         <title>Novel Aspects about &#8220;Lifetime&#8221; in Upconversion Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept briefly reviews recent advances in temporal response (TR) and lifetime of upconversion luminescence, including lifetime control methods, relation of excitation and de&#8208;excitation, the impact of TR on luminescence spectra, and proposes future challengesthat need to be addressed, in order to raise more attention to the development of this field and relevant applications using TR characteristics.







Abstract
Recent progress on the temporal response (TR) of lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion luminescence (UCL) has enriched the means of UCL regulation, promoted advanced designs for customized applications such as biological diagnosis, high&#8208;capacity optical coding, and dynamic optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and pushed us to reacquaint the dynamic responses of sensitizer/activator ions in UCL systems. In particular, the lifetime of UCL should be revisited after discovery of novel experimental phenomena and luminescence mechanisms, i.&#8201;e., it should be understood as the collective TR (in the decay edge) of all the involved ions rather than the reciprocal of the radiative rate of an individual ion. In this Concept, we retraced the latest understanding of the dynamics in UCL with special attention to the relationship between excitation and emission, means of TR regulation, and discussed existing challenges. It is expected to provide some fundamental insights to deepened understanding, further regulation, and frontier applications of TR features of UCL.

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed [2+3]&#8208;Cyclative o,m&#8208;diC&#8208;H Functionalization of Phenols</title>

A B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed highly chemoselective [2+3]&#8208;cyclative diC&#8722;H functionalization of phenols tethered with propargylic ether motifs was developed for the synthesis of polycyclic compounds. Derivatizations of the phenol&#8208;OH group demonstrated the good variability of the cyclization products, indicating the potential application of this methodology in the preparation of other types of polycyclic compounds.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free catalytic C&#8722;H functionalization is highly desired for the construction of C&#8722;C bonds. We herein report a highly chemoselective consecutive C&#8722;H [2+3]&#8208;cyclative functionalization for the simultaneous formation of two C&#8722;C bonds with construction of polycyclic phenols catalyzed by commercially available and low&#8208;cost B(C6F5)3. This catalytic system tolerates a wide range of substrate scope, providing a series of 2,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroacenaphthylen&#8208;3&#8208;ol&#8208;type polycyclic compounds efficiently. Several derivatizations of the catalytic products have also been conducted to show the potential application of this method in synthesis of polycyclic compounds.

         <title>Nanocomposite Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanostructures (CNS) morphology and functionalization effects are studied to attain nanocomposite and supramolecular hydrogels with a self&#8208;assembling tripeptide. The latter is covalently anchored onto carbon nanotubes and carbon nanohorns, and the resulting nanocomposite soft matter is characterized at the nanoscale and macroscale to rationalize the self&#8208;healing ability of the hydrogel, and the CNS influence on peptide fibrillation in aqueous buffer.







Abstract
Carbon nanostructures (CNSs) are attractive components to attain nanocomposites, yet their hydrophobic nature and strong tendency to aggregate often limit their use in aqueous conditions and negatively impact their properties. In this work, carbon nanohorns (CNHs), multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene (G) are first oxidized, and then reacted to covalently anchor the self&#8208;assembling tripeptide L&#8208;Leu&#8208;D&#8208;Phe&#8208;D&#8208;Phe to improve their dispersibility in phosphate buffer, and favor the formation of hydrogels formed by the self&#8208;organizing L&#8208;Leu&#8208;D&#8208;Phe&#8208;D&#8208;Phe present in solution. The obtained nanocomposites are then characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), oscillatory rheology, and conductivity measurements to gain useful insights as to the key factors that determine self&#8208;healing ability for the future design of this type of nanocomposites.

         <title>Controlling the Formation of Electroactive Graphene&#8208;Based Cementitious Composites: Towards Structural Health Monitoring of Civil Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional rGO&#8208;based cement composite featuring remarkably enhanced electrical properties was developed. Simple and efficient method for obtaining homogeneous and stable rGO dispersion in cement composites was established. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was applied to investigate the conduction mechanisms within rGO&#8208;based cement mortar and new electrical equivalent circuit was proposed.







Abstract
The development of composites combining multiple components each one imparting a specific function to the ensemble is highly sought after for disruptive applications in chemistry and materials science, with a particular importance for the realization of smart structures. Here, we report on the development of an unprecedented multifunctional cementitious composite incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO). By design, this material features significantly enhanced electrical properties while retaining the excellent cement's hydration and microstructure. The multiscale investigation on the chemical and physical properties of the dispersion made it possible to establish an efficient preparation protocol for rGO aqueous dispersion as well as rGO&#8208;based cementitious composites using a commercial poly(carboxylate ether)&#8208;based superplasticizer. The conduction mechanisms within the matrix of rGO containing mortars were unraveled by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealing conductive paths originating from bulk cement matrix and rGO nanosheets in composites with rGO loadings as low as 0.075&#8197;wt.&#8201;%. For this rGO loading, we observed the reduction of the resistivity of bulk cement mortar layers from 18.3&#8197;M&#937;&#8201;cm to 2.8&#8197;M&#937;&#8201;cm. Moreover, the addition of 0.2&#8197;wt.&#8201;% of rGO resulted in the formation of rGO conductive paths with the resistivity of 51.1&#8197;k&#937;&#8201;cm. These findings represent a major step forward towards the practical application of graphene&#8208;based materials in structural health monitoring of concrete structures.

         <title>Tuneable Plasmonic Resonances Of A Dynamic Thin Film Of Ultrasmall Nanocrystals Modified In the Anti&#8208;Galvanic Reduction Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented plasmonic enhancement in ultra&#8208;small gold nanoparticles modified with Anti&#8208;Galvanic Reduction gives access to new type pseudo liquid&#8208;crystalline nanoparticles. Thermoswitchable structure and induced plasmonic properties provide a general and straightforward access to a variety of a new type of plasmonic materials based on small gold nanoparticles.







Abstract
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (NPs) have revolutionized nanotechnology as they are an excellent starting substrate for the synthesis of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with photonic or energy conversion applications, often with a responsive nature. However, ultrasmall NPs do not sustain plasmonic resonances, preventing their use in plasmon&#8208;related applications. In the presented work, we show a method of chemical modification of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles in order to fabricate dynamically controlled plasmonic thin films. For this purpose, we used the Anti&#8208;Galvanic Reduction process (AGR) to modify the surface of small gold nanoparticles, inducing plasmonic properties without notable size increases. Au@Ag NPs are then modified with liquid crystal&#8208;like organic ligands. The obtained NPs can assemble into densely packed films with long&#8208;range order and temperature&#8208;dependent structural properties. Namely, we detect two, fully reversible phase transitions between the hexagonal and cubic symmetries. The combination of AGR and organic surface modifications enabled us to demonstrate the possibility of managing plasmonic properties in the thin film of ~2&#8197;nm diameter metallic NPs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An unprecedented plasmonic enhancement&lt;/b&gt; in ultra-small gold nanoparticles modified with Anti-Galvanic Reduction gives access to new type pseudo liquid-crystalline nanoparticles. Thermoswitchable structure and induced plasmonic properties provide a general and straightforward access to a variety of a new type of plasmonic materials based on small gold nanoparticles.

We describe a facile protocol for constructing all carbon quaternary, tertiary carbon&#8208;centered spiro[4.4]nonanes and spiro[4.5]decanes by treating cheap dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate with 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;ketoalkyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandiones and 2&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;ketoalkyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandiones, respectively. Additionally, spiro[4.4]nonane products were further transformed into highly conjugated pentafulvene&#8208;based dyes simply by treating them with TFA or H2SO4. The reported method provides an excellent yield and ample tunability around the fulvene skeleton under metal&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Synthesis of highly functionalized spiro[4.4]nonane and spiro[4.5]decane motifs by the reaction of dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) with 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;ketoalkyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandiones and 2&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;ketoalkyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;indandiones, respectively, has been developed by utilizing a catalytic amount of DABCO. The tertiary hydroxy&#8208;containing spiro[4.4]nonane products were converted into fully conjugated pentafulvene &#960;&#8208;systems in an acidic medium through dehydration and unprecedented C&#8722;C bond rearrangement.

         <title>Synthesis of 10&#8208;Membered Azecines through Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [6+4] Cycloaddition and Their Transannular Reaction to Polycyclic Compounds</title>

         <dc:description>
Catalytic formal [6+4] cycloaddition was developed for the synthesis of 10&#8208;membered azecines. Under palladium catalysis, the reaction of &#948;&#8208;vinylvalerolactones and benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes proceeds smoothly to afford benzofuran&#8208;fused azecines with high diastereoselectivity in moderate to good yields. The unique transformations involving the transannular reaction of these compounds was also demonstrated.







Abstract
Azecine fragments are frequently presented in natural products and bioactive compounds. However, minor efforts have been devoted to these 10&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles, and their synthesis is still challenging. Reported herein is the first catalytic formal [6+4] cycloaddition for the synthesis of 10&#8208;membered azecines. Under palladium catalysis, the reaction of &#948;&#8208;vinylvalerolactones and benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes proceeds smoothly to afford benzofuran&#8208;fused azecines with high diastereoselectivity in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Encapsulation in Charged Droplets Generates Distorted Host&#8208;Guest Complexes

&#8220;Spring&#8208;loaded&#8221; resorcinarene capsules form in charged droplets. The complexes are not observed in solution and form during electrospray ionisation under conditions violating electroneutrality. The strained resorcinarene and dicationic guest complexes survive due to strengthening of non&#8208;covalent bonds in the gas&#8208;phase enabling structural assignment via different tandem mass spectrometry techniques.







Abstract
The ability of various hydrogen&#8208;bonded resorcinarene&#8208;based capsules to bind &#945;,&#969;&#8208;alkylbisDABCOnium (DnD) guests of different lengths was investigated in solution and in the gas&#8208;phase. While no host&#8208;guest interactions were detected in solution, encapsulation could be achieved in the charged droplets formed during electrospray ionisation (ESI). This included guests, which are far too long in their most stable conformation to fit inside the cavity of the capsules. A combination of three mass spectrometric techniques, namely, collision&#8208;induced dissociation, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, and ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry, together with computational modelling allow us to determine the binding mode of the DnD guests inside the cavity of the capsules. Significant distortions of the guest into horseshoe&#8208;like arrangements are required to optimise cation&#8208;&#960; interactions with the host, which also adopt distorted geometries with partially open hydrogen&#8208;bonding seams when binding longer guests. Such quasi &#8220;spring&#8208;loaded&#8221; capsules can form in the charged droplets during the ESI process as there is no competition between guest encapsulation and ion pair formation with the counterions that preclude encapsulation in solution. The encapsulation complexes are sufficiently stable in the gas&#8208;phase &#8211; even when strained &#8211; because non&#8208;covalent interactions significantly strengthen in the absence of solvent.

         <title>The Origin of Delayed Polymorphism in Molecular Crystals Under Mechanochemical Conditions</title>

The extended induction period associated with mechanochemical polymorphism arises from the phenomenon of mechanical activation, which preceeds the transformation.







Abstract
We show that mechanochemically driven polymorphic transformations can require extremely long induction periods, which can be tuned from hours to days by changing ball milling energy. The robust design and interpretation of ball milling experiments must account for this unexpected kinetics that arises from energetic phenomena unique to the solid state. Detailed thermal analysis, combined with DFT simulations, indicates that these marked induction periods are associated with processes of mechanical activation. Correspondingly, we show that the pre&#8208;activation of reagents can also lead to marked changes in the length of induction periods. Our findings demonstrate a new dimension for exerting control over polymorphic transformations in organic crystals. We expect mechanical activation to have a much broader implication across organic solid&#8208;state mechanochemistry.

         <title>Boosting the Cell Performance of the SiO/Cu and SiO/PPy Anodes via In&#8208;Situ Reduction/Oxidation Coating Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SiO/Cu and SiO/PPy composites are prepared by in&#8208;situ reduction/oxidation of Cu2+ and Py on the discharged/charged SiO surface, respectively. Cu and ppy coating layer enhance the conductivity of composite and mitigate volume expansion, which significantly improves the electrochemical performance of the SiO anode.







Abstract
Silicon monoxide (SiO) has attracted great attention due to its high theoretical specific capacity as an alternative material for conventional graphite anode, but its poor electrical conductivity and irreversible side reactions at the SiO/electrolyte interface seriously reduce its cycling stability. Here, to overcome the drawbacks, the dicharged SiO anode coated with Cu coating layer is elaborately designed by in&#8208;situ reduction method. Compared with the pristine SiO anode of lithium&#8208;ion battery (293&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles), the obtained SiO/Cu composite presents superior cycling stability (1206&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles). The tight combination of Cu particles and SiO significantly improves the conductivity of the composite, effectively inhibits the side&#8208;reaction between the active material and electrolyte. In addition, polypyrrole&#8208;coated SiO composites are further prepared by in&#8208;situ oxidation method, which delivers a high reversible specific capacity of 1311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles. The in&#8208;situ coating strategies in this work provide a new pathway for the development and practical application of high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode.

         <title>Mechanistic Study on Selenium&#8208; and Sulfur&#8208;Mediated Isomerization of Hydroxamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of para&#8208;aminophenols, such as paracetamol, holds high interest in pharmaceutical applications. In this study, the mechanistic transformations involved in the selenium&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;mediated formation of these compounds from hydroxamic acid were investigated computationally. Calculations with density functional theory (DFT) methods and experimental studies reveal the formation of ortho&#8208;sulfoxide as a product of the sulfur&#8208;mediated reaction.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth computational study reveals the intriguing mechanism of the recently reported isomerization of hydroxamic acids into para&#8208;aminophenols catalyzed by phenylselenyl bromide under mild conditions. The computations not only align with the reported experimental data, effectively explaining observed phenomena such as para&#8208;selectivity but also shed light on crucial aspects of the reaction mechanism that establish limitations on the scope of the studied rearrangement. Additionally, a joint theoretical/experimental study was performed to examine the potency of the phenylsulfenyl bromide to mediate the reaction under the same conditions.

         <title>Ruthenium and Iron Co&#8208;doped Molybdenum Carbide as a Stable Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalyst in Harsh Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru and Fe co&#8208;doped Mo2C electrocatalyst (Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC) was synthesized via a controllable two&#8208;step method for efficient and persistent hydrogen evolution reaction in harsh electrolyte. The synergistic effect between Ru, Fe dopants and Mo2C resulted in a remarkably enhanced hydrogen evolution performance of the electrocatalyst in both acidic and alkaline electrolyte.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting is one of the most commercially valuable pathways of hydrogen production especially combined with renewable electricity; however, efficient and durable electrocatalysts are urgently needed to reduce electric energy consumption. Here, we reported a Ru and Fe co&#8208;doped Mo2C on nitrogen doped carbon via a controllable two&#8208;step method, which can be used for efficient and enduring hydrogen evolution reaction. At 10, 100 and 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic electrolyte, the resultant Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC delivered low overpotentials of 31, 78 and 103&#8197;mV, respectively, which are comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C (20&#8197;wt&#8201;%). At an applied current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, stable hydrogen production was conducted for 120&#8197;h without obvious degradation. In alkaline media, Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC can also deliver a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for more than 100&#8197;h. Furthermore, the Ru&#8208;Fe/Mo2C@NC electrocatalyst was used as cathode in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer under industrial environments for robust hydrogen production. The characterization and electrochemical results prove the synergism effects between Ru, Fe dopants and Mo2C for promoting hydrogen evolution activity. This work would pave a new avenue to fabricate low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts for industrial water electrolyzers.

         <title>Hexanuclear Ln6L6 Complex Formation by Using an Unsymmetric Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reduced symmetry ligand directs formation of hexanuclear lanthanide complex: Lanthanide ionic radius and counterions play a role in self&#8208;assembly of a hexagonal Ln6L6 complex. Structural assignment was achieved by NMR, mass spectrometry and homo&#8208;RIDME EPR experiments that identified three unique Gd&#8943;Gd distances. The Eu6L6 complex shows distinct photophysical features from the Eu2L3 complex generated with a related symmetric ligand.







Abstract
Multinuclear, self&#8208;assembled lanthanide complexes present clear opportunities as sensors and imaging agents. Despite the widely acknowledged potential of this class of supramolecule, synthetic and characterization challenges continue to limit systematic studies into their self&#8208;assembly restricting the number and variety of lanthanide architectures reported relative to their transition metal counterparts. Here we present the first study evaluating the effect of ligand backbone symmetry on multinuclear lanthanide complex self&#8208;assembly. Replacement of a symmetric ethylene linker with an unsymmetric amide at the center of a homoditopic ligand governs formation of an unusual Ln6L6 complex with coordinatively unsaturated metal centers. The choice of triflate as a counterion, and the effect of ionic radii are shown to be critical for formation of the Ln6L6 complex. The atypical Ln6L6 architecture is characterized using a combination of mass spectrometry, luminescence, DOSY NMR and EPR spectroscopy measurements. Luminescence experiments support clear differences between comparable Eu6L6 and Eu2L3 complexes, with relatively short luminescent lifetimes and low quantum yields observed for the Eu6L6 structure indicative of non&#8208;radiative decay processes. Synthesis of the Gd6L6 analogue allows three distinct Gd&#8943;Gd distance measurements to be extracted using homo&#8208;RIDME EPR experiments.

The alkali&#8208;metal cation affinities of a series of stabilized enolate anions were determined by a combination of gas&#8208;phase experiments and quantum chemical calculations. Both methods afford values in excellent agreement and show how the derived affinities result from the subtle interplay of electronic and conformational effects.







Abstract
The chemistry of alkali&#8208;metal enolates is dominated by ion pairing. To improve our understanding of the intrinsic interactions between the alkali&#8208;metal cations and the enolate anions, we have applied Cooks&#8217; kinetic method to determine relative M+ (M=Li, Na, K) affinities of the stabilized enolates derived from acetylacetone, ethyl acetoacetate, diethyl malonate, ethyl cyanoacetate, 2&#8208;cyanoacetamide, and methyl malonate monoamide in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations support the experimental results and moreover afford insight into the structures of the alkali&#8208;metal enolate complexes. The affinities decrease with increasing size of the alkali&#8208;metal cations, reflecting weaker electrostatic interactions and lower charge densities of the free M+ ions. For the different enolates, a comparison of their coordinating abilities is complicated by the fact that some of the free anions undergo conformational changes resulting in stabilizing intramolecular interactions. If these complicating effects are disregarded, the M+ affinities correlate with the electron density of the chelating functionalities, that is, the carbonyl and/or the nitrile groups of the enolates. A comparison with the known association constants of the corresponding alkali&#8208;metal enolates in solution points to the importance of solvation effects for these systems.

         <title>Dyads and Triads of Boron Difluoride Formazanate and Boron Difluoride Dipyrromethene Dyes</title>

The first examples of BF2 formazanate and BODIPY conjugates: Dyads and triads of BF2 formazanate and BODIPY dyes undergo reversible reduction to polyanions and exhibit anti&#8208;Kasha photoluminescence. These properties arise from the interplay of the discrete properties of each dye and highlight the promise of dye&#8208;dye conjugates based on BF2 formazanates.







Abstract
Dye&#8208;dye conjugates have attracted significant interest for their utility in applications such as bioimaging, theranostics, and light&#8208;harvesting. Many classes of organic dyes have been employed in this regard; however, building blocks don't typically extend beyond small chromophores. This can lead to minor changes to the optoelectronic properties of the original dye. The exploration of dye&#8211;dye structures is impeded by long synthetic routes, incompatible synthetic conditions, or a mismatch of the desired properties. Here, we present the first&#8208;of&#8208;their&#8208;kind dye&#8208;dye conjugates of boron difluoride complexes of formazanate and dipyrromethene ligands. These conjugates exhibit dual photoluminescence bands that reach the near&#8208;infrared spectral region and implicate anti&#8208;Kasha processes. Cyclic voltammetry experiments revealed the generation of polyanionic species that can reversibly tolerate the uptake of up to 6 electrons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that BF2 formazanates can serve as a synthetically accessible platform to build upon new classes of dye&#8208;dye conjugates.

         <title>Dual Strategies with Anion/Cation Co&#8208;Doping and Lithium Carbonate Coating to Enhance the Electrochemical Performance of Lithium&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>

The lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) were successfully prepared based on a dual modification strategy, by co doped with anions and cations and coated with lithium carbonate coating. It founds that modified LLOs possess excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) are widely used as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high specific capacity, high operating voltage and low cost. However, the LLOs are faced with rapid decay of charge/discharge capacity and voltage, as well as interface side reactions, which limit its electrochemical performance. Herein, the dual strategies of sulfite/sodium ion co&#8208;doping and lithium carbonate coating were used to improve it. It founds that modified LLOs achieve 88.74&#8201;% initial coulomb efficiency, 295.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 first turn discharge capacity, in addition to 216.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C, and 87.23&#8201;% capacity retention after 100&#8197;cycles. Mechanism research indicated that the excellent electrochemical performance benefits from the doping of both Na+ and SO32&#8722;, and it could significantly reduce the migration energy barrier of Li+ and promote Li+ migration. Meanwhile, anion and cation are co&#8208;doped greatly reduces the band gap of LLOs and increase its electrical conductivity, and its binding effect on Li+ is weakened, making it easier for Li+ to shuttle through the material. In addition, the lithium carbonate coating significantly inhibits the occurrence of interfacial side reactions of LLOs. This work provides a theoretical basis and practical guidance for the further development of LLOs with higher electrochemical performance.

Nickel&#8208;electrocatalyzed homocoupling is applied to the preparation of bifuran&#8208;based monomers from methyl bromo&#8208;furancarboxylates that can be prepared from hemicellulose&#8208;based furfural. The protocol is run with graphite electrodes in an undivided cell, and the products are isolated by precipitation.







Abstract
Bifuran motifs can be accessed with nickel&#8208;bipyridine electrocatalyzed homocouplings of bromine&#8208;substituted methyl furancarboxylates, which, in turn, can be prepared from hemicellulose&#8208;derived furfural. The described protocol uses sustainable carbon&#8208;based graphite electrodes in the simplest setup &#8211; an undivided cell with constant current electrolysis. The reported method avoids using a sacrificial anode by employing triethanolamine as an electron donor.

         <title>An In Situ Fabricated Hydrogel Polymer &#8211; Palladium Nanocomposite Electrocatalyst for the HER: Critical Role of the Polymer in Realizing High Efficiency and Stability</title>

Nanoelectrocatalyst in hydrogel: A novel and unique role of the hydrogel polymer matrix of an in&#8197;situ fabricated nanocomposite thin film (palladium&#8208;poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl methacrylate)) based catalytic electrode, in promoting hydrogen evolution in the water splitting reaction is demonstrated.







Abstract
Development of general and simple designs of catalytic electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical. The present work demonstrates the multiple roles played by a hydrogel polymer in the fabrication and activity enhancement of the nanoelectrocatalyst. A nanocomposite thin film of Pd with the insulating hydrogel, poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), is fabricated through a facile in&#8197;situ process, the polymer itself functioning as the reducing/stabilizing agent in the formation of Pd nanoparticles. Pd&#8208;PHEMA on Ni foam enables efficient HER in alkaline medium with a low overpotential; the polymer enables the electrocatalysis by its swelling and confinement of the electrolyte. Most significantly, when the electrode is subjected to an optimized cycling protocol, the overpotential decreases steadily, reaching an impressively low value of 36&#8197;mV (@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). A low Tafel slope (68&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), high exchange current density, Faradaic efficiency and TOF (3.27&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 99&#8201;%, 122.7&#8197;h&#8722;1), and extended stability are achieved. Detailed investigations reveal the active role of the polymer in the evolution of the nanocatalyst, itself undergoing favorable morphological changes. The study illustrates the widened scope for developing efficient and stable catalytic electrodes with hydrogel polymers and unique features that promote the generation of green hydrogen.

Most significantly, when the electrode is subjected to an optimized cycling protocol, the overpotential decreases steadily, reaching an impressively low value of 36&#8197;mV (@10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). A low Tafel slope (68&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high exchange current density, Faradaic efficiency and TOF (3.27&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 99&#8201;%, 122.7&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and extended stability are achieved. Detailed investigations reveal the active role of the polymer in the evolution of the nanocatalyst, itself undergoing favorable morphological changes. The study illustrates the widened scope for developing efficient and stable catalytic electrodes with hydrogel polymers and unique features that promote the generation of green hydrogen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Intermediates in the Bypass Mechanism of Glutathione Peroxidase: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Structures of Selenocysteine&#8208;Derived Cyclic Selenenyl Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structures and reactivities of selenocysteine&#8208;derived cyclic selenenyl amides have been elucidated. The results obtained here suggest that they can serve not only as protective forms to suppress the degradation of the active center in glutathione peroxidase but also as highly electrophilic intermediates in the several reactions of selenoproteins.







Abstract
Selenocysteine (Sec)&#8208;derived cyclic selenenyl amides, formed by the intramolecular cyclization of Sec selenenic acids (Sec&#8211;SeOHs), have been postulated to function as protective forms in the bypass mechanism of glutathione peroxidase (GPx). However, their chemical properties have not been experimentally elucidated in proteins or small&#8208;molecule systems. Recently, we reported the first nuclear magnetic resonance observation of Sec&#8211;SeOHs and their cyclization to the corresponding cyclic selenenyl amides by using selenopeptide model systems incorporated in a molecular cradle. Herein, we elucidate the structures and reactivities of Sec&#8208;derived cyclic selenenyl amides. The crystal structures and reactions toward a cysteine thiol or a 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;type chemical probe indicated the highly electrophilic character of cyclic selenenyl amides. This suggests that they can serve not only as protective forms to suppress the inactivation of Sec&#8211;SeOHs in GPx but also as highly electrophilic intermediates in the reactions of selenoproteins.

         <title>Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Based on the Efficient Interaction between Pb2+ and Cyano Groups of 4&#8208;Aminophthalonitrile</title>

By using 4&#8208;APN to manage surface defects in perovskite film, highly stable perovskite solar cells have been achieved.







Abstract
Defects present on the top surface of perovskite films have a pronounced detrimental impact on the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Consequently, the development of effective defect passivation strategies has become key in enhancing both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of PSCs. In this study, a small molecule material, 4&#8208;Aminophthalonitrile (4&#8208;APN), was introduced as a means to mitigate surface defects within perovskite films. Obviously, 4&#8208;APN effectively passivates the defects at grain boundaries by combining cyano groups (&#8722;C&#8801;N) with Pb2+, significantly reducing the density of defect states, inhibiting non&#8208;radiative recombination at the interface, and promoting the charge transfer efficiency from the perovskite layer to the hole transport layer. The 4&#8208;APN modification led to a significant upswing in the PCE, while concurrently bolstering the overall device stability. Importantly, the devices on 4&#8208;APN as passivation additive exhibited negligible performance degradation aging for 1200&#8197;h.

         <title>Fabrication of High Surface Area Fe/Fe3O4 with Enhanced Performance for Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>

Novel specific surface area and interconnected pores Fe/Fe3O4/PC composite is fabricated by a simple template method. The as&#8208;synthesized material possessing high electrochemically active surface area promote the occurrence of catalytic kinetics, therefore affording super electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction performance.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficient and large&#8208;scale non&#8208;precious electrocatalysts to improve sluggish reaction kinetics plays a key role in enhancing electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) for ammonia production under mild condition. Herein, Fe3O4 and Fe supported by porous carbon (denoted as Fe/Fe3O4/PC&#8208;800) composite with a high specific surface area of 1004.1&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 was prepared via a simple template method. On one hand, the high surface area of Fe/Fe3O4/PC&#8208;800 provides a large area to enhance N2 adsorption and promote more protons and electrons to accelerate the reaction, thereby greatly improving the dynamics. On the other hand, mesoporous Fe/Fe3O4/PC&#8208;800 provides high electrochemically active surface area for promoting the occurrence of catalytic kinetics. As a result, Fe/Fe3O4/PC&#8208;800 exhibited significantly enhanced NRR performance with an ammonia yield of 31.15&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and faraday efficiency of 22.26&#8201;% at &#8722;0.1&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). This study is expected to provide a new strategy for the synthesis of catalysts with large specific area and pave the way for the foundational research in NRR.

Lesser, better, faster: Optimization of a radiolabeling method by complexation of aluminum&#8208;[18F]fluoride {Al18F} species using a Design of Experiments (DoE) approach is presented. This study demonstrates the potential of this strategy in radiochemistry for optimization of a radiochemical process.







Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;18 (18F) is the most favorable positron emitter for radiolabeling Positron Emission Tomography (PET) probes. However, conventional 18F labeling through covalent C&#8722;F bond formation is challenging, involving multiple steps and stringent conditions unsuitable for sensitive biomolecular probes whose integrity may be altered. Over the past decade, an elegant new approach has been developed involving the coordination of an aluminum fluoride {Al18F} species in aqueous media at a late&#8208;stage of the synthetic process. The objective of this study was to implement this method and to optimize radiolabeling efficiency using a Design of Experiments (DoE). To assess the impact of various experimental parameters on {Al18F} incorporation, a pentadentate chelating agent NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was prepared as a model compound. This model carried a thiourea function present in the final conjugates resulting from the grafting of the chelating agent onto the probe. The formation of the radioactive complex Al18F&#8208;NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was studied to achieve the highest radiochemical conversion. A complementary &#8220;cold&#8221; series study using the natural isotope 19F was also conducted to guide the radiochemical operating conditions. Ultimately, Al18F&#8208;NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was obtained with a reproducible and satisfactory radiochemical conversion of 79&#177;3.5&#8201;% (n=5).

         <title>Chalcogen Bond Catalysis with Telluronium Cations for Bromination Reaction: Importance of Electrostatic and Polarization Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of bromination reaction based on chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis was discussed and the importance of the electrostatic and polarization effects in the ChB is elucidated by high&#8208;level computational results. Moreover, the structure&#8208;property relationship between the strength of ChB bond, electrostatic effect, polarization effect and catalytic performance are established for the design of more efficient ChB catalysts.







Abstract
Recently, chalcogen bond catalysts with telluronium cations have garnered considerable attention in organic reactions. In this work, chalcogen bond catalysis on the bromination reaction of anisole with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) with the telluronium cationic catalysts has been explored with density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic reaction is divided into two stages: the bromine transfer step and the proton transfer step. Based on the computational results, one can find the rate&#8208;determining step is the bromine transfer step. Moreover, the present study elucidates that a stronger chalcogen bond between catalysts and NBS will give better catalytic performance. Additionally, this work also clarified the importance of the electrostatic and polarization effects in the chalcogen bond between the oxygen atom of NBS and the Te atom of the catalyst in this bromination reaction. The electrostatic and polarization effects are significantly influenced by the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the substitution groups on the catalysts. Moreover, the structure&#8208;property relationship between the strength of chalcogen bond, electrostatic effect, polarization effect and catalytic performance are established for the design of more efficient chalcogen bond catalysts.

         <title>Diversification of the Carbodicarbene Class by Embedding an Anionic Component in its Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>

We report the synthesis of anionic CDC pincer Pd complexes containing BF2 moiety, which exhibits facile second coordination toward Au(I), Ag(I) and Pd(II) without any external ligand assistance. Such phenomenon of gem&#8208;bimetallic supported by anionic pincer CDC is unprecedented, as pincer neutral CDC complexes are failed to exhibit two&#8208;fold donor capacity.







Abstract
Carbodicarbene (CDC) has become an emerging ligand in many fields due to its strong &#963;&#8208;donating ability. &lt;We report the first synthesis of the anionic CDC Pd complexes containing a BF2&#8208; moiety within the framework to leverage the electronic feature of carbon carbone. The elucidation of X&#8208;ray crystal structures, ligand competition as well as transmetallation experiments suggest that the anionic moiety has enhanced the overall donor strength of the traditional neutral CDC. Importantly, this anionic scaffold exhibits a facile second coordination toward Au(I), Ag(I) and Pd(II) without any external ligand assistance, whereas previously reported neutral pincer CDC complexes do not possess a two&#8208;fold donor capacity. The analysis of the bonding situation via theoretical methods shows that the description of the anionic CDC moieties in terms of dative bonding is preferred over the model of delocalized positive charge, as it accounts for the two&#8208;fold donor ability of the divalent carbon atom, preserving a characteristic feature of a carbone.

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregate&#8208;Triggering BODIPYs: an Ultrasensitive Chromogenic and Fluorogenic Sensing Platform for Perfluorooctanesulfonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are chemicals that bioaccumulate and resist degradation, posing serious threats to health and the environment. Current analytical methods are ill&#8208;suited for the rapid visual detection of point sources of contamination in the field. Here, a simple, rapid, and highly sensitive chromogenic and fluorogenic &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor is reported that can detect and remove PFASs from contaminated water with high efficiency.







Abstract
Contamination of water supplies by polyfluoroalkyl substances, notably perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has serious health and environmental consequences. Therefore, the development of straightforward and effective means of monitoring and removing PFASs is urgently required. In this study, we report a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of PFOS and PFOA in water that rely on the J&#8208;aggregate formation of meso&#8208;ester&#8208;BODIPY dyes. The dye C10&#8208;mim, which contains a hydrophilic methylimidazolium group and a hydrophobic alkylated BODIPY, self&#8208;assembles in water into weakly green&#8208;emissive micellar assemblies. Upon binding to PFOS or PFOA, a spontaneous disassembly and reorganization forms orange&#8208;emissive J&#8208;aggregates. The rapid formation (&#8804;5&#8197;s) of J&#8208;aggregates and the accompanying spectral shifts provide a superior sensing performance, with excellent sensitivity (limit of detection=0.18&#8197;ppb for PFOS) and distinct chromogenic and fluorogenic &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; responses.

The potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] reductively couples 9&#8208;diazo&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (fluN2) to generate a highly coloured species containing the [fluNNNNflu]2&#8722; ligand. Thermal elimination of N2 and loss of doubly reduced 1,2&#8208;di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)diazene [fluN=Nflu]2&#8722; as the potassium salt generates a neutral aluminium ketimide, which undergoes cycloaddition and hydrogen transfer to form the corresponding guanidinate complex.







Abstract
The reaction of 9&#8208;diazo&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (fluN2) with the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8722;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) affords K[Al(NON)(&#954;N1,N3&#8208;{(fluN2)2})] (1). Structural analysis shows a near planar 1,4&#8208;di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ylidene)tetraazadiide ligand that chelates to the aluminium. The thermally induced elimination of dinitrogen from 1 affords the neutral aluminium ketimide complex, Al(NON)(N=flu)(THF) (2) and the 1,2&#8208;di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)diazene dianion as the potassium salt, [K2(THF)3][fluN=Nflu] (3). The reaction of 2 with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diisopropylcarbodiimide (iPrN=C=NiPr) affords the aluminium guanidinate complex, Al(NON){N(iPr)C(N=CMe2)N(CHflu)} (4), showing a rare example of reactivity at a metal ketimide ligand. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to examine the bonding in the newly formed [(fluN2)2]2&#8722; ligand in 1 and the ketimide bonding in 2. The mechanism leading to the formation of 4 has also been studied using this technique.

         <title>Nitrogen Heterocycle Synthesis through Hydride Abstraction of Acyclic Carbamates and Related Species: Scope, Mechanism, Stereoselectivity, and Product Conformation Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyliminium ions and related species can be formed through hydride abstraction reactions that obviate the need for leaving group installation and avoid issues of unfavorable equilibria. This allows for the study of several previously unappreciated reactivity properties of these species in the context of cyclization reactions, including intermediate geometry, transition state conformation, stereoselectivity and product geometry.







Abstract
Acyliminium ions and related species are potent electrophiles that can be quite valuable in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. This manuscript describes a protocol to form these intermediates through hydride abstractions of easily accessible allylic carbamates, amides, and sulfonamides that avoids the reversibility that is possible in classical condensation&#8208;based routes. These intermediates are used in the preparation of a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and in many cases high levels of stereocontrol are observed. Specifically areas of investigation include the impact of chemical structure on oxidation efficiency, the geometry of the intermediate iminium ions, the impact of a substrate stereocenter on stereocontrol, and an examination of transition state geometry.

         <title>Mechanistic Avenues in the Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;Based Etherification Reaction: A Computational Exploration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have carried out extensive computational investigations to explore the mechanistic avenues in CuII(OAC)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;based etherification reaction. Transmetalation from the methoxide&#8208;bridged CuII intermediate is rate determining. Hammett studies indicate higher catalytic turnovers for electron&#8208;rich boronic ester substituents.







Abstract
Ongoing advances in CuII&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative coupling reactions between arylboronic esters and diverse heteroatom nucleophiles have strengthened the development of the general Chan&#8208;Lam (CL)&#8208;based reaction protocol, including C&#8722;O bond formation methodologies. In&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of CL etherification with specific emphasis on different reaction routes and their energetics are still lacking, even though the reaction has been experimentally explored. Here, we present a DFT&#8208;guided computational study to unravel the mechanistic pathways of CL&#8208;based etherification. The computational findings provide some interesting insights into the fundamental steps of the catalytic cycle, particularly the rate&#8208;determining transmetalation event. An aryl boronic ester&#8208;coordinated, methoxide&#8208;bridged CuII intermediate that acts as resting state undergoes transmetalation with an activation barrier of 20.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The energy spans of the remaining fundamental steps leading to the methoxylated product are relatively low. The minor p&#8208;cresol product requires an additional 14.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 energy span to surmount in comparison to the favored route. Hammett studies for the substituted aryl boronic esters reveal higher reaction turnovers for electron&#8208;rich aryl systems. The results agree with previously reported spectroscopic and kinetic observations. For a series of alcohol substrates, it was observed that, except for cyclohexanol, moderate to high etherification turnovers are predicted.

         <title>Construction and Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of a Supramolecular Metal&#8211;Carbene Complex with Multifunctional Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 71, December 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional metal&#8211;carbene assembly comprising three crown ether and three ferrocene units close to each other was developed. The introduction of ammonium salts caused crown ether blocks to move far away from the electrochemical center, regulating the redox properties. Using bisammonium salts as cross&#8208;linked agents and metal&#8722;carbene complexes as cores can form a stimulus&#8208;responsive and self&#8208;healing supramolecular gel.







Abstract
Hierarchical combinations involving metal&#8211;ligand interactions and host&#8722;guest interactions can consolidate building blocks with unique functions into material properties. This study reports the construction and hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex containing three crown ether units and three ferrocene units. Host&#8722;guest interactions between the multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex and organic ammonium salts were investigated, revealing that crown ether&#8208;based host&#8722;guest interactions can effectively regulate the electrochemical properties of the complex. Utilizing bisammonium salt as the cross&#8208;linker and multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex as the core, a stimuli&#8208;responsive and self&#8208;healing supramolecular gel with different functional units was obtained.

A novel fluorescent supramolecular polymer without conventional chromophores have been reported.







Abstract
Fluorescent supramolecular polymers have garnered significant attention due to their successful integration of supramolecular polymers and fluorescence, offering vast potential for applications in sensing, imaging, optoelectronics, and photonics. In this study, we present a novel supramolecular polymer based on P5&#8208;OH, derived from mono&#8208;substituted pillararene macrocycles. Notably, these formed supramolecular polymeric aggregates exhibit a prominent blue emission, representing a rare instance of fluorescent polymers devoid of conventional chromophores. Furthermore, through the modification of alkyl chain ending groups attached to pillar[5]arenes, slight shifts in the emission peak could be observed. This research expands the scope of functional supramolecular polymeric systems utilizing pillararenes, providing valuable insights for the design of innovative luminescent materials and optical devices.

The cover picture shows key players in the catalytic cycle of the mammalian antioxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Selenocysteine selenenic acids (queen) and selenocysteine selenenyl sulfides (rook) are established contributors to GPx function. This study unveils a previously overlooked class of intermediates: selenocysteine cyclic selenenyl amides (king). Through model studies, their reactivity has been revealed, exhibiting dual functionality. They not only prevent the inactivation of GPx but also act as highly electrophilic intermediates in selenoprotein reactions. Their roles mirror a chess king, dynamically adapting to their application. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Goto et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302615).

Pentafulvene&#8208;containing dyes: The cyclic cross&#8208;conjugated disposition of pentafulvenes creates a distinctive electron system, making them an exciting class of organic compounds. They attracted significant attention because of their propensity to display non&#8208;benzenoid aromatic properties. Synthesis of a series of such pentafulvene&#8208;containing compounds was easily achieved by the reaction of spiro[4.4]nonane in an acidic medium under metal&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, the synthesis of various functionalized spiro[4.4]nonanes was achieved by the reaction of dimethylacetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) with 2&#8208;(2&#8242;&#8208;ketoalkyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208; indandiones in the presence of a catalytic amount of 1,4&#8208;Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as an organo&#8208;catalyst.

Etherification in computational chemistry: Mechanistic studies are of paramount importance for the development of catalytic systems. Our study elucidates the CuII&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed etherification of alcohol substrates under the purview of Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;based coupling reactions. DFT calculations characterized the presence of methoxy&#8208;bridged CuII intermediates as the resting state and the transmetalation step as rate&#8208;limiting. The effect of substrate variation was exemplified by using energy span values. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Koley and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302983).

Recent years have seen an emerging interest in the scientific world to exploring the multifaceted properties of redox&#8208;active ligands towards the design and synthesis of robust and efficient molecular electrocatalysts exhibiting HER. This Review highlights the role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity on mechanistic pathways utilizing 3d transition metal&#8208;based complexes.







Abstract
In recent years, researchers have shifted their focus towards investigating the redox properties of ancillary ligand backbones for small&#8208;molecule activation. Several metal complexes have been reported for the electrocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (HER), providing valuable mechanistic insights. This process involves efficient coupling of electrons and protons. Redox&#8208;active ligands stipulate internal electron transfer and promote effective orbital overlap between metal and ligand, thereby, enabling efficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reactions. Understanding such catalytic mechanisms requires thorough spectroscopic and computational analyses. Herein, we summarize recent examples of molecular electrocatalysts based on 3d transition metals that have significantly influenced mechanistic pathways, thus, emphasizing the multifaceted role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity.

This review emphasizes and comprehensively analyses representative examples of palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions and demonstrates their efficacy in converting C&#8722;H bonds at multiple positions within drug (derivative) molecules into diverse functional groups. Specifically, this study elucidates the notable strides made in the realm of late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation of drug (derivatives) molecules employing Pd (II) catalysts.







Abstract
This review comprehensively analyses representative examples of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions and demonstrates their efficacy in converting C&#8722;H bonds at multiple positions within drug (derivative) molecules into diverse functional groups. These transformative reactions hold immense potential in medicinal chemistry, enabling the efficient and selective functionalization of specific sites within drug molecules, thereby enhancing their pharmacological activity and expanding the scope of potential drug candidates. Although notable articles have focused on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug&#8208;like molecules using transition&#8208;metal catalysts, reviews specifically focusing on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug (derivative) molecules using Pd(II) catalysts are required owing to their prominence as the most widely utilized metal catalysts for C&#8722;H activation and their ability to introduce a myriad of functional groups at specific C&#8722;H bonds. The utilization of Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation methodologies demonstrates impressive success in introducing various functional groups, such as cyano (CN), fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), aromatic rings, olefin, alkyl, alkyne, and hydroxyl groups, to drug (derivative) molecules with high regioselectivity and functional&#8208;group tolerance. These breakthroughs in late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions serve as invaluable tools for drug discovery and development, thereby offering strategic options to optimize drug candidates and drive the exploration of innovative therapeutic solutions.

         <title>Halogen Substitution Regulates High Temperature Dielectric Switch in Lead&#8208;Free Chiral Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports a pair of 1D lead&#8208;free hybrid metal halides: (R&#8208;3FP)2SbCl5 (1; 3FP=3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium) and (R&#8208;3FP)2SbBr5 (2) exhibit high temperature triggered structural phase transition and dielectric switching properties. By halogen substitution in the inorganic framework, the dielectric switch temperature of 2 increased about 20&#8197;K, compared with 1.







Abstract
Hybrid metal halides (HMHs) based phase transition materials have received widespread attention due to their excellent performance and potential applications in energy harvesting, optoelectronics, ferroics, and actuators. Nevertheless, effectively regulating the properties of phase transitions is still a thorny problem. In this work, two chiral lead&#8208;free HMHs (R&#8208;3FP)2SbCl5 (1; 3FP=3&#8208;fluoropyrrolidinium) and (R&#8208;3FP)2SbBr5 (2) were synthesized. By replacing the halide ions in the inorganic skeleton, the phase transition temperature of 2 changes with an increase of about 20&#8197;K, compared with 1. Meanwhile, both compounds display reversible dielectric switching properties. Through crystal structure analysis and Hirshfeld surface analysis, their phase transitions are ascribed to the disorder of the cations and deformation of the inorganic chains.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Discrete Oligomers of Naphthalenediimides in Bulk and on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete oligomers of alkyl&#8208;bridged naphthalenediimides were synthesized and found to assemble into lamellar morphologies in bulk and at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. The results show that both the molecular architecture as well as the crystallization condition play a significant role in the nanoscale ordering and raise the question of the trade&#8208;off between synthetic efforts and novel properties of molecularly perfect materials.







Abstract
Here, we report on the synthesis of discrete oligomers of alkyl&#8208;bridged naphthalenediimides (NDIs) and study their molecular nanostructures both in bulk, in solution, and at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. Via an iterative synthesis method, multiple NDI cores were bridged with short and saturated alkyl&#8208;diamines (C3 and C12) or long and unsaturated alkyl&#8208;diamines (u2C33 to u8C100) at their imide termini. The strong intermolecular interaction between the NDI cores was observed by probing their photophysical properties in solution. In bulk, the discrete NDI oligomers preferentially ordered in lamellar morphologies, irrespective of whether a saturated or unsaturated spacer was employed. Moreover, both the molecular architecture as well as the crystallization conditions play a significant role in the nanoscale ordering. The long unsaturated alkyl chains lead preferably to folded&#8208;chain conformations while their saturated analogues form stretched arrangements. At the solution&#8208;solid interface, well&#8208;defined lamellar regions were observed. These results show that precision in chemical structure alone is not sufficient to reach well&#8208;defined structures of discrete oligomers, but that it must be combined with precision in processing conditions.

         <title>Breaking Radial Dipole Symmetry in Planar Macrocycles Modulates Edge&#8208;to&#8208;Edge Packing and Disrupts Cofacial Stacking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Changing the direction of one of three triazole dipoles by just 40&#176; modulated all modes of self&#8208;assembly. While changes in the relative stability of 2D polymorphs on graphite surfaces was expected, disruption of face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking in 1D was not. These findings revealed the role of long&#8208;range dipole repulsions between stacked macrocycles.







Abstract
Dipolar interactions are ever&#8208;present in supramolecular architectures, though their impact is typically revealed by making dipoles stronger. While it is also possible to assess the role of dipoles by altering their orientations by using synthetic design, doing so without altering the molecular shape is not straightforward. We have now done this by flipping one triazole unit in a rigid macrocycle, tricarb. The macrocycle is composed of three carbazoles (2 Debye) and three triazoles (5 Debye) defining an array of dipoles aligned radially but organized alternately in and out. These dipoles are believed to dictate edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge tiling and face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking. We modified our synthesis to prepare isosteric macrocycles with the orientation of one triazole dipole rotated 40&#176;. The new dipole orientation guides edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge contacts to reorder the stability of two surface&#8208;bound 2D polymorphs. The impact on dipole&#8208;enhanced &#960; stacking, however, was unexpected. Our stacking model identified an unchanged set of short&#8208;range (3.4&#8197;&#197;) anti&#8208;parallel dipole contacts. Despite this situation, the reduction in self&#8208;association was attributed to long&#8208;range (~6.4&#8197;&#197;) dipolar repulsions between &#960;&#8208;stacked macrocycles. This work highlights our ability to control the build&#8208;up and symmetry of macrocyclic skeletons by synthetic design, and the work needed to further our understanding of how dipoles control self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>A Nitronyl Nitroxide&#8208;Substituted Benzotriazinyl Tetraradical
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraradical with a triplet ground state and a nearby excited quintet state, high thermal stability, and reversible redox waves has been prepared by using the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a triiodo&#8208;derivative of benzotriazinyl radical with a gold(I) nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide complex in the presence of an efficient catalytic system: Pd2(dba)3/MeCgPPh.







Abstract
High&#8208;spin organic tetraradicals with significant intramolecular exchange interactions have high potential for advanced technological applications and fundamental research, but those synthesized to date possess limited stability and processability. In this work, we have designed a tetraradical based on the Blatter's radical and nitronyl nitroxide radical moieties and successfully synthesized it by using the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of a triiodo&#8208;derivative of the 1,2,4&#8208;benzotriazinyl radical with gold(I) nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide complex in the presence of a newly developed efficient catalytic system. The molecular and crystal structure of the tetraradical was confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The tetraradical possesses good thermal stability with decomposition onset at &#8764;150&#8201;&#176;C under an inert atmosphere and exhibits reversible redox waves at &#8722;0.54 and 0.45&#8197;V versus Ag/AgCl. The magnetic properties of the tetraradical were characterized by SQUID magnetometry of polycrystalline powders and EPR spectroscopy in various matrices. The collected data, analyzed by using high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations, confirmed that the tetraradical has a triplet ground state and a nearby excited quintet state. The unique high stability of the prepared triazinyl&#8208;nitronylnitroxide tetraradical is a new milestone in the field of creating high&#8208;spin systems.

         <title>A Primer on 2D Descriptors in Selectivity Modeling for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in modeling catalyst selectivity by using 2D structures of catalysts and substrates are highlighted in this brief review. Two&#8208;dimensional descriptors offer the advantage of lower cost and higher speed in calculations than quantum chemical parameters. We provide an overview of a typical quantitative structure&#8208;property relationship workflow, including model building and validation techniques, as well as applications of these methodologies in the design of asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Machine learning has permeated all fields of research, including chemistry, and is now an integral part of the design of novel compounds with desired properties. In the field of asymmetric catalysis, the preference still lies with models based on a physical understanding of the catalysis phenomenon and the electronic and steric properties of catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recent advances in modeling&lt;/b&gt; catalyst selectivity by using 2D structures of catalysts and substrates are highlighted in this brief review. Two-dimensional descriptors offer the advantage of lower cost and higher speed in calculations than quantum chemical parameters. We provide an overview of a typical quantitative structure-property relationship workflow, including model building and validation techniques, as well as applications of these methodologies in the design of asymmetric catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning has permeated all fields of research, including chemistry, and is now an integral part of the design of novel compounds with desired properties. In the field of asymmetric catalysis, the preference still lies with models based on a physical understanding of the catalysis phenomenon and the electronic and steric properties of catalysts. However, such models require quantum chemical calculations and are thus limited by their computational cost. Here, we highlight the recent advances in modeling catalyst selectivity by using the 2D structures of catalysts and substrates. While these have a less explicit mechanistic connection to the modeled property, 2D descriptors, such as topological indices, molecular fingerprints, and fragments, offer the tremendous advantages of low cost and high speed of calculations. This makes them optimal for the in-silico screening of large amounts of data. We provide an overview of common quantitative structure-property relationship workflow, model building and validation techniques, applications of these methodologies in asymmetric catalysis design, and an outlook on improving the understanding of 2D-based models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spent nuclear fuel contains heavy element fission products that must be separated for effective reprocessing for a safe and sustainable nuclear fuel cycle. 93Zr and 99Tc are high&#8208;yield fission products that co&#8208;transport in liquid&#8208;liquid extraction processes. Here we seek atomic&#8208;level information of this co&#8208;extraction process, as well as fundamental knowledge about ZrIV (and HfIV) aqueous polyoxocation speciation in the presence of topology&#8208;directing ligands such as pertechnetate (TcO4&#8208;) and non&#8208;radioactive surrogate perrhenate (ReO4&#8208;). In this context, we show that the flat tetrameric oxyhydroxyl&#8208;cluster [M4(OH)8(H2O)16]8+ (and related polymers) is dissociated by perrhenate/pertechnetate to yield isostructural dimers, M2(OH)2(XO4&#8208;)6(H2O)6&#183;3H2O (M=Zr/HfIV; X = Re/TcVII), elucidated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. We used these model compounds to understand the pervasive 93Zr&#8208;99Tc coextraction with further speciation studies in water, nitric acid, and tetrabutylphosphate (TBP) &#8208;kerosene; where the latter two media are relevant to nuclear fuel reprocessing. SAXS (small angle X&#8208;ray scattering), compositional evaluation, and where experimentally feasible, ESI&#8208;MS (electrospray ionization mass spectrometry) showed that perrhenate/pertechnetate influence Zr/HfIV&#8208;speciation in water. In Zr&#8208;XO4 solvent extraction studies to simulate fuel reprocessing, we provide evidence that TcO4&#8208; enhances extraction of ZrIV, and compositional analysis of the extracted metal&#8208;complexes (Zr&#8208;ReO4 study) is consistent with the crystallized&#160; Zr2(OH)2(ReO4&#8208;)6(H2O)6&#183;dimer.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Activation Produces Different Reaction Environments for Intermediates during Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Commercial zinc metal powder requires activation for consistent and reliable use as a reductant in the formation of organozinc reagents from organohalides, and for the avoidance of supplier and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability. However, the impact of activation methods on the reaction environments of subsequent intermediates has been unknown. Herein, a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) method is developed to bridge this knowledge gap, by imaging and examining reaction intermediates on zinc metal that has been activated by pretreatment through different common methods (i.e., by chemical activation with TMSCl, dibromoethane, or HCl; or by mechanical activation). The group of chemical activating agents, previously thought to act similarly by removing oxide layers, are here shown to produce markedly different reaction environments experienced by subsequent oxidative&#8208;addition intermediates from organohalides&#8212;data uniquely available through FLIM&#8217;s ability to detect small quantities of intermediates in situ coupled with its microenvironmental sensitivity. These different microenvironments potentially give rise to different rates of formation, subsequent solubilization, and reactivity, despite the shared &#8220;[RZnX]&#8221; molecular structure of these intermediates. This information revises models for methods development for oxidative addition to currently sluggish metals beyond zinc by establishing diverse outcomes for pretreatment activation methods that were previously considered similar.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum&#8208;chemical (DFT) calculations on hitherto unknown base(carbene)&#8208;stabilized gallium monoiodides (LB&#8594;GaI) suggest that these systems feature one lone pair of electrons and a formally vacant p&#8208;orbital &#8211; both centered at the central gallium atom &#8211; and exhibit metallomimetic behavior. The calculated reaction free energies as well as bond dissociation energies suggest that these LB&#8594;GaI systems are capable of forming stable donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with group 13 trichlorides. Examination of the ligand exchange reactions with iron and nickel complexes indicates their potential use as ligands in transition metal chemistry. In addition, it is found that the title compounds are also able to activate various enthalpically robust bonds. Further, a detailed mechanistic investigation of these small molecule activation processes reveals the non&#8208;innocent behavior of the carbene (base) moiety attached to the GaI fragment, thereby indicating the cooperative nature of these bond activation processes. The energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and activation strain model (ASM) of reactivity were also employed to quantitatively understand and rationalize the different activation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(II) Promoted C(sp3)&#8722;H Activation in Unactivated Cycloalkanes: Oxo&#8208;Alkylation of Styrenes to Synthesize &#946;&#8208;Disubstituted Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketone derivatives are synthesized from styrenes via oxo&#8208;alkylation of unactivated cycloalkanes. Anhydrous CuCl2 acts as a catalyst in presence of TBHP oxidant and 1&#8208;methylimidazole base. A wide range of olefinic arenes as well as broad range of aliphatic C&#8722;H substrates are well tolerated in this protocol.







Abstract
We report the Cu(II) catalyzed synthesis of &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones from styrene via oxo&#8208;alkylation with unactivated cycloalkanes as the alkylating agent in presence of tert&#8208;butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) and 1&#8208;methylimidazole as oxidant and base respectively. &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones are known to be synthesized by using either expensive Ru/Ir complexes, or low&#8208;cost metal complexes (e.&#8201;g., Fe, Mn) with activated species like aldehyde, acid, alcohol, or phthalimide derivatives as the alkylating agent, however, use of unactivated cycloalkanes directly as the alkylating agent remains challenging. A wide range of aliphatic C&#8722;H substrates as well as various olefinic arenes and heteroarene (35 substrates including 14 new substrates) are well&#8208;tolerated in this method. Hammett analysis shed more light on the substitution effect in the olefinic part on the overall mechanism. Furthermore, the controlled experiments, kinetic isotope effect study, and theoretical calculations (DFT) enable us to gain deeper insight of mechanistic intricacies of this new simple and atom&#8208;economic methodology.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Studies for the Synthesis of Functionalized Cyclopropanes from 2&#8208;Substituted Allylic Derivatives with Ethyl Diazoacetate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small rings: The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from &#945;&#8208;substituted allyl derivatives is described. The methodology, using ethyl diazoacetate, catalyzed by a chiral ruthenium complex furnished the corresponding cyclopropanes as a mixture of easily separable diastereoisomers in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from 2&#8208;substituted allylic derivatives is reported. Using ethyl diazo acetate, the reaction, catalyzed by a chiral ruthenium complex (Ru(II)&#8208;Pheox), furnished the corresponding easily separable cis and trans cyclopropanes in moderate to high yields (32&#8208;97&#8201;%) and excellent ee (86&#8208;99&#8201;%). This approach significantly extends the portfolio of accessible enantioenriched cyclopropanes from an underexplored class of olefins. DFT calculations suggest that an outer&#8208;sphere mechanism is operative in this system.

         <title>Immobilizing Bimetallic RuCo Nanoalloys on Few&#8208;Layered MXene as a Robust Bifunctional Electrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ice and fire: The ruthenium&#8208;cobalt bimetallic nanoalloy&#8208;coupled exfoliated Ti3C2Tx MXene (RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx) has been constructed by ice&#8208;templated and high&#8208;temperature activation approaches, which provide a feasible and efficient strategy for developing MXene&#8208;based catalysts for overall water splitting.







Abstract
Doping Co atoms into Ru lattices can tune the electronic structure of active sites, and the conductive MXene can adjust the electrical conductivity of catalysts, which are both favorable for improving the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst for water splitting. Here, ruthenium&#8208;cobalt bimetallic nanoalloys coupled with exfoliated Ti3C2Tx MXene (RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx) have been constructed by ice&#8208;templated and thermal activation. Due to the strong interaction between the RuCo nanoalloys and conductive MXene, RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx not only exhibits an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a low overpotential and Tafel slope (60&#8197;mV, 34.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4 and 52&#8197;mV, 38.7&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M KOH), but also good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in an alkaline electrolyte (266&#8197;mV, 111.1&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M KOH). The assembled RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx||RuCo&#8722;Ti3C2Tx electrolyzer requires a lower potential (1.56&#8197;V) than does the Pt/C||RuO2 electrolyzer at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. A boosted catalytic HER activity from immobilizing the RuCo nanoalloys on MXene was unveiled by density functional theory calculations. This study provides a feasible and efficient strategy for developing MXene&#8208;based catalysts for overall water splitting.

         <title>Chalcogen and Hydrogen Bond Team up in Driving Anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Anion Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

The H&#8208;selenite anion (HSeO3&#8722;) can act as donor and acceptor of both hydrogen bond and chalcogen bond; the resulting anion&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;anion self&#8208;assembly forms uncommon and structurally different infinite chains featuring an unprecedented Janus&#8208;type team up between the two interactions.







Abstract
H&#8208;selenite anions (HSeO3&#8722;) form in the solid unprecedented anionic supramolecular chains wherein single units are assembled via alternating short Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O contacts. Crystallographic analyses and computational studies (the quantum theory of &#8220;atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules&#8221;, QTAIM, and the noncovalent interaction plot, NCIPlot) consistently prove the attractive nature of these chalcogen bonds (ChBs) and hydrogen honds (HBs), the Janus&#8208;type character of HSeO3&#8722; anions which act as both donors and acceptors of ChB and HB, and the possible stability of anion dimers in solution. The effectiveness of the ChBs herein described may lead to consider the HSeO3&#8722; moiety as a new entry in the toolbox of crystal engineering based on ChB.

         <title>Computational Design of &#945;&#8208;Conotoxins to Target Specific Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Subtypes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FoldX was benchmarked as the best energy prediction method, and seven accurate molecular models of &#945;&#8208;conotoxin/nAChRs were developed as surrogates for the experimental complexes. The combined use of FoldX and these molecular models emerged as an effective approach to predict &#945;&#8208;conotoxins with improved pharmaceutical properties. Novel &#945;&#8208;conotoxin variants designed by this method were successfully validated by experimental assay.







Abstract
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are drug targets for neurological diseases and disorders, but selective targeting of the large number of nAChR subtypes is challenging. Marine cone snail &#945;&#8208;conotoxins are potent blockers of nAChRs and some have been engineered to achieve subtype selectivity. This engineering effort would benefit from rapid computational methods able to predict mutational energies, but current approaches typically require high&#8208;resolution experimental structures, which are not widely available for &#945;&#8208;conotoxin complexes. Herein, five mutational energy prediction methods were benchmarked using crystallographic and mutational data on two acetylcholine binding protein/&#945;&#8208;conotoxin systems. Molecular models were developed for six nAChR subtypes in complex with five &#945;&#8208;conotoxins that were studied through 150 substitutions. The best method was a combination of FoldX and molecular dynamics simulations, resulting in a predictive Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.68 (85&#8201;% accuracy). Novel &#945;&#8208;conotoxin mutants designed using this method were successfully validated by experimental assay with improved pharmaceutical properties. This work paves the way for the rapid design of subtype&#8208;specific nAChR ligands and potentially accelerated drug development.

         <title>Affinity of Telluronium Chalcogen Bond Donors for Lewis Bases in Solution: A Critical Experimental&#8208;Theoretical Joint Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Telluronium salts [Ar2MeTe]X were synthesized, and their Lewis acidic properties towards a number of bases were addressed in solution by physical and theoretical means. DFT and ab&#8208;initio methods reveal the driving role of coulombic and dispersion interactions in the formation of [Ar2MeTe&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Bn]+ complexes in solution (B=Lewis base).







Abstract
Telluronium salts [Ar2MeTe]X were synthesized, and their Lewis acidic properties towards a number of Lewis bases were addressed in solution by physical and theoretical means. Structural X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of 21 different salts revealed the electrophilicity of the Te centers in their interactions with anions. Telluroniums&#8217; propensity to form Lewis pairs was investigated with OPPh3. Diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy suggested that telluroniums can bind up to three OPPh3 molecules. Isotherm titration calorimetry showed that the related heats of association in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane depend on the electronic properties of the substituents of the aryl moiety and on the nature of the counterion. The enthalpies of first association of OPPh3 span &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Study of the affinity of telluroniums for OPPh3 by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT and ab&#8208;initio methods revealed the dominant Coulombic and dispersion interactions as well as an entropic effect favoring association in solution. Intermolecular orbital interactions between [Ar2MeTe]+ cations and OPPh3 are deemed insufficient on their own to ensure the cohesion of [Ar2MeTe&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Bn]+ complexes in solution (B=Lewis base). Comparison of Grimme's and Tkatchenko's DFT&#8208;D4/MBD&#8208;vdW thermodynamics of formation of higher [Ar2MeTe&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Bn]+ complexes revealed significant molecular size&#8208;dependent divergence of the two methodologies, with MBD yielding better agreement with experiment.

         <title>Stabilization of Luminescent Mononuclear Three&#8208;Coordinate CuI Complexes by Two Distinct Cavity&#8208;Shaped Diphosphanes Obtained from a Single &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Precursor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two for the price of one! Depending on the experimental conditions, two dramatically different diphosphanes can be obtained from diphenyl(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane and an &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;derived dimesylate. The metal confining properties of the cavity&#8208;shaped ligands have been exploited to produce luminescent chelate [CuX(PP)] complexes (X=Cl, Br, I).







Abstract
Slightly different reaction conditions afforded two distinct cavity&#8208;shaped cis&#8208;chelating diphosphanes from the same starting materials, namely diphenyl(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane and an &#945;&#8211;cyclodextrin&#8208;derived dimesylate. Thanks to their metal&#8208;confining properties, the two diphosphanes form only mononuclear [CuX(PP)] complexes (X=Cl, Br, or I) with the tricoordinated metal ion located just above the center of the cavity. The two series of CuI complexes display markedly different luminescence properties that are both influenced by the electronic properties of the ligand and the unique steric environment provided by the cyclodextrin (CD) cavity. The excited state lifetimes of all complexes are significantly longer than those of the cavity&#8208;free analogues suggesting peculiar electronic effects that affect radiative deactivation constants. The overall picture stemming from absorption and emission data suggests close&#8208;lying charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT, XLCT) and triplet ligand&#8208;centered (LC) excited states.

         <title>Ethynyl&#8208;B(dan) in [3+2] Cycloaddition and Larock Indole Synthesis: Synthesis of Stable Boron&#8208;Containing Heteroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct, efficient synthesis of diverse five&#8208;membered heteroaryl&#8208;B(dan) with excellent protodeborylation&#8208;resistant properties has been achieved depending upon [3+2] cycloaddition or Pd&#8208;catalyzed heteroannulation of ethynyl&#8208;B(dan). The resulting heteroaryl&#8208;B(dan) has been demonstrated to undergo direct cross&#8208;coupling, regardless of the highly diminished Lewis acidity.







Abstract
The cycloaddition of nitrile oxides with ethynyl&#8208;B(dan) (dan=naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diaminato) allowed the facile preparation of diverse isoxazolyl&#8208;B(dan) compounds, all of which displayed excellent protodeborylation&#8208;resistant properties. The dan&#8208;installation on the boron center proves vital to the high stability of the products as well as the perfect regioselectivity arising from hydrogen bond&#8208;directed orientation in the cycloaddition. The diminished boron&#8208;Lewis acidity of ethynyl&#8208;B(dan) also renders it amenable to azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition, Larock indole synthesis and related heteroannulations. The obtained boron&#8208;containing triazole, indoles, benzofuran and indenone exhibit sufficient resistance toward protodeborylation. Despite the commonly accepted transmetalation&#8208;inactive property derived from the diminished Lewis acidity, the synthesized heteroaryl&#8208;B(dan) compound was still found to be convertible to the oligoarene via sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling.

         <title>A Facile Preparation of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins: Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of &#946;&#8208;Butyrolactone and Frustrated Lewis Pair Reactivity
</title>

         <dc:description>
Diverse N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) were prepared by the direct reaction of NHCs or MICs with N&#8208;aziridinylimines. The prepared NHOs&#8217; activity in ring&#8208;opening polymerizations and their frustrated Lewis pair reactivity were studied.







Abstract
A direct synthesis of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) and their mesoionic congeners (mNHOs) from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes and N&#8208;aziridinylimines is reported. The reaction provided diverse functionalized (m)NHOs and &#960;&#8208;extended analogues. The prepared NHOs initiated the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#946;&#8208;butyrolactone, and insertion of aldehyde and nitrile into an NHO&#8208;B(C6F5)3 adduct was demonstrated.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Highly Crystalline 1T&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;LixMoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover feature represents the crystal structure of LiMoS2. It consists of slightly distorted MoS2 layers with lithium sandwiched in between, illustrated as isosurfaces for potential lithium mobility. The compound is notoriously difficult to prepare with high crystallinity. Now, a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis has allowed the elucidation of the crystal structure. Thus, the tungsten carbide cubes of the multianvil press used at the Innsbruck laboratory encompass the structure. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Schwarzm&#252;ller and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302565).

         <title>Are &#8220;Carbon Dots&#8221; Always Carbon Dots? Evidence for Their Supramolecular Nature from Structural and Dynamic Studies in Solution and in the Pure Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The depicted model unveils the supramolecular nature of the so&#8208;called carbon dots (CDs), which in dilute solution are in fact individual small&#8208;to&#8208;medium&#8208;sized molecular species that only assemble into supramolecular organized structures when in the solid state. The image also alludes to the main techniques that allowed coherent correlations to be established between the morphology of CDs in the solid state (HRTEM) and the solution properties. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;V. Prata and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302955).

         <title>The Effect of Conformational Freedom vs Restriction on the Rate in Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Monohydrogenation of Dienones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation constitutes an efficient strategy for the preparation of chiral molecules. When dienes are subjected to hydrogenation, control over regioselectivity still presents a large challenge and the fully saturated alkane is often yielded. A few successful monohydrogenations of dienes have been reported, but hitherto these are only efficient for dienes comprised of two distinctly different olefins. Herein, the reactivity of a conjugated carbonyl compound as a function of their conformational freedom is studied, based on a combined experimental and theoretical approach. It was found that alkenes in the (s)&#8208;cis conformation experience a large rate acceleration while (s)&#8208;trans restrained alkenes undergo hydrogenation slowly. Ultimately, this reactivity aspect was exploited in a novel method for the monohydrogenation of dienes based on conformational restriction ((s)&#8208;cis vs (s)&#8208;trans). This mode of discrimination conceptually differs from existing monohydrogenations and dienones constructed of two olefins similar in nature could efficiently be hydrogenated to the chiral alkene (up to 99% ee). The extent of regioselection is even powerful enough to overcome the conventional reactivity order of substituted olefins (di&gt;tri&gt;tetra). This high yielding and atom&#8208;economical protocol provides an interesting opportunity to instal a stereogenic center on a carbocycle, while leaving a synthetically useful alkene untouched.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphinidenes: Fundamental Properties and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphinidenes are heavy congeners of nitrenes that have been broadly used as in situ reagents in synthetic phosphorus chemistry and also serve as versatile ligands in coordination with transition metals. However, the detection of free phosphinidenes is largely challenged by their high reactivity and also the lack of suitable synthetic methods, rendering the knowledge about the fundamental properties of this class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds limited. Recently, an increasing number of free phosphinidenes bearing prototype structural and bonding properties have been prepared for the first time, thus enabling the exploration of their distinct reactivity from the nitrene analogues. This Concept article will discuss the experimental approaches for the generation of the highly unstable phosphinidenes and highlight their distinct reactivity from the nitrogen analogues so as to stimuate future studies about their potential applications in phosphorus chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonylation as a Key Step in New Tandem Reactions &#8211; A Route to BODIPYs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a highly efficient five&#8208;step reaction sequence to BODIPYs is presented. The key step is the combination of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed in&#8208;situ generation of aldehydes and their subsequent organocatalytic activation to yield dipyrromethanes, which are further converted to the corresponding BODIPY. Classic syntheses towards BODIPYs have relied on aldehydes or acid chlorides, which are often not commercially available and rather sensitive to handle. The presented approach starts from readily available and stable alkenes or aryl&#8208;bromides, which allows to extend the range of readily available BODIPYs that can be tailored for their specific use. The synthesis of 55 derivatives with overall yields of up to 78% demonstrates the wide applicability and advantages of the presented method.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;device Dimethylamine Treatment Enables Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of organic ligands via post&#8208;device treatment is an effective strategy to improve the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although the active area is protected by metal electrode under post&#8208;treatment, the aggression of post&#8208;treatment ligands into active area cannot be avoided thoroughly. Unfortunately, the size of long&#8208;chain amines is too large, and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite cannot maintain its 3D perovskite structure once the cation substitution occurs during the post&#8208;treatment. Despite that the low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskites are beneficial to stability, long&#8208;chain amines are harmful to carrier transport in PSCs. Here, we introduce dimethylamine (DMA), a slightly oversized cation that can be doped into 3D perovskite structure, for post&#8208;device treatment to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs. After exposure to DMA gas, the inactive area of Cs/FA/MA mixed cation perovskite device that is not covered by metal electrode is converted into LD perovskite, passivating the defects of 3D perovskite in the active region, suppressing non&#8208;radiation recombination and ion migration. As a result, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.29% with negligible hysteresis and better stability after DMA post&#8208;treatment, which is much higher than that (20.40%) of the control device.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical insight into the special synergy of bimetallic site in Co/MoC catalyst to promote N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic mechanisms of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) on the pristine and Co/&#945;&#8208;MoC(001) surfaces were explored by density functional theory calculations. The results show that the preferred pathway is that a direct N&#8801;N cleavage occurs first, followed by continuous hydrogenations. The production of second NH3 molecule is identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step on both systems with kinetic barriers of 1.5 and 2.0 eV, respectively, indicating that N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 transformation on bimetallic surface is more likely to occur. The two components of the bimetallic center play different roles during NRR process, in which Co atom does not directly participate in the binding of intermediates, but primarily serves as a reservoir of H atoms. This special synergy makes Co/&#945;&#8208;MoC(001) have superior activity for ammonia synthesis. The introduction of Co not only facilitates N2 dissociation, but also accelerates the migration of H atom due to the antibonding characteristic of Co&#8722;H bond. This study offers a facile strategy for the rational design and development of efficient catalysts for ammonia synthesis and other reactions involving the hydrogenation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Contrast Photoacoustic Imaging of Localized Cysteine in Orthotopic Breast Cancer Enabled by A Totally&#8208;Caged Methylene Blue Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;contrast photoacoustic sensing imaging (PASI) was greatly determined by optical absorption changes of the absorbers usually enabled by activatable probes via controllably converting the absorbed electromagnetic energy to ultrasound waves. However, most of current photoacoustic probes still suffer from limited imaging contrast towards specific species because of their small absorption spectral changes in the near infrared (NIR) region. Herein, we developed a methylene blue&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with its NIR optical absorption totally caged, which could afford dramatical &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; absorption transition for high&#8208;contrast photoacoustic imaging towards the localized cysteine. The rationally designed methylene blue&#8208;based probe for cysteine (MB&#8208;Cys) would keep in off state with almost no absorption in NIR region, while upon activated by cysteine through cyclization reaction with acrylates, it would reconstruct the &#960;&#8208;conjugation system to release the free methylene blue with strong absorption centered at 665 nm (&gt;130&#8208;fold enhancement). The unique responsive behavior could enable the PASI for photoacoustic mapping the cysteine in orthotopic breast cancer in a high&#8208;contrast manner. Therefore, this work established an up&#8208;to&#8208;date strategy to originally eliminate the background photoacoustic signal for PASI to accurately monitor cysteine in vivo.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-contrast photoacoustic sensing imaging (PASI) was greatly determined by optical absorption changes of the absorbers usually enabled by activatable probes via controllably converting the absorbed electromagnetic energy to ultrasound waves. However, most of current photoacoustic probes still suffer from limited imaging contrast towards specific species because of their small absorption spectral changes in the near infrared (NIR) region. Herein, we developed a methylene blue-based photoacoustic probe with its NIR optical absorption totally caged, which could afford dramatical &#8220;OFF-to-ON&#8221; absorption transition for high-contrast photoacoustic imaging towards the localized cysteine. The rationally designed methylene blue-based probe for cysteine (MB-Cys) would keep in off state with almost no absorption in NIR region, while upon activated by cysteine through cyclization reaction with acrylates, it would reconstruct the &#960;-conjugation system to release the free methylene blue with strong absorption centered at 665 nm (&amp;gt;130-fold enhancement). The unique responsive behavior could enable the PASI for photoacoustic mapping the cysteine in orthotopic breast cancer in a high-contrast manner. Therefore, this work established an up-to-date strategy to originally eliminate the background photoacoustic signal for PASI to accurately monitor cysteine in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Complexes for X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoluminescent properties of lanthanide complexes have been thoroughly investigated; however, there have been much fewer studies showcasing their potential use in ionizing radiation detection. In this work, we delve into the photo&#8208; and radio&#8208;induced luminescence of a series of lanthanide&#8208;bearing organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids and their potential as a platform for X&#8208;ray scintillation and imaging. The judicious synergy between lanthanide cations and 2,6&#8208;di(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)isonicotinate (bppCOO&#8211;) ligands&#160;affords six new materials with three distinct structures. Notably, Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1 and Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 display sharp fingerprint X&#8208;ray&#8208;excited luminescence (XEL), the intensities of which can be linearly correlated with the X&#8208;ray dose rates over a broad dynamic range (0.007 &#8211; 4.55 mGy s&#8722;1). Moreover, the X&#8208;ray sensing efficacies of Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1 and Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 were evaluated, showing that Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 features a lower detection limit of 4.06 &#956;Gy s&#8722;1 compared to 14.55 &#956;Gy s&#8722;1 of Eu&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;1. Given the higher X&#8208;ray sensitivity and excellent radiation stability of Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2, we fabricated a flexible scintillator film for X&#8208;ray imaging by embedding finely ground Tb&#8208;bppCOO&#8208;2 in the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer. The resulting scintillator film can be utilized for high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution of approximately 7 lp mm&#8208;1</dc:description>

         <title>&#948;&#8208;bonding and spin&#8208;orbit coupling make SrAg4Sb2 a topological insulator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bonding interactions and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in the topological insulator SrAg4Sb2 are investigated using DFT with orbital projection analysis. Ag&#8208;Ag delta bonding is a key ingredient in the topological insulating state because the 4dxy + 4dx2 &#8722;y2 delta antibonding band forms a band inversion with the 5s sigma bonding band. Spin&#8208;orbit coupling is required to lift d orbital degeneracies and lower the antibonding band enough to create the band inversion. These bonding effects are enabled by a longer&#8208;than&#8208;covalent Ag&#8208;Ag distance in the crystal lattice, which might be a structural characteristic of other transition metal based topological insulators. A simplified model of the topological bands is constructed to capture the essence of the topological insulating state in a way that may be engineered in other materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Porphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework with High Iodine Capture Capacity and I&#8208;doping Enhanced Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous organic materials with well&#8208;defined and uniform structure. The material is an excellent candidate as a solid adsorbent for iodine adsorption. In the present study, we report the synthesis of COF with porphyrin moiety, TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF, by solvothermal reaction, which was characterized by XRD, solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, IR, TGA, and nitrogen adsorption&#8208;desorption analysis. TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF showed a high specific surface area of 443 m2 g&#8208;1, and exhibited good adsorption performance for iodine vapor, with an adsorption capacity of 2.74 g g&#8208;1. XPS and Raman spectrum indicated that a hybrid of physisorption and chemisorption took place between host COF and iodine molecules. The electric properties of iodine&#8208;loaded TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF were also studied. After doped with iodine, the conductivity of the material increased by more than 5 orders of magnitude. The photoconductivity of I2&#8208;doped COF was also studied and TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF showed doping&#8208;enhanced photocurrent generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Exceptional capture of methane at low pressure by an iron&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective capture of methane (CH4) at low concentrations and its separation from N2 are extremely challenging owing to the weak host&#8208;guest interactions between CH4 molecules and any sorbent material. Here, we report the exceptional adsorption of CH4 at low pressure and efficient separation of CH4/N2 by MFM&#8208;300(Fe). MFM&#8208;300(Fe) shows a very high uptake for CH4 of 0.85 mmol g&#8722;1 at 1 mbar and 298 K and a record CH4/N2 selectivity of 45 for porous solids, representing a new benchmark for CH4 capture and CH4/N2 separation. The excellent separation of CH4/N2 by MFM&#8208;300(Fe) has been confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. In situ neutron powder diffraction, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopies, coupled with modelling, reveal a unique and strong binding of CH4 molecules involving Fe&#8208;OH&#183;&#183;&#183;CH4 and C&#183;&#183;&#183;phenyl ring interactions within the pores of MFM&#8208;300(Fe), thus promoting the exceptional adsorption of CH4 at low pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress in Fabrication and Applications of Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Microcapsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of recent advances in cholesteric liquid crystal microcapsules, focusing on the preparation methods of cholesteric liquid crystal microcapsules, the shell layer materials used for the preparation of cholesteric liquid crystal microcapsules, as well as the application areas of cholesteric liquid crystal microcapsules. In addition, some insights into their future development are introduced.







Abstract
Liquid crystals (LCs) are well known for inherent responsiveness to external stimuli, such as light, thermal, magnetic, and electric fields. Cholesteric LCs are among the most fascinating, since they possess distinctive optical properties due to the helical molecular orientation. However, the good flow, easy contamination, and poor stability of small&#8208;molecule LCs limit their further applications, and microencapsulation as one of the most effective tools can evade these disadvantages. Microencapsulation can offer shell&#8208;core structure with LCs in the core can strengthen their stability, avoiding interference with the environment while maintaining the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and optical properties. Here, we report recent progress in the fabrication and applications of cholesteric LC microcapsules (CLCMCs). We summarize general properties and basic principles, fabrication methods including interfacial polymerization, in&#8208;situ polymerization, complex coacervation, solvent evaporation, microfluidic and polymerization of reactive mesogens, and then give a comprehensive overview of their applications in various popular domains, including smart fabrics, smart sensor, smart displays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information encryption, biomedicine and actuators. Finally, we discuss the currently facing challenges and the potential development directions in this field.

This review highlights emerging molecular designs for purely organic ferroelectric materials based on supramolecular assembly of different donor (D)&#8211;acceptor (A) systems including classical D&#8208;A co&#8208;crystals or gels those exhibit inter&#8208;molecular charge&#8208;transfer interactions. Subsequent developments in single component dipolar and more recently ambipolar systems (with intra&#8208;molecular charge&#8208;transfer) are discussed with specific emphasis on the impact of chiral supramolecular polymerization in ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity.







Abstract
Organic ferroelectric (FE) materials, though known for more than a century, are yet to reach close to the benchmark of inorganic or hybrid materials in terms of the magnitude of polarization. Amongst the different classes of organic systems, donor (D)&#8211;acceptor (A) charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes are recognized as promising for ferroelectricity owing to their neutral&#8208;to&#8208;ionic phase transition at low temperature. This review presents an overview of different supramolecular D&#8208;A systems that have been explored for FE phase transitions. The discussion begins with a general introduction of ferroelectricity and its different associated parameters. Then it moves on to show early examples of CT cocrystals that have shown FE properties at sub&#8208;ambient temperature. Subsequently, recent developments in the field of room temperature (RT) ferroelectricity, exhibited by H&#8208;bond&#8208;stabilized lock&#8208;arm supramolecular&#8208;ordering (LASO) in D&#8208;A co&#8208;crystals or other FE CT&#8208;crystals devoid of neutral&#8208;ionic phase transition are discussed. Then the discussion moves on to emerging reports on other D&#8208;A soft materials such as gel and foldable polymers; finally it shows very recent developments in ferroelectricity in supramolecular assemblies of single&#8208;component dipolar or ambipolar &#960;&#8208;systems, exhibiting intra&#8208;molecular charge transfer. The effects of structural nuances such as H&#8208;bonding, balanced charge transfer and chirality on the observed ferroelectricity is described with the available examples. Finally, piezoelectricity in recently reported ambipolar ADA&#8208;type systems are discussed to highlight the future potential of these soft materials in micropower energy harvesting.

         <title>An In Crystallo Reaction with an Engineered Cytochrome P450 Peroxygenase
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered P450 peroxygenase, T252E&#8208;CYP199A4, requires only H2O2 for O&#8208;demethylation to occur with 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid as substrate. Crystals of this peroxygenase with substrate bound were soaked with H2O2 and showed a loss of electron density, which is consistent with in crystallo O&#8208;demethylation.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) are a class of heme&#8208;thiolate enzymes that insert oxygen into unactivated C&#8722;H bonds. These enzymes can be converted into peroxygenases via protein engineering, which enables their activity to occur using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) without the requirement for additional nicotinamide co&#8208;factors or partner proteins. Here, we demonstrate that soaking crystals of an engineered P450 peroxygenase with H2O2 enables the enzymatic reaction to occur within the crystal. Crystals of the designed P450 peroxygenase, the T252E mutant of CYP199A4, in complex with 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid were soaked with different concentrations of H2O2 for varying times to initiate the in crystallo O&#8208;demethylation reaction. Crystal structures of T252E&#8208;CYP199A4 showed a distinct loss of electron density that was consistent with the O&#8208;demethylated metabolite, 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid. A new X&#8208;ray crystal structure of this enzyme with the 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid product was obtained to enable comparison alongside the existing substrate&#8208;bound structure. The visualisation of enzymatic catalysis in action is challenging in structural biology and the ability to initiate the reactions of P450 enzymes, in crystallo by simply soaking crystals with H2O2 will enable new structural biology methods and techniques to be applied to study their mechanism of action.

         <title>Reinforcing the Adsorption and Conversion of Polysulfides in Li&#8722;S Battery by Incorporating Molybdenum into MnS/MnO Nanorods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molybdenum&#8208;doped MnS/MnO@C porous structure is designed as a multifunctional coating on the polypropylene separator to achieve the synergistic effect mechanism between &#8220;strong adsorption&#8221; and &#8220;rapid conversion&#8221; for lithium polysulfides.







Abstract
The Sabatier principle suggests that an excessive adsorption of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by metal compounds may hinder their conversion in the absence of a conversion module. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a synergetic effect mechanism between &#8220;strong adsorption&#8221; and &#8220;rapid conversion&#8221; for LiPSs. To achieve this coexistence, a molybdenum&#8208;doped MnS/MnO@C porous structure is designed as a multifunctional coating on the polypropylene (PP) separator. The incorporation of MnS/MnO@C enhances the adsorption capacity towards LiPSs, while molybdenum facilitates subsequent conversion. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of each component and its large specific surface area, the cell with Mo&#8208;doped MnS/MnO@C coating achieves smooth adsorption&#8208;diffusion&#8208;conversion processes and exhibits an appreciable rate performance with outstanding cycling stability. Even when sulfur loading increases to 9.68&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the modified battery delivers an excellent initial areal capacity of 11.69&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintains 6.97&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 50 cycles at 0.1&#8197;C. This study presents a promising approach to simultaneously accomplish &#8220;strong adsorption&#8221; and &#8220;rapid conversion&#8221; of polysulfides, offering novel perspectives for devising dual&#8208;functional modified separators.

         <title>ortho&#8208;Boronic Acid Carbonyl Compounds and Their Applications in Chemical Biology
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we highlight the utility of o&#8208;boronic acid imines, hydrazones, oximes, and diazaborines in chemical biology applications, including bioconjugation, drug delivery systems, stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers, and as chemical probes.







Abstract
Iminoboronates and diazaborines are related classes of compounds that feature an imine ortho to an arylboronic acid (iminoboronate) or a hydrazone that cyclizes with an ortho arylboronic acid (diazaborine). Rather than acting as independent chemical motifs, the arylboronic acid impacts the rate of imine/hydrazone formation, hydrolysis, and exchange with competing nucleophiles. Increasing evidence has shown that the imine/hydrazone functionality also impacts arylboronic acid reactivity toward diols and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Untangling the communication between C=N linked functionalities and arylboronic acids has revealed a powerful and tunable motif for bioconjugation chemistries and other applications in chemical biology. Here, we survey the applications of iminoboronates and diazaborines in these fields with an eye toward understanding their utility as a function of neighboring group effects.

         <title>Theoretical and Experimental Aspects of Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The summarization of the progress in the design strategy of OER electrocatalysts is beneficial to building the future global energy mix. The strategy of combining theoretical design and experimental verification can shed light on the design, preparation, and application of advanced OER catalysts.







Abstract
Scientists are increasingly paying attention to using theoretical design as a guide combined with modern in&#8208;situ characterization techniques to develop catalysts with high activity, low cost, and long&#8208;term life. The review discusses the progress of catalyst theoretical design and corresponding experiments based on three typical oxygen evolution catalytic mechanisms, including the adsorbate evolution, lattice oxygen&#8208;mediated, and unconventional bifunctional mechanisms. This work briefly describes the commonly used tools and descriptors in theory as well as the electrochemical techniques and characterizations in experiments. Our purpose is to sort out the ways to closely integrate the theoretical method and experimental verification from the perspective of reaction mechanism, and to provide some experience reference for the future development of theoretical tools and experimental technologies.

         <title>Divergent Cascade Ring&#8208;Expansion Reactions of Acryloyl Imides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic and medium&#8208;sized ring ketones, lactones and lactams can all be made from common acryloyl imide starting materials through divergent, one&#8208;pot cascade ring&#8208;expansion reactions. A second ring expansion can also be performed following a second iteration of imide formation and alkene functionalisation/ring expansion.







Abstract
Macrocyclic and medium&#8208;sized ring ketones, lactones and lactams can all be made from common acryloyl imide starting materials through divergent, one&#8208;pot cascade ring&#8208;expansion reactions. Following either conjugate addition with an amine or nitromethane, or osmium(VIII)&#8208;catalysed dihydoxylation, rearrangement through a four&#8208;atom ring expansion takes place spontaneously to form the ring expanded products. A second ring expansion can also be performed following a second iteration of imide formation and alkene functionalisation/ring expansion. In the dihydroxylation series, three&#8208; or four&#8208;atom ring expansion can be performed selectively, depending on whether the reaction is under kinetic or thermodynamic control.

         <title>Stabilization of Diborynes versus Destabilization of Diborenes by Coordination of Lewis Bases: Unravelling the Dichotomy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different electronic structure of B2 and B2H2 makes them to react differently to the addition of ligands. Hence, in B2L2, electron&#8208;donating ligands shorten and strengthen the boron&#8208;boron bond whereas, in B2H2L2, they elongate and weaken the boron&#8208;boron bond.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically investigated the boron&#8208;boron bonds in B2, diborynes B2L2, and diborenes B2H2L2 (L=none, OH2, NH3) using dispersion&#8208;corrected relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. B2 has effectively a single B&#8722;B bond provided by two half &#960; bonds, whereas B2H2 has effectively a double B=B bond provided by two half &#960; bonds and one &#963; 2p&#8211;2p bond. This different electronic structure causes B2 and B2H2 to react differently to the addition of ligands. Thus, in B2L2, electron&#8208;donating ligands shorten and strengthen the boron&#8208;boron bond whereas, in B2H2L2, they lengthen and weaken the boron&#8208;boron bond. The aforementioned variations in boron&#8208;boron bond length and strength become more pronounced as the Lewis basicity of the ligands L increases.

         <title>Towards Amplified Probing of Weak Intermolecular Interactions on the External Surfaces of &#160;Molecular Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: We report a sensitive method for comparing weak interactions between aryl rings located on the external surfaces of equilibrating homo&#8208; and heterodimeric molecular capsules. Two identical self&#8208;complementary resorcin[4]arene tetrabenzoate molecules and one tetramethylammonium cation form in CDCl3 hydrogen&#8208;bonded homodimeric capsules whose exteriors are decorated with four tight pairs of weakly interacting aryl rings. The pairwise mixing of six homodimers establishes their equilibria with the corresponding heterodimeric species in which two types of aryl rings exert on each other some gentle forces. This equilibrium is significantly shifted either towards homo&#8208; or heterodimers depending on the nature and location of the substituents in the weakly interacting aryl rings. The thermodynamic favorability or disadvantage of the heterodimerization is determined by stronger or weaker aryl&#8208;aryl attractions in the hetero&#8208; or homodimeric capsules, respectively. The four&#8208;fold amplification of weak aryl&#8208;aryl interactions on the external surfaces of the equilibrating capsules is responsible for the high sensitivity of our approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction of a Cyclic Zinc(II) Porphyrin Trimer with an Encapsulated Rhenium(I) Bipyridine Tricarbonyl Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We previously reported a cyclic Zn(II) porphyrin trimer in which three Zn porphyrins are alternately bridged by three 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) moieties, enabling the encapsulation of metal complexes within the nanopore formed by the Zn porphyrins. In this study, we introduced a&#160;[Re(CO)3Br] fragment into one of the bpy moieties of the cyclic trimer to form the catalytic Re(4,4&#8217;&#8208;R2&#8208;bpy)(CO)3Br center (R = methyl ester). The ester groups (R) play an important role in the synthesis of the cyclic structure. However, it was observed that these ester groups significantly deactivated the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction. Therefore, we converted the ester groups with a suitable reducing reagent into hydroxymethyl groups, followed by acetylation to form acetoxymethyl groups. This modification remarkably enhanced the photocatalytic activity of the cyclic trimer=Re complex system for CO2 reduction. Moreover, in the modified system, the presence of the Re complex induced room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence of the Zn porphyrin. The phosphorescence was significantly quenched by 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole, indicating that efficient electron transfer mediated by the excited triplet state of the Zn porphyrin occurs during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroplated electrodes for continuous and mass&#8208;efficient electrochemical hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic hydrogenations (ECH) enable the reduction of organic substrates upon usage of electric current and present a sustainable alternative to conventional processes if green electricity is used. Opposed to most current protocols for electrode preparation, this work presents a one&#8208;step binder&#8208; and additive&#8208;free production of silver&#8208; and copper&#8208;electroplated electrodes. Controlled adjustment of the preparation parameters allows for tuning of catalyst morphology and its electrochemical properties. Upon optimization of the deposition protocol and carbon support, high faradaic efficiencies of 93% for the ECH of the Vitamin A&#8208; and E&#8208;synthon 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;butyn&#8208;2&#8208;ol (MBY) are achieved that can be maintained at current densities of 240&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2&#160;and minimal catalyst loadings of 0.2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8208;2, corresponding to an unmatched production rate of 1.47&#160;kgMBE&#160;gcat&#8209;1&#160;h&#8209;1. For a continuous hydrogenation process, the protocol can be directly transferred into a single&#8208;pass operation mode giving a production rate of 1.38&#160;kgMBE&#160;gcat&#8209;1&#160;h&#8209;1. Subsequently, the substrate spectrum was extended to a total of 17 different C&#8208;C&#8208;, C&#8208;O&#8208; and N&#8208;O&#8208;unsaturated compounds revealing the general applicability of the reported process. Our results lay an important groundwork for the development of electrochemical reactors and electrodes able to directly compete with the palladium&#8208;based thermocatalytic state of the art.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic hydrogenations (ECH) enable the reduction of organic substrates upon usage of electric current and present a sustainable alternative to conventional processes if green electricity is used. Opposed to most current protocols for electrode preparation, this work presents a one-step binder- and additive-free production of silver- and copper-electroplated electrodes. Controlled adjustment of the preparation parameters allows for tuning of catalyst morphology and its electrochemical properties. Upon optimization of the deposition protocol and carbon support, high faradaic efficiencies of 93% for the ECH of the Vitamin A- and E-synthon 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol (MBY) are achieved that can be maintained at current densities of 240&#160;mA&#160;cm-2&#160;and minimal catalyst loadings of 0.2&#160;mg&#160;cm-2, corresponding to an unmatched production rate of 1.47&#160;kgMBE&#160;gcat&#8209;1&#160;h&#8209;1. For a continuous hydrogenation process, the protocol can be directly transferred into a single-pass operation mode giving a production rate of 1.38&#160;kgMBE&#160;gcat&#8209;1&#160;h&#8209;1. Subsequently, the substrate spectrum was extended to a total of 17 different C-C-, C-O- and N-O-unsaturated compounds revealing the general applicability of the reported process.

         <title>Accelerated Synthesis of Nanolayered MWW Zeolite by Interzeolite Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining interzeolite transformation with a dual&#8208;template strategy, nanolayered MWW zeolite was obtained within 48&#8197;h. 4&#8208;Membered&#8208;ring (4MR) units from the FAU precursor are essential to accelerate MWW formation.







Abstract
Hierarchical zeolites can offer substantial benefits over bulk zeolites in catalysis. A drawback towards practical implementation is their lengthy synthesis, often requiring complex organic templates. This work describes an accelerated synthesis of nanolayered MWW zeolite based on the combination of interzeolite transformation (IZT) with a dual&#8208;templating strategy. FAU zeolite, hexamethyleneimine (HMI), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were respectively employed as Al source and primary zeolite, structure directing agent, and exfoliating agent. This approach allowed to reduce the synthesis of nanolayered MWW to 48&#8197;h, which is a considerable advance over the state of the art. Tracking structural, textural, morphological, and chemical properties during crystallization showed that 4&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (4MR) units derived from the FAU precursor are involved in the faster formation of MWW in comparison to a synthesis procedure from amorphous precursor. CTAB restricts the growth of the zeolite in the c&#8208;direction, resulting in nanolayered MWW. Moreover, we show that this approach can speed up the synthesis of nanolayered FER. The merits of nanolayered MWW zeolites are demonstrated in terms of improved catalytic performance in the Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran and ethylene to p&#8208;xylene compared to bulk reference MWW sample.

         <title>Regulating Excited States by Varying Different Acceptors of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Emitters for Efficient Non&#8208;Doped Blue Electroluminescence with High Luminance and Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A emitters with different acceptors are designed and synthesized, and the excited states could be manipulated from LE&#8208;dominated (mPAN, and mPANPH) to HLCT featured (mPNAPH) transition. The non&#8208;doped OLED based on mPNAPH exhibits pure blue emission at 456&#8197;nm with high Lmax of 35290&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, EQEmax of 6.13&#8201;% and low efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Chromophores with hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited state are promising for the realization of high performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The rational manipulation of HLCT excited state for efficient emitters remains challenging. Herein, we present three donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) molecules (mPAN, mPANPH, and mPNAPH) with phenanthro[9,10&#8208;d]imidazole (PI) and pyridinyl as donor and &#960;&#8208;bridge respectively. Changes in various kinds of polycyclic aromatic derivative acceptors (anthracene, 9&#8208;phenylanthracene, and 1&#8208;phenylnaphthalene) could manipulate the excited states and optoelectronic properties. Theoretical calculations reveal that the S1 state of mPNAPH exhibits HLCT nature while the other two molecules show local excited (LE) state dominated feature. The photophysical properties also demonstrate this characteristic. Therefore, compared with mPAN and mPANPH, mPNAPH has higher photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) whether in solutions or neat films. Ultimately, the non&#8208;doped devices based on these emitters show high luminance larger than 35000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, and high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmaxs) larger than 5&#8201;% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. In particular, the mPNAPH&#8208;based device displays an excellent performance of pure blue emission at 456&#8197;nm with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinate of (0.15, 0.16) and EQEmax of 6.13&#8201;% that benefited from the HLCT state and high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process.

         <title>A Cyclotriveratrylene Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chiral Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In and out! The control of the cyclotriveratrylene chirality by achiral solvents allow to switch from an open cage in polar aprotic solvents to an imploded one in bulky aromatic solvents. Interestingly, this controlled molecular motion of a cyclotriveratrylene unit is described for the first time.







Abstract
Chiral molecular switches are attracting attention as they could pave the way to chiral molecular machines. Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of a single molecule chiral switch based on a cyclotriveratrylene scaffold, in which the chirality inversion is controlled by the solvent. Hemicryptophanes are built around a C3 cyclotriveratrylene chiral unit, with either M or P handedness, connected to another tripod and usually displaying an &#8220;out&#8221; configuration. Here, we demonstrate that solvents are able to control the &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;out&#8221; configurations of the CTV unit, creating a chiral molecular switch from (M/P)&#8221;in&#8221; to (P/M)&#8221;out&#8221; handedness. The full characterization of the &#8220;in&#8221; and &#8220;out&#8221; configurations and of the chirality switch were made possible by combining NMR, HPLC, ECD, DFT and molecular dynamics. Interestingly, bulky aromatic solvents such as 2&#8208;t&#8208;butylphenol favor the &#8220;in&#8221; configuration while polar aprotic solvents such as acetone favor the &#8220;out&#8221; configuration. This chiral switch was found to be fully reversible allowing the system to oscillate between two different M and P configurations several times upon the action of solvents stimuli.

         <title>A Conformationally Stable &#960;&#8208;Expanded X&#8208;Type Double Helicene Comprising Dihydropyracylene Units with Multistage Redox Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented X&#8208;type double helicene with &#960;&#8208;expanded polycyclic framework and exceptional conformational stability was realized and its enantiomers were successfully separated. Comprehensive spectroscopic and electrochemical studies in conjunction with theory identified the compound as a strong chiral fluorophore with 5&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior.







Abstract
A &#960;&#8208;expanded X&#8208;type double [5]helicene comprising dihydropyracylene moieties was synthesized from commercially available acenaphthene. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed the unique highly twisted structure of the compound resulting in the occurrence of two enantiomers which were separated by chiral HPLC, owing to their high conformational stability. The compound shows strongly bathochromically shifted UV/vis absorption and emission bands with small Stokes shift and considerable photoluminescence quantum yield and circular polarized luminescence response. The electrochemical studies revealed five facilitated reversible redox events, including three reductions and two oxidations, thus qualifying the compound as chiral multistage redox amphoter. The experimental findings are in line with the computational studies based on density functional theory pointing towards increased spatial extension of the frontier molecular orbitals over the polycyclic framework and a considerably narrowed HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap.

         <title>Capturing Sialyl&#8208;glycan on Live Cancer Cells by Tailored Boronopeptide
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This investigation demonstrates that the appropriate positioning of a customized boronic acid probe into a sialic acid binding epitope leverages a selective and potent binder of sialyl&#8208;glycan. Such synergistic peptide probe is promising in clinical oncology for diagnosis.







Abstract
Boronic acid&#8208;containing molecules are substantially popularized in chemical biology and medicinal chemistry due to the broad spectrum of covalent conjugations as well as interaction modules offered by the versatile boron atom. Apparently, the WGA peptide (wheat germ agglutinin, 62&#8211;73), which shows a considerably low binding affinity to sialic acid, turned into a selective and &gt;5 folds potent binder with the aid of a suitable boronic acid probe installed chemoselectively. In silico studies prompted us to install BA probes on the cysteine residue, supposedly located in close proximity to the bound sialic acid. In vitro studies revealed that the tailored boronopeptides show enhanced binding ability due to the synergistic recognition governed by selective non&#8208;covalent interactions and cis&#8208;diol boronic acid conjugation. The intense binding is observed even in 10&#8201;% serum, thus enabling profiling of sialyl&#8208;glycan on cancer cells, as compared with the widely used lectin, Sambucus nigra. The synergistic binding mode between the best boronopeptide (P3) binder and sialic acid was analyzed via 1H and 11B&#8197;NMR.

         <title>Investigation of Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)&#8208;Plasma Membrane Interaction in Live Cells and the Influence of GPI Glycan Structure on the Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional GPI derivative containing the entire conserved core structure of GPIs was proved to be a useful probe to target the cell membrane and tag GPI&#8208;related membrane proteins to facilitate protein isolation and proteomics analysis.







Abstract
Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) need to interact with other components in the cell membrane to transduce transmembrane signals. A bifunctional GPI probe was employed for photoaffinity&#8208;based proximity labelling and identification of GPI&#8208;interacting proteins in the cell membrane. This probe contained the entire core structure of GPIs and was functionalized with photoreactive diazirine and clickable alkyne to facilitate its crosslinking with proteins and attachment of an affinity tag. It was disclosed that this probe was more selective than our previously reported probe containing only a part structure of the GPI core for cell membrane incorporation and an improved probe for studying GPI&#8208;cell membrane interaction. Eighty&#8208;eight unique membrane proteins, many of which are related to GPIs/GPI&#8208;anchored proteins, were identified utilizing this probe. The proteomics dataset is a valuable resource for further analyses and data mining to find new GPI&#8208;related proteins and signalling pathways. A comparison of these results with those of our previous probe provided direct evidence for the profound impact of GPI glycan structure on its interaction with the cell membrane.

         <title>Exploring the Influence of the Phosphorus&#8208;Heteroatom Substitution in Nicotine on Its Electronic and Vibrational Spectroscopic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impacts of the phosphorus&#8208;substituted heteroatom in heterocycles on the vibrational spectroscopy and structural properties of a molecule were investigated. It was observed that phosphorus substitution in the conformationally flexible ring in addition to changing the structural and conformational properties of a molecule was able to alter the VCD patterns of these molecules.







Abstract
The influence of phosphorus substitution of nitrogen in heterocyclic compounds on the vibrational spectroscopy as well as frontier molecular orbitals are analyzed. Nicotine with two nitrogen atoms in its structure is taken as the sample system to be studied computationally. By replacing the nitrogen atom in one or both rings of this molecule with phosphorus, three nicotine derivatives are created. The vibrational circular dichroism and infrared spectra of these four molecules in their monomer state, as well as the assemblies up to trimers are determined. The aforementioned spectra are calculated using static quantum chemical calculations employing a cluster&#8208;weighted approach. The calculated gas phase spectra of nicotine are compared to their respective experimental spectra. It is observed that the nicotine derivatives with phosphorus in the methylpyrrolidine ring have considerably different gas phase and bulk phase vibrational circular dichroism spectra when compared to nicotine. The phosphorus substitution reduces the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital as well as altering the polarizability and reactivity of the investigated molecules.

         <title>Unravelling CO2 Reduction Reaction Intermediates on High Entropy Alloy Catalysts: An Interpretable Machine Learning Approach To Establish Scaling Relations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a proposed interpretable machine learning model successfully established a scaling relation among the adsorbates adsorbed on the same adsorption sites of the complex high entropy alloy catalytic surfaces through suitable features and techniques.







Abstract
Establishment of a scaling relation among the reaction intermediates is highly important but very much challenging on complex surfaces, such as surfaces of high entropy alloys (HEAs). Herein, we designed an interpretable machine learning (ML) approach to establish a scaling relation among CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) intermediates adsorbed at the same adsorption site. Local Interpretable Model&#8208;Agnostic Explanations (LIME), Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) are used for the global and local interpretation of the utilized black box models. These methods were successfully applied through an iterative way and validated on CuCoNiZnMg and CuCoNiZnSnbased HEAs data. Finally, we successfully predicted adsorption energies of *H2CO (MAE: 0.24&#8197;eV) and *H3CO (MAE: 0.23&#8197;eV) by using the *HCO training data. Similarly, adsorption energy of *O (MAE: 0.32&#8197;eV) is also predicted from *H training data. We believe that our proposed method can shift the paradigm of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ML in catalysis towards better interpretability.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H (Phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethylation of Acrylamides: Scope, Mechanism, and Critical Role of Additives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report first CuII&#8208;catalyzed Z&#8208;selective difluoromethylation of vinylic&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond of acrylamides bearing a native functional group with an in&#8208;home designed and stable electrophilic salt. The versatility of the CF2SO2Ph group was shown and mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations highlight the critical role of additives. The process was achieved under robust reaction conditions in the presence of the readily available Cu(OAc)2.







Abstract
Herein, we report the Cu&#8208;complex catalyzed, native functional group&#8208;assisted, and TFA/NMF additives promoted (phenylsulfonyl)difluoromethylation of vinylic C(sp2)&#8722;H bond of acrylamides. Using our in&#8208;home designed reagent, this reaction enables the construction of the C(sp2)&#8722;CF2SO2Ph bond from simple C&#8722;H bond activation by copper catalysis under mild reaction conditions with total Z&#8208;selectivity. The versatility of utilized fluorinated group was illustrated by its conversion into value&#8208;added CF2 moieties as well as the remarkable =CHF residue. The performed experimental and computational mechanistic studies enabled to identify the true nature of active catalyst and substrate, as well as establish critical roles of TFA and NMF additives. In this reaction, the TFA acts as a promoter of the much&#8208;needed CuII/CuII&#8594;CuIII/CuI disproportionation, while the NMF facilitates the following ligand exchange and C&#8722;C coupling processes. We ruled out the generation of radical intermediates and established the C&#8722;H activation to be irreversible and the rate&#8208;determining step of the entire process.

         <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Using Palladium Catalysts Supported on Phosphine Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd(0) immobilized a phosphine periodic mesoporous organosilica (P&#8208;PMO) catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross coupling reactions of various aryl chlorides with phenylboronic acid. The annular dark field scanning TEM (ADF&#8208;STEM) images as well as EDX analysis evidenced that a single Pd atom supported on the P&#8208;PMO surface behaves as a reactive site.







Abstract
Phosphine periodic mesoporous organosilicas (R&#8208;P&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R=Ph, tBu), which possess electron&#8208;donating alkyl substituents on the phosphorus atom, were synthesized using bifunctional compounds with alkoxysilyl&#8208; and phosphino groups, bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]phenylphosphine borane (1&#8201;a) and bis[3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propyl]&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine borane (1&#8201;b). Immobilization of Pd(0) species was performed to give R&#8208;P&#8208;Pd&#8208;PMO&#8208;TMS: R=Ph (2&#8201;a), tBu (3&#8201;a), respectively. The Pd(0) immobilized 2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a were applicable as catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions of aryl chlorides with phenylboronic acid. It was revealed that 3&#8201;a bearing more electron&#8208;donating tBu groups exhibited higher catalytic activity. Various functional groups including both electron withdrawing and donating substituents were compatible in the system. The recyclability of 3&#8201;a was examined to support its moderate utility for the recycle use.

         <title>Multifunctional UV&#8208;NIR Dual Light&#8208;Responsive Soft Actuators from a Main&#8208;Chain Azobenzene Semi&#8208;Crystalline Poly(ester&#8208;amide) Doped with Polydopamine Nanoparticles</title>

         <dc:description>
Efficient development of multifunctional photoactuators with enhanced mechanical/photomechanical properties, UV&#8208;NIR dual light&#8208;responsivity, room&#8208;temperature three&#8208;dimensional (3D) shape reprogrammability and reprocessability, and photothermal healability by simply doping polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles into main&#8208;chain azo semi&#8208;crystalline poly(ester&#8208;amide) (PEA) films is described. They are compatible with aqueous environment and exhibit photothermal deformation below the melting temperature based on a unique photothermally induced hydrogen bond&#8208;disruption mechanism.







Abstract
The development of soft photoactuators with multifunctionality and improved performance is highly important for their broad applications. Herein, we report on a facile and efficient strategy for fabricating such photoactuators with UV&#8208;NIR dual light&#8208;responsivity, room&#8208;temperature 3D shape reprogrammability and reprocessability, and photothermal healability by doping polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles into a main&#8208;chain azobenzene semi&#8208;crystalline poly(ester&#8208;amide) (PEA). The PEA/PDA nanoparticle composite was readily processed into free&#8208;standing films with enhanced mechanical and photomechanical properties compared with the blank PEA films. Its physically crosslinked uniaxially oriented films showed rapid and highly reversible photochemically induced bending/unbending under the UV/visible light irradiation at room temperature in both the air atmosphere and water. When exposed to the NIR light, they (and their bilayer films formed with a polyimide film) exhibited photothermally induced bending even at a temperature much lower than their crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic phase transition temperature based on a unique mechanism (involving photothermally induced polymer chain relaxation due to the disruption of their hydrogen bonds). The room&#8208;temperature 3D shape reprogrammability and reprocessability and photothermal healability of the composite polymer films were also demonstrated. Such multifunctional dual light&#8208;responsive photoactuators with well&#8208;balanced mechanical robustness, actuation stability, 3D shape reprogrammability/reprocessability and photothermal healability hold much promise in various photoactuating applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three unusual ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids, alsmaphylines A&#8211;C (1&#8211;3), were rapidly discovered and isolated from the stem barks and leaves of Alstonia macrophylla via a building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy.







Abstract
Three unusual ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids, alsmaphylines A&#8211;C, together with their postulated biogenetic precursors, were isolated from the stem barks and leaves of Alstonia macrophylla via the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy. Alsmaphyline A represents a rare ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloid with an S&#8208;shape polycyclic ring system. Alsmaphylines B and C are two novel ajmaline&#8208;macroline type bisindole alkaloids with N&#8208;1&#8722;C&#8208;21&#8242; linkages, and the former possesses an unconventional stacked conformation due to the presence of intramolecular noncovalent interactions. The chemical structures including absolute configurations of alsmaphylines A&#8211;C were established by comprehensive spectroscopic analyses, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. In addition, a plausible biosynthetic pathway of these bisindole alkaloids as well as their ability to promote the protein synthesis on HT22 cells were discussed.

         <title>Facile Access to Cationic Methylstannylenes and Silylenes Stabilized by E&#8722;Pt Bonding and their Methyl Group Transfer Reactivity
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt/Sn and Pt/Si heterobimetallic complexes were developed, cationic methyl stannylene was prepared by complete Me group transfer from Pt(II) to Sn under mild conditions, low valent silicon was stabilized with neutral nitrogen donor. Transmetalation from a monomethyl Pt center was triggered by hydride sources.







Abstract
We describe a family of cationic methylstannylene and chloro&#8208; and azidosilylene organoplatinum(II) complexes supported by a neutral, binucleating ligand. Methylstannylenes MeSn:+ are stabilized by coordination to PtII and are formed by facile Me group transfer from dimethyl or monomethyl PtII complexes, in the latter case triggered by concomitant B&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H, and H2 bond activation that involves hydride transfer from Sn to Pt.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pt/Sn and Pt/Si heterobimetallic complexes&lt;/b&gt; were developed, cationic methyl stannylene was prepared by complete Me group transfer from Pt&lt;sup&gt;(II)&lt;/sup&gt; to Sn under mild conditions, low valent silicon was stabilized with neutral nitrogen donor. Transmetalation from a monomethyl Pt center was triggered by hydride sources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We describe a family of cationic methylstannylene and chloro- and azidosilylene organoplatinum(II) complexes supported by a neutral, binucleating ligand. Methylstannylenes MeSn:&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are stabilized by coordination to Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and are formed by facile Me group transfer from dimethyl or monomethyl Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes, in the latter case triggered by concomitant B&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bond activation that involves hydride transfer from Sn to Pt. A cationic chlorosilylene complex was obtained by formal HCl elimination and Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; removal from HSiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; under ambient conditions. The computational studies show that stabilization of cationic methylstannylenes and cationic silylenes is achieved through weak coordination to a neutral N-donor ligand binding pocket. The analysis of the electronic potentials, as well as the Laplacian of electron density, also reveals the differences in the character of Pt&#8722;Si vs. Pt&#8722;Sn bonding. We demonstrate the importance of a ligand-supported binuclear Pt/tetrel core and weak coordination to facilitate access to tetrylium-ylidene Pt complexes, and a transmetalation approach to the synthesis of MeSn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Diterpenoids from iso&#8208;GGPP&#8197;III: A Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analog with a Shifted Double Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) analog iso&#8208;GGPP&#8197;III with a shifted double bond was synthesized and enzymatically converted with six diterpene synthases. The main products were isolated from the often complex product mixtures and structurally characterized, revealing, in several cases, the formation of compounds with novel skeletons that can be explained by the changed reactivity of the substrate analog.







Abstract
The analog of the diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate with a double bond shifted from C14=C15 to C15=C16 (named iso&#8208;GGPP&#8197;III) has been synthesized and enzymatically converted with six bacterial diterpene synthases; this allowed the isolation of nine unnatural diterpenes. For some of the enzyme&#8208;substrate combinations, the different reactivity implemented in the substrate analog iso&#8208;GGPP&#8197;III opened reaction pathways that are not observed with natural GGPP, resulting in the formation of diterpenes with novel skeletons. A stereoselective deuteration strategy was used to assign the absolute configurations of the isolated diterpenes.

         <title>Nanoflower&#8208;Like High&#8208;Entropy Co&#8208;Fe&#8208;Cr&#8208;Mo&#8208;Mn Spinel for Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key anode reaction of electrolytic water. To improve the slow OER kinetics, we synthesize nanoflower&#8208;like Co&#8208;Fe&#8208;Cr&#8208;Mo&#8208;Mn high&#8208;entropy spinel (HES) nanosheets on nickel foam (NF) by one&#8208;step solvothermal method, which exhibit an overpotential (&#951;10) of only 188 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, much lower than bimetallic CoFeOx/NF (233 mV), trimetallic CoFeCrOx/NF (211 mV), and tetrametallic CoFeCrMoOx/NF (200 mV). The OER overpotential decreases with the increase of the number of metals, indicating that the formation of HES has a positive effect on the improvement of electrocatalytic performance, since the synergistic effect between different metals enhances the charge transfer rate and decreases reaction barrier. In&#8208;situ Raman spectra demonstrate that the formation of &#947;&#8208;NiOOH on the HES surface is a crucial active species for the OER. This work demonstrates a simple and efficient synthesis method to prepare nanoflower&#8208;like high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for efficient OER electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexakispyrazolylethane: A New Strategy for Stabilization of Hexaarylethane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane (1TMS) was synthesized by the oxidative dimerization of tris(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane (2TMS). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis of 1TMS showed that the ethane C&#8211;C bond (1.623(4) &#197;) is shorter than that in hexaphenylethane (1.67(3) &#197;). In solution, 1TMS existed as a single species, contrastive that conventional hexaphenylethanes can keep the central C&#8211;C bond only by the aid of additional bridges between the two triarylmethyl units. Theoretical calculations indicated that the tris(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl radical (2H&#8226;), which is anticipated to be under equilibrium with hexakis(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane (1H), is less stable than trityl radicals due to lack of delocalization of the radicals. Furthermore, introduction of pyrazole groups allowed additional bridging between the two triarylmethyl moieties through metal coordination to the adjacent N atoms: 1TMS exhibited unique coordination to three Ag atoms affording a hexaarylethane analog bearing three N&#8211;Ag&#8211;N bridges.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Low Temperature Activity with Low N2O Emission of Stabilized Al&#8208;rich Zeolite Beta for Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low temperature activity of Fe&#8208;loaded zeolites as selective catalytic reduction of NOx by NH3 (NH3&#8208;SCR) catalysts is a critical drawback for practical application. Here, we found unexpected improvement of low temperature activity by our proposed postsynthetic treatment. An Al&#8208;rich zeolite beta (Si/Al = 5) is employed as the catalyst support, and the parent sample is dealuminated for higher hydrothermal stability, followed by the liquid&#8208;mediated stabilization treatment and impregnation. It is found that stabilized samples feature excellent low temperature activity and high N2 selectivity even for a long&#8208;term operation, along with the ability to maintain high NOx conversion after aging. The improved SCR activity should be attributed to abundant acid sites in Al&#8208;rich framework and better stabilization of monomeric iron species after the stabilization treatment. Furthermore, the low yield of side product N2O is probably due to the absence of the generation of NH4NO3 during NH3&#8208;SCR catalyzed by Fe&#8208;loaded zeolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Incorporating Photoresponses into Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous liquids combine the properties of a porous solid with those of a liquid, creating a porous flowable media. Since their discovery, these materials have gathered widespread interest within the scientific community, with substantial numbers of new systems being discovered, often with a focus on increasing the pore volume and gas capacity. Which begs the question, what does the future hold for porous liquids? Recently, the first examples of photoresponsive porous liquids have emerged, allowing changes in porosity to be observed under UV irradiation. Here, we expand on our previous report of photoresponsive porous liquids and explore the conceptualisation of responsive porous liquids and how these materials could be developed with the ability to respond to light, thereby offering a potential mechanism of controllable uptake and release in these systems. This concept article summarises different approaches that could be used to incorporate a photoresponse in a porous liquid before discussing recently reported systems, alongside important factors to consider in their design. Finally, by taking inspiration from the methods used to translate porous solids into the liquid state, combined with the field of photoresponsive materials, we discuss potential strategies that could be employed to realise further examples of photoresponsive porous liquids.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have emerged as the most promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their inherent safety, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Simultaneously, the utilization of organic electrode materials with renewable resources, environmental compatibility, and diverse structures has sparked a surge in research and development of aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). A comprehensive review is warranted to systematically present recent advancements in design principles, synthesis techniques, energy storage mechanisms, and zinc&#8208;ion storage performance of organic cathodes. In this review article, we initially summarize the energy storage mechanisms employed by aqueous ZOBs. Subsequently, we categorize organic cathode materials into small&#8208;molecule compounds and high&#8208;molecular polymers respectively. Novel polymer materials such as conjugated polymers (CPs), conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are highlighted with an overview of molecular design strategies and structural optimization based on organic cathode materials aimed at enhancing the performance of aqueous ZOBs. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by aqueous ZOBs along with future prospects to offer insights into their practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Sn Bulk Phase Doping and Surface Modification on Ti4O7 for Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We doped Sn into Ti4O7 (D&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7) by simple polymerization post&#8208;calcination method as a high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8208; ORR electrocatalyst. In addition, we also applied plain calcination after the grinding method to load Sn on Ti4O7 (L&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7) as a comparison. However, the performance of L&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7 is far inferior to that of the D&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7. D&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7 exhibits a starting potential of 0.769 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and a high H2O2 selectivity of 95.7%. Excitingly, the catalyst can maintain a stable current density of 2.43 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2 for 3600 s in our self&#8208;made H&#8208;type cell, and the cumulative H2O2 production reaches 359.2 mg&#183;L&#8208;1 within 50,000 s at 0.3 V. The performance of D&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7 is better than that of the non&#8208;noble metal 2e&#8208; ORR catalysts reported so far. The doping of Sn not only improves the conductivity but also leads to the lattice distortion of Ti4O7, further forming more oxygen vacancies and Ti3+, which greatly improves its 2e&#8208; ORR performance compared with the original Ti4O7. In contrast, since the Sn on the surface of L&#8208;Sn&#8208;Ti4O7 displays a synergistic effect with Tin+ (3 &#8804; n &#8804; 4) of Ti4O7, the active center Tin+ dissociates the O = O bond, making it more inclined to 4e&#8208; ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nickel Anchored Covalent Organic Framework as Unimolecular Metallaphotocatalyst for Visible Light Driver C&#8722;P Bond Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The urgent need to develop a sustainable and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing organophosphine compounds is underscored by their extensive applications in organic synthesis, coordination chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and photoelectric materials. Metalated covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), which seamlessly integrate the inherent photo properties of COF with the catalytic capabilities of metal ions, offer an optimal material for efficient transformation of organics sustainably. In this study, we introduce a simple COF with nickel anchorages (Bpy&#8208;COF&#8208;NiCl2) as a unimolecular metallaphotocatalytic system for effective C&#8208;P bond formation. This heterogeneous photocatalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance, achieving yields of up to 95%, and demonstrates broad substrate tolerance and functional group reactivity. Notably, the metallaphotocatalytic system has demonstrated the capability to process aryl bromides to produce the desired product, a feat not previously reported. Finally, the production and reusability test at the gram scale attests to its superior practicality for designing future organic cross&#8208;coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Bubble&#8208;Diode&#8221; Breathable Electrodes for Fast Gas Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bubbles arising from wild gas evolution commonly exist in electrochemical systems, particularly in water electrolysis and rechargeable aqueous batteries (e.g., Zn&#8208;air batteries). Substantial energy dissipation occurs due to the obstruction of active sites and ion&#8208;conducting pathways by evolving bubbles. Efforts are made to elucidate effective strategies for fast gas transport, most of which focus on minimizing bubble size and facilitating their timely detachment through complex techniques such as constructing super&#8208;hydrophilic nano&#8208;structure electrodes, flowing electrolytes, and ultrasonic oscillation. Recently, an innovative, facile, and highly efficient method utilizing a breathable electrode design to promote gaseous molecules to the external environment emerges as a promising approach since it avoids remarkable bubble accumulation while remaining free of additional accessories. This concept highlights the origin and evolution of this promising design. Starting with introducing the basic concept of traditional breathable electrodes based on hydrophobic polymer networks and discussing the current progress made in underlying mechanisms, a detailed description of the advanced design inspired by a &#8220;bubble&#8208;diode&#8221; concept with superior breathability follows. This Concept aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of this technology and paves the way for further advancements in this renewable energy era.</dc:description>

An electrocatalytic hypervalent iodine(III)&#8208;mediated in&#8208;cell synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones by C&#8722;N coupling is established, applying catalytic amounts of reagents, inexpensive electrode materials and a simple galvanostatic set&#8208;up. With this method 23 examples in yields up to 96&#8201;% could be synthesized, exhibiting various functional groups. Furthermore, a 10&#8208;fold scale&#8208;up was performed and a reaction mechanism was proposed.







Abstract
Electrochemically generated hypervalent iodine(III) species are powerful reagents for oxidative C&#8722;N coupling reactions, providing access to valuable N&#8208;heterocycles. A new electrocatalytic hypervalent iodine(III)&#8208;mediated in&#8208;cell synthesis of 1H&#8208;N&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones by dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation is presented. Catalytic amounts of the redox mediator, a low supporting electrolyte concentration and recycling of the solvent used make this method a sustainable alternative to electrochemical ex&#8208;cell or conventional approaches. Furthermore, inexpensive, readily available electrode materials and a simple galvanostatic set&#8208;up are applied. The broad functional group tolerance could be demonstrated by synthesizing 23 examples in yields up to 96&#8201;%, with one reaction being performed on a 10&#8208;fold higher scale. Based on the obtained results a sound reaction mechanism could be proposed.

         <title>Synthesis of Waixenicin A: Exploring Strategies for Nine&#8208;Membered Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full account on the development of the first total synthesis of the marine natural product waixenicin A is presented. Learning from a series of approaches which ultimately remained unsuccessful, a route relying on an intramolecular alkylation to forge the characteristic nine&#8208;membered ring of the natural product was developed.







Abstract
We present a comprehensive account on our efforts behind the recently published synthesis of waixenicin A. Our approach for constructing the dihydropyran ring relied on an Achmatowicz rearrangement. For the assembly of the nine&#8208;membered ring, four distinct strategies were investigated. Our initial attempts using radical&#8208;based addition/fragmentation reactions targeting the C7&#8722;C11 bond proved unsuitable for accessing the 6/9&#8208;bicycle. By employing anionic fragmentation conditions at the furfuryl alcohol stage, we successfully reached a 5/9&#8208;bicycle. However, subsequent ring&#8208;expansion was unsuccessful. Alternative approaches, such as Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi or Heck reactions to connect the C6&#8722;C7 bond, also encountered difficulties, with no nine&#8208;membered ring formation observed. Our first breakthrough came from our attempts to install the C5&#8722;C6 bond via an intramolecular alkylation. Surprisingly, subsequent functional group modifications proved unexpectedly challenging, necessitating a redesign of our synthetic route. Drawing from all our investigations, we concluded that construction of the C9&#8722;C10 bond would enable efficient nine&#8208;membered ring alkylation and would facilitate the installation of the desired substitution pattern along the southern periphery. Exploration of this strategy yielded further surprises but ultimately led to the successful synthesis of waixenicin A and 9&#8208;deacetoxy&#8208;14,15&#8208;deepoxyxeniculin. For the latter compound, a bioinspired one&#8208;step rearrangement to xeniafauranol A was achieved.

         <title>Enhancing Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion of Pyrene Derivatives for Photoredox Catalysis via Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highest efficient red&#8208;to&#8208;green upconversion is achieved in a TTA&#8208;UC pair consisted of PdTPTBP and pyrene derivative via molecular engineering. This pair is successfully used to activate photooxidation of aryl boronic acid under red light, and the reaction yield is greatly improved compared to green light, showing the advantage of TTA&#8208;UC in photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) has the potential to enhance photoredox catalysis yield. It includes a sensitizer and an annihilator. Efficient and stable annihilators are essential for photoredox catalysis, yet only a few examples are reported. Herein, we designed four novel pyrene annihilators (1, 2, 3 and 4) via introducing aryl&#8208;alkynyl groups onto pyrene to systematically modulate their singlet and triplet energies. Coupled with platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP), the TTA&#8208;UC efficiency is enhanced gradually as the number of aryl&#8208;alkynyl group increases. When combining 4 with palladium tetraphenyl&#8208;tetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP), we achieved the highest red&#8208;to&#8208;green upconversion efficiency (22.4&#177;0.3&#8201;%) (out of a 50&#8201;% maximum) so far. Then, this pair was used to activate photooxidation of aryl boronic acid under red light (630&#8197;nm), which achieved a great improved reaction yield compared to that activated by green light directly. The results not only provide a design strategy for efficient annihilators, but also show the advantage of applying TTA&#8208;UC into improving the photoredox catalysis yield.

         <title>A Metal&#8208;free and Operationally Simple Radical Trifluoromethylative Borylation of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and efficient protocol has been developed to generate a trifluoromethyl and boron centered radical under metal&#8208;free conditions by the synergetic interaction of highly Lewis acidic boron reagent with Togni reagent. This method establishes a new approach for the installation of trifluoromethyl and boron moiety to the unactivated alkenes simultaneously.







Abstract
We herein describe a protocol to synthesize trifluoromethylated alkyl boronates from alkenes by the mutual activation of the Togni II and the bis(catecholato)diboron reagents in the absence of any catalyst and additives. This reaction enables synthesizing a series of trifluoromethylated alkyl boronates using unactivated alkenes, including natural products and drug derivatives, in a regioselective manner. Moreover, the synthetic utility of the boronic ester present in the product allows access to a range of trifluoromethyl containing compounds. The radical trapping and gas detection experiments reveal that the more Lewis acidic diboron reagent determines the rapid formation of trifluoromethyl and boron centered radicals.

         <dc:description>
Color&#8208;changing dyes in zeolites: In free solution, deprotonated resorufin emits a bright fuchsia&#8208;colored light. As it proceeds through the pore openings of zeolite&#8208;&#946;, it picks up a proton. Confinement by the micropores allows this species to fluoresce with a bright orange light. This feature was used to investigate accessibility and diffusion (barriers) in zeolites. More information can be found in the Research Article by B.&#8197;M.

         <title>Calamitic Liquid Crystals for Reversible Light&#8208;Modulated Phase Regulation Based on Arylazopyrazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A birefringent thin film of liquid crystals based on photoswitchable arylazopyrazoles has been created. The typical schlieren structure is indicative of calamitic liquid crystals. Upon irradiation with UV light, the mesogen photoisomerizes from E to Z, and the liquid crystal instantaneously forms an isotropic liquid. Upon irradiation with green light, the mesogen photoisomerizes from Z to E, and the liquid crystal reassembles. The phase transition can be induced locally using an optical fiber. More information can be found in the Research Article by B.&#8197;J. Ravoo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302958).

The typical schlieren structure is indicative of calamitic liquid crystals. Upon irradiation with UV light, the mesogen photoisomerizes from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;, and the liquid crystal instantaneously forms an isotropic liquid. Upon irradiation with green light, the mesogen photoisomerizes from &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;, and the liquid crystal reassembles. The phase transition can be induced locally using an optical fiber. More information can be found in the Research Article by B.&#8197;J. Ravoo and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202302958"&gt;10.1002/chem.202302958&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Contemporary Applications of Thioamides and Methods for their Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioamides are naturally occurring isosteres of amide bonds in which the chalcogen atom of the carbonyl is changed from oxygen to sulfur. This substitution gives rise to altered nucleophilicity and hydrogen bonding properties with importance for both chemical reactivity and non&#8208;covalent interactions. As such, thioamides have been introduced into biologically active compounds to achieve improved target affinity and/or stability towards hydrolytic enzymes but have also been applied as probes of protein and peptide folding and dynamics. Recently, a series of new methods have been developed for the synthesis of thioamides as well as their utilization in peptide chemistry. Further, novel strategies for the incorporation of thioamides into proteins have been developed, enabling both structural and functional studies to be performed. In this Review, we highlight the recent developments in the preparation of thioamides and their applications for peptide modification and study of protein function.</dc:description>

         <title>Study on the epoxidation of chain olefins using biquaternary ammonium phosphotungstic acid phase transfer catalysts under no&#8208;solvent condition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we have developed a novel catalyst synthesized by phosphotungstic acid and a gemini quaternary ammonium cation salt. This quaternary ammonium salt not only reduces the interfacial tension between olefins and hydrogen peroxide but also forms a notably stable structure with phosphotungstic acid. Dodecene was successfully epoxidized to epoxy dodecane with a selectivity of 82.9%. The impact of initial conditions were systematically investigated such as molar ratio, temperature, reaction time, and catalyst dosage on the catalytic performance. Characterization of the catalyst morphology was performed by SEM, TEM and SAXS. Raman spectra, FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra were employed to perform the catalyst transformation during the epoxidation reaction. This catalytic mechanism study could provide the industrial application in the epoxidation of long&#8208;chain olefins.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformer aggregates exhibit dual wavelength emissions on chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based triphenylethylenes and acetone detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study on structure&#8208;property relationship has been a significant focus in the field of organic molecular luminescence. In the present work, three chiral binaphthyl&#8208;based triphenylethylene (HTPE) derivatives were prepared through condensation reactions. Despite their similar structures, these compounds exhibited distinct luminescent properties. Diphenylmethane&#8208;derived HTPE displayed dual&#8208;state emissions, characterized by dual&#8208;wavelength emissions which were insensitive to the polarity of solvents. The dual emissions in solution state could be attributed to the different locally excited (LE) excitons. However, upon aggregation, two stable conformers were generated, probably leading to different emission peaks. In contrast, dibenzocycloheptadiene&#8208;derived HTPE aggregates showed only a single emission peak. Surprisingly, fluorene&#8208;derived HTPE exhibited obvious luminescence in neither solution nor aggregate states due to inherent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. These conclusions were substantiated by X&#8208;ray analysis, spectroscopic analysis, and theory calculations. Application studies demonstrated that fluorescence on/off switches could be achieved through exposure to acetone. More importantly, trace amounts of acetone could be detected using luminescent materials in both organic and aqueous phases with a detection limit of 0.08%. Thus, this work not only presents a strategy for designing chiral triphenylethylene fluorophores but also provides valuable information for dual wavelength emissions resulting from two stable conformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Autocatalysis in Eschenmoser Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Eschenmoser coupling reaction (ECR) of thioamides with electrophiles is believed to proceed via thiirane intermediates. However, little is known about converting the intermediates into ECR products. Previous mechanistic studies involved external thiophiles to remove the sulfur atom from the intermediates. In this work, an ECR proceeding without any thiophilic agent or base is studied by electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry. ESI&#8208;MS enables the detection of the so&#8208;far elusive polysulfide species Sn, with n ranging from 2 to 16 sulfur atoms, proposed to be the key species leading to product formation. Integrating observations from ion mobility spectrometry, ion spectroscopy, and reaction monitoring via flow chemistry coupled with mass spectrometry provides a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism and uncovers the autocatalytic nature of the ECR reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral Chromium Complex with a Cr&#8801;Si Triple Bond: Synthesis and Photoinduced H&#8211;H and Benzene C&#8211;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A neutral silylyne complex with a Cr&#8801;Si triple bond was prepared by dehydrogenation of a chromium silylene complex with Cr&#8211;H and Si&#8211;H bonds, and was isolated as monomeric crystals, unlike dimeric forms of its tungsten and molybdenum congeners. The strong Cr(&#948;&#8208;)&#8211;Si(&#948; +) bond polarity was revealed by the reaction with MeOH and DFT calculations. The chromium silylyne complex reacted with H2 under LED (365 nm) irradiation to reproduce the precursor silylene complex with a (H)Cr=Si(H) moiety, as a result of 1,2&#8208;H&#8211;H addition across the Cr&#8801;Si triple bond. Similarly, the chromium silylyne complex reacted with benzene under irradiation to afford an 1,2&#8208;addition product with a (H)Cr=Si(Ph) moiety, via benzene C&#8211;H bond activation accompanied by Si&#8211;C bond forming.</dc:description>

         <title>Anode Reaction Control for a Single&#8208;Compartment Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reactor with a Surface&#8208;Activated Diamond Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2) in aqueous electrolyte solutions is attracting increasing attention for sustainable chemical production. Boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrodes have been previously shown to be very effective for the stable electrochemical production of formic acid from CO2. Typically, the electrochemical production of formic acid by CO2 reduction (CO2R) reaction is performed with a dual&#8208;compartment flow reactor equipped with a membrane separator. The problems caused by the membrane separator, such as scaling&#8208;up, complicated operational control and materials costs can be solved using a membrane free single&#8208;compartment reactor. Here we demonstrate anode reaction control for a single&#8208;compartment CO2R flow reactor using a surface&#8208;activated BDD cathode and achieve a Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production of over 70%.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a rapid, efficient, and scope&#8208;extensive approach for the late&#8208;stage electrochemical diselenation of BODIPYs. Photophysical analyses reveal red&#8208;shifted absorption &#8208; corroborated by TD&#8208;DFT and DLPNO&#8208;STEOM&#8208;CCSD computations &#8208; and color&#8208;tunable emission with large Stokes shifts in the selenium&#8208;containing derivatives compared to their precursors. In addition, due to the presence of the heavy Se atoms, competitive ISC generates triplet states which sensitize 1O2 and display phosphorescence in PMMA films at RT and in a frozen glass matrix at 77 K. Importantly, the selenium&#8208;containing BODIPYs demonstrate the ability to selectively stain lipid droplets, exhibiting distinct fluorescence in both green and red channels. This work highlights the potential of electrochemistry as an efficient method for synthesizing unique emission&#8208;tunable fluorophores with broad&#8208;ranging applications in bioimaging and related fields</dc:description>

         <title>General Construction of Asymmetric Amine Ethers via Efficient Transesterification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel method to prepare asymmetric amine ether is reported. Tertiary amine alcohol hydrogen sulfate intermediates are prepared through a reactive distillation process, followed by the transesterification process to afford eventually asymmetric amine ethers. Experiments and DFT calculations revealed the essential roles the moderately acidic sulfate group plays in the highly selective monoesterification process. This clean method is tolerant towards various functional groups with good yields under relatively rather short reaction time mild condition, which is obviously superior compared to the conventional processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Ionic Li+@C70 Endohedral Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first C70&#8208;based &#8220;ionic&#8221; endohedral fullerene, Li+@C70, was synthesized and isolated as PF6&#8722; and TFSI&#8722; salts. The 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ion pair structures were fully confirmed by spectroscopic analyses and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Optical spectroscopy as well as electrochemical measurements revealed that the encapsulated Li+ strongly stabilized the orbital energy of C70 through Coulomb interaction without changing the original energy gap and orbital degeneracy of the cage.







Abstract
Ion&#8208;endohedral&#8208;fullerene has attracted growing interest due to the unique electronic and structural characteristics arising from its distinctive ionic nature. Although there has been only one reported ion&#8208;encapsulated fullerene, Li+@C60, a significant number of fundamental and applied studies have been conducted, making a substantial impact not only in chemistry and physics but also across various interdisciplinary research fields. Nevertheless, studies on ion&#8208;endohedral fullerenes are still in their infancy due to the limitations in variety, and hence, it remains an open question how the size and symmetry of fullerene, as well as the motion and position of the encapsulated ion, affect their physical/chemical properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;endohedral [70]fullerene (Li+@C70 X&#8722;, X=PF6&#8722; and TFSI&#8722;), a novel ionic endohedral fullerene. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the encapsulation of Li+ by C70 cage as well as its ion&#8208;pair structure stabilized by external TFSI&#8722; counter anion. The encapsulated Li+ drastically lowered the orbital energy of the C70 cage by Coulomb interactions but did not affect the orbital energy gap and degeneracy. DFT studies were also performed, which supported the experimentally observed electronic effects caused by the encapsulated Li+.

         <title>A Strategy Based on &#8220;Ambident Anthracene&#8221; for the Synthesis of Higher&#8208;Order Iptycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the synthesis of higher&#8208;order iptycenes using an &#8220;ambident anthracene&#8221; building block is presented. For that purpose, an iterative elongation strategy involving the ring&#8208;opening of an endoxide to give a highly reactive anthranoxide, followed by a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with an aryne was used. The method systematically provides higher&#8208;order iptycenes, including trideciptycene, which is the longest&#8208;chain iptycene synthesized so far.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208; and Amine&#8208; Promoted Multielectron Autoredox Transformation of Nitromethane: Multicomponent Access to Thiourea Derivatives</title>

Synthesis of thioureas using elemental sulfur and nitromethane as the starting materials: multi&#8208;electron auto&#8208;redox property of nitromethane in the presence of sulfur and amines, delivering thiourea products without any added oxidant or reductant.







Abstract
Thiourea derivatives are in&#8208;demand motifs in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and material science, yet redox methods for the synthesis that start from safe, simple, inexpensive and readily available feedstocks are scarce. In this article, we disclose the synthesis of these motifs using elemental sulfur and nitromethane as the starting materials. The method harnesses the multi&#8208;electron auto&#8208;redox property of nitromethane in the presence of sulfur and amines, delivering thiourea products without any added oxidant or reductant. Extension of this reaction to cyclizable amines and/or higher homologues of nitromethane led to a wide range of nitrogen heterocycles and thioamides. Operationally simple, the reactions are scalable, tolerate a wide range of functional groups, and can be employed for the direct functionalization of natural products. Mechanistically, the nitro group was found to act as an oxidant leaving group, being reduced to ammonia whereas sulfur, along with the role of a sulfur building block for the thiocarbonyl group, behaved as a complementary reductant, being oxidized to sulfate.

         <title>B&#8208;P Coupling: Metal Stabilized Phosphinoborate Complexes</title>

Synthesis and characterization of phosphinoborate complex through B&#8208;P coupling reaction involving Ru&#8208;(&#963;&#8208;borate) species and chlorodiphenyl phosphine.







Abstract
In an effort to establish B&#8208;P coupling reactions without the use of phosphine&#8208;borane dehydrocoupling agent, we have developed a new synthetic methodology employing group&#8197;8 metal &#963;&#8208;borate complex [{&#954;3&#8208;H,S,S&#8242;&#8208;BH2L2}Ru{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,S&#8208;BH3L}] (L=NC5H4S), 1. Treatment of 1 with chlorodiphenyl phosphine (PPh2Cl) yielded 1,5&#8208;P,S chelated Ru&#8208;dihydridoborate species [PPh2H{&#954;3&#8208;H,H,S&#8208;BH(OH)L}Ru{&#954;2&#8208;P,S&#8208;(Ph2P)BH2L}], 2. The insertion of phosphine moiety (PPh2) by the cleavage of 3c&#8211;2e &#963;(Ru&#8230;H&#8208;B) bonding interaction led to the formation of B&#8208;P bond. The &#954;2&#8208;P,S chelated six&#8208;membered ring adopted a boat conformation in complex 2. The heterocycle is made of all different atoms, which is one of the rarest examples of heteroatomic ring systems. Theoretical outcomes demonstrated the electronic insight of B&#8208;P coupling and stabilization through transition metal. In order to explore an alternate route of B&#8208;P bond formation, we have further explored the reaction of 1 and Ru&#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) complex, 5 with secondary phosphine oxide (SPO). Although, thermolysis of 1 with diphenylphosphine oxide yielded analogous &#963;&#8208;borate complex 3, the similar reaction of 5 at room temperature led to the formation of novel phosphinous(III) acid incorporated Ru(&#963;&#8208;borate)(dihydridoborate) complex, 6.

&lt;p&gt;Synthesis and characterization of phosphinoborate complex through B-P coupling reaction involving Ru-(&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-borate) species and chlorodiphenyl phosphine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to establish B-P coupling reactions without the use of phosphine-borane dehydrocoupling agent, we have developed a new synthetic methodology employing group&#8197;8 metal &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-borate complex [{&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-H,S,S&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}Ru{&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;L}] (L=NC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S), &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Treatment of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with chlorodiphenyl phosphine (PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl) yielded 1,5-P,S chelated Ru-dihydridoborate species [PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H{&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-BH(OH)L}Ru{&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-(Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P)BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L}], &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. The insertion of phosphine moiety (PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by the cleavage of 3c&#8211;2e &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;(Ru&lt;sup&gt;&#8230;&lt;/sup&gt;H-B) bonding interaction led to the formation of B-P bond. The &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;-&lt;i&gt;P,S&lt;/i&gt; chelated six-membered ring adopted a boat conformation in complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. The heterocycle is made of all different atoms, which is one of the rarest examples of heteroatomic ring systems. Theoretical outcomes demonstrated the electronic insight of B-P coupling and stabilization through transition metal. In order to explore an alternate route of B-P bond formation, we have further explored the reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and Ru-bis(dihydridoborate) complex, &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; with secondary phosphine oxide (SPO). Although, thermolysis of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with diphenylphosphine oxide yielded analogous &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-borate complex &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, the similar reaction of &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; at room temperature led to the formation of novel phosphinous(III) acid incorporated Ru(&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-borate)(dihydridoborate) complex, &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;. In a similar fashion, the reaction of &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; with phosphite ligand generated Ru(&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;-borate)(dihydridoborate) complex, &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, which is analogous to &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simulating non&#8208;adiabatic dynamics of photoexcited phenyl azide: Investigating electronic and structural relaxation en route to the formation of phenyl nitrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photolysis of phenyl azide lead by coupled nuclear motion results in excited singlet photoproduct. Surface hopping simulations based on multi&#8208;reference model reveal that the second electronic excited state steers the N2 elimination, accompanied by synchronous bond elongation and angular rotation.







Abstract
Excited state molecular dynamics simulations of the photoexcited phenyl azide have been performed. The semi&#8208;classical surface hopping approximation has enabled an unconstrained analysis of the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom which contribute to the molecular dissociation of phenyl azide into phenyl nitrene and molecular nitrogen. The significance of the second singlet excited state in leading the photodissociation has been established through electronic structure calculations, based on multi&#8208;configurational schemes, and state population dynamics. The investigations on the structural dynamics have revealed the N&#8722;N bond separation to be accompanied by synchronous changes in the azide N&#8722;N&#8722;N bond angle. The 100&#8197;fs simulation results in a nitrene fragment that is electronically excited in the singlet manifold.

Direct Synthesis of Phosphoryltriacetates from White Phosphorus via Visible Light Catalysis: The reaction of P4 with &#945;&#8208;bromo esters using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 as the photocatalyst and blue LEDs (456&#8197;nm) as the light source was developed for the first time to afford a series of phosphoryltriacetates. This approach features mild reaction conditions and simple operational process without chlorination.







Abstract
Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) are widely used in many fields. However, traditional synthetic routes in the industry usually involve multistep and hazardous procedures. Therefore, it's of great significance to construct such compounds in an environmentally&#8208;friendly and facile way. Herein, a photoredox catalytic method has been developed to construct novel phosphoryltriacetates. Using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 (ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine) as the photocatalyst and blue LEDs (456&#8197;nm) as the light source, white phosphorus can react with &#945;&#8208;bromo esters smoothly to generate phosphoryltriacetates in moderate to good yields. This one&#8208;step approach features mild reaction conditions and simple operational process without chlorination.

Tripodal molecules Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 exhibited absorption in 290&#8211;480&#8197;nm range in solutions and optical bandgaps (Egopt) of 3.10&#8197;eV and 2.64&#8197;eV, respectively. Electron mobilities of 5.24&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs and 6.14&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs were obtained for Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 respectively. Excellent photocatalytic abilities of compounds were observed towards highly selective formation of benzimidazoles through the oxidative condensation between o&#8208;phenylenediamines and carboxaldehydes.







Abstract
Tripodal donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) small molecules Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 consisting of triphenyl triazine and 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide, without and with a thiophene spacer have been synthesized. Their optical and redox properties were thoroughly investigated along with their utilization as photocatalysts in organic transformations. Compounds Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 showed broad absorption in the range of 290&#8211;480&#8197;nm in solutions and 300&#8211;510&#8197;nm in thin films. These tripodal molecules displayed wide optical bandgaps of (Egopt) 3.10&#8197;eV and 2.64&#8197;eV with very deep&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels (&#8722;6.60&#8197;eV and &#8722;6.03&#8197;eV) and low&#8208;lying LUMO levels (&#8722;3.50&#8197;eV and &#8722;3.40&#8197;eV). Appreciable electron mobilities of 5.24&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs and 6.14&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs were obtained for compounds Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 respectively by space&#8208;charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Metal&#8208;free tripodal molecules Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 showed excellent photocatalytic abilities towards condensation of aromatic aldehydes and o&#8208;phenylenediamine followed by cyclization under visible light to yield benzimidazole derivatives that are of high medicinal value.

         <title>Optical Cavity Design and Functionality for Molecular Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cavity strong coupling offers prospects for showcasing captivating photochemical or photophysical phenomena. Recently, significant advancements have been made in the fabrication of microcavities specifically designed for strong coupling. The development of microcavities with multiple functions beyond simply optical resonators allows further investigation of strong coupling systems and opens the way for practical applications.







Abstract
Optical cavity/molecule strong coupling offers attractive opportunities to modulate photochemical or photophysical processes. When atoms or molecules are placed in an optical cavity, they can coherently exchange photonic energy with optical cavity vacuum fields, entering the strong coupling interaction regime. Recent work suggests that the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of molecules can be significantly changed by strong coupling, resulting in the emergence of intriguing photochemical and photophysical phenomena. As more and more physico&#8208;chemical systems are studied under strong coupling conditions, optical cavities have also advanced in their sophistication, responsiveness, and (multi)functionality. In this review, we highlight some of these recent developments, particularly focusing on Fabry&#8211;Perot microcavities.

The development of microcavities with multiple functions beyond simply optical resonators allows further investigation of strong coupling systems and opens the way for practical applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optical cavity/molecule strong coupling offers attractive opportunities to modulate photochemical or photophysical processes. When atoms or molecules are placed in an optical cavity, they can coherently exchange photonic energy with optical cavity vacuum fields, entering the strong coupling interaction regime. Recent work suggests that the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of molecules can be significantly changed by strong coupling, resulting in the emergence of intriguing photochemical and photophysical phenomena. As more and more physico-chemical systems are studied under strong coupling conditions, optical cavities have also advanced in their sophistication, responsiveness, and (multi)functionality. In this review, we highlight some of these recent developments, particularly focusing on Fabry&#8211;Perot microcavities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of N&#8208;formamides by Integrating Reductive Amination of Ketones and Aldehydes with CO2 Fixation in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru/MFM&#8208;300(Cr) was used as catalyst for the one&#8208;pot N&#8208;formylation of both aldehydes and ketones (30 substrates) in high yield. Synchrotron PXRD reveals the activation of carbonyl compounds via confined binding within MFM&#8208;300(Cr). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis and control experiments suggest formate species as the intermediate derived from the reduction of CO2 and reveal the possible reaction pathway.







Abstract
Formamides are important feedstocks for the manufacture of many fine chemicals. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesis of formamides relies on the use of an excess amount of reagents, giving copious waste and thus poor atom&#8208;economy. Here, we report the first example of direct synthesis of N&#8208;formamides by coupling two challenging reactions, namely reductive amination of carbonyl compounds, particularly biomass&#8208;derived aldehydes and ketones, and fixation of CO2 in the presence of H2 over a metal&#8208;organic framework supported ruthenium catalyst, Ru/MFM&#8208;300(Cr). Highly selective production of N&#8208;formamides has been observed for a wide range of carbonyl compounds. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction reveals the presence of strong host&#8208;guest binding interactions via hydrogen bonding and parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the catalyst and adsorbed substrates facilitating the activation of substrates and promoting selectivity to formamides. The use of multifunctional porous catalysts to integrate CO2 utilisation in the synthesis of formamide products will have a significant impact in the sustainable synthesis of feedstock chemicals.

         <title>Revisiting Peri&#8208;Aryloxyquinones: From a Forgotten Photochromic System to a Promising Tool for Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging applications of photochromic compounds demand new molecular designs that can be inspired by some longknown yet currently forgotten classes of photoswitches. In the present review, we remind the community about PeriAryloxyQuinones (PAQs) and their unique photoswitching behavior originally discovered more than 50 years ago. At the heart of this phenomenon is the light&#8208;induced migration of an aromatic moiety (arylotropy) in peri&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;substituted quinones resulting in ana&#8208;quinones. PAQs feature absorbance of both isomers in the visible spectral region, photochromism in the amorphous and crystalline state, and thermal stability of the photogenerated ana&#8208;isomer. Particularly noticeable is the high sensitivity of the ana&#8208;isomer towards nucleophiles in solution. In addition to the mechanism of molecular photochromism and the underlaying structure&#8208;switch relationships, we analyze potential applications and prospects of aryloxyquinones in optically switchable materials and devices. Due to their ability to efficiently photoswitch in the solid state, PAQs are indeed attractive candidates for such materials and devices, including electronics (optically controllable circuits, switches, transistors, memories, and displays), porous crystalline materials, crystalline actuators, photoactivated sensors, and many more. This review is intended to serve as a guide for researchers who wish to use photoswitchable PAQs in the development of new photocontrollable materials, devices, and processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards a General Access to 1&#8208;Azaspirocyclic Systems via Photoinduced, Reductive Decarboxylative Radical Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A convenient and versatile approach to important 1&#8208;azaspirocyclic systems relevant to medicinal chemistry and natural products is reported herein. The main strategy relies on a reductive decarboxylative cyclization of redox&#8208;active esters which can be rapidly assembled from abundant cyclic azaacids and tailored acceptor sidechains, with a focus on alkyne acceptors enabling the generation of useful exo&#8208;alkene moieties. Diastereoconvergent variants were studied and could be achieved either through remote stereocontrol or conformational restriction in bicyclic carbamate substrates. Two sets of metal&#8208;free photocatalytic conditions employing inexpensive eosin Y were disclosed and studied experimentally to highlight key mechanistic divergences.</dc:description>

         <title>Borirenes and Boriranes: Development and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strained compounds constitute a highly topical area of research in chemistry. Borirene and borirane both feature a BC2 three&#8208;membered ring. They can be viewed as the analogous compounds derived from cyclopropane and cyclopropene, where a CH2 unit of the carbonaceous counterparts is replaced with BH, respectively. Indeed, this structural variation introduces numerous intriguing aspects. For instance, borirane and borirene are both Lewis acidic due to the presence of a tricoordinate borane center. In addition, borirene is 2&#960; aromatic according to H&#252;ckel's rule. On the other hand, recent successful syntheses of benzoborienes and their carborane&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional analogues have introduced novel perspectives to this field. Their applications as valuable "BC2" synthons have become increasingly evident along with the newly disclosed reactivity. Additionally, the boosted Lewis acidity of carborane&#8208;fused boriranes, thanks to the potent electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of o&#8208;carborane, combined with their readiness for ring enlargement, makes them promising candidates as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks in the construction of chemically responsive luminescent materials. This review provides a summary of the synthesis and reactivity of borirene and borirane derivatives, with the aim of encouraging the design of new borierene&#8208; and borirane&#8208;based molecules and inspiring further exploration of their potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelectricity and Related Properties of Nitratecadmate(II) Hybrid with Metal&#8208;Vacancy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By substitution of NH4+ ion of a hexagonal perovskite structure with Cd2+ ion, we obtained a new metal&#8208;vacancy compound (H2dabco)2Cd(H2O)2(NO3)6. The coordination twist of the Cd&#8208;vacancy leads to instability of the lattices, structural phase transitions and excellent ferroelectricity. This result reveals that the vacancy can be utilized as an element to produce ferroelectric complexes.







Abstract
All crystals are not ideal, and many of their properties are often determined not by the regular arrangement of atoms, but by the irregular arrangement of crystal defects. Many properties of materials can be controlled effectively by proper use of solid defects. By substitution of NH4+ ion of a hexagonal perovskite structure (H2dabco)(NH4)(NO3)3 (dabco=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1) with Cd2+ ion, we obtained a new metal&#8208;vacancy compound (H2dabco)2Cd(H2O)2(NO3)6 (2).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All crystals are not ideal, and many of their properties are often determined not by the regular arrangement of atoms, but by the irregular arrangement of crystal defects. Many properties of materials can be controlled effectively by proper use of solid defects. By substitution of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion of a hexagonal perovskite structure (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dabco)(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (dabco=1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, we obtained a new metal-vacancy compound (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dabco)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cd(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;).

A comparison of the various-temperature single-crystal structures indicates that the coordination twist of Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion leads to instability of the lattices and excellent ferroelectricity. These findings reveal that the vacancy can be utilized as an element to produce ferroelectricity and may start the chemistry of metal-vacancy coordination compounds.

         <title>Polymorphism&#8208;driven Distinct Nanomechanical, Optical, Photophysical, and Conducting Properties in a Benzothiophene&#8208;quinoline</title>

Polymorphic forms of ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinolone&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate with distinct packing arrangements and interactions, vary in their nanomechanical response, photophysical, optical waveguiding, and conducting properties, highlight the significant role of polymorphism in modulating the microstructures in molecular materials and thereby their functional properties. DFT calculations on the single molecule and crystal dimorphs corroborate the experimental photophysical and conductive findings.







Abstract
Polymorphic forms of organic conjugated small molecules, with their unique molecular shapes, packing arrangements, and interaction patterns, provide an excellent opportunity to uncover how their microstructures influence their observable properties. Ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate (BZQ) exists as dimorphs with distinct crystal habits &#8211; blocks (BZB) and needles (BZN). The crystal forms differ in their molecular arrangements &#8211; BZB has a slip&#8208;stacked column&#8208;like structure in contrast to a zig&#8208;zag crystal packing with limited &#960;&#8208;overlap in BZN. The BZB crystals characterized by extended &#960;&#8208;stacking along [100] demonstrated semiconductor behavior, whereas the BZN, with its zig&#8208;zag crystal packing and limited stacking characteristics, was reckoned as an insulator. Monotropically related crystal forms also differ in their nanomechanical properties, with BZB crystals being considerably softer than BZN crystals. This discrepancy in mechanical behavior can be attributed to the distinct molecular arrangements adopted by each crystal form, resulting in unique mechanisms to relieve the strain generated during nanoindentation experiments. Waveguiding experiments on the acicular crystals of BZN revealed the passive waveguiding properties. Excitation of these crystals using a 532&#8197;nm laser confirmed the propagation of elastically scattered photons (green) and the subsequent generation of inelastically scattered (orange) photons by the crystals. Further, the dimorphs display dissimilar photoluminescence properties; they are both blue&#8208;emissive, but BZN displays twice the quantum yield of BZB. The study underscores the integral role of polymorphism in modulating the mechanical, photophysical, and conducting properties of functional molecular materials. Importantly, our findings reveal the existence of light&#8208;emitting crystal polymorphs with varying electric conductivity, a relatively scarce phenomenon in the literature.

         <title>Bisurea&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers for Tunable Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,4&#8208;Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) was used as starting material to obtain functional and desymmetrized supramolecular monomers that assemble into fibrous structures in water. The resulting supramolecular polymers are dynamic, biocompatible and stable in cellular media, which opens up the use of the UT motif to access tunable biomaterials.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble supramolecular polymers show great potential to develop dynamic biomaterials with tailored properties. Here, we elucidate the morphology, stability and dynamicity of supramolecular polymers derived from bisurea&#8208;based monomers. An accessible synthetic approach from 2,4&#8208;toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as the starting material is developed. TDI has two isocyanates that differ in intrinsic reactivity, which allows to obtain functional, desymmetrized monomers in a one&#8208;step procedure. We explore how the hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio affects the properties of the formed supramolecular polymers by increasing the number of methylene units from 10 to 12 keeping the hydrophilic hexa(ethylene glycol) constant. All bisurea&#8208;based monomers form long, fibrous structures with 3&#8211;5 monomers in the cross&#8208;section in water, indicating a proper hydrophobic\hydrophilic balance. The stability of the supramolecular polymers increases with an increasing amount of methylene units, whereas the dynamic nature of the monomers decreases. The introduction of one Cy3 dye affords modified supramolecular monomers, which co&#8208;assemble with the unmodified monomers into fibrous structures. All systems show excellent water&#8208;compatibility and no toxicity for different cell&#8208;lines. Importantly, in cell culture media, the fibrous structures remain present, highlighting the stability of these supramolecular polymers in physiological conditions. The results obtained here motivate further investigation of these bisurea&#8208;based building blocks as dynamic biomaterial.

         <title>Enzymatic Resolution and Decarboxylative Functionalization of &#945;&#8208;Sulfinyl Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic resolution of &#945;&#8208;sulfinyl esters gives recovered ester and &#945;&#8208;sulfinyl acid in high enantiomeric purity. Decarboxylative functionalization provides access to a wide range of optically active sulfoxides in both enantiomeric forms.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Sulfinyl esters can be readily prepared through thiol substitution of &#945;&#8208;bromo esters followed by oxidation to the sulfoxide. Enzymatic resolution with lipoprotein lipase provides both the unreacted esters and corresponding &#945;&#8208;sulfinyl carboxylic acids in high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Subsequent decarboxylative halogenation, dihalogenation, trihalogenation and cross&#8208;coupling gives rise to functionalized sulfoxides. The method has been applied to the asymmetric synthesis of a potent inhibitor of 15&#8208;prostaglandin dehydrogenase.

         <dc:description>Liquid crystalline&#160;nanoparticles (LC NPs) are a kind&#160;of polymer&#160;NPs&#160;with LC mesogens, which can form special anisotropic morphologies due to the influence of LC ordering.&#160;Owing to the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of the LC blocks,&#160;LC NPs show abundant&#160;morphology&#160;evolution behaviors in response to external regulation. LC NPs have&#160;great application&#160;potential in nano&#8208;devices, drug delivery, special fibers and other fields.

         <title>Aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization by Consecutive Paired Electrolysis: Dibromination of Aryl Amines with Dibromoethane at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclose a facile and efficient electrochemical method for the dibromination of aryl amines by double functionalization of aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H (both para and ortho) under metal&#8208; and external oxidant&#8208;free conditions at room temperature for the first time. The reaction is demonstrated using 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane to dibrominate a wide range of N&#8208;substituted aryl amines in a simple setup with C(+)/Pt(&#8722;) electrodes under mild reaction conditions. This transformation proceeds smoothly with a broad substrate scope affording the valuable and versatile N&#8208;substituted 2,4dibromoanilines in moderate to excellent yields with high regioselectivity. In this convergent paired electrolysis, anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction occur simultaneously to generate two intermediates, which are then coupled to furnish the product. It represents a distinctive approach to challenging redox&#8208;neutral reactions. The versatility of the electrochemical ortho&#8208;, paradibromination was reflected by unique regioselectivities for challenging aryl amines and gram&#8208;scale electrosynthesis without the use of a stoichiometric oxidant or an activating agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysical Analysis of Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Luminogens Based on Triphenylamine and Thiophene: Insights into Emission Behavior in Solution and PMMA Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) luminogens have garnered significant interest due to their distinctive applications in different applications. Among the diverse molecular architectures, those based on triphenylamine and thiophene hold prominence. However, a comprehensive understanding of the deactivation mechanism both in solution and films remains lacking. In this study, we synthesized and characterized spectroscopically two AIE luminogens: 5&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTY) and 5'&#8208;(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;[2,2'&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5&#8208;carbaldehyde (TTO). Photophysical and theoretical analyses were conducted in both solution and PMMA films to understand the deactivation mechanism of TTY and TTO. In diluted solutions, the emission behavior of TTY and TTO is influenced by the solvent, and the deactivation of the excited state can occur via Locally Excited (LE) or Planar Intramolecular Charge Transfer (PICT) state. In PMMA films, rotational and translational movements are constrained, necessitating emission solely from the LE state. Nevertheless, in the PMMA film, excimers&#8208;like structures form, resulting in the emergence of a longer wavelength band and a reduction in emission intensity. The zenith of emission intensity occurs when molecules are dispersed at higher concentrations within PMMA, effectively diminishing the likelihood of excimer&#8208;like formations. Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSC) were fabricated to validate these findings, and the optical efficiency was studied at varying concentrations of luminogen and PMMA.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The implacable rise of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere and acute water stress are one of the central challenges of our time. Present&#8208;day chemistry is strongly inclined towards more sustainable solutions. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), attributable to their structural designability with atomic precision, functionalizable chemical environment and robust extended architectures, have demonstrated promising performances in CO2 trapping and water harvesting from air. In this Review, we discuss the major developments in this field as well as sketch out the opportunities and shortcomings that remain over large&#8208;scale COF synthesis, device engineering, and long&#8208;term performance in real environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Polar covalent apex&#8208;base bonding in borapyramidanes probed by solid&#8208;state NMR and DFT calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyramidane molecules have attracted chemists for many decades due to their regular shape, high symmetry and their correspondence in the macroscopic world. Recently, experimental access to a number of examples has been reported, in particular the rarely reported square pyramidal bora[4]pyramidanes. To describe the bonding situation of the nonclassical structure of pyramidanes, we present solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) as a versatile tool for deciphering such bonding properties for three now accessible bora[4]pyramidane and dibora[5]pyramidane molecules. 11B solid&#8208;state NMR spectra indicate that the apical boron nuclei in these compounds are strongly shielded (around &#8208;50 ppm vs. BF3&#8208;Et2O complex) and possess quadrupolar coupling constants of less than 0.9 MHz pointing to a rather high local symmetry. 13C&#8208;11B spin&#8208;spin coupling constants have been explored as a measure of the bond covalency in the borapyramidanes. While the carbon&#8208;boron bond to the &#8211;B(C6F5)2 substituents of the base serves as an example for a classical covalent 2&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron (2c&#8208;2e) sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;sp2&#8208;boron &#963;&#8208;bond with 1J(13C&#8208;11B) coupling constants in the order of 75 Hz, those of the boron(apical)&#8208;carbon(basal) bonds in the pyramid are too small to measure. These results suggest that these bonds have a strongly ionic character, which is also supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking same&#8208;sign CPL: solvent effects on spectral form and racemisation kinetics in nine&#8208;coordinate chiral europium(III) complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the factors that shape the circularly polarised luminescence (CPL) emission profiles of europium(III)&#8208;based CPL emitters to have specific sign properties, e.g. monosignate individual CPL transitions, is key to design novel complexes for applications ranging from advanced security inks to bio&#8208;probes for live cell imaging. In order to correlate structure and spectral characteristics, a photophysical and kinetic investigation has been conducted on a series of coordinatively saturated nine&#8208;coordinate europium(III) systems based on 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane. 
We highlight that lanthanide emission is sensitive to changes in the ligand field by showing the linear dependence of total emission intensity ratios as a function of solvent polarity, for europium(III) complexes displaying an internal charge transfer (ICT) excited state. This sensitivity increases by a factor of 20 when studying changes in CPL spectra, rendering these complexes accurate probes of local polarity. Solvent polarity, solvent&#8208;specific effects, and the nature of the chromophores&#8217; coordinating donor atoms strongly influence the kinetic stability of europium(III) complexes with respect to enantiomer interconversion. Notably, we show that the choice of donor groups to coordinating to europium(III) and the nature and polarity of the solvent affects the rate of racemisation, leading to very long half&#8208;lives at room temperature in non&#8208;polar media.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling pH&#8208;Sensitive Chemical Reactions Pathways with Light &#8208; a Tale of Two Photobases: an Arrhenius and a Br&#248;nsted</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;gated chemical reactions allow spatial and temporal control of chemical processes. Here, we suggest a new system for controlling pH&#8208;sensitive processes with light using two photobases of Arrhenius and Br&#248;nsted types. Only after light excitation do Arrhenius photobases undergo hydroxide ion dissociation, while Br&#248;nsted photobases capture a proton. However, none can be used alone to reversibly control pH due to the limitations arising from excessively fast or overly slow photoreaction timescales. We show here that combining the two types of photobases allows light&#8208;triggered and reversible pH control. We show an application of this method in directing the pH&#8208;dependent reaction pathways of the organic dye Alizarin Red S simply by switching between different wavelengths of light, i.e., irradiating each photobase separately. The concept of a light&#8208;controlled system shown here of a sophisticated interplay between two photobases can be integrated into various smart functional and dynamic systems.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Light-gated chemical reactions allow spatial and temporal control of chemical processes. Here, we suggest a new system for controlling pH-sensitive processes with light using two photobases of Arrhenius and Br&#248;nsted types. Only after light excitation do Arrhenius photobases undergo hydroxide ion dissociation, while Br&#248;nsted photobases capture a proton. However, none can be used alone to reversibly control pH due to the limitations arising from excessively fast or overly slow photoreaction timescales. We show here that combining the two types of photobases allows light-triggered and reversible pH control.

         <title>Signal Transduction Allows Temporal Control of the Potential of a Concentration Cell Driven by the Decarboxylation of an Activated Carboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of Activated Carboxylic Acids (ACAs) allows the time&#8208;controlled operation of dissipative chemical systems based on the acid&#8208;base reaction by providing both the stimulus that temporarily drives a physicochemical change and, subsequently, the counter&#8208;stimulus with a single reagent addition. However, their application is inherently limited to acid&#8208;sensitive systems. To overcome this limitation, we herein develop a straightforward device for the transduction of the acid&#8208;base stimuli delivered by an ACA into a voltage signal that, in turn, is used to control voltage&#8209;sensitive circuits that are not pH&#8209;responsive by themselves. The signal transductor can be easily assembled from common laboratory equipment and employs aqueous solutions of readily available chemicals. Furthermore, the operator can simply and intuitively tune the amplitude of the voltage signal, as well as its duration and offset by varying the concentration of the chemical species involved in the transduction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydroamination of Triisopropylsilyl Acetylene Sulfur Pentafluoride &#8208; a Bench&#8208;top Route to Pentafluorosulfanylated Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic access to a variety of aliphatic and vinylic pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks remains a major challenge in contemporary organofluorine chemistry hampering its investigation in the context of medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and functional materials. Herein, we report a bench&#8208;top protocol to access the virtually unknown class of &#945;&#8208;SF5&#8208;enamines under mild reaction conditions in good to excellent yields (up to 95%). This reaction combines the protodesilylation of the commercially available precursor TASP with the in&#8208;situ hydroamination of HC&#8801;C&#8208;SF5. The on&#8208;site use of highly toxic gases or corrosive reagents is avoided, making access to this motif applicable to a wide chemical audience. The excellent E&#8208;diastereoselectivity of this two&#8208;step cascade reaction is suggested to be the result of the convergence of the fast Z&#8208;/E&#8208; isomerization of a vinyl anion as well as the isomerization of the iminium ion. The remarkable thermal stability of these SF5&#8208;enamines encourages further studies of their synthetic utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating the Structure&#8208;property Relationships of Two Cd&#8208;based Hybrid Multifunctional Compounds with High Tc, Bright Fluorescence and Wide Band&#8208;gap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional materials have shown significant application in lighting and sensor fields, owing to their prominent performance and diversity structures. Herein, we synthesized two multifunctional compounds: (propyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (1) and (F&#8208;butyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (2). By introducing light&#8208;emitting organic cation with flexible long chain, 1 and 2 exhibit excellent transition properties and bright blue&#8208;white fluorescence. Then, combine fluorescence lifetime and first&#8208;principal calculation, providing evidence for the electron transfer emission. Subsequently, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8208;C to C&#8208;F) and halide framework (Cl to I) on the fluorescence properties. Results indicate that Cd&#183;&#183;&#183;Cd distance and structural rigidity play an important role in fluorescence. Overall, our research provides valuable insight and example for chemical modifications enhance compound performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this concept, we showcase the upsurge in the studies of dynamic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials containing inorganic and/or organic components as versatile photo&#8208;responsive platforms. The goal is to provide a comprehensive analysis of photo&#8208;controllable RTP, and meanwhile delve into the underlying RTP properties of various classes of photochromic materials including metal&#8211;organic complexes, organic&#8208;inorganic co&#8208;crystals, purely organic small molecules and organic polymers. In particular, the design principles governing the integration of the photochromic and RTP moieties within a single material system, and the tuning of dynamic RTP in response to light are emphasized. As such, this concept sheds light on the challenges and opportunities of using these tunable RTP materials for potential applications in optoelectronics, particularly highlighting their use of reversible information encryption, erasable light printing and rewritable smart paper.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence color change of supramolecular polymer networks controlled by crown ether&#8208;cation recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) system based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition. The polymer side chains bear ammonium cations, which can be recognized by host molecules with a B15C5 unit and a quinoline group at each end. The quinoline group makes the host molecule exhibit blue fluorescence. After the formation of SPNs, the recognition of the crown ether&#8208;cation transforms the blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence. The accompanying fluorescence color change during the formation of SPNs makes it with potential applications in the fields of display, printing, information storage, and bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst, in which the photosensitizer and the transition metal site are close to each other, is important for improving the efficiency of metallaphotoredox catalysis. However, the development of convenient synthetic strategies for the precise construction of an all&#8208;in&#8208;one catalyst remains a challenging task due to the requirement of precise installation of the catalytic sites. Herein, we have successfully established a facile bottom&#8208;up strategy for the direct synthesis of Ni(II)&#8208;incorporated covalent organic framework (COF), named LZU&#8208;713@Ni, as a versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one metallaphotoredox catalyst. LZU&#8208;713@Ni showed excellent activity and recyclability in the photoredox/nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;O, C&#8208;S, and C&#8208;P cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Notably, this catalyst displayed a better catalytic activity than its homogeneous analogues, physically mixed dual catalyst system, and, especially, LZU&#8208;713/Ni which was prepared through post&#8208;synthetic modification. The improved catalytic efficiency of LZU&#8208;713@Ni should be attributed to the implementation of bottom&#8208;up strategy, which incorporated the fixed, ordered, and abundant catalytic sites into its framework. This work sheds new light on the exploration of concise and effective strategies for the construction of multifunctional COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Radiolabelled&#160;177Lu&#8208;Bispidine&#8208;Trastuzumab for Targeting Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Positive Cancers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radioimmunotherapy (TRIT) is a promising alternative to conventional treatment options. Here,&#160;we present experimental work on the synthesis, radiochemistry, and&#160;in vivo&#160;performance of a lanthanide&#8208;selective nonadentate bispidine ligand suitable for&#160;177Lu3+&#160;ion complexation. The ligand (bisp,1) was derivatised with a photoactivatable aryl azide (ArN3) group as a bioconjugation handle for light&#8208;induced labelling of proteins. Quantitative radiosynthesis of [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1+&#160;was accomplished in 10 minutes at 40oC. Subsequent incubation [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1+&#160;with trastuzumab, followed by irradiation with light at 365 nm for 15 min, at room temperature and pH8.0&#8211;8.3, gave the radiolabelled mAb, [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;azepin&#8208;trastuzumab ([177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;mAb) in a decay&#8208;corrected radiochemical yield of 14%, and radiochemical purity (RCP)&gt;90%. Stability studies and cellular binding assays&#160;in vitro&#160;using the SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 human ovarian cancer cells confirmed that [177Lu]Lu&#8208;1&#8208;mAb remained biological active and displayed specific binding to HER2/neu. Experiments in immunocompromised female athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous xenograft models of SK&#8208;OV&#8208;3 tumours revealed significantly higher tumour uptake in the normal group compared with the control block group (29.8&#177;11.4%ID g&#8208;1&#160;vs. 14.8&#177;6.1%ID g&#8208;1, respectively;&#160;P&#8208;value=0.037). The data indicate that bispidine&#8208;based ligand systems are suitable starting points for constructing novel, high&#8208;denticity chelators for specific complexation of larger radiotheranostic metal ion nuclides.</dc:description>

         <title>The impact of stoichiometry on the initial steps of crystal formation: Stability and lifetime of charged triple&#8208;ion complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minerals form in nature from solutions with varying ratios of their lattice ions, yet non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions have generally been overlooked in investigations of new formation (nucleation) of ionic crystals. Here, we investigated the influence of cation:anion&#8208;ratio in the solution on the initial steps of nucleation by studying positively and negatively charged triple ion complexes and subsequent particle size evolution. Our model systems are carbonates and sulfates of calcium and barium, as it was recently shown that solution stoichiometry affects the timing and rate of their nucleation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and dynamic light scattering (DLS) flow experiments show that nucleation correlates with the stability and lifetime of the initial complexes, which were significantly impacted by the cation:anion stoichiometry and ion type. Specifically, Ba(SO4)22&#8208; had higher association constants and its lifetime was twofold longer than Ba2SO42+. Similar trends were observed for BaCO3 and CaSO4. Contrastingly, for CaCO3, Ca(CO3)22&#8208; had lower association constants and its lifetime was shorter than Ca2CO32+. These trends in stability and lifetime follow the same asymmetrical behaviour as observed experimentally for particle formation using techniques like DLS. This suggests a causal relationship between the stability and lifetime of the initial charged complexes and the nucleation under non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclometalatedgold(III)&#8208;hydride under oriented external electric fields: a new strategy to modulate its reactivity?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selected gold complexes have been regarded as promising anti&#8208;cancer agents because they can bind with protein targets containing thiol or selenol moieties, but their clinical applications were hindered by the unbiased binding towards off&#8208;target thiol&#8208;proteins. Recently, a novel gold(III)&#8208;hydride complex (abbreviated as 1) with visible light&#8208;induced thiol reactivity has been reported as potent photo&#8208;activated anticancer agents (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2020, 132, 11139). To explore new strategies to stimuli this potential antitumor drug, the effect of oriented external electric fields (OEEFs) on its geometric structure, electronic properties, and chemical reactivity was systematically investigated. Results reveal that imposing external electric fields along the Au&#8208;H bond of 1 can effectively activate this bond, which is conducive to its dissociation and the binding of Au site to potential targets. Hence, this study provides a new OEEF&#8208;strategy to activate this reported gold(III)&#8208;hydride, revealing its potential application in electrochemical therapy. We anticipate this work could promote the development of more electric field&#8208;activated anticancer agents. However, further experimental research should be conducted to verify the conclusions obtained in this work.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating Efficient Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials with Cyano&#8208;Substituted 11,12&#8208;Diphenyldipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2',3'&#8208;c]phenazine Acceptors</title>

         <dc:description>Red luminescent materials are essential components for full color display and white lightening based on organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology, but the extension of emission color towards red or deep red region generally leads to decreased photoluminescence and electroluminescence efficiencies. Herein, we wish to report two new luminescent molecules (2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA) consisting of cyano&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;diphenyldipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2',3'&#8208;c]phenazine acceptors and triphenylamine donors. As the increase of cyano substituents, the emission wavelength is greatly red&#8208;shifted and the reverse intersystem crossing process is promoted, resulting in strong red delayed fluorescence. Meanwhile, due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the molecular structures become rigidified and planarized, which brings about large horizontal dipole ratios. As a result, 2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA can perform as emitters efficiently in OLEDs, furnishing excellent external quantum efficiencies of 28.8% at 616 nm and 20.4% at 648 nm, which are significantly improved in comparison with that of the control molecule without cyano substituents. The findings in this work demonstrate that the introduction of cyano substituents to the acceptors of delayed fluorescence molecules could be a facile and effective approach to explore high&#8208;efficiency red or deep red delayed fluorescence materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scalable [3+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and in situ generated unstabilized azomethine ylide is reported for the first time. The selective formation of either 1:1 or 1:2 cycloaddition products was achieved by carefully optimizing the reaction conditions, mainly by controlling the reactant stoichiometry, catalyst loading, and internal temperature. The developed protocol tolerated many valuable functional groups, including TMS, protected alcohol (as ether or THP derivatives), or aldehyde (as acetal). Further common C&#8211;C and C &#8211; heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, as well as scaled&#8208;up procedures demonstrate the utility of the prepared compounds as building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting the Antifungal Activity of Carbon Dots against Candida albicans&#160;Biofilm Formation by Tailoring Their Surface Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) are an emerging class of carbon nanoparticles, which for their characteristics have found applications in many fields such as catalysis, materials and biomedicine. Within this context, the application of CDs as antibacterial agents has received much attention in very recent years, while their use as antifungal nanoparticles has been scarcely investigated. Here we report a systematic investigation of the surface functional groups of CDs to study their influence on these nanoparticles&#8217; against Candida albicans. Three classes of CDs have been synthesised and fully characterized. A thorough in vitro and in vivo biological screening against C. albicans was performed to test their antifungal, antiadhesion and antibiofilm formation activities. Moreover, the interaction with C. albicans cells was investigated by microscopic analysis. Our results evidence how the presence of a positively polarised surface results crucial for the internalization into COS&#8208;7 cells. Positively charged nanoparticles were also able to inhibit adhesion and biofilm formation, to interact with the cellular membrane of C. albicans, and to increase the survival of G. mellonella infected larvae after the injection with positive nanoparticles. The antifungal activity of CDs and their extremely low toxicity may represent a new strategy to combat infections sustained by C.albicans.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Alkyl&#8208;Locked Axial Chirality Scaffold by Restriction of Molecular Motions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boosting the circularly polarized luminescence of small organic molecules has been a stubborn challenge because of weak structure rigidity and dynamic molecular motions. To investigate and eliminate these factors, here, we carried out the structure&#8208;property relationship studies on a newly&#8208;developed axial chiral scaffold of bidibenzo[b,d]furan. The molecular rigidity was finely tuned by gradually reducing the alkyl&#8208;chain length. The environmental factors were considered in solution, crystal, and polymer matrix at different temperatures. As a result, a significant amplification of the dissymmetry factor glum from 10&#8208;4 to 10&#8208;1 was achieved, corresponding to the situation from (R)&#8208;4C in solution to (R)&#8208;1C in polymer film at room temperature. A synergistic strategy of increasing the intramolecular rigidity and enhancing the intermolecular interaction to restrict the molecular motions was thus proposed to improve circularly polarized luminescence. The though&#8208;out demonstrated relationship will be of great importance for the development of high&#8208;performance small organic chiroptical systems in the future.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Boosting the circularly polarized luminescence of small organic molecules has been a stubborn challenge because of weak structure rigidity and dynamic molecular motions. To investigate and eliminate these factors, here, we carried out the structure-property relationship studies on a newly-developed axial chiral scaffold of bidibenzo[b,d]furan. The molecular rigidity was finely tuned by gradually reducing the alkyl-chain length. The environmental factors were considered in solution, crystal, and polymer matrix at different temperatures. As a result, a significant amplification of the dissymmetry factor glum from 10-4 to 10-1 was achieved, corresponding to the situation from (R)-4C in solution to (R)-1C in polymer film at room temperature. A synergistic strategy of increasing the intramolecular rigidity and enhancing the intermolecular interaction to restrict the molecular motions was thus proposed to improve circularly polarized luminescence. The though-out demonstrated relationship will be of great importance for the development of high-performance small organic chiroptical systems in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
