         <title>Biasing the Formation of Solution&#8208;Unstable Intermediates in Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the reversible nature of coordination bonds and solvation effect, coordination self&#8208;assembly pathways are often difficult to elucidate experimentally in solution, as intermediates and products are in constant equilibration. Herein, we showed that some of these transient and high&#8208;energy self&#8208;assembly intermediates can be accessed by means of ball&#8208;milling approaches. Among them, highly aqueous&#8208;unstable Pd3L11 and Pd6L14 open&#8208;cage intermediates of the framed Fujita Pd6L14 cage and Pd2L22, Pd3L21 and Pd4L22 intermediates of Mukherjee Pd6L24 capsule are successfully trapped in solid&#8208;state, where L1 = 2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and L2 = 1,3,5&#8208;tris(1&#8208;imidazolyl)benzene). Their structures are assigned by a combination of solution&#8208;based characterization tools such as standard NMR spectroscopy, DOSY NMR, ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Collectively, our result highlights the opportunity of using mechanochemistry to access unique chemical space with vastly different reactivity compared to conventional solution&#8208;based supramolecular self&#8208;assembly reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of Crystallinity and Stability in &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high chemical stability pose significant challenges for practical applications. Although a growing number of robust COFs have been developed and employed for a broad scope of applications, the assessment of COF stability has primarily relied on qualitative descriptions, lacking a rational and quantitative assessment. Herein, we for the first time present a novel assessment method that enables visual and quantitative depiction of COF stability. By analyzing the PXRD patterns of chemically stable &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;based COFs (KEA&#8208;COFs), we establish two crystallinity&#8208;dependent parameters, the relative intensity (I2&#952;rel) and the relative area (A2&#952;rel) of the main peak (2&#952;), which are expected to establish a standardized criterion for assessing COF crystallinity. Based on these parameters, the crystalline changes after stability tests can be visually presented, which provides a rational and quantitative assessment of their stability. This study not only demonstrates the remarkable chemical stability of KEA&#8208;COFs, but also provides valuable insights into the quantitative evaluation of COFs&#8217;crystallinity and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomatization of C6 Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Main Group Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomatization of C6 aromatic hydrocarbons by low&#8208;valent main group compounds represent an attractive gateway toward their functionalization for stoichiometric transformations and catalytic applications. This review is aimed to cover the different pathways in C6 aromatic hydrocarbon activation that have been achieved in the past few decades.







Abstract
The dearomatization reaction is a powerful method for transformation of simple aromatic compounds to unique chemical architectures rapidly in synthetic chemistry. Over the past decades, the chemistry in this field has evolved significantly and various important organic compounds such as crucial bioactive molecules have been synthesized through dearomatization. In general, photochemical conditions or assistance by transition metals are required for dearomatization of rigid arenes. Recently, main&#8208;group elements, especially naturally abundant elements in the Earth's crust, have attracted attention as they have low toxicity and are cost&#8208;effective compared to the late transition metals. In recent decades, a variety of low&#8208;valent main&#8208;group molecules, which enable the activation of stable aromatic compounds under mild conditions, have been developed. This minireview highlights the developments in the chemistry of dearomatization of C6 aromatic hydrocarbons by main&#8208;group compounds leading to the formation of seven&#8208;membered EC6 (E=main&#8208;group elements) ring or cycloaddition products.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer in Luminescent Dyes: From Theoretical Insight to Experimental Evidence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To ESPT, or not to ESPT: Efficient use of luminescent dyes requires understanding their excitation and relaxation pathways like Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT). Experimental demonstration is challenging due to competing phenomena. A holistic approach, merging experimental results, computational analysis, and diverse mechanism assessment, is vital for ESPT verification, affecting molecular probes, sensors, and related applications.







Abstract
The effective utilization of luminescent dyes often relies on a comprehensive understanding of their excitation and relaxation pathways. One such pathway, Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT), involves the tautomerization of the dye in its excited state, resulting in a new structure that exhibits distinct emission properties, such as a very large Stokes&#8242; shift or dual&#8208;emission. Although the ESPT phenomenon is well&#8208;explained theoretically, its experimental demonstration can be challenging due to the presence of numerous other phenomena that can yield similar experimental observations. In this review, we propose that an all&#8208;encompassing methodology, integrating experimental findings, computational analyses, and a thorough evaluation of diverse mechanisms, is essential for verifying the occurrence of ESPT in luminescent dyes. Investigations have offered significant understanding of the elements impacting the ESPT process and the array of approaches that can be used to validate the existence of ESPT. These discoveries hold crucial ramifications for the advancement of molecular probes, sensors, and other applications that depend on ESPT as a detection mechanism.

         <title>Comparative Study on Proton Conductivity and Mechanism Analysis of Two Imidazole Modified Imine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonding on the proton conductivity of COFs was investigated. It was shown that the extrinsic proton carriers could increase the proton conductivity of DaTta, which originally had negligible proton conductivity due to intramolecular hydrogen bonds, to 0.91&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 100&#8201;&#176;C/98&#8201;% RH by breaking the intramolecular H&#8208;bonds.







Abstract
This work elucidates the potential impact of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore walls of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on proton conductivity. Employing DaTta and TaTta as representative hosts, it was observed that their innate proton conductivities (&#963;) are both unsatisfactory and &#963;(DaTta)&lt;&#963;(TaTta). Intriguingly, the performance of both imidazole&#8208;loaded products, Im@DaTta and Im@TaTta is greatly improved, and the &#963; of Im@DaTta (0.91&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) even surpasses that of Im@TaTta (3.73&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) under 100&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity. The structural analysis, gas adsorption tests, and activation energy calculations forecast the influence of imidazole on the H&#8208;bonded system within the framework, leading to observed changes in proton conductivity. It is hypothesized that intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the COF framework impede efficient proton transmission. Nevertheless, the inclusion of an imidazole group disrupts these intramolecular bonds, leading to the formation of an abundance of intermolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore channels, thus contributing to a dramatic increase in proton conductivity. The related calculation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) provides further evidence for this inference.

         <title>Interaction Between the Transferrin Protein and Plutonium (and Thorium), What's New?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalloprotein: With a toolbox of X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, this work sheds light on the binding interaction of plutonium and thorium (early actinides at oxidation state +IV) with iron transport transferrin protein and its tertiary structure.







Abstract
Transferrin (Tf) is a glycoprotein that transports iron from the serum to the various organs. Several studies have highlighted that Tf can interact with metals other than Fe(III), including actinides that are chemical and radiological toxics. We propose here to report on the behavior of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) in comparison with Fe(III) upon Tf complexation. We considered UV&#8208;Vis and IR data of the M2Tf complex (M=Fe, Th, Pu) and combined experimental EXAFS data with MD models. EXAFS data of the first M&#8722;O coordination sphere are consistent with the MD model considering 1 synergistic carbonate. Further EXAFS data analysis strongly suggests that contamination by Th/Pu colloids seems to occur upon Tf complexation, but it seems limited. SAXS data have also been recorded for all complexes and also after the addition of Deferoxamine&#8208;B (DFOB) in the medium. The Rg values are very close for apoTf, ThTf and PuTf, but slightly larger than for holoTf. Data suggest that the structure of the protein is more ellipsoidal than spherical, with a flattened oblate form. From this data, the following order of conformation size might be considered:holoTf&lt;M2Tf (M=Th, Pu)&lt;apoTf&lt;M2Tf&#8208;DFOB (M=Fe, Th, Pu).

         <title>Platinum(IV)&#8211;Gold(I) Agents with Promising Anticancer Activity: Selected Studies in 2D and 3D Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer Models</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two are better than one, heterometallic anticancer agents continue to impress: A Platinum(IV)&#8211;gold(I) agent inhibits several TNBC cancer hallmarks with no decreased drug sensitivity in 3D spheroids versus 2D cell culture models, inhibiting thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in cells at concentrations five times lower than the IC50 value.







Abstract
New heterometallic binuclear and trinuclear platinum(IV)&#8211;gold(I) compounds of the type [Pt(L)nCl2(OH){(OOC&#8208;4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;PPh2)AuCl}x] (L=NH3, n=2; x=1, 2; L=diaminocyclohexane, DACH, n=1; x=2) are described. These compounds are cytotoxic and selective against a small panel of renal, bladder, ovarian, and breast cancer cell lines. We selected a trinuclear PtAu2 compound containing the PtIV core based on oxaliplatin, to further investigate its cell&#8208;death pathway, cell and organelle uptake and anticancer effects against the triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8197;cell line. This compound induces apoptosis and accumulates mainly in the nucleus and mitochondria. It also exerts remarkable antimigratory and antiangiogenic properties, and has a potent cytotoxic effect against TNBC 3D spheroids. Trinuclear compounds do not seem to display relevant interactions with calf thymus (CT) DNA and plasmid (pBR322) even in the presence of reducing agents, but inhibit pro&#8208;angiogenic enzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in TNBC cells.

         <dc:description>
A ferrocene&#8208;based tetradentate ligand featured with modular synthesis and rigid skeleton was reported. Its iron(II) complex facilitates asymmetric direct hydrogenation of ketones without the participation of extra strong&#8208;field ligand such as CO and isocyanide. Various chiral alcohols including the intermediate for montelukast could be prepared with satisfactory yields and enantioinduction.







Abstract
We herein reported the design and synthesis of a ferrocene&#8208;based tetradentate ligand that is featured with modular synthesis and rigid skeleton. Its iron(II) complex facilitates asymmetric direct hydrogenation of ketones without the participation of extra strong&#8208;field ligand such as CO and isocyanide. Hydride donor lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) converted non&#8208;reactive Fe(II) species to reactive Fe(II) hydride species. With this catalyst, various chiral alcohols including the intermediate for montelukast could be prepared with satisfactory yields and enantioinduction.

         <title>Direct Amination of Benzene with Ammonia by Flow Plasma Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct amination of benzene is demonstrated with a plasma microreactor. Using ammonia plasma, this process was optimized by studying the influence of temperature, residence time and power of the plasma. Various compounds were evaluated to study influence of double bond, conjugation, and aromaticity. Under optimized conditions, direct amination of benzene gave of total yield of 3.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Amine derivatives, including aniline and allylic amines, can be formed in a single&#8208;step process from benzene and an ammonia plasma in a microreactor. Different process parameters such as temperature, residence time, and plasma power were evaluated to improve the reaction yield and its selectivity toward aminated products and avoid hydrogenated or oligomerized products. In parallel, simulation studies of the process have been carried out to propose a global mechanism and gain a better understanding of the influence of the different process parameters. The exploration of diverse related alkenes showed that the double bonds, conjugation, and aromatization influenced the amination mechanism. Benzene was the best reactant for amination based on the lifetime of radical intermediates. Under optimized conditions, benzene was aminated in the absence of catalyst with a yield of 3.8&#8201;% and a selectivity of 49&#8201;% in various amino compounds.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Three&#8208;Component Tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;heteroarylation of Alkenes with 1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetrafluoroethanesulfonyl Chloride and Quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones</title>

         <dc:description>
A convenient three&#8208;component tetrafluoroethylation reaction of alkenes induced by visible light has been developed using 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethylsulfonyl chloride and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This method provides a facile approach to introduce the HCF2CF2 group into organic molecules under mild conditions, enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active and drug molecules.







Abstract
1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;containing compounds are valuable structures due to their unique physicochemical properties, which have increasing potential application in drug discovery. However, synthetic methods for preparing such compounds are rare. Herein, we report the first use of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethanesulfonyl chloride to introduce the HCF2CF2 group into organic molecules via a three&#8208;component, radical tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;heteroarylation of alkenes with readily available quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This method provides a new and facile approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of potential biologically active molecules.

         <title>Spontaneous Decoration of Ultrasmall Pt Nanoparticles on Size&#8208;Separated MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Size of liquid exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets plays a crucial role in determining nanoparticle decoration densities in the spontaneous reduction of chloroplatinic acid into ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles.







Abstract
Liquid exfoliation can be considered as a viable approach for the scalable production of 2D materials due to its various benefits, although the polydispersity in the obtained nanosheet size hinders their straightforward incorporation. Size&#8208;separation can help alleviate these concerns, however a correlation between nanosheet size and property needs to be established to bring about size&#8208;specific applicability. Herein, size&#8208;selected aqueous nanosheet dispersions have been obtained via centrifugation&#8208;based protocols, and their chemical activity in the spontaneous reduction of chloroplatinic acid is investigated. Growth of ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles was achieved on nanosheet surfaces without a need for reducing agents, and stark differences in the nanoparticle coverage were observed as a function of nanosheet size. Defects in the nanosheets were probed via Raman spectroscopy, and correlated to the observed size&#8208;activity. Additionally, the effect of reaction temperature during synthesis was investigated. The electrochemical activity of the ultrasmall Pt nanoparticle decorated MoS2 nanosheets was evaluated for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and enhancement in performance was observed with nanosheet size, and nanoparticle decoration density. These findings shine light on the significance of nanosheet size in controlling spontaneous reduction reactions, and provide a deeper insight to intrinsic properties of liquid exfoliated nanosheets.

         <title>Revisiting sp2 Dilithio Methandiides: From Geometric Curiosity to Simple Bonding Description</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intriguing tetracoordinate geometry of a dilithio methandiide complex is probed from a coordination chemistry perspective, demonstrating the sp2&#8208;hybridized nature of the methandiide carbon and the other (non&#8208;covalent) interactions responsible for its planarity.







Abstract
The reported tetracoordinate dilithio methandiide complex from Liddle and co&#8208;workers (1) is investigated from a coordination chemistry perspective, to probe the origin of its intriguing geometry. Through the application of a variety of computational techniques, non&#8208;covalent (steric, electrostatic) interactions are found to be dominant. Further, we arrive at a bonding description which emphasizes the tricoordinate sp2&#8208;hybridized nature of the central methandiide carbon, differing somewhat from the original proposal. Thus, 1 is distinct from other dilithio methandiides since it contains only one C&#8722;Li &#963;&#8208;bond, and is found to be comparable to a simple aryllithium compound, phenyllithium.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome lattice: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2D covalent organic frameworks with kagome (kgm) topology are a promising class of crystalline frameworks that possess both triangular micropores and hexagonal mesopores. These dual&#8208;pore structures enable kgm COFs to exhibit unique advantages in selective separation, mass transfer, and targeted drug release. However, the synthesis of 2D kgm COFs has been hindered by the reliance on empirical methods. In this review, we systematically summarize the conventional macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;framework strategy, typical [4+2] co&#8208;polymerization synthetic strategy, and bifunctional molecules self&#8208;condensation approach for constructing 2D kgm COFs. We also survey the factors influencing formation of kgm lattice such as monomer type, solvent polarity, substrate concentration, etc., and highlight the representative examples on targeted synthesis. Additionally, we summarize the applications of 2D kgm COFs and the relationships between structure and performances. Finally, we propose key fundamental perspectives to accelerate the further development of this intriguing material.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel Phosphonate MOF Derived N&#8208;doped Carbon&#8208;coated Phosphorus&#8208;vacancies&#8208;rich Ni2P Particles as Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of non&#8208;noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts with outstanding performance and remarkable stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the most essential issue to the realization of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery and transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as robust candidates for oxygen electrocatalysts. Herein, N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated phosphorus&#8208;vacancies&#8208;rich Ni2P particles (Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC) is proposed via simple carbonization and following Ar plasma treatment from a single nickel phosphonate metal organic framework (MOF) without extra phosphine and nitrogen sources. The facile and rapid plasma treatment can achieve phosphorus vacancies which could modulate the electronic structure to enhance the inherent active and electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the pyridine&#8208;N and graphitized&#8208;N produced during calcination also could provide more active sites and increase the electrical conductivity. The resultant Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC catalyst shows excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity (OER/ORR) based on synergistic effect of introducing P vacancies into Ni2P and N&#8208;doped carbon. Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC catalyst shows more advantageous &#916;E value (0.70 V) compared to Pt/C + RuO2 (0.73 V) and most reported catalysts. Additionally, the Zinc&#8208;Air Batterie (ZAB) employing Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC as air cathode shows excellent performance. The maximum power density of 203.48 mW cm&#8722;2, the cycling stability of more than 150 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Stereochemical Communication and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Chiroptical Properties in Biphenyl&#8208;Capped Cyclodextrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiroptical materials are gaining increasing interest due to their innovative character and their applications in optoelectronics and data encryption technologies. Fully harnessing the potential of building blocks from the &#8220;chiral pool&#8221; such as, for example, native cyclodextrins (CDs), as they often lack chromophores suitable for the construction of materials with significant chiroptical properties. Here, we present the synthesis and characterization of a two&#8208;level molecular stack consisting of a point&#8208;chiral element (CD) and an axially chiral element (biphenyl), capable of effectively translating the overall stereochemical information contained in CDs into stimuli&#8208;responsive chiroptical properties. &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Permethylated CDs were efficiently capped with two different 2,2&#8217;&#8208;difunctionalized 1,1'&#8208;biphenyl units. In CD derivatives containing the rigid 2,2'&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl cap, two intramolecular hydrogen bonds act synergistically as stereoselective actuators, enabling effective communication between the two levels and the transfer of non&#8208;chromophoric stereochemical information from the cyclooligosaccharide to the atropoisomeric cap. The chiroptical properties can be finely tuned by external stimuli such as temperature and solvent. The way chirality is transferred from the CD platform to the biphenyl cap was revealed thanks to crystallographic and computational analyses, together with electronic circular dichroism (ECD) studies.</dc:description>

         <title>An Artificial Liposome Compartment with Size Exclusion Molecular Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cellular compartment plays an essential role in organizing the complex and diverse biochemical reactions within the cell. By mimicking the function of such cellular compartments, the challenge of constructing artificial compartments has been taken up to develop new biochemical tools for efficient material production and diagnostics. The important features required for the artificial compartment are that it isolates the interior from the external environment and is further functionalized to control the transport of target chemicals to regulate the interior concentration of both substrate and reaction products. In this study, we have constructed an artificial compartment with a size&#8208;selective molecular transport function by using a DNA origami&#8208;guided liposome prepared by modifying the method reported by Perrault et al. This completely isolates the liposome interior, including the DNA origami skeleton, from the external environment and allows the assembly of a defined number of molecules of interest inside and/or outside the compartment. By incorporating a bacterial membrane protein, OmpF, into the liposome, the resulting artificial compartment was shown to transport only the molecule of interest with a molecular weight below 600 Da from the external environment into the interior of the compartment.</dc:description>

The important features required for the artificial compartment are that it isolates the interior from the external environment and is further functionalized to control the transport of target chemicals to regulate the interior concentration of both substrate and reaction products. In this study, we have constructed an artificial compartment with a size-selective molecular transport function by using a DNA origami-guided liposome prepared by modifying the method reported by Perrault et al. This completely isolates the liposome interior, including the DNA origami skeleton, from the external environment and allows the assembly of a defined number of molecules of interest inside and/or outside the compartment. By incorporating a bacterial membrane protein, OmpF, into the liposome, the resulting artificial compartment was shown to transport only the molecule of interest with a molecular weight below 600 Da from the external environment into the interior of the compartment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis and Reactivity of Three&#8208;Membered Strained Carbo&#8208; and Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;organic synthesis has become an established and environmentally benign tool for initiating chemical transformations. This review summarizes the electrochemical synthesis and ring&#8208;opening reactions of three&#8208;membered strained rings, and particular attention is given to mechanistic aspects.







Abstract
Three&#8208;membered carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring structures are versatile synthetic building blocks in organic synthesis with biological importance. Moreover, the inherent strain of these three&#8208;membered rings leads to their ring&#8208;opening functionalization through C&#8208;&gt;C, C&#8208;&gt;N, and C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Traditional synthesis and ring&#8208;opening methods for these molecules require the use of acid catalysts or transition metals. Recently, electro&#8208;organic synthesis has emerged as a powerful tool for initiating new chemical transformations. In this review, the synthetic and mechanistic aspects of electro&#8208;mediated synthesis and ring&#8208;opening functionalization of three&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles are highlighted.

Regioselectively controlled C&#8722;H&#8208;activated direct arylation reactions of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrroles (DTP) are presented providing novel regioselectively substituted DTPs with N&#8208;aryl, unprecedented &#946;&#8208;aryl and &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;diaryl, as well &#945;&#8208;aryl and &#945;,&#945;&#8216;&#8208;diaryl scaffolds depending on the catalytic system and substitution at the DTP nitrogen.







Abstract
In this study, regioselectively controlled direct arylation of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrroles (DTPs) is reported. By carefully selecting the catalytic system, Pd source, ligand, and additives, we achieved either selective N&#8208;arylation or unprecedented &#946;&#8208;arylation and &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;diarylation of the DTP core through C&#8722;H activation when reacting unsubstituted H&#8208;DTP with 9&#8208;anthracenyl halides. For N&#8208;substituted DTPs, we obtained regioselective carboxylate&#8208;assisted arylation of the &#945;&#8208;position(s). Consequently, depending on the catalytic system and substitution at the DTP nitrogen, we successfully synthesized novel regioselectively substituted DTPs, including N&#8208;aryl, rarely reported &#946;&#8208;aryl, &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;diaryl, &#945;&#8208;aryl, and &#945;,&#945;&#8216;&#8208;diaryl scaffolds. These compounds can be straightforwardly prepared and further functionalized for applications as organic electronic materials.

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Aromatics in Spherical Nanocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferred molecular recognition of aromatics in spherical M12L8 metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) has been studied in consecutive single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) reactions combining single&#8208;crystal&#8208;XRD (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis, DFT calculations, and solid&#8208;state NMR. Computed DFT host&#8211;guest energy interactions (Ehost&#8211;guest) showed a good match with the observed molecular recognition and the rotational behaviour of the pyridine rings in the M12L8 nanocages (low rotational energy barrier &#8776;3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Considering the structure&#8211;function properties observed in M12L8, the metal&#8211;organic structures could be used in sensing applications.







Abstract
In general, due to the lack of efficient specific molecular interactions, achieving host&#8211;guest molecular recognition inside large and neutral metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) is challenging. Preferential molecular recognition of aromatics using the internal binding sites of interlocked icosahedral (i.&#8201;e., spherical) M12L8 MOCs within poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenane (1) is reported. The guest absorption was monitored directly in the solid&#8208;state by consecutive single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) reactions in a gas&#8208;solid environment, in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) experiments. The preferential guest uptake was corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations by determining the host&#8211;guest interaction energy (Ehost&#8211;guest) with a nitrobenzene (NB)&#8811;p&#8208;xylene (p&#8208;xy)&#8811;o&#8208;dichlorobenzene (o&#8208;DCB) trend (i.&#8201;e., from 44 to 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), assessing the XRD outcomes. Combining SC&#8208;XRD, DFT and solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, the exceptional stability of the M12L8 cages, together with the guest exchange/release properties were rationalized by considering the presence of mechanical bonds (efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions) and by the pyridine's rotor&#8208;like behaviour (with 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 rotational energy barrier). The structure&#8211;function properties of M12L8 makes 1 a potential candidate in the field of molecular sensors.

         <dc:description>Designing chiral ligands with an axial symmetry higher than C2&#8208;rotational symmetry is one of the most crucial approaches to improving enantioselectivity in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, we report C3&#8208;symmetric chiral cage&#8208;shaped phosphites. Their Lewis basicity and chiral environment are precisely controlled by the tethered group. The cage&#8208;shaped phosphites successfully worked as chiral ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate additions, realizing acceptable yields with excellent enantioselectivity, and were used to synthesize a pharmacologically important molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution using a Nickel&#8208;based Calixpyrrole Complex: Controlling the Secondary Coordination Sphere on an Electrode Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating design elements from homogeneous catalysts to construct well defined active sites on electrode surfaces is a promising approach for developing next generation electrocatalyst for energy conversion reactions. Furthermore, if functionalities that control the electrode microenvironment could be integrated into these active sites it would be particularly appealing. In this context, we report a square planar nickel calixpyrrole complex, Ni(DPMDA) (DPMDA= 2,2'&#8208;((diphenylmethylene)bis(1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;5,2&#8208;diyl))bis(methaneylylidene))bis(azaneylylidene))dianiline) with pendant amine groups that forms a heterogeneous hydrogen evolution catalyst using anilinium tetrafluoroborate as the proton source. The supported Ni(DPMDA) catalyst was surprisingly robust and displayed fast reaction kinetics with turnover frequencies (TOF) up to 25,900 s&#8208;1 or 366,000 s&#8208;1&#183;cm&#8208;2. Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies revealed a KIE of 5.7, and this data, combined with Tafel slope analysis, suggested that a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process involving the pendant amine groups was rate&#8208;limiting. While evidence of poor electronic coupling between the electrode and the Ni(DPMDA) catalyst was observed, it is hypothesized that the control over the secondary coordination sphere provided by the pendant amines facilitated such high TOFs and enabled the PCET mechanism. The results reported herein provide insight into heterogeneous catalyst design and approaches for controlling the secondary coordination sphere on electrode surfaces.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Incorporating design elements from homogeneous catalysts to construct well defined active sites on electrode surfaces is a promising approach for developing next generation electrocatalyst for energy conversion reactions. Furthermore, if functionalities that control the electrode microenvironment could be integrated into these active sites it would be particularly appealing. In this context, we report a square planar nickel calixpyrrole complex, Ni(DPMDA) (DPMDA= 2,2'-((diphenylmethylene)bis(1H-pyrrole-5,2-diyl))bis(methaneylylidene))bis(azaneylylidene))dianiline) with pendant amine groups that forms a heterogeneous hydrogen evolution catalyst using anilinium tetrafluoroborate as the proton source. The supported Ni(DPMDA) catalyst was surprisingly robust and displayed fast reaction kinetics with turnover frequencies (TOF) up to 25,900 s-1 or 366,000 s-1&#183;cm-2. Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies revealed a KIE of 5.7, and this data, combined with Tafel slope analysis, suggested that a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process involving the pendant amine groups was rate-limiting. While evidence of poor electronic coupling between the electrode and the Ni(DPMDA) catalyst was observed, it is hypothesized that the control over the secondary coordination sphere provided by the pendant amines facilitated such high TOFs and enabled the PCET mechanism.

         <title>Spin Qubit in a 2D&#160;GdIIINaI&#8208;based Oxamato Supramolecular Coordination Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Qubits are the basic unit of quantum information and computation. To realize quantum computing and information processing, the decoherence times of qubits must be long enough. Among the studies of molecule&#8208;based electron spin qubits, most of the work focused on the ions with the spin S = 1/2, where only single&#8208;bit gates can be constructed. However, quantum operations require the qubits to interact with each other, so people gradually carry out relevant research in ions or systems with S &gt; 1/2 and multilevel states. In this work, we selected a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) oxygen&#8208;coordinated GdIIINaI&#8208;based oxamato supramolecular coordination framework, Na[Gd(4&#8208;HOpa)4(H2O)]&#8729;2H2O (1, 4&#8208;HOpa = N&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyphenyloxamate), as a possible carrier of qubit. The field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation shows this system has&#160;phonon bottleneck (PB) effect at low temperatures with a very weak magnetic anisotropy. The pause electron paramagnetic resonance studies show the spin&#8208;lattice and spin&#8208;spin relaxation times are T1 = 1.66 ms at 4 K and Tm = 4.25 &#956;s at 8 K for its diamagnetically diluted sample (1Gd0.12%). It suggested that the relative long decoherence time is mainly ascribed to its near isotropic and the PB effect from resonance phonon trapped for pure sample, while the dilution further improves its qubit performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Additive Manufacturing of Hydrazone linked Covalent Organic Framework Aerogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, porous organic materials. Recent studies have demonstrated novel processing strategies for COFs to form adaptable architectures, but these have focused primarily on imine&#8208;linked COFs. &#160;In this work, we present a new synthesis and processing route to produce crystalline hydrazone&#8208;linked COF gels and aerogels with hierarchical porosity. &#160;We implemented this method to produce a series of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs with different alkyl side&#8208;chain substituents and demonstrate that we can control the hydrophilicity of the final aerogel. Variation in the length of the alkyl substituents yielded materials with controllable form factors that can preferentially adsorb water or nonpolar organic solvents. Additionally, we demonstrate a method for additive manufacturing of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs using hydroxymethylcellulose as a sacrificial additive. &#160;This work demonstrates an effective and simple approach to the fabrication of hydrazone COF aerogels and additive manufacturing to produce hydrazone COFs of desired shape.</dc:description>

         <title>Is Enol Always the Culprit? The Curious Case of High Enantioselectivity in a Chiral Rh(II) Complex Catalyzed Carbene Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of Rh2(S&#8208;NTTL)4&#160;catalyzed carbene insertion into C(3)&#8211;H of indole is investigated using DFT methods. Previously proposed mechanisms involved a metal&#8208;free enol intermediate, which&#160;naturally raises a conundrum regarding the mode of chiral induction. We now propose a new mechanistic pathway involving a metal&#8208;associated enol intermediate and stereochemical model to solve this puzzle. We show how the catalyst bowl&#8208;shaped structure along with substrate&#8208;catalyst binding is crucial for achieving high levels of enantioselectivity. The water molecules are held together by H&#8208;bonding interactions with the carboxylate ligands that is reminiscent of enzyme catalysis. Till date there is no transition state model that can explain the high enantioselectivity with such chiral Rh complexes. The metal&#8208;associated enol pathway is currently underrepresented in catalytic cycles and may play a crucial role in catalyst design. Since the enol pathway is commonly adopted in other metal&#8208;catalyzed X&#8211;H insertion reactions involving a diazoester, our results are not specific to the current reaction. Therefore, our study could provide the direction for achieving high levels of enantioselectivity which is otherwise difficult to achieve with a single metal catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>The Facile Hydrolysis of Imidazolinium Chlorides (N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Precursors) Under Basic Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrolysis of imidazolinium chlorides takes place readily in a basic water/dichloromethane biphasic mixture at room temperature. Experi&#173;mental parameters were optimized to afford full conversions and high yields of&#160;&#947;&#8208;amino&#173;formamides starting from twelve symme&#173;trical substrates with alkyl or aryl substituents on their nitrogen atoms, and five unsym&#173;metrical 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#173;imidazol&#173;in&#173;ium chlorides. NMR and XRD analyses showed that the cleavage of unsymmetrical salts led to&#160;&#947;&#8208;alkylamino&#8208;N&#8208;aryl&#173;formamides with a high regio&#173;selec&#173;ti&#173;vity and that bulky alkyl or aryl groups on the formamide moiety led to the isolation of the (E)&#8208;isomer in high stereoisomeric purity (&gt;95%), whereas smaller and more flexible alkyl substituents afforded mixtures of (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;rotamers. Control experiments showed that the hydrolysis of 1,3&#8208;dimesityl&#173;imidazolinium chloride (SIMes&#183;HCl) did not occur readily in pure or acidic water and that the presence of bulky aromatic substituents on the nitrogen atoms of 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#173;imidazol&#173;inium chloride (SIDip&#183;HCl) efficiently slowed down its hydrolysis under basic aqueous conditions. Most strikingly, this work highlighted the critical influence of the counteranion on the reactivity of imidazolinium cations. Indeed, the chloride salts underwent a facile hydrolysis in the presence of water and Na2CO3, whereas various other NHC&#183;HX derivatives reacted much slower or remained essentially inert under these conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Three Oxidative Addition Routes of Alkali Metal Aluminyls to Dihydridoaluminates and Reactivity with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three distinct methods have been studied to convert alkali metal aluminyls, AM[Al(NONDipp)] (AM=Li&#8722;Cs) to dihydridoaluminates AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)2], which in turn reduce CO2 to bis&#8208;formates AM[Al(NONDipp)(O2CH)2]. Diverting from its usual proton&#8208;hydride releasing behaviour, 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene undergoes a remarkable oxidative addition in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometric reaction with Cs[Al(NONDipp)] yielding the inverse sandwich compound [{Cs(Et2O)}2{Al(NONDipp)(H)}2(C6H6)] (pictured).







Abstract
Three distinct routes are reported to the soluble, dihydridoaluminate compounds, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)2] (AM=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; [NONDipp]2&#8722;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) starting from the alkali metal aluminyls, AM[Al(NONDipp)]. Direct H2 hydrogenation of the heavier analogues (AM=Rb, Cs) produced the first examples of structurally characterized rubidium and caesium dihydridoaluminates, although harsh conditions were required for complete conversion. Using 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,4&#8208;CHD) as an alternative hydrogen source in transfer hydrogenation reactions provided a lower energy pathway to the full series of products for AM=Li&#8722;Cs. A further moderation in conditions was noted for the thermal decomposition of the (silyl)(hydrido)aluminates, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)(SiH2Ph)]. Probing the reaction of Cs[Al(NONDipp)] with 1,4&#8208;CHD provided access to a novel inverse sandwich complex, [{Cs(Et2O)}2{Al(NONDipp)(H)}2(C6H6)], containing the 1,4&#8208;dialuminated [C6H6]2&#8722; dianion and representing the first time that an intermediate in the commonly utilized oxidation process of 1,4&#8208;CHD to benzene has been trapped. The synthetic utility of the newly installed Al&#8722;H bonds has been demonstrated by their ability to reduce CO2 under mild conditions to form the bis&#8208;formate AM[Al(NONDipp)(O2CH)2] compounds, which exhibit a diverse series of eyecatching bimetallacyclic structures.

         <title>FeIII&#8208;Based Eutectic Mixtures as Multi&#8208;task and Reusable Reaction Media for Efficient and Selective Conversion of Alkynes into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynes were hydration under bench type reaction conditions (45&#8201;&#176;C, air, absence of co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvents) thanks to the use of a sustainable FeIII&#8208;based deep eutectic solvent (DES) as promoter/reaction medium. This Fe&#8208;DES was recycled for up to eight consecutives runs in the absence of any VOC solvent.







Abstract
An efficient, simple and general protocol for the selective hydration of terminal alkynes into the corresponding methyl ketones has been developed by using a cheap, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise and sustainable FeIII&#8208;based eutectic mixture [FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O/Gly (3&#8201;:&#8201;1)] as both promoter and solvent for the hydration reaction, working: i)&#8197;under mild (45&#8201;&#176;C) and bench&#8208;type reaction conditions (air); and ii)&#8197;in the absence of ligands, co&#8208;catalysts, co&#8208;solvents or toxic, non&#8208;abundant and expensive noble transition metals (Au, Ru, Pd). When the final methyl ketones are solid/insoluble in the eutectic mixture, the hydration reaction takes place in 30&#8197;min, and the obtained methyl ketones can be isolated by simply decanting the liquid FeIII&#8208;DES, allowing the direct isolation of the desired ketones without VOC solvents. By using this straightforward and simple isolation protocol, we have been able to recycle the FeIII&#8208;based eutectic mixture system up to eight consecutive times. Furthermore, the FeIII&#8208;eutectic mixture is able to promote the selective and efficient formal oxidation of internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, with the possibility of recycling this system up to three consecutive times. Preliminary investigations into a possible mechanism for the oxidation of the internal alkynes seem to indicate that it proceeds through the formation of the corresponding methyl ketones and &#945;&#8208;chloroketones.

         <title>Modified Peptide Molecules As Potential Modulators of Shelterin Protein Functions; TRF1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In silico designed N&#8208;modified tripeptide PEP1 (yellow) imitating TIN2 peptide (green) can modulate interaction of TIN2 with TRF1 telomeric shelterin protein (gray) as shown in the figure and in consequence cause biological effects in cancer cells leading to senescence.







Abstract
In this work, we present studies on relatively new and still not well&#8208;explored potential anticancer targets which are shelterin proteins, in particular the TRF1 protein can be blocked by in silico designed &#8220;peptidomimetic&#8221; molecules. TRF1 interacts directly with the TIN2 protein, and this protein&#8208;protein interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of telomere, which could be blocked by our novel modified peptide molecules. Our chemotherapeutic approach is based on assumption that modulation of TRF1&#8208;TIN2 interaction may be more harmful for cancer cells as cancer telomeres are more fragile than in normal cells. We have shown in&#8197;vitro within SPR experiments that our modified peptide PEP1 molecule interacts with TRF1, presumably at the site originally occupied by the TIN2 protein. Disturbance of the shelterin complex by studied molecule may not in short term lead to cytotoxic effects, however blocking TRF1&#8208;TIN2 resulted in cellular senescence in cellular breast cancer lines used as a cancer model. Thus, our compounds appeared useful as starting model compounds for precise blockage of TRF proteins.

         <title>Formation of a Hexaphosphido Cobalt Complex through P&#8722;P Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[4+2] condensation reaction of diphosphene [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)]OTf and diphosphanide [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)Cl] with the cyclo&#8208;P4 cobalt complex [K(18c&#8208;6)][(PHDI)Co(&#951;4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P4)] forms a CoP6 complex, featuring an unusual hexaphosphido ligand composed of a cyclo&#8208;P5 ring and an exocyclic (ClImDipp)P moiety. 31P&#8197;NMR spectroscopic studies reveal that at ambient temperature, this CoP6 complex undergoes disproportionation into more stable CoP7 and CoP5 complexes.







Abstract
The reaction between diphosphorus derivatives [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)]OTf (1[OTf]) and [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)Cl] (1[Cl]) with the cyclotetraphosphido cobalt complex [K(18c&#8208;6)][(PHDI)Co(&#951;4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P4)] (2) leads to the formation of complex [(PHDI)Co{&#951;4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P6(Dipp)(ClImDipp)}] (3), which features an unusual hexaphosphido ligand [ClImDipp=4,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, 18c&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, PHDI=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)phenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;diimine]. Complex 3 was obtained as a crystalline material with a moderate yield at low temperature. Upon exposure to ambient temperature, compound 3 slowly transforms into two other compounds, [K(18c&#8208;6)][(PHDI)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P7Dipp)] (4) and [(PHDI)Co{cyclo&#8208;P5(ClImDipp)}] (5). The novel complexes 3&#8211;5 were characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. To shed light on the formation of these compounds, a proposed mechanism based on 31P&#8197;NMR monitoring studies is presented.

         <title>Synergistic Promotion of Large&#8208;Current Water Splitting through Interfacial Engineering of Hierarchically Structured CoP&#8722;FeP Nanosheets with Rich P Vacancies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoP&#8722;FeP heterostructure catalyst with abundant P vacancies (Vp&#8722;CoP&#8722;FeP/NF) on nickel foam is constructed through impregnation and phosphorization. It demonstrates excellent hydrogen evolution performance and has practical application prospects in high&#8208;current overall water splitting. The catalyst&#8216;s unique hierarchical nanosheet structure, plentiful P vacancies and synergistic effect of CoP and FeP accelerate HER kinetics, resulting in its superior performance.







Abstract
The development of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts with high performance under large current density is still a challenge. Introducing P vacancies in heterostructure is an appealing strategy to enhance HER kinetics. This study investigates a CoP&#8722;FeP heterostructure catalyst with abundant P vacancies (Vp&#8722;CoP&#8722;FeP/NF) on nickel foam (NF), which was prepared using dipping and phosphating treatment. The optimized Vp&#8722;CoP&#8722;FeP catalyst exerted prominent HER catalytic capability, requiring an ultra&#8208;low overpotential (58&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and displaying robust durability (50&#8197;h @ 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in 1.0&#8197;M KOH solution. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated superior overall water splitting activity as cathode, demanding only cell voltage of 1.76&#8197;V at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outperforming Pt/C/NF(&#8722;) || RuO2/NF(+). The catalyst&#8216;s outstanding performance can be attributed to the hierarchical structure of porous nanosheets, abundant P vacancies, and synergistic effect between CoP and FeP components, which promote water dissociation and H* adsorption and desorption, thereby synergically accelerating HER kinetics and enhancing HER activity. This study demonstrates the potential of HER catalysts with phosphorus&#8208;rich vacancies that can work under industrial&#8208;scale current density, highlighting the importance of developing durable and efficient catalysts for hydrogen production.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Activatable Hybrid Prodrug for the Self&#8208;Immolative Delivery of an Anticancer Agent and Hydrogen Sulfide with Turn&#8208;on Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorogenic prodrugs are advantageous for the targeted drug delivery enabling real&#8208;time non&#8208;invasive monitoring with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. We report herein the dual&#8208;stimuli (ROS and CA)&#8208;responsive thiocarbamate&#8208;based prodrug (AM&#8208;TCB) for the turn&#8208;on fluorogenic delivery of the naphthalimide&#8208;based anticancer agent amonafide along with the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S). A carbamate&#8208;based prodrug AM&#8208;CB was also designed, capable of releasing the anticancer agent amonafide without any H2S. The prodrugs were synthesized using multi&#8208;step organic synthesis. UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopic studies revealed selective reactivity of the boronate ester group of prodrugs towards ROS (primarily H2O2) with the release of amonafide and COS/CO2 via self&#8208;immolative processes. Hydrolysis of the generated COS by carbonic anhydrase (CA) produces H2S. While the prodrug AM&#8208;TCB retained the anticancer activity of free amonafide in cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and HeLa), unlike amonafide, it enhanced the cellular viability of the non&#8208;malignant cells (HEK&#8208;293). Fluorescence imaging in HeLa cells revealed the simultaneous delivery of the anticancer agent and H2S from AM&#8208;TCB with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Western blot studies further revealed the cytoprotective effects of the released H2S from AM&#8208;TCB. The present adjuvant strategy therefore would be helpful in future for ameliorating the anticancer drug&#8208;induced side&#8208;effects.</dc:description>

         <title>The Calculation of Both Electrostatic and Van der Waals Effects to Probe the Efficiency of Solvent Extraction of Heterocyclic Aromatics from Heavy Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the complex composition and similar structure, the extraction denitrification of aromatic rich oil is faced with the contradiction problem of denitrification efficiency and aromatic loss which cannot be efficiently solved by experiments. However, the complex interactions involved can be analyzed from the perspective of calculation, and the prediction criteria and methods are proposed. Based on rigorous density functional theory calculation data, we have established and validated simple models based on electrostatic potential (ESP) and Van der Waals potential (VdWP)&#8208;based calculations. The twofold model provided the best prediction for interactions between extractants and nitrogen compounds and between extractants and aromatics, which determines denitrification efficiency and aromatic loss, respectively, due to the most complete description of both electrostatic and VdW force. This provides a powerful tool for evaluating the non&#8208;covalent interactions and thence tuning the efficiency of the separation process. Thus, high denitrification efficiency (43.2~66.3%) and moderate aromatic loss (1.7~4.4%) were obtained using screened deep eutectic solvents (DESs). This ideal observation provided the potential for mild hydrodesulfurization and manufacture of high&#8208;grade carbon materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Catalytic Hydrogenolysis of Chlorosilanes into Hydrosilanes with &#8220;Inverse&#8221; Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>

         <dc:description>The challenging metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenolysis of silyl chlorides to hydrosilanes is unlocked by using an inverse frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), combining a mild Lewis acid (Cy2BCl) and a strong phosphazene base (BTPP) in mild conditions (10&#160;bar of H2, r.t.). In the presence of a stoichiometric amount of the base, the hydrosilanes R3SiH (R&#160;=&#160;Me, Et, Ph) are generated in moderate to high yields (up to 95%) from their chlorinated counterparts. A selective formation of the valuable difunctional monohydride Me2SiHCl is also obtained from Me2SiCl2. A mechanism is proposed based on stoichiometric experiments and DFT calculations; it highlights the critical role of borohydride species generated by the heterolytic splitting of H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Localized Crystallization of Calcium Phosphates by Light&#8208;Induced Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Medical treatment options for bones and teeth can be significantly enhanced by taking control over the crystallization of biomaterials like hydroxyapatite in the healing process. Light&#8208;induced techniques are particularly interesting for this approach as they offer tremendous accuracy in spatial resolution. However, in the field of calcium phosphates, light&#8208;induced crystallization has not been investigated so far. Here, we establish a proof of principle to successfully induce carbonate&#8208;hydroxyapatite precipitation by light irradiation. Phosphoric acid is released by a photolabile molecule exclusively after irradiation, combining with calcium ions to form a calcium phosphate in the crystallization medium. 4&#8208;Nitrophenylphosphate (4NPP) is established as the photolabile molecule and the system is optimized and fully characterized. We successfully crystallize a calcium phosphate by irradiation in aqueous solution and identify it as carbonate apatite. Control over the localization and stabilization of the carbonate apatite is achieved by a pulsed laser, triggering precipitation in calcium and 4NPP&#8208;containing gel matrices. We anticipate that the results of this communication will open up a wide range of new opportunities; both, in the field of chemistry for more sophisticated reaction control in localized crystallization processes, as well as in the field of medicine for enhanced treatment of calcium phosphate containing biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions involves the application of organozinc reagents and is a highly versatile reaction in synthetic organic chemistry. The transmetallation step plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of these types of cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Herein, we present our mechanistic investigations, indicating, that higher&#8208;order zincates are the transmetallating active species in Pd&#8208; and Ni&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These findings are supported by halide salt addition experiments and by obtaining a single X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the solid monoaryl higher&#8208;order zincate&#160;[1&#8208;NaphthylZnX3]2&#8211;Mg(THF)22+. The procedure developed in this work was further applied to the synthesis of various monoaryl higher&#8208;order zincates, after which their synthetic usefulness in terms of high reactivity towards transmetallation in Negishi cross&#8208;couplings, as well as stability, was exemplified in several reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Addition of Organosulfur Compounds to Alkynes and Alkenes: Catalysis and Catalyst Poisons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of heteroatom compounds to alkynes and alkenes is an atom&#8208;efficient method of carbon&#8211;heteroatom bond formation and is widely used as a fundamental synthetic method for the construction of functional molecules. Nevertheless, examples of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed addition reactions of group 16 heteroatom compounds to carbon&#8211;carbon unsaturated bonds have been limited due to the widespread belief that organic sulfur and selenium compounds are representative catalyst poisons. In recent decades, however, several seminal catalytic reactions of sulfur compounds have been developed, providing important insights into catalysis and poisons. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed addition of organosulfur compounds to alkynes and alkenes, gain comprehensive insights into the catalysis and catalyst poisons, and propose concepts for the development of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions of group 16 heteroatom compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfone/Carbonyl&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Fluorescent Dyes: Synthesis, Structures, Photophysical Properties and Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;accepting units play vital roles in constructing donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated organic optoelectronic materials, the electronic structures and functions of the acceptors are needed to carefully unveil to controllably tailor the optoelectronic properties. Herein, we synthesized two D&#8208;A conjugated organic fluorophores (named TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO) with similar molecular skeletons based on sulfone or carbonyl contained polycyclic aromatic acceptors. For strong intramolecular charge transfer processes, both TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO display obvious solvent polarity&#8208;dependent photophysical properties and large Stokes shift of over 100 nm. The experimental evidences indicate sulfone group in TPA&#8208;SO merely serves as a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing unit, and TPA&#8208;SO shows yellowish&#8208;green emission with an emission peak at 542 nm and absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 98% in solution, while the carbonyl group in TPA&#8208;CO can act as both electron&#8208;withdrawing unit and spin transition convertor, so TPA&#8208;CO displays red emission with a low absolute PLQY of 0.32% in solution. Impressively, from solution to aggregate state, TPA&#8208;SO nanoparticles keep high PLQY of 9.5% and good biocompatibility, which are good nanoprobes for cellular fluorescence imaging. The results reveal that the inherent characteristic of acceptors acts as a crucial effect in the photophysical properties and applications of the organic fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers are formed through nucleation (i.e., initiation) and polymerization processes, and kinetic control over the nucleation process has recently led to the realization of living supramolecular polymerization. Changing the viewpoint, herein we focus on controlling the polymerization process, which we expect to pave the way to further developments in controlled supramolecular polymerization. In our previous study, two&#8208;dimensional living supramolecular polymerization was used to produce supramolecular nanosheets with a controlled area; however, these had rough edges. In this study, the growth of the nanosheets was controlled by using a &#8216;dummy&#8217; monomer to produce supramolecular nanosheets with smoothed edges.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Phenothiazinone as Fluorophore and its Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenothiazinone is a promising yet underutilized fluorophore, possibly due to the lack of a general accessibility. Herein, we report a robust and scalable TEMPO&#8208;mediated electrochemical method to access a variety of phenothiazinones from 2&#8208;aminothiophenols and quinones. The electrosynthesis proceeds in a simple cell architecture under mild condition, and notably carbon&#8211;halogen bond in quinones remains compared to conventional methods, enabling orthogonal downstream functionalization. Mechanistic studies corroborate that TEMPO exert a protective effect in avoiding product decomposition at the cathode. In particular, benzophenothiazinones show intriguing luminescence in the states of both solid and solution, and thus their photophysical properties are scrutinized in detail. Further bio&#8208;imaging of the lipid droplets in living cells highlights the considerable promise of benzophenothiazinones as fluorescent dye in the biomedical fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembling Molecular Clips To Build &#960;&#8208;Stacks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature utilizes an intimate stacking of aromatic motifs to construct functional structures, as demonstrated in protein folding and polynucleotide assembly. However, organized &#960;&#8208;stacks of artificial molecules are difficult to build, primarily due to the weak, non&#8208;directional, and context&#8208;sensitive nature of van der Waals forces. To overcome these challenges, chemists have invented ingenious architectural designs to construct &#960;&#8208;stacked supramolecular assemblies using clip&#8208;like molecules. This CONCEPT article focuses on molecular clips that offer precise spatial control over assembly patterns, beyond the scope of simple host&#8211;guest chemistry. We analyze and compare different design strategies that leverage non&#8208;covalent interactions to create multi&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;stacks. Particular emphasis is placed on the choice of spine units as they play a crucial role in controlling the (i) spacing, (ii) orientation, and (iii) conformational pre&#8208;organization of linked aromatics to achieve long&#8208;range spatial ordering.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiocontrol via Electronics: Insights into a Ru&#8208;Catalyzed, Cu&#8208;Mediated Site&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Isoquinolones via a C&#8722;C Bond Activation of Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru&#8208;catalyzed, Cu&#8208;mediated site&#8208;selective, C3/C4&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;pyridylisoquinolones is achieved. The reaction pathway is characterized by open&#8208;shell singlet and triplet energy pathways arising from the bimetallic complex. Regioselectivity arises from the energies of the two states. While the electron&#8208;donating groups primarily afford the unprecedented C(4)&#8208;isomer, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups show an inclination towards the C(3)&#8208;product.







Abstract
A site&#8208;selective C(3)/C(4)&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;pyridylisoquinolones is achieved by employing C&#8722;C bond activation of cyclopropanols under Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed/Cu(II)&#8208;mediated conditions. The regioisomeric ratios of the products follow directly from the electronic nature of the cyclopropanols and isoquinolones used, with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups yielding predominantly the C(3)&#8208;alkylated products, whereas the electron&#8208;donating groups primarily generate the C(4)&#8208;alkylated isomers. Density functional theory calculations and detailed mechanistic investigations suggest the simultaneous existence of the singlet and triplet pathways for the C(3)&#8208; and C(4)&#8208;product formation. Further transformations of the products evolve the utility of the methodology thereby yielding scaffolds of synthetic relevance.

         <dc:description>
3&#8208;Benzylidene&#8208;indoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones are of great importance for the pharmaceutical industry. These compounds have been extensively reported for their biological properties, but have hardly been studied concerning their photochemical activity. Here, we present 3&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;indoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones as a promising class of photoswitches with high yields, robust photochemical switching, and quantum yields reaching up to 50&#8201;%.







Abstract
3&#8208;Benzylidene&#8208;indoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones play a prominent role in the pharmaceutical industry due to the diverse biomedical applications of oxindole heterocycles. Despite the extensive reports on their biological properties, these compounds have hardly been studied for their photochemical activity. Here, we present 3&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;indoline&#8208;2&#8208;ones as a promising class of photoswitches with high yields, robust photochemical switching with quantum yields reaching up to 50&#8201;% and potential for biological applications.

         <dc:description>
A novel route using Schreiner thiourea mediated organocatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of nitroolefins with diverse azides is devised to furnish high yield of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl glycoconjugates. The method has some notable features including metal&#8208;free, straightforward, acid&#8208;free, excellent regioselectivity operationally simple, wide substrate scope and high yielding. The Schreiner thiourea organocatalysts enable the required activation of nitroolefins through double hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
A novel organocatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of nitroolefins with glycosyl azides as well as organic azides has been developed for successful construction of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl glycoconjugates. This metal&#8208;free and acid&#8208;free, regioselective synthetic protocol proceeds in the presence of only Schreiner thiourea organocatalysts, which enable the required activation of nitroolefins through double hydrogen bonding. The straightforward, operationally simple, and regioselectivity of this methodology, complementing to the classical RuAAC catalyzed synthesis of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. In the presence of catalytic amount of Schreiner thiourea organocatalyst, organic azides react with a broad array of nitroolefins producing a series of diverse 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208; triazoles in good yields with excellent regioselectivity.

Ag10hpbt, Ag12bpva and Ag12bpb exemplify the first luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers used in the sensing of nitrobenzene through fluorescence quenching.







Abstract
Nitrobenzene (NB) is a highly toxic chemical and a cause for concern to human health and the environment. Hence, it is worth designing new efficient and robust sensing platforms for NB. In this study, we present three newly synthesized luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers, {[Ag10(StBu)6(CF3COO)4(hpbt)] (DMAc)2(CH3CN)2}n (hpbt=N,N,N&#8217;,N'N&#8221;,N&#8221;&#8208;hexa(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamine), [Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpva)3]n (bpva=9,10&#8208;Bis(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)anthracene), and {[Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpb)(DMAc)2(H2O)2] (DMAc)2}n (bpb=1,4&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene) composed of Ag10, Ag12 and Ag12 cluster cores, respectively, connected by multidentate pyridine linkers. In addition, two new luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Ag(CF3COO)(dpa)]n (dpa=9,10&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)anthracene) referred to as Agdpa (H) and Agdpa (R), where H and R denote hexagon&#8208; and rod&#8208;like crystal shapes, respectively, have been prepared. The coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effects to NB, attributed to the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and NB as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of NB.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of Biological Activity of Ferrocene&#8208;Ispinesib Hybrids: Impact of a Ferrocenyl Group on the Antiproliferative and Kinesin Spindle Protein Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ferrocenyl&#8208; and adamantyl&#8208;ispinesib hybrids showing significantly higher anticancer activity than ispinesib were designed. The presence of an ispinesb core is responsible for KSP inhibitory activity, whereas bulky ferrocenyl and adamantyl substituents are responsible for increased ability to ROS generation and significantly increased G2/M phase cell arrest of the new compounds.







Abstract
With the aim to combine more than one biologically&#8208;active component in a single molecule, derivatives of ispinesib and its (S) analogue were prepared that featured ferrocenyl moieties or bulky organic substituents. Inspired by the strong kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitory activity of ispinesib, the compounds were investigated for their antiproliferative activity. Among these compounds, several derivatives demonstrated significantly higher antiproliferative activity than ispinesib with nanomolar IC50 values against cell lines. Further evaluation indicated that the antiproliferative activity is not directly correlated with their KSP inhibitory activity while docking suggested that several of the derivatives may bind in a manner similar to ispinesib. In order to investigate the mode of action further, cell cycle analysis and reactive oxygen species formation were investigated. The improved antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds may be assigned to synergic effects of various factors such as KSP inhibitory activity due to the ispinesib core and ability to generate ROS and induce mitotic arrest.

         <title>Oriented External Electric&#8208;Field Effects on the Activation of Aryl CO Bond in Anisole using Rh(PEP) (E=Al, B, Ga) Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculations with density functional theory (DFT) demonstrate the effect of Oriented External Electric Field (OEEF) on the heterolytic activation reactions of the C(sp2)&#8722;O bond in aryl ether compounds, such as anisole, catalysed by Rh&#8722;E (E= Al/B/Ga) complexes. New Rh&#8722;E catalyst complexes with improved activity has also been proposed.







Abstract
The present work reports a DFT&#8208;based mechanistic investigation of aryl C&#8722;O bond activation in anisole catalysed by a Rh&#8722;Al pincer&#8208;type complex at room temperature. The study is extended to analogues Rh&#8722;E complexes based on Group&#8197;13 elements (E=B/Ga). Our results show a preference for the heterolytic cleavage pathway over oxidative addition in the C&#8722;O bond activation. The calculated barriers range from 16 to 36&#8197;kcal/mol, following the order: E=Al&lt;E=Ga&lt;E=B. A strong correlation between the activation barriers and the local electric field (LEF) at the Rh metal centre for the studied Rh&#8722;E complexes was observed. Additionally, the ability of Oriented External Electric Field (OEEF) to lower the reaction barrier by applying the OEEF along the direction of electron reorganization, that is, &#8220;the reaction axis&#8221;, was examined. Our results demonstrate the significant effect of applied OEEF on the aryl C&#8722;O bond activation in Rh&#8722;E systems. Furthermore, the effect of OEEF on the C&#8722;O bond activation using modified Rh&#8722;E (E=B, Al, or Ga) complexes, in which electronic structure modifications enable a more efficient barrier control by the OEEF, was showcased. Notably, applying a moderate field strength reduces the high reaction barrier for the Rh&#8722;B system by approximately 13&#8197;kcal/mol.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Rubicene&#8208;Based Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Compounds as Five&#8208;Membered Ring Embedded Planar Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic compounds having two and three rubicene substructures were synthesized by the Scholl reactions of oligoarene precursors. These nanographene&#8208;like compounds have planar aromatic frameworks, and its length along the long axis reaches 2.8&#8197;nm for the trimer. These compounds showed characteristic absorption and fluorescence bands in the long&#8208;wavelength region owing to small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps by effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons consisting of two or three rubicene substructures were designed as &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds embedding five&#8208;membered rings. The target compounds with t&#8208;butyl groups were synthesized by the Scholl reaction of precursors consisting of 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene units, even though a partially precyclized precursor was required for the synthesis of the trimer. These compounds were isolated as stable and dark blue solids. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations revealed the planar aromatic framework of these compounds. In the electronic spectra, the absorption and emission bands were considerably red&#8208;shifted compared with those of the reference rubicene compound. In particular, the emission band of the trimer extended to the near&#8208;IR region while retaining the emissive property. The narrowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap with the extension of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations.

New poly&#8208;substituted aza&#8208;bodipy NIR dyes: a combined photophysical, electrochemical and theoretical study.







Abstract
This study presents the synthesis, the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of new bis&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted azaboron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes substituted by different electron donating groups connected to the aza&#8208;BODIPY core through a thiophene unit. In line with theoretical calculations, experimental measurements point out the positive impact of the thiophene group that behave as a secondary donor group leading to an enhancement of the intramolecular charge transfer process in comparison to previously reported aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes. This heterocycle has also been found to tune the oxidative potential and to stabilize the electro&#8208;generated species.

         <title>Supramolecular Chirogenesis in a Sterically Hindered Porphyrin: A Critical Theoretical Analysis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to rationalization the molecular mechanisms of chirogenesis? Using a sterically hindered porphyrin receptor, we provide a blue print for the comprehensive analysis of induced electronic circular dichroism with experimental and computational methods and identify critical geometric factors and possible problems, such as a lack of significant conformations and accidental agreement of experimental and simulated spectra.







Abstract
The determination of molecular stereochemistry and absolute configuration is an important part of modern chemistry, pharmacology, and biology. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy is a widely used tool for chirality assignment, especially with porphyrin macrocycles employed as reporter chromophores. However, the mechanisms of induced ECD in porphyrin complexes are yet to be comprehensively rationalized. In this work, the ECD spectra of a sterically hindered hexa&#8208;cationic porphyrin with two camphorsulfonic acids in dichloromethane and chloroform were experimentally measured and computationally analyzed. The influence of geometric factors such as the position of chiral guest molecules, distortion of the porphyrin macrocycle, and orientation of aromatic and non&#8208;aromatic peripheral substituents on the ECD spectra was theoretically studied. Various potential pitfalls, such as a lack of significant conformations and accidental agreement of experimental and simulated spectra, are considered and discussed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to rationalization the molecular mechanisms of chirogenesis&lt;/b&gt;? Using a sterically hindered porphyrin receptor, we provide a blue print for the comprehensive analysis of induced electronic circular dichroism with experimental and computational methods and identify critical geometric factors and possible problems, such as a lack of significant conformations and accidental agreement of experimental and simulated spectra.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The determination of molecular stereochemistry and absolute configuration is an important part of modern chemistry, pharmacology, and biology. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy is a widely used tool for chirality assignment, especially with porphyrin macrocycles employed as reporter chromophores. However, the mechanisms of induced ECD in porphyrin complexes are yet to be comprehensively rationalized. In this work, the ECD spectra of a sterically hindered hexa-cationic porphyrin with two camphorsulfonic acids in dichloromethane and chloroform were experimentally measured and computationally analyzed. The influence of geometric factors such as the position of chiral guest molecules, distortion of the porphyrin macrocycle, and orientation of aromatic and non-aromatic peripheral substituents on the ECD spectra was theoretically studied. Various potential pitfalls, such as a lack of significant conformations and accidental agreement of experimental and simulated spectra, are considered and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Squaramide&#8208;Based Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes for Sodium Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Recognition</title>

Rotaxane! Utilizing the Lewis basic carbonyl moieties of the squaramide motif, a series of squaramide&#8208;containing heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are synthesized via sodium&#8208;cation templation. 1H&#8197;NMR binding studies reveal the bromide and iodide recognition capabilities of these heteroditopic receptors are significantly enhanced by up to ca. 20&#8208;fold in the presence of co&#8208;bound sodium cations, highlighting the unique ambidentate ion&#8208;pair binding nature of squaramides.







Abstract
A series of squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes consisting of isophthalamide macrocycle and squaramide axle components are synthesized using an alkali metal cation template&#8208;directed stoppering methodology. This work highlights the unprecedented sodium cation template coordination of the Lewis basic squaramide carbonyls for interlocked structure synthesis. Extensive quantitative 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic anion and ion&#8208;pair recognition studies reveal the [2]rotaxane hosts are capable of cooperative sodium halide ion&#8208;pair mechanical bond axle&#8208;macrocycle component recognition, eliciting up to 20&#8208;fold enhancements in binding strengths for bromide and iodide, wherein the Lewis basic carbonyls and Lewis acidic NH hydrogen bond donors of the squaramide axle motif operate as cation and anion receptive sites simultaneously in an ambidentate fashion. Notably, varying the length and nature of the polyether cation binding unit of the macrocycle component dramatically influences the ion&#8208;pair binding affinities of the [2]rotaxanes, even overcoming direct contact NaCl ion&#8208;pair binding modes in polar organic solvents. Furthermore, the cooperative ion&#8208;pair binding properties of the squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are exploited to successfully extract solid sodium halide salts into organic media.

         <title>In Situ Formation of CoP/Co3O4 Heterojunction for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoP/Co3O4@TM (TM=titanium mesh) heterojunction exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. OER requires an overpotential of 257&#8197;mV to reach 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and can work stably for more than 40&#8197;h, HER requires an overpotential of 98&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and overall water splitting only needs 1.590&#8197;V to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is an environmentally friendly and effective energy storage method. However, it is still a huge challenge to prepare non&#8208;noble metal based electrocatalysts that possess high activity and long&#8208;term durability to realize efficient water splitting. Here, we present a novel method of low&#8208;temperature phosphating for preparing CoP/Co3O4 heterojunction nanowires catalyst on titanium mesh (TM) substrate that can be used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction showed an excellent catalytic performance and long&#8208;term durability in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 257&#8197;mV at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 during the OER process, and it could work stably more than 40&#8197;h at 1.52&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). During the HER process, the overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 98&#8197;mV at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, when used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalyst, they achieved 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.59&#8197;V. The Faradaic efficiencies of OER and HER were 98.4&#8201;% and 99.4&#8201;%, respectively, outperforming Ru/Ir&#8208;based noble metal electrocatalysts and other non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

         <title>2&#8208;Benzamide Tellurenyl Iodides: Synthesis and Their Catalytic Role in CO2 Mitigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insertion of tellurium into carbon&#8208;iodine bond has been achieved for the first time by a base&#8208;free copper&#8208;catalyzed method for the construction of aryl 2&#8208;benzamide tellurenyl iodides. Furthermore, synthesized tellurenyl iodides were explored for CO2 mitigation to synthesize cyclic carbonates and 1,3&#8208;diaryl ureas, using epoxides and anilines, respectively. In addition, for the first time, the ebtellur intermediate is isolated and characterized by SC&#8208;XRD.







Abstract
Benzamide&#8208;derived organochalcogens (chalcogen=S, Se, and Te) have shown promising interest in biological and synthetic chemistry. Ebselen molecule derived from benzamide moiety is the most studied organoselenium. However, its heavier congener organotellurium is under&#8208;explored. Here, an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed atom economical synthetic method has been developed to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzamide tellurenyl iodides by inserting a tellurium atom into carbon&#8208;iodine bond of 2&#8208;iodobenzamides in one pot with 78&#8211;95&#8201;% yields. Further, the Lewis acidic nature of Te center and Lewis basic nature of nitrogen of the synthesized 2&#8208;Iodo&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides enabled them as pre&#8208;catalyst for the activation of epoxide with CO2 at 1&#8197;atm for the preparation of cyclic carbonates with TOF and TON values of 1447&#8197;h&#8722;1 and 4343, respectively, under solvent&#8208;free conditions. In addition, 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides have also been used as pre&#8208;catalyst for activating anilines and CO2 to form a variety of 1,3&#8208;diaryl ureas up to 95&#8201;% yield. The mechanistic investigation for CO2 mitigation is done by 125Te&#8197;NMR and HRMS studies. It seems that the reaction proceeds via formation of catalytically active Te&#8722;N heterocycle, an ebtellur intermediate which is isolated and structurally characterized.

         <title>Stability and Reversible Oxidation of Sub&#8208;Nanometric Cu5 Metal Clusters: Integrated Experimental Study and Theoretical Modeling
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined XANES and NAP XPS study shows that Cu5 clusters are resistant to irreversible oxidation up to 773&#8197;K in the presence of oxygen. A theoretical model reveals that adsorbed O2 molecules are transformed into superoxo and peroxo species by an interplay of collective charge transfer and large amplitude &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions. A chemical phase diagram for Cu oxidation state of the Cu5&#8208;O2 system is presented.

Sub&#8208;nanometer metal clusters have special physical and chemical properties, significantly different from those of nanoparticles. However, there is a major concern about their thermal stability and susceptibility to oxidation. In situ X&#8208;ray Absorption spectroscopy and Near Ambient Pressure X&#8208;ray Photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal that supported Cu5 clusters are resistant to irreversible oxidation at least up to 773&#8197;K, even in the presence of 0.15&#8197;mbar of oxygen. These experimental findings can be formally described by a theoretical model which combines dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT and first principles thermochemistry revealing that most of the adsorbed O2 molecules are transformed into superoxo and peroxo species by an interplay of collective charge transfer within the network of Cu atoms and large amplitude &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions. A chemical phase diagram for Cu oxidation states of the Cu5&#8208;oxygen system is presented, clearly different from the already known bulk and nano&#8208;structured chemistry of Cu.

The photocatalyzed reaction between various electron&#8208;deficient aromatic compounds and a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide is successfully performed in a flow system.







Abstract
The photocatalyzed dearomative reaction between various electron&#8208;deficient aromatic compounds and a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide is successfully performed in a flow system. Whereas the use of supported eosin as organic photocatalyst exhibits limited efficiency, turning to the soluble Rose Bengal allows to transform a broad range of substrates from hetarenes (indole, benzofuran, quinoline, pyridine) to naphthalenes and benzenes. This photocatalyzed (3+2) dearomative cycloaddition under green light irradiation provides a simple and efficient access to tridimensional pyrrolidino scaffolds with a tetrasubstituted carbon center at ring junction and can be performed in the friendly ethyl acetate. Computational studies support the mechanism involving azomethine ylide as reactive species toward the electron&#8208;poor arene.

A formal synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Salvinorin A, a neo clerodane diterpenoid natural product and &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor agonist, is being reported utilizing a double application of gold(I) methodology as a Lewis acid and a photoredox catalyst.







Abstract
The formal synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;salvinorin A is presented. Our approach utilizes two distinct gold(I) catalytic processes. The combination of a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction with an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction followed by a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed photoredox reaction generated in eight steps the framework of the natural product with high diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Infrared Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigations of Group 13 Oxyfluorides OMF2 and OMF (M=B, Al, Ga, In)</title>

Terminal oxygen radicals involving group 13&#8201;atoms: We investigate herein oxydifluoride OMF2 (M=B, Al, Ga and In) radicals by the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated group 13 atoms with OF2 under cryogenic conditions in solid noble gas matrices. The computed molecular orbitals and spin densities showed that the unpaired electron is mainly located at the terminal oxygen atom.







Abstract
Group 13 oxyfluorides OMF2 were produced by the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated group 13 atoms M (M=B, Al, Ga and In) with OF2 and isolated in excess neon or argon matrices at 5&#8197;K. These molecules were characterized by matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and isotopic substitution experiments in conjunction with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The calculations indicate that the OMF2 molecules have a 2B2 ground state with C2v symmetry. The computed molecular orbitals and spin densities show that the unpaired electron is mainly located at the terminal oxygen atom. Oxo monofluorides OMF were only observed in solid argon matrices and exhibit a linear structure in the singlet ground state. The M&#8722;O bonding in the OMF molecules can be rationalized as highly polar multiple bonds based on the calculated bond lengths and natural resonance theory (NRT) analyses. In particular, the molecular orbitals of OBF exhibit the character of a triple bond B&#8722;O resulting from two degenerate electron&#8208;sharing &#960; bonds and an O&#8594;B dative &#963; bond formed by the oxygen 2p lone pair which donates electron density to the boron empty 2p orbital.

A novel architecture with no organic isolobal analogue, the bicyclic 3&#8208;mercaptopyrylium rhodium complexes, [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)X2(PPh3)2] (X=Cl, Br), arise from thiocarbonyl&#8208;cyclopropenium coupling.







Abstract
Addition of triphenylcyclopropenium bromide to the thiocarbonyl complex [RhCl(CS)(PPh3)2] affords novel bicyclic metalla&#8208;3&#8208;mercapto&#8208;thiapyrylliums [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(PPh3)2X2] (X=Cl, Br) &#8211; heterocycles with no metal&#8208;free isolobal precedent. Halide abstraction with silver triflate (AgOTf) in acetonitrile affords the salt [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(NCMe)2(PPh3)2{Ag(OH2)2}{Ag(OTf)3}]&#8208;OTf which in turn reacts with sodium chloride to return [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(PPh3)2Cl2].

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Tropane Scaffolds by an Organocatalyzed 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of 3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Betaines and Dienamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyzed (5+2) cycloaddition of 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines and dienamines is presented. The protocol allows for the enantioselective construction of functionalized tropane scaffolds in up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee and up to quantitative yield. DFT calculations propose a stepwise mechanism in which multiple cycloaddition pathways are possible, but the reversibility of diverging routes renders the reaction fully periselective.







Abstract
Tropane alkaloids constitute a compound&#8208;class which is structurally defined by a central 8&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane core. A diverse bioactivity profile combined with an unusual aza&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework has made tropanes molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest within organic chemistry. Enantioselective examples of (5+2) cycloadditions between 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines and olefins remain unexplored, despite 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines being useful reagents in organic synthesis. The first asymmetric (5+2) cycloaddition of 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines is reported, affording tropane derivatives in up to quantitative yield and with excellent control of peri&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The reactivity is enabled by dienamine&#8208;activation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes combined with in&#8197;situ formation of the pyridinium reaction&#8208;partner. A simple N&#8208;deprotection protocol allows for liberation of the tropane alkaloid motif, and synthetic elaborations of the cycloadducts demonstrate their synthetic utility to achieve highly diastereoselective modification around the bicyclic framework. DFT computations suggest a stepwise mechanism where regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity are defined during the first bond&#8208;forming step in which the pyridinium dipole exerts critical conformational control over its dienamine partner. In the second bond&#8208;forming step, a kinetic preference toward an initial (5+4) cycloadduct was identified; however, a lack of catalyst turn&#8208;over, reversibility, and thermodynamic bias favoring a (5+2) cycloadduct rendered the reaction fully periselective.

The reaction of an iridium tetrahydride (LIrH4, L=DippNacnac) with main&#8208;group (E=Sn, Pb, Bi) amides/alkoxides results in the extrusion of amines/alcohols with formation of iridium dimetallotetrylenes (LIrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2. Computational investigations of the Ir2E2 (E=Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open&#8208;shell singlets; in contrast, Ir2Bi2 is characterized as having a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state.







Abstract
Reactions of the IrV hydride [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 {BDI=(Dipp)NC(Me)CH(Me)CN(Dipp); Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3} with E[N(SiMe3)2]2 (E=Sn, Pb) afforded the unusual dimeric dimetallotetrylenes ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 in good yields. Moreover, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Ge)2 was formed in&#8197;situ from thermal decomposition of [MeBDIDipp]Ir(H)2Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2. These reactions are accompanied by liberation of HN(SiMe3)2 and H2 through the apparent cleavage of an E&#8722;N(SiMe3)2 bond by Ir&#8722;H. In a reversal of this process, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 reacted with excess H2 to regenerate [MeBDIDipp]IrH4. Varying the concentrations of reactants led to formation of the trimeric ([MeBDIDipp]IrH2)3(&#956;2&#8208;E)3. The further scope of this synthetic route was investigated with group&#8197;15 amides, and ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Bi)2 was prepared by the reaction of [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 with Bi(NMe2)3 or Bi(OtBu)3 to afford the first example of a &#8220;naked&#8221; two&#8208;coordinate Bi atom bound exclusively to transition metals. A viable mechanism that accounts for the formation of these products is proposed. Computational investigations of the Ir2E2 (E=Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open&#8208;shell singlets with confined nonbonding lone pairs at the E centers. In contrast, Ir2Bi2 is characterized as having a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state.

         <title>[(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; &#8211; An Unprecedented Molecular Fluoridobromate(V) Anion in Cs[Br3F16]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first fluoride&#8208;bridged oligonuclear Br(V) anion, [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722;, has been obtained in the compound Cs[Br3F16]. The lone pairs on the Br atoms are shown to be stereochemically active, which has never been observed before for fluoridobromates(V) but only for fluoridoiodates(V).







Abstract
The reaction of Cs[BrF6] with BrF5 gave the compound Cs[Br3F16] with the unprecedented propeller&#8208;shaped, C3&#8208;symmetric [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; anion. All other currently known fluoridobromates(V) contain only octahedral [BrF6]&#8722; anions, which, unlike the related [IF6]&#8722; anions, never exhibited stereochemical activity of the lone pair on the Br atoms. Despite the same coordination number of six for the Br atom in the [BrF6]&#8722; and [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; anions, the longer &#956;3&#8208;F&#8722;Br bonds provide additional space, allowing the lone pairs on the Br atoms to become stereochemically active. Cs[Br3F16] was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations for both the solid&#8208;state compound and the isolated anion at 0&#8197;K. Intrinsic bond orbital calculations show that the &#956;3&#8208;F&#8722;Br bond is essentially ionic in nature and also underpin the stereochemical activity of the lone pairs of the Br(V) atoms.

         <title>A Doubly Dissipative System Driven by Chemical and Radiative Stimuli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motions of an alkali cation from and to the crown&#8208;ether moieties of different ligands (up to three) is controlled over time and in a dissipative fashion by contextually employing two orthogonal stimuli, namely a radiative one and a chemical one. When the stimuli are no longer supplied, moving from out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium states, the system reversibly returns to its equilibrium state.







Abstract
The operation of a dissipative network composed of two or three different crown&#8208;ether receptors and an alkali metal cation can be temporally driven by the use (combined or not) of two orthogonal stimuli of a different nature. More specifically, irradiation with light at a proper wavelength and/or addition of an activated carboxylic acid, are used to modulate the binding capability of the above crown&#8208;ethers towards the metal ion, allowing to control over time the occupancy of the metal cation in the crown&#8208;ether moiety of a given ligand. Thus, application of either or both of the stimuli to an initially equilibrated system, where the metal cation is distributed among the crown&#8208;ether receptors depending on the different affinities, causes a programmable change in the receptor occupancies. Consequently, the system is induced to evolve to one or more out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium states with different distributions of the metal cation among the different receptors. When the fuel is exhausted or/and the irradiation interrupted, the system reversibly and autonomously goes back to the initial equilibrium state. Such results may contribute to the achievement of new dissipative systems that, taking advantage of multiple and orthogonal stimuli, are featured with more sophisticated operating mechanisms and time programmability.

Bare clusters of five Cu atoms, synthesized electrochemically, display remarkable oxidation stability on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. They exhibit reversible O2 adsorption, transitioning between various Cu oxidation states with changes in temperature and O2 pressure. In&#8208;situ XPS and XANES spectroscopy experiments, along with theoretical characterizations of Cu5&#8211;(O2)n complexes, provide direct evidence of the Cu5 clusters&#8217; O2 stability. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;P. de&#8197;Lara&#8208;Castells, F.&#8197;G. Requejo, M.&#8197;A.

         <dc:description>
Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) is widely used to determine chirality especially by employing porphyrins as reporter chromophores. The artwork, designed by Natalja Jemikova, shows a supramolecular complex of a porphyrin with two chiral guest molecules being irradiated to measure ECD and UV&#8208;Vis spectra. However, the electronic mechanism of induced ECD in the porphyrin has yet to be comprehensively rationalized, and computational chemistry can be successfully applied for this purpose. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Osadchuk, M.&#8197;O. Senge and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301408).

Luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers composed of Ag10 or Ag12 cluster cores and multidentate pyridine linkers were synthesized as well as luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers. It was found that these coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effect to nitrobenzene, attributed to the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and nitrobenzene as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of nitrobenzene.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Metal Catalysts for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalytic sites and recent developments of dual&#8208;site metal catalysts (DSMCs) in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are presented. This Review includes a description and generalization of the classification of DSMCs used for CO2RR according to the form of metal existence; a detailed analysis of the mechanisms and importance of synergy in enhancing electrocatalytic properties for CO2RR.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising and green approach for reducing atmospheric CO2 concentration and achieving high&#8208;valued conversion of CO2 under the carbon&#8208;neutral policy. In CO2RR, the dual&#8208;site metal catalysts (DSMCs) have received wide attention for their ingenious design strategies, abundant active sites, and excellent catalytic performance attributed to the synergistic effect between dual&#8208;site in terms of activity, selectivity and stability, which plays a key role in catalytic reactions. This review provides a systematic summary and detailed classification of DSMCs for CO2RR, describes the mechanism of synergistic effects in catalytic reactions, and also introduces in&#8197;situ characterization techniques commonly used in CO2RR. Finally, the main challenges and prospects of dual&#8208;site metal catalysts and even multi&#8208;site catalysts for CO2 recycling are analyzed. It is believed that based on the understanding of bimetallic site catalysts and synergistic effects in CO2RR, well&#8208;designed high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts are promising for achieving CO2 conversion, electrochemical energy conversion and storage in the future.

         <title>Recent Developments on Photochemical Synthesis of 1,n&#8208;Dicarbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls, having immense applications in the pharmaceutical industry owing to their fascinating attributes and biological activity, have been exploited as versatile building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. The recent advancement on assembly of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds via different photochemical modes of reaction has been documented in this review.







Abstract
1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls are one of the most fascinating chemical feedstocks finding abundant usage in the field of pharmaceuticals. Besides, they are utilized in a plethora of synthesis in general synthetic organic chemistry. A number of &#8216;conventional&#8217; methods are available for their synthesis, such as the Stetter reaction, Baker&#8208;Venkatraman rearrangement, oxidation of vicinal diols, and oxidation of deoxybenzoins, synonymous with unfriendly reagents and conditions. In the last 15&#8197;years or so, photocatalysis has taken the world of synthetic organic chemistry by a remarkable renaissance. It is fair to say now that everybody loves the light and photoredox chemistry has opened a new gateway to organic chemists towards milder, more simpler alternatives to the previously available methods, allowing access to many sensitive reactions and products. In this review, we present the readers with the photochemical synthesis of a variety of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls. Diverse photocatalytic pathways to these fascinating molecules have been discussed, placing special emphasis on the mechanisms, giving the reader an opportunity to find all these significant developments in one place.

         <title>Supramolecular Chirogenesis in a Sterically Hindered Porphyrin: A Critical Theoretical Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 49, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;It was found that a change in the ethyl substituents in the porphyrin structure can also influence the ECD spectra of the host&#8211;guest complex.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202301408).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the groups of Irina Osadchuk at Tallinn University of Technology and Mathias Senge at Trinity College Dublin. The image depicts how a porphyrin with two guest molecules (R)&#8208;camphor sulfonic acid is irradiated with UV&#8208;visible light to measure and simulate ECD and UV&#8208;Vis spectra.

         <dc:description>Enantiomerically pure acyclic O,O&#8208;acetal compounds (up to 97% ee) have been accessed through chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed addition of oximes to alkoxyallenes. DFT calculations support that a protonative hydropalladation pathway is favourable, in which the hydrogen bonding interaction between the amide group of the diphosphine ligand and the alkoxyallene is critical for the highly stereoselective formation of the dioxygenated stereogenic center.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Closing Alkyne&#8208;Carbonyl Metathesis for the Synthesis of Butenolides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis is a type of carbon&#8208;carbon forming reaction involving the construction a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond and a carbonyl group in one transformation. Herein, a Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis protocol has been developed to make densely substituted &#947;&#8208;butenolides from propargyl &#945;&#8208;ketoesters. It features 100% atom economy, excellent substrate flexibility and benign functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the coordinative interaction between the gold catalyst and the alkyne might initiate the transfer of an oxygen atom and the formation of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. By using this gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis as a key step reaction, four naturally occurring butenolide&#8208;type compounds including decumbic acid (45% yield for 3 steps), deoxyisosporothric acid (32% yield for 5 steps), lichesterinic acid (34% yield for 5 steps) and isomuronic acid (6% yield for 8 steps) have been accessed starting from commercially available starting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas Permeation through Mechanically Resistant Self&#8208;Standing Membranes of a Neat Amorphous Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas separation: A novel organic cage with excellent film&#8208;forming tendencies was processed into transparent, mechanically robust, self&#8208;standing membranes of controllable thickness. Thanks to their peculiar features, the membranes of the neat cage were successfully tested for gas permeation (e.g., with CO2), with behavior similar to that found with stiff glassy polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity or polyimides being reported. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;C. Jansen, V. Amendola and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301437).

         <title>In silico investigation of the thermochemistry and photoactivity of pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution of NaCl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab&#8197;initio study of the hydrated and non&#8208;hydrated forms of pyruvate in NaCl aqueous solution emphasizes the influence of sodium on the chemical equilibrium of hydration and photoactivity of the anion.







Abstract
The photochemistry of oxocarboxylic acids contributes significantly to the complex chemistry occurring in the atmosphere. In this regard, pyruvic acid undergoes photoreactions that lead to many diverse products. The presence of sodium cation near pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution, or its conjugate base in non&#8208;acidic conditions, influences the hydration equilibrium and the photosensitivity to UV&#8208;visible light of the oxocarboxylic acid. We performed an ab&#8197;initio metadynamics simulation which serves two purposes: first, it unveils the mechanisms of the reversible hydration reaction between the keto and the diol forms, with a free&#8208;energy difference of only 2&#8197;kJ/mol at 300&#8197;K, which shows the influence of sodium on the keto/diol ratio; second, it provides solvent&#8208;shared ion pairing (SSIP) and contact ion pairing (CIP) structures, including Na+ coordinated to carbonyl, for the calculations of the electronic transition energies to an antibonding &#960;* orbital, which sheds light on the photoactivity of these two forms in the actinic region.

         <dc:description>
Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a lithium oxonitridophosphate double salt synthesized from P3N5 and Li2O in ampoule synthesis. The structure consists of phosphate and diphosphate motifs and exhibits a severe disorder in the diphosphate unit. NMR and vibrational spectroscopy methods give additional information concerning the composition of oxygen and nitrogen. Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a Li+ ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
The crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x, was obtained in an ampoule synthesis from P3N5 and Li2O. The compound crystallizes in the triclinic space group P
 with a=5.125(2), b=9.888(5), c=10.217(5) &#197;, &#945;=70.30(2), &#946;=76.65(2), &#947;=77.89(2)&#176;. Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a double salt, the structure of which contains distinctive complex anion species, namely non&#8208;condensed P(O,N)4 tetrahedra, and P(O,N)7 double tetrahedra connected by one N atom. Additionally, there is mixed occupation of O/N positions, which enables further anionic species by variation of O/N occupancies. To characterize these motifs in detail, complementary analytical methods were applied. The double tetrahedron exhibits significant disorder in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, the title compound is a Li+ ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and a corresponding total activation energy of 0.47(2) eV.

         <title>Unravelling the Mystery of COVID&#8208;19 Pathogenesis: Spike Protein and Cu Can Synergize to Trigger ROS Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How COVID&#8208;19 damage DNA: Severe oxidative damage to various biomolecules in COVID&#8208;19&#8208;infected lungs has been reported. Our study shows that SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein fragments coordinate Cu(II) ions, forming three&#8208;nitrogen complexes in the lung environment. Using various methods, we demonstrated that these complexes generate ROS, leading to single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand DNA breaks.







Abstract
The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on global health, highlighting the need to understand how the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus damages the lungs in order to develop effective treatments. Recent research has shown that patients with COVID&#8208;19 experience severe oxidative damage to various biomolecules. We propose that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection involves an interaction between copper ions and the virus&#8216;s spike protein. We tested two peptide fragments, Ac&#8208;ELDKYFKNH&#8208;NH2 (L1) and Ac&#8208;WSHPQFEK&#8208;NH2 (L2), derived from the spike protein of the Wuhan strain and the &#946; variant, respectively, and found that they bind Cu(II) ions and form a three&#8208;nitrogen complexes at lung pH. Our research demonstrates that these complexes trigger the overproduction of ROS, which can break both DNA strands and transform DNA into its linear form. Using A549&#8197;cells, we demonstrated that ROS overproduction occurs in the mitochondria, not in the cytoplasm. Our findings highlight the importance of the interaction between copper ions and the virus&#8216;s spike protein in the development of lung damage and may aid in the development of therapeutic procedures.

         <title>Base&#8208;Stabilized Phosphinidene Oxide, Imide and Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphinidene conducts an auction for the best P=X bond: Cyclic phosphinoamidinate&#8208;supported phosphinidene (NP)P is a natural precursor to base&#8208;stabilized PIII compounds (NP)P=X (X=O, NR, S). Interestingly, for the stronger P=O and P=N bonds, the respective compounds (NP)P=O and (NP)P=NTol are labile and cannot be isolated, but can be intercepted by isocyanate TolNCO to give the urea compound (NP)P&#8208;(NTol)2CO. In contrast, the sulfide (NP)P=S, prepared by a reaction of (NP)P with sulfur, is isolable. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;F. Vyboishchikov, G.&#8197;I. Nikonov and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301842).

         <title>EPR Sensing of a Cation Species by Aza&#8208;Crown Ethers Incorporating a Persistent Nitroxidic Radical Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and the use of aza&#8208;crown ethers containing a stable nitroxide acting as selective sensor of inorganic and organic cations is described. The radical is deeply involved in the coordination complex generating peculiar EPR spectral pattern also depending on non&#8208;zero nuclear spin of the metal cation. The wheel was employed also in the preparation of a rotaxane structure.







Abstract
New nitroxides based on aza&#8208;crown ethers were prepared and employed as selective sensors for the detection of inorganic and organic cations by EPR analysis of the corresponding host&#8211;guest complexes. The nitroxide unit behaves as a sensitive probe for a number of alkali and alkaline earth metal cations affording EPR spectra differing in the value of nitrogen hyperfine constants and in the appearance of splitted signals due to the non&#8208;zero nuclear spin of some metal cation upon complexation. Owing to the remarkable EPR spectral differences between the host and the corresponding cation complex the new macrocycles are likely to act as multitasking tools to recognize several cationic species. EPR behaviour of the larger nitroxide azacrown 1&#8901; when acting as a wheel in a radical synthetic bistable [2]rotaxane containing both secondary dialkylammonium and 1,2&#8208;bis(pyridinium) molecular stations, was also investigated. Reversible movements of the macrocycle between the two recognition sites in the rotaxane were promptly revealed by EPR, which shows significant changes either in nitrogen coupling constant values (aN) or in the spectral shape in the two rotaxane co&#8208;conformations.

         <title>Robust Biosensor Based on Carbon Nanotubes/Protein Hybrid Electrolyte Gated Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust sensor: A robust methodology for the fabrication of electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor biosensors is presented. Single walled carbon nanotubes are hybridized with bovine serum albumin allowing the transistor fabrication from aqueous solution. The sensor functionality is demonstrated for the detection of cortisol in solution after immobilization of antibodies on the gate surface. Analysis of the signal allows the extraction of binding parameters.







Abstract
Semiconducting single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising materials for biosensing applications with electrolyte&#8208;gated transistors (EGT). However, to be employed in EGT devices, SWCNTs often require lengthy solution&#8208;processing fabrication techniques. Here, we introduce a simple solution&#8208;based method that allows fabricating EGT devices from stable dispersions of SWCNTs/bovine serum albumin (BSA) hybrids in water. The dispersion is then deposited on a substrate allowing the formation of a SWCNTs random network as the semiconducting channel. We demonstrate that this methodology allows the fabrication of EGT devices with electric performances that allow their use in biosensing applications. We demonstrate their application for the detection of cortisol in solution, upon gate electrode functionalization with anti&#8208;cortisol antibodies. This is a robust and cost&#8208;effective methodology that sets the ground for a SWCNT/BSA&#8208;based biosensing platform that allows overcoming many limitations of standard SWCNTs biosensor fabrications.

         <title>Diiminium Nucleophile Adducts Are Stable and Convenient Strong Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dicationic diiminium pyridine adducts distinctively concentrate their positive charges at the diiminium carbon atom, a characteristic vividly portrayed in their molecular electrostatic potential. They are easily handled and synthesized. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302089), F.&#8197;F. Mulks and co&#8208;workers showcase the adducts&#8217; prominence as potent Lewis acids, particularly in facilitating dehydration reactions like amide and imide couplings.

         <dc:description>Two families of phosphorhydrazone dendrons having either an azide or an alkyne linked to the core and diverse types of pyridine derivatives as terminal functions have been synthesized and characterized. These dendrons were grafted via click reaction to graphene oxide (GO) functionalized with either alkyne or azide functions, respectively. The resulting modified&#8208;GO and GO&#8208;dendrons materials have been characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS&#8208;NMR) analyses. In addition, the free dendrons and the dendrons grafted to GO were tested toward cancerous (HCT116) and non&#8208;cancerous (RPE1) cell lines.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The surprising differences between the experimental solid&#8208;state and calculated gas&#8208;phase structures of 5&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;dithiadiazole (Roesky&#8217;s ketone, 1) and 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,4,3,5&#8208;trithiadiazole (Roesky&#8217;s sulfoxide, 2), identified and studied in a series of papers published between 2004 and 2010 but then never satisfactorily explained, have been revisited, making use of the more advanced computational possibilities currently available. The previous calculations&#8217; considerable overestimations of the C&#8211;S and S&#8211;S bond lengths in 1 and 2, respectively, have been partly explained based on the results of periodic calculations and the application of Valence Bond (VB) Theory. In the case of 1, the crystal environment appears to stabilize a structure with a highly polarized C=O bond, which features a C&#8211;S bond with considerable double&#8208;bond character &#8211; an effect which does not exist for the isolated molecule &#8211; explaining the much shorter bond in the solid state. For 2, a similar conclusion can be drawn for the S&#8211;S distance. For both compounds, though, packing effects are not the sole source of the differences: the inability of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to properly deal with the electronic structures of these apparently simple main&#8208;group systems remains a contributing factor.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Cycle Performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries by Coating the Separator with a Cation&#8208;Selective Polymer Layer&#160;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are believed to possess the feasibility to power electric vehicles in the future ascribed to the competitive energy density. However, soluble polysulfides continuously shuttle between the sulfur electrode and lithium anode across the separator, which dramatically impairs the battery&#8217;s capacity. Herein, the surface of a polypropylene separator (PP film) is successfully modified with a delicately designed cation&#8208;selective polymer layer to suppress the transport of polysulfides. In principle, since bis&#8208;sulfonimide anions groups on the backbone of the polymer are immobilized, only cations can pass through the polymer layer. Furthermore, plenty of ethoxy chains in the polymer can facilitate lithium&#8208;ion mobility. Consequently, in addition to obstructing the movement of negatively charged polysulfides by the electrostatic repulsive force of fixed anions, the coated multi&#8208;functional layer on the PP film also guarantees the smooth conduction of lithium ions. The investigations demonstrate that the battery with the pristine PP film only delivers 228.5 mAh g&#8208;1 after 300 cycles at 2 C with a high capacity fading rate of 60.9%. By contrast, the polymer&#8208;coated sample can release 409.4 mAh g&#8208;1 under the identical test condition and the capacity fading rate sharply declines to 43.2%, illustrating superior cycle performance.</dc:description>

         <title>From an Isolable Bismolyl Anion to an Yttrium&#8211;Bismolyl Complex with &#956;&#8208;Bridging Bismuth(I) Centers and Polar Covalent Y&#8211;Bi Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and first structural characterization of the [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)] bismolyl Bitet (C4Me4Bi) contact ion pair 1 is presented. Notably, according to Natural Resonance Theory calculations, the Bitet anion of 1 features two types of leading mesomeric structures with localized anionic charge and two lone pairs of electrons at the Bi(I) center, and delocalized anionic charge in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated C4Bi ring. The lone pairs at Bi enable a unique bridging coordination mode of the bismolyl ligand as shown for the first rare earth metal bismolyl complex (Cptet2Y)2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Bitet)22. The latter results from salt metathesis reaction of KBitet with Cptet2Y(BPh4) (Cptet = C5Me4H). The Y&#8211;Bi bonding interaction in 2 of 16.6% covalency at yttrium is remarkably large.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Truncation on Optoelectronic Properties of Azaborole Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report configurationally stable singly&#8208;truncated (ST) and structurally flexible doubly&#8208;truncated (DT) helically chiral compounds derived from azabora[7]helicenes by a hypothetical removal of a single or two C=C double bonds. The singly&#8208;truncated constitutional isomers were synthesized from either benzoisoquinoline (BIQ) or phenantherene building blocks and the corresponding biaryls in excellent yields to give azabora[5]helicenes with a pendant phenyl ring at a sterically hindered position. These systems highlight the electronic impact of the nitrogen donor substitution position. The compounds with a disrupted BIQ moiety (STN) possess remarkable photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.53 in the solid state and a blue emission in solution with dissymmetry factors of up to ca. 3 &#215; 10&#8211;3. Upon cooling to 79 K all compounds exhibit phosphorescence with lifetimes of up to ca. 0.5 s. A methyl complex of azabora[7]helicene showing excellent configurational stability was used as a chiral inducer embedded in an emissive polymer (F8BT) to produce circularly polarized organic light emitting diodes with an electroluminescence dissymmetry factor gEL of up to 0.54.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Binding of Hydrogen and Styrene Coordination on a Manganese Phosphenium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of two complexes [(RNHP)Mn(CO)4] (RNHP = N&#8208;arylated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium) with H2 at elevated pressure (&#8776; 4 bar) were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Irradiation with UV light initialized in one case (5a, R = Dipp) the unselective formation of (RNHP&#8208;H)MnH(CO)4] (6a) via cooperative addition of H2 across the Mn=P double bond. In the other case (5b, R = Mes), addition of H2 was unobservable and the reaction proceeded via decarbonylation to a dimeric species [(RNHP)2Mn2(CO)7] (7b) that was isolated and identified spectroscopically. Taking into account the outcome of further reaction studies under various conditions in the absence and presence of H2, both transformations can be explained in the context of a common mechanism involving decarbonylation to 7a,b as the first step, and the different outcome is attributable to the fact that 7b is unreactive towards both H2 and CO while 7a is not. DFT studies relate this divergence to deviations in the molecular constitution and stability arising from a different level of steric congestion. Preliminary studies suggest further that 5a/H2 as well as 6a enable the photo&#8208;induced hydrogenation of styrene to ethyl benzene, even if the mechanism and possibly catalytic nature of this process remain yet unknown.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy for Increasing the Air&#8208;stability of Phosphines Including Primary Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given recent reports of structurally diverse air&#8208;stable primary phosphines lacking kinetic stabilization, the stability against oxidation was difficult to rationalize and attributed to the specific electronic nature of the phosphine group. This contribution shows the synthesis of a series of air&#8208;stable primary phosphines Fc(CH2)nPH2, where n = 0,1,2,3; and Fc = ferrocenyl, and their corresponding isolable primary phosphine oxides. It was demonstrated that the ferrocene moiety exerts an antioxidant effect on the primary phosphine group, which is intermolecular, solvent dependent and increases with the electron density on the ferrocene moiety. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the presence of ferrocene in solution also inhibits the oxidation of other secondary and tertiary phosphines in air. The collected information suggests that quenching of singlet oxygen is the actual reason for the antioxidant effect which was experimentally confirmed using other established singlet oxygen quenchers as well, demonstrating a key role of singlet oxygen in the aerobic oxidation of phosphines.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as Photocatalyst for the Direct Formylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new metal&#8208;free photocatalytic approach for the direct conversion of N,N&#8208;difunctionalized anilines into formamides derivatives (up to 89&#8201;% yield) under mild operative conditions is described herein. In this reaction, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) acts as a robust and fully recyclable visible&#8208;light photocatalyst that was easily recovered and reused up to five times without any significant drop in yield.







Abstract
The use of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) for the photocatalytic radical formylation of anilines, which represents a more sustainable and attractive alternative to the currently used approaches, is reported herein. Our operationally simple method occurs under mild conditions, employing air as an oxidant. In particular, the chemistry is driven by the ability of g&#8208;CN to reach an electronically excited state upon visible&#8208;light absorption, which has a suitable potential energy to trigger the formation of reactive &#945;&#8208;amino radical species from anilines. Mechanistic investigations also proved the key role of the g&#8208;CN to form reactive superoxide radicals from O2 via single electron transfer. Importantly, this photocatalytic transformation provides a variety of functionalized formamides (15 examples, up to 89&#8201;% yield).

         <title>Hydrogen Bonded Dimer of an Alcohol with the Derived Carboxylic acid Triggering their Sorption by Nanoporous&#8208;crystalline PPO Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene) oxide (PPO) films do not absorb benzyl alcohol (BAL) and benzoic acid (BA) separately from dilute aqueous solutions while exhibiting selective uptake of a BAL/BA equimolar compound, if BA is obtained by oxidizing BAL. Quantitative FTIR evaluations and structural information indicate uptake of a BAL/BA hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer in PPO intrahelical crystalline channels.







Abstract
Films exhibiting nanoporous&#8208;crystalline (NC) phases of poly(2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene) oxide (PPO), which are highly effective to absorb apolar organic guest molecules, are also able to absorb polar molecules (like alcohols and carboxylic acids) but only from concentrated organic solutions. NC PPO films, which do not absorb alcohols and carboxylic acids from diluted aqueous solutions, exhibits a huge uptake (even above 30&#8197;wt&#8201;%) of benzyl alcohol (BAL) and benzoic acid (BA), if BA is obtained by spontaneous room temperature oxidation of BAL in aqueous solution. This phenomenon is rationalized by an easy uptake, mainly by the PPO intrahelical crystalline empty channels, of a BAL/BA 1/1 hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer. This huge uptake of BAL/BA dimer by NC PPO films, which is also fast for films exhibiting the orientation of the crystalline helices perpendicular to the film plane (c&#8869; orientation), can be exploited for purification of water from BAL, when present in traces. High and fast sorption of a hydrogen bonded dimer and negligible sorption of the two separate compounds is possibly unprecedented for absorbent materials.

         <title>Chiral TPE Foldamers in Macrocycles: Aggregation Enhanced Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral macrocycles with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted increasing attention due to the rigid structure, symmetrical chiral geometry and large luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum). &#160;However, most chiral macrocycles are more emissive in solutions but have weakened fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) in aggregates, limiting their further application. In this paper, chiral macrocycle R/S&#8208;PhTPE was synthesized by combining chiral macrocycle architectonics with Z&#8208;o&#8208;phenyltetraphenylethylene (PhTPE) foldamer. Enhanced solution state emission and characteristic aggregation enhanced emission (AEE) effect can be observed for R/S&#8208;PhTPE due to the folded PhTPE conformation. Macrocycle immobilization and folded conformation endow PhTPE moiety with stable helical conformation. Most importantly, R/S&#8208;PhTPE exhibits opposite CPL signals compared with common chiral TPEs, demonstrating the evident impact of folded conformation. This work reports the first and deep insights into the chiroptical properties of chiral PhTPE foldamers, and will provide a new strategy to tune &#1060;F and CPL signals of AIE active chiral macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Triplex&#8208;Forming Isoorotamide PNA Nucleobases for A&#8208;U Recognition of RNA Duplexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four new isoorotamide (Io) containing PNA nucleobases were designed for A&#8208;U recognition of double helical RNA. New PNA monomers were prepared efficiently and incorporated into PNA 9&#8208;mers for binding A&#8208;U in a PNA:RNA2 triplex. Isothermal titration calorimetry and UV thermal melting experiments revealed slightly improved binding affinity for singly&#8208;modified PNA compared to known A&#8208;binding nucleobases. Molecular dynamics simulations provided further insights into binding of Io bases in the triple helix. Together, data revealed interesting insights into binding modes including the notion that three Hoogsteen&#8208;hydrogen bonds are unnecessary for strong selective binding of an extended nucleobase. Cationic monomer Io8 additionally gave the highest affinity observed for an A&#8208;binding nucleobase to date. These results will help inform future nucleobase design toward the goal of recognizing any sequence of double helical RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Hydrolysable Analogues of Cyclic and Branched Condensed Phosphates: Chemistry and Chemical Proteomics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Studies into the biology of condensed phosphates almost exclusively cover linear polyphosphates. However, there is evidence for the presence of cyclic polyphosphates (metaphosphates) in organisms and for enzymatic digestion of branched phosphates (ultraphosphates) with alkaline phosphatase. Further research of non&#8208;linear condensed phosphates in biology would profit from interactome data of such molecules, however, their stability in biological media is limited. Here we present syntheses of modified, non&#8208;hydrolysable analogues of cyclic and branched condensed phosphates, called meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates, and their application in a chemical proteomics approach using yeast cell extracts. We identify putative interactors with overlapping hits for structurally related capture compounds underlining the quality of our results. The datasets serve as starting point to study the biological relevance and functions of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphates. In addition, we examine the reactivity of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates with implications for their &#8220;hydrolysable&#8221; analogues: Efforts to increase the ring&#8208;sizes of meta&#8208; or cyclic ultraphosphonates revealed a strong preference to form trimetaphosphate&#8208;analogue structures by cyclization and/or ring&#8208;contraction. Using carbodiimides for condensation, the so far inaccessible dianhydro product of ultraphosphonate, corresponding to P4O112&#8722;, was selectively obtained and then ring&#8208;opened by different nucleophiles yielding modified cyclic ultraphosphonates.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mild, practical, and environmentally friendly method for the hydrodecarboxylation of fatty acids using an acridine&#8208;based photoredox catalyst and thiophenol was developed. Cn&#8208;1 alkanes were synthesized in good to excellent yields (up to 99%) from C9&#8208;C18 saturated fatty acids under visible light irradiation (405 nm). The developed protocol was employed for a mixture of fatty acids obtained from the hydrolysis of Licuri oil, affording a mixture of C9&#8208;C17 hydrocarbons in quantitative yield, which demonstrates the potential application of the method to produce drop&#8208;in biofuels.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Base&#8208;Assisted Arylation of Unsaturated Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of Lewis bases with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyls allows the in situ generation of enolates without the need for strong Br&#248;nsted bases. Recently developed synthetic methods employ this approach for arylation followed by elimination of the Lewis base, regenerating the alkene. This strategy has been deployed for formal &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;C&#8211;H arylation in different contexts, namely (a) transition metal catalysis, (b) rearrangement reactions utilizing hypervalent main group elements and (c) organocatalysis. This concept article provides an overview of the developed strategies highlighting and contextualizing their features.</dc:description>

         <title>Complexation&#8208;triggered Fluctuation of &#960;&#8208;conjugation on an Antiaromatic Dicyanoanthracene Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of Lewis pairs is an important chemical concept. Recently, the complexation of Lewis acidic tris(pentafluorophenyl)&#8208;borane with Lewis basic moieties and subsequent reduction has emerged as a fascinating strategy for designing novel reactions and structures. The impact of the complexation and subsequent reduction of antiaromatic systems bearing Lewis basic moieties has been investigated. We found how Lewis adduct formation stabilizes an antiaromatic system consisting of 9,10&#8208;dicyanoanthracene and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane using synthesis, X&#8208;ray crystallography, spectroscopic analysis, and quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

We found how Lewis adduct formation stabilizes an antiaromatic system consisting of 9,10-dicyanoanthracene and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane using synthesis, X-ray crystallography, spectroscopic analysis, and quantum chemical calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dispersing LiCl in Zwitterionic COF for Highly Efficient Ammonia Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient and inherently safe NH3 storage and separation are of significant importance for chemical industry. Herein, we proposed zwitterionic COF as porous host to disperse LiCl for highly efficient NH3 storage and separation with record adsorption capacity. The equivalently cationic and anionic groups in the channels of zwitterionic COF could act as two separated sites to facilitate the dispersion of LiCl, hence the optimal composite exhibits a high capture capacity of 44.98 mmol/g at 25&#176;C and 1 bar, far exceeding other existing porous materials. Notably, the adsorption capacity is completely reversible and the efficient separation of NH3 from NH3/CO2/N2 mixture is achieved through breakthrough experiments. DFT calculation combined with XPS and 7Li NMR experimental results give insight into the interaction between zwitterionic COF and LiCl. This work extends possibilities for the development of efficient adsorbents for NH3 storage and separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Non&#8208;Heme Mn Catalysts for Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Oxyfunctionalizations with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, metalloenzymes&#8208;mediated highly selective oxidations of organic substrates under mild conditions have been inspiration for developing synthetic bioinspired catalyst systems, capable of conducting such processes in the laboratory (and, in the future, in industry), relying on easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and environmentally benign oxidants such as H2O2. To date, non&#8208;heme manganese complexes with chiral bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl and structurally related ligands are considered as possessing the highest synthetic potential, having demonstrated the ability to mediate a variety of chemo&#8208; and stereoselective oxidative transformations, such as epoxidations, C(sp3)&#8210;H hydroxylations and ketonizations, oxidative desymmetrizations, kinetic resolutions, etc. Furthermore, in the past few years non&#8208;heme Mn based catalysts have become the major platform for studies focused on getting insight into the molecular mechanisms of oxidant activation and (stereo)selective oxygen transfer, testing non&#8208;traditional hydroperoxide oxidants, engineering catalytic sites with enzyme&#8208;like substrate recognition&#8208;based selectivity, exploration of catalytic regioselectivity trends in the oxidation of biologically active substrates of natural origin. This contribution summarizes the progress in manganese catalyzed C&#8210;H oxygenative transformations of organic substrates, achieved essentially in the past 5 years (late 2018&#8210;2023).</dc:description>

         <title>Photolysis of an Archetypal Model Complex. Photooxidation Versus Photoreduction of Azido(porphinato)iron(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photolysis: The yield and product distribution of the photolysis of the archetypal azidoporphinatoiron(III) complex are examined by stationary and transient IR spectroscopy in conjunction with chemical quenching reactions with iodide and an isonitrile. The complex decomposes almost equally to the Fe(II) and the nitrido&#8208;Fe(V) product, with small absolute yields. Moreover, subsequent bimolecular reactions of the products are considered.







Abstract
Azidoporphinatoiron(III) ([1]) is an archetypal model complex for the photochemical generation of nitridoiron(V) complexes via cleavage of dinitrogen. So far, this process has only been studied with continuous irradiation in thin films under cryogenic conditions or in frozen solutions. In addition, the photooxidation from iron(III) to iron(V) competes with photoreduction to iron(II) via cleavage of an azidyl radical. The quantum yields of both pathways remained hitherto undisclosed. Here, we investigated the photolysis of this model complex in room temperature liquid solution using stationary and time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy. The two reaction pathways are unambiguously identified in quenching studies and their quantum yields are accurately determined. Nitridoporphinatoiron(V) ([2]) exhibits N&#8208;atom&#8208;2&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactivity toward tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile and forms a carbodiimido species. In the presence of tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile, the two products of the photoreduction pathway react to cationic diisonitriloporphinatoiron(III) and azide anions, which in turn combine to reform [1] and the quencher.

         <title>Tuneable plasmonic resonances of a dynamic thin film of ultrasmall nanocrystals modified in the anti&#8208;galvanic reduction process.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (NPs) have revolutionized nanotechnology as they are an excellent starting substrate for the synthesis of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with photonic or energy conversion applications, often with a responsive nature. However, ultrasmall NPs do not sustain plasmonic resonances, preventing their use in plasmon&#8208;related applications. In the presented work, we show a method of chemical modification of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles in order to fabricate dynamically controlled plasmonic thin films. For this purpose, we used the Anti&#8208;Galvanic Reduction process (AGR) to modify the surface of small gold nanoparticles, inducing plasmonic properties without notable size increases. Au@Ag NPs are then modified with liquid crystal&#8208;like organic ligands. The obtained NPs can assemble into densely packed films with long&#8208;range order and temperature&#8208;dependent structural properties. Namely, we detect two, fully reversible phase transitions between the hexagonal and cubic symmetries. The combination of AGR and organic surface modifications enabled us to demonstrate the possibility of managing plasmonic properties in the thin film of ~2 nm diameter metallic NPs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Structure of Maneb, An Important Manganese&#8208;Containing Bis(dithiocarbamate) Fungicide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular structure of Maneb determined: Over 70&#8197;years after patent publication, the mystery of the structure of the surprisingly stable manganese(II)&#8208;containing ethylene bis(dithiocarbamate) fungicide, which is extensively used in agriculture, has finally been solved.







Abstract
Maneb is a manganese(II)&#8208;containing fungicide with a multi&#8208;site effect and no resistance, therefore it is widely applied in many parts of the world. There is, however, mounting evidence for neurotoxic effects with Parkinson&#8208;like symptoms (manganism) related to usage of Maneb. Due to its insolubility in most solvents and its paramagnetism, structural elucidation is not trivial, and thus its exact molecular structure remains unknown. We report herein a synthesis procedure to prepare Maneb reproducibly in pure form and the use of various analytical techniques including X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and electron diffraction to determine the molecular structure of Maneb in the solid state and also in solution.

         <title>Straightforward Synthesis of Halopyridine Aldehydes via Diaminomethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridines featuring two or more halogen atoms react with silylformamidine via insertion into the most acidic C&#8722;H bond either at the &#947; or &#946;&#8208;positions affording the corresponding aminals. Their hydrolysis gave aldehydes. The reaction proceeds via H&#8208;abstraction from pyridines by the strong base&#8208;carbenic form of silylformamidine followed by formation of C&#8722;C bond between the formamidinium cation and the pyridine anion.







Abstract
A novel two&#8208;step method for formylation of fluoropyridines with silylformamidine Me3SiC(=NMe)NMe2 (1) under catalyst&#8208;free conditions was developed. A series of all possible 18&#8197;fluoropyridines featuring one to four fluorine atoms were subjected to the reaction with 1 existing in equilibrium with its carbenic form Me2NC(:)N(Me)SiMe3 (1&#8242;). Among them, 12&#8197;fluoropyridines were shown to react via C&#8722;H insertion. The reaction proceeded either at &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;positions affording the corresponding aminals. The more fluorine atoms in pyridines, the easier the reaction proceeded. We also hypothesized that the pyridines in which the fluorine was substituted by other halogens would react in a similar manner. To test the hypothesis, a set of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with various combination of halogen atoms was prepared. 3,5&#8208;Difluoropyridine was taken as a compound for comparison. All the pyridines in the series also reacted likewise. In most cases, hydrolysis of the aminals afforded the corresponding aldehydes. As DFT calculations indicate, the reaction mechanism includes deprotonation of pyridine by 1&#8242; as a strong base and the following rearrangement of the formed tight ionic pair to the final product. An alternative reaction pathway involving addition of 1&#8242; to the pyridine carbon with the following hydrogen transfer via a three&#8208;membered transition state structure required much higher activation energy.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pyridines&lt;/b&gt; featuring two or more halogen atoms react with silylformamidine via insertion into the most acidic C&#8722;H bond either at the &#947; or &#946;-positions affording the corresponding aminals. Their hydrolysis gave aldehydes. The reaction proceeds via H-abstraction from pyridines by the strong base-carbenic form of silylformamidine followed by formation of C&#8722;C bond between the formamidinium cation and the pyridine anion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel two-step method for formylation of fluoropyridines with silylformamidine Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiC(=NMe)NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1)&lt;/b&gt; under catalyst-free conditions was developed. A series of all possible 18&#8197;fluoropyridines featuring one to four fluorine atoms were subjected to the reaction with &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; existing in equilibrium with its carbenic form Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NC(:)N(Me)SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&#8242;)&lt;/b&gt;. Among them, 12&#8197;fluoropyridines were shown to react via C&#8722;H insertion. The reaction proceeded either at &#946;- or &#947;-positions affording the corresponding aminals. The more fluorine atoms in pyridines, the easier the reaction proceeded. We also hypothesized that the pyridines in which the fluorine was substituted by other halogens would react in a similar manner. To test the hypothesis, a set of 3,5-disubstituted pyridines with various combination of halogen atoms was prepared. 3,5-Difluoropyridine was taken as a compound for comparison. All the pyridines in the series also reacted likewise. In most cases, hydrolysis of the aminals afforded the corresponding aldehydes. As DFT calculations indicate, the reaction mechanism includes deprotonation of pyridine by &lt;b&gt;1&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; as a strong base and the following rearrangement of the formed tight ionic pair to the final product. An alternative reaction pathway involving addition of &lt;b&gt;1&#8242;&lt;/b&gt; to the pyridine carbon with the following hydrogen transfer via a three-membered transition state structure required much higher activation energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterocyclic Merging of Stereochemically Diverse Chiral Piperazines and Morpholines with Indazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study accomplishes the heterocyclic merging of piperazines and morpholines with indazoles, successfully produced 20 distinct regio and stereochemically diverse indazolo&#8208;piperazine and indazolo&#8208;morpholine derivatives. This process could possibly be expanded to provide an efficient synthetic route that allows stereochemical and regiochemical variation in the assembly. We hypothesize that merging will afford compounds with biological activities that are unique from those of the simpler scaffolds that make up their merged structure.&gt;







Abstract
We report a heterocyclic merging approach to construct novel indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines. Starting from chiral diamines and amino alcohols, novel regiochemically (1,3 and 1,4) and stereochemically diverse (relative and absolute) cohorts of indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines were obtained within six or seven steps. The key transformations involved are a Smiles rearrangement to generate the indazole core structure and a late&#8208;stage Michael addition to build the piperazine and morpholine heterocycles. We further explored additional vector diversity by incorporating substitutions on the indazole aromatic ring, generating a total of 20 unique, enantiomerically pure heterocyclic scaffolds.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrochemiluminescence from Imidazole&#8208;Based Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imidazole&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters have been synthesized and characterized. The electrochemiluminescence efficiency of such compounds is dictated by the presence of electrochemical reversible redox processes rather than by their photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yields and excited&#8208;state lifetimes. Moreover, the imidazole moiety can be alkylated enabling the insertion of a derivatizable group.







Abstract
A family of novel thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters has been synthesized by a straightforward and metal&#8208;free synthesis, and structurally characterized. In this work we kept the acceptor moiety, 4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzonitrile, fixed and systemically tested different donors to correlate their photophysical and electrochemical properties with their performance in electrochemiluminescence using both benzoyl peroxide as co&#8208;reactant and co&#8208;reactant free (annihilation) conditions. Some compounds exceeded the efficiency of the standard [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 by up to 28&#8197;times with benzoyl peroxide and 38&#8197;times in annihilation. Interestingly, we found that the efficiency is mainly dictated by the electrochemical reversibility of the redox processes rather than by the photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yields or excited&#8208;state lifetime. In addition, the annihilation electrochemiluminescence efficiency strongly depends on the pulse sequence. The imidazole moiety can be conveniently alkylated, thus allowing the insertion of functional groups, such a carboxylic acid, and enabling practical applications.

         <title>Acid&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Amide Supramolecular Synthon for Tuning Amino Acid&#8208;Based Hydrogels&#8217; Properties</title>

The self&#8208;assembly of the well&#8208;known efficient gelator N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;l&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;phenylalanine, in the presence of a strong hydrogen bond&#8208;forming non&#8208;gelator, like benzamide, is driven by the same supramolecular interactions both in the crystal and hydrogel phase. This matching could open the way to a crystal engineering&#8208;based approach for the design of multicomponent amino acid hydrogels with tunable strength and properties.







Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels formed by the self&#8208;assembly of N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine derivatives are gaining relevance for several applications in the materials and biomedical fields. In the challenging attempt to predict or tune their properties, we selected Fmoc&#8208;pentafluorophenylalanine (1) as a model efficient gelator, and studied its self&#8208;assembly in the presence of benzamide (2), a non&#8208;gelator able to form strong hydrogen bonds with the amino acid carboxylic group. Equimolar mixtures of 1 and 2 in organic solvents afforded a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 co&#8208;crystal thanks to the formation of an acid&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amide heterodimeric supramolecular synthon. The same synthon occurred in the transparent gels formed by mixing the two components in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio in aqueous media, as revealed by structural, spectroscopic, and thermal characterizations performed on both the co&#8208;crystal powder and the lyophilized hydrogel. These findings revealed the possibility of modulating the properties of amino acid&#8208;based hydrogels by involving the gelator in the formation of a co&#8208;crystal. Such a crystal engineering&#8208;based approach is shown also to be useful for the time&#8208;delayed release of suitable bioactive molecules, when involved as hydrogel coformers.

         <title>Sheltering Mono&#8208;P&#8208;Ligated Metal Complexes in Porous Polystyrene Monolith: Effect of Aryl Pendant Stabilizers on Catalytic Durability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mono&#8208;ligated phosphine&#8208;metal complexes on porous polystyrene monoliths exhibited high catalytic durabilities by screening the electronic properties of aryl pendant groups. The quantitative analyses of interactions between aryl pendant groups and metal center revealed the importance of moderate stabilization for long&#8208;term catalysis in continuous&#8208;flow cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Metal centers that can generate coordinatively unsaturated metals in accessible and stable states have been developed using synthetic polymers with sophisticated ligand and scaffold designs, which required synthetic efforts. Herein, we report a simple and direct strategy for producing polymer&#8208;supported phosphine&#8208;metal complexes, which stabilizes mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligated metals by modulating the electronic properties of the aryl pendant groups in the polymer platform. A three&#8208;fold vinylated PPh3 was copolymerized with a styrene derivative and a cross&#8208;linker to produce a porous polystyrene&#8208;phosphine hybrid monolith. Based on the Hammett substituent constants, the electronic properties of styrene derivatives were modulated and incorporated into the polystyrene backbone to stabilize the mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligated Pd complex via Pd&#8208;arene interactions. Through NMR, TEM, and comparative catalytic studies, the polystyrene&#8208;phosphine hybrid, which induces selective mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligation and moderate Pd&#8208;arene interactions, demonstrated high catalytic durability for the cross&#8208;coupling of chloroarenes under continuous&#8208;flow conditions.

         <title>Improved catalytic performance toward selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols originated from new open&#8208;framework copper molybdovanadate with a unique V/Mo ratio</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid open&#8208;framework molybdovanadate with mixed&#8208;valences of vanadium (V4+/V5+ =4/3) and molybdenum (Mo5+/Mo6+ =8/2) cations has been synthesized for the first time. The complex possesses the unique V/Mo ratio (7/10), fascinating 8&#8208;C topological network and 1D 4&#8208;MR channels (7.793 &#197; &#215; 6.699 &#197;). Importantly, its catalytic activities for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (oxidant: H2O2, wt % = 30 %) have been well evaluated. The results indicated that it exhibited improved catalytic activities (conv.: 96.8 %) compared with the catalyst (Cpyr)5PV2Mo5W5O40 [Conv.: 88.51 %, Cpyr = (C16H32C5H4N)+)], high recyclability and structural stability. Moreover, the conversions and selectivities (Conv.: 82.4&#8208;92.5 %; Sele.: 91.5&#8208;95.7 %) of the substrates containing electron donating groups (&#8208;OH, &#8208;CH3, &#8208;OCH3 and &#8208;Cl) were significantly higher than those of the substrate containing electron withdrawing group (&#8208;NO2) (Conv. 67.4 %; Sele. 80.8 %). This is due to the fact that the &#8208;NO2 with a large Hammett substituent constant (&#963;) is not conducive to the generation of transition state products. The studies revealed the complex could act as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst in selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Mono&#8208; and Dinuclear Boron Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dinuclear bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) borane adduct 2 rapidly reacts with tritylium salts at room temperature but the outcome is strongly impacted by the respective counter&#8208;ion. Using tritylium tetrakis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy)aluminate affords &#8211; depending on the solvent &#8211; either the bis(boronium) ion 4 or the hydride&#8208;bridged dication 5. In case of tritylium hexafluorophosphate, however, H/F exchange occurs between boron and phosphorus yielding the dinuclear BF3 adduct 3 along with phosphorus dihydride trifluoride. H/F exchange also takes place when using the mononuclear N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene BH3 adduct 6 and hence provides a facile route to PH2F3, which is usually synthesized in more complex reaction sequences regularly involving toxic hydrogen fluoride. DFT calculations shed light on the H/F exchange between the borenium ion and the [PF6]&#8208; counter&#8208;ion and the computed mechanism features only small barriers in line with the experimental observations.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Addition and &#946;&#8208;hydride Elimination by a Macrocyclic Dinickel Complex: Observing Bimetallic Elementary Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dinickel(I) complex Ni2(tBuPONNOPONNO), featuring a planar macrocyclic diphosphoranide ligand tBuPONNOPONNO, offers a unique architectural platform for observing bimetallic elementary reactions. Oxidative addition reactions of alkyl halides produce dinickel(II) complexes of the type Ni2(&#956;&#8208;R)(&#956;&#8208;X)(tBuPONNOPONNO). However, when R = Et &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is observed to form a dinickel monohydride, with the rate dependent on the nature of X. DFT studies suggest a new mechanism for bimetallic &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, where the rate dependence arises from the steric pressure imposed by the X group on the opposing trans face of the dinickel macrocycle. This work enhances understanding of bimetallic elementary reactions, particularly &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination, which have not been well&#8208;explored for dinuclear systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Doping heteroatoms into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may alter their structures and thereby physical properties. Herein, we report the construction of B/N&#8208;codoped PAHs via combining the B&#8208; and N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems. Two &#960;&#8208;extended B/N&#8208;codoped PAHs were synthesized through the Mallory photoreaction. Both of them feature a C48BN2 &#960;&#8208;skeleton, which is assembled by linearly fusing three substructures including B&#8208;doped and sp2&#8208;hybridized N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;moieties and one pyrene unit. In comparison to the pristine B&#8208;doped analog, their intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states are distinctly modulated by the fused N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system and the further incorporated cyano group, leading to their tunable optical properties, as revealed by detailed theoretical and experimental analysis. Furthermore, these three molecules have sufficient Lewis acidity and can coordinate with Lewis base to form Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts, and notably, such intermolecular complexation can further dynamically modulate their ICT transitions and thereby photophysical properties, such as producing blue, green and red fluorescences.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the CO2 hydrogenation performance of Fe&#8208;based catalyst via unique confinement effect of the carbon shell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Even though Fe&#8208;based catalysts have been widely employed for CO2 hydrogenation into hydrocarbons, oxygenates, liquid fuels, etc., the precise regulation of their physicochemical properties is needed to enhance the catalytic performance. Herein, under the guidance of the traditional concept in heterogeneous catalysis&#8208;confinement effect, we construct a core&#8208;shell structured catalyst Na&#8208;Fe3O4@C to boost the CO2 hydrogenation performance. Benefiting from the carbon&#8208;chain growth limitation, tailorable H2/CO2 ratio on the catalytic interface, and unique electronic property that all endowed by the confinement effect, the selectivity and space&#8208;time yield of light olefins (C2=&#8208;C4=) are as high as 47.4% and 15.9 g molFe&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, respectively, which are all notably higher than that from the shell&#8208;less counterpart. The function mechanism of the confinement effect in Fe&#8208;based catalysts are clarified in detail by multiple characterization and density functional theory (DFT). This work may offer a new prospect for the rational design of CO2 hydrogenation catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Green and facile preparation of covalent organic frameworks based on reaction medium for advanced applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a new class of crystalline, well&#8208;ordered, and porous materials with intermittent constructions, are formed via organic structural parts connected through covalent bonds. These materials have been employed in several fields comprising pollutant adsorption and separation, catalysis, electrical conductivity, gas storage, etc. The preparation of COFs is mainly applied in tubes with high temperatures and degassing treatment. Furthermore, the reaction medium is involved in toxic organic solvents like toluene, dioxane, mesitylene, acetonitrile, and so on. Hence, discovering clean medium and green approaches have attracted wide attention. Recently, facial, less dangerous, and greener methods have been developed for COFs synthesis in diverse applications like performing the reaction at ambient temperature or employing aqueous solvents, ionic liquids, and a mixture of organic solvents/water.

These materials have been employed in several fields comprising pollutant adsorption and separation, catalysis, electrical conductivity, gas storage, etc. The preparation of COFs is mainly applied in tubes with high temperatures and degassing treatment. Furthermore, the reaction medium is involved in toxic organic solvents like toluene, dioxane, mesitylene, acetonitrile, and so on. Hence, discovering clean medium and green approaches have attracted wide attention. Recently, facial, less dangerous, and greener methods have been developed for COFs synthesis in diverse applications like performing the reaction at ambient temperature or employing aqueous solvents, ionic liquids, and a mixture of organic solvents/water. This review article summarizes the eco-friendly production approaches of COFs for diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) have emerged as a very active area of research in glycoscience and nutrition. HMO are involved in the early development of infants and may help to prevent certain diseases. The development of chemical methods for obtaining individual HMO aids the global effort dedicated to understanding the roles of these biomolecules. Reported herein is the chemical synthesis of two common core hexasaccharides found in human milk, i. e.para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose (pLNH) and para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose (pLNnH). After screening multiple leaving groups and temporary protecting group combinations, we found that a 3+3 convergent coupling strategy works best for obtaining these linear glycans.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphenylpyrrole&#8208;Strapped Calix[4]pyrrole Extractant for the Fluoride and Chloride Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anion binding features of diphenylpyrrole&#8208;strapped calix[4]pyrrole 1 have been investigated by means of 1H NMR spectroscopy and ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry), as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Receptor 1 bearing an auxiliary pyrrolic NH donor and solubilizing phenyl groups on the strap was found to bind F&#8211;, Cl&#8211;, and Br&#8211;as their tetrabutylammonium salts with high affinity in DMSO&#8208;d6. In addition, receptor 1 was found to extract the fluoride anion (as both its tetraethylammonium (TEA+) and tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salts), as well as the chloride anion into chloroform&#8208;d from an aqueous source phase. Cation metathesis using TBAI or the use of a dual host approach involving crown ethers enabled receptor 1 to extract simple alkali metal fluoride or chloride salts from water. Quantitative binding of NaF by receptor 1 was observed in 20% D2O&#8208;DMSO&#8208;d6 allowing for the direct determination of the NaF concentration in an unknown sample.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Photochromic Phosphines by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation Reaction of Alkynes bearing Phosphinyl Substituent with a Silacyclopropene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of phosphines with light controlled basicity is presented in this study. A methodological approach for the preparation of these unconventional photochromic phosphines based on a dithienylethene organic moiety is reported. It relies on the palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of alkynyl phosphines in the presence of a 2,3&#8208;Dithienylsilacyclopropene. Accordingly, a diphenyphosphino moiety is connected to the organic photochrome thanks to different linkers. Their influence on the photochromism and on the phosphinyl group basicity is studied and evaluated based on experimental an NMR descriptor as well as DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State [4+4] Cycloaddition and Cycloreversion with Use of Unpaired Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donors to Achieve Solvatomorphism and Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crystal structure of a commercially available anthracene derivative, anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;thiocarboxamide, is reported here for the first time, and we demonstrate that the compound undergoes a [4+4] cycloaddition in the solid state to afford facile synthesis of the cycloadduct (CA). The cycloaddition is also reversible in the solid state using heat or mechanical force. Due to the presence of unpaired, strong hydrogen&#8208;bond donor atoms on the CA, significant solvatomorphism is achieved, and components of the solvatomorphs self&#8208;assemble into four different classes of supramolecular structures. The CA readily crystallizes with a variety of structurally&#8208;diverse solvents including those containing oxygen&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, or pi&#8208;acceptors. Some of the solvents the CA crystallized with include thiophene, benzene, and the three xylene isomers; thus, we employed the CA in industrially&#8208;relevant solvent separation. However, in competition studies, the CA did not exhibit selectivity. Lastly, we demonstrate that the CA crystallizes with vinyl&#8208;containing monomers and is currently the only compound that crystallizes with both widely used monomers 4&#8208;vinylpyridine and styrene. Solid&#8208;state complexation of the CA with the monomers affords over a 50 &#176;C increase in the monomer&#8217;s thermal stabilities. We expect the strategy of designing molecules with unused donors can be applied to achieve separations or volatile liquid stabilization.</dc:description>

In with the old: Perylene diimide, one of the oldest electron acceptors, was functionalized with group&#8197;14 elements in the bay position. The influence of these substitutions on their properties and performance in organic photovoltaics was thoroughly studied.







Abstract
Organic solar cells have been continuously studied and developed through the last decades. A major step in their development was the introduction of fused&#8208;ring non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors. Yet, beside their high efficiency, they suffer from complex synthesis and stability issues. Perylene&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, in contrast, can be prepared in only a few steps and display good photochemical and thermal stability. Herein, we introduce four monomeric perylene diimide acceptors obtained in a three&#8208;step synthesis. In these molecules, the semimetals silicon and germanium were added in the bay position, on one or both sides of the molecules, resulting in asymmetric and symmetric compounds with a red&#8208;shifted absorption compared to unsubstituted perylene diimide. Introducing two germanium atoms improved the crystallinity and charge carrier mobility in the blend with the conjugated polymer PM6. In addition, charge carrier separation is significantly influenced by the high crystallinity of this blend, as shown by transient absorption spectroscopy. As a result, the solar cells reached a power conversion efficiency of 5.38&#8201;%, which is one of the highest efficiencies of monomeric perylene diimide&#8208;based solar cells recorded to date.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Mediated H&#8208;Aggregates of Cyanine Dyes for Effective Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H&#8208;aggregation behaviors of cyanine dyes induced by metal ions Fe2+ or Mn2+ for effective photothermal therapy have been studied. The ROS (O2&#8722;) generation efficiency varies depending on the extent of H&#8208;aggregates, which further affects their photothermal stability. Thus, the photothermal performance of Cy&#8208;3COOH/M NPs could be manipulated by the degree of H&#8208;aggregation.







Abstract
Integration of cyanine dyes and metal ions into one nanoplatform via metal&#8208;coordination interactions is an effective strategy to build multimodality phototheranostics. The multifunctionalities of the formed nanoscale metal&#8211;organic particles (NMOPs) have been widely explored. However, the effect of metal&#8208;coordination interaction on the aggregation behavior of cyanine dyes is rarely reported. Herein, we reported the H&#8208;aggregation behavior of cyanine dye Cy&#8208;3COOH induced by different metal ions M (Fe2+ or Mn2+). Moreover, the extent of H&#8208;aggregates varied with different metal&#8208;coordination interactions. Upon NIR irradiation, H&#8208;aggregates of Cy&#8208;3COOH remarkably promoted photothermal conversion efficiency. Interestingly, we also find that H&#8208;aggregates of Cy&#8208;3COOH induced by metal ions can generate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) involving singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;&#8901;) upon light irradiation. In addition, the ROS efficiency varies depending on the extent of H&#8208;aggregates. Additionally, the photoinduced ROS could disassemble aggregates and decompose cyanine dye Cy&#8208;3COOH, which limits the photothermal capability of Cy&#8208;3COOH/M NPs. Therefore, the photothermal performance of Cy&#8208;3COOH/M NPs could be manipulated by the degree of H&#8208;aggregation. This would provide a new insight to develop efficient phototheranostics NMOPs for cancer treatment.

&lt;p&gt;H-aggregation behaviors of cyanine dyes induced by metal ions Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for effective photothermal therapy have been studied. The ROS (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) generation efficiency varies depending on the extent of H-aggregates, which further affects their photothermal stability. Thus, the photothermal performance of Cy-3COOH/M NPs could be manipulated by the degree of H-aggregation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integration of cyanine dyes and metal ions into one nanoplatform via metal-coordination interactions is an effective strategy to build multimodality phototheranostics. The multifunctionalities of the formed nanoscale metal&#8211;organic particles (NMOPs) have been widely explored. However, the effect of metal-coordination interaction on the aggregation behavior of cyanine dyes is rarely reported. Herein, we reported the H-aggregation behavior of cyanine dye Cy-3COOH induced by different metal ions M (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, the extent of H-aggregates varied with different metal-coordination interactions. Upon NIR irradiation, H-aggregates of Cy-3COOH remarkably promoted photothermal conversion efficiency. Interestingly, we also find that H-aggregates of Cy-3COOH induced by metal ions can generate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) involving singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and superoxide anion radical (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;) upon light irradiation. In addition, the ROS efficiency varies depending on the extent of H-aggregates. Additionally, the photoinduced ROS could disassemble aggregates and decompose cyanine dye Cy-3COOH, which limits the photothermal capability of Cy-3COOH/M NPs. Therefore, the photothermal performance of Cy-3COOH/M NPs could be manipulated by the degree of H-aggregation. This would provide a new insight to develop efficient phototheranostics NMOPs for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Migratory and Cytotoxic Activities of [Ga(8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato)3]: Roles of Endogenous Cu(II) and Drug&#8208;Induced Phenotypic Changes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[GaQ3] (Q=8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato) is the first metal complex likely to induce terminal differentiation in invasive human cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) that could be used in differentiation cancer therapy, when combined with the highly cytotoxic [CuQ2] generated in&#8197;situ by partial ligand release.







Abstract
As shown by IncuCyte Zoom imaging proliferation assays, invasive triple&#8208;negative human breast MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cancer cells treated with sub&#8208;toxic doses (5.0&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;M, 72&#8197;h) of [GaQ3] (Q=8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato) caused profound morphological changes and inhibition of cell migration, which were likely due to terminal cell differentiation or similar phenotypical change. This is the first demonstration of potential use of a metal complex in differentiation anti&#8208;cancer therapy. Additionally, a trace amount of Cu(II) (0.20&#8197;&#956;M) added to the medium dramatically increased [GaQ3] cytotoxicity (IC50~2&#8197;&#956;M, 72&#8197;h) due to its partial dissociation and the action of the HQ ligand as a Cu(II) ionophore, as shown with electrospray mass spectrometry and fluorescence spectroscopy assays in the medium. Hence, cytotoxicity of [GaQ3] is strongly linked to ligand binding of essential metal ions in the medium, for example, Cu(II). Appropriate delivery mechanisms of such complexes and their ligands could enable a powerful new triple therapeutic approach for cancer chemotherapy, including cytotoxicity against primary tumour, arrest of metastases, and activation of innate and adaptive immune responses.

         <title>Photochemical [2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and maleimides is described as a convenient method for the synthesis of polysubstituted borylated cyclobutenes tolerating a wide range of functional groups. Physicochemical and structural properties of the products obtained provide rationale for their application as phthalimide isosteric replacements, for example, in Thalidomide. Mechanistic studies confirm that the [2+2] cycloaddition proceeds through initial excitation of the maleimide component.







Abstract
A photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and maleimides is reported. The developed protocol provided 35&#8211;70&#8201;% yield of maleimide&#8208;derived cyclobutenyl boronates and demonstrated wide compatibility with various functional groups. The synthetic utility of the prepared building blocks was demonstrated for a range of transformations, including Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling, catalytic or metal&#8208;hydride reduction, oxidation, and cycloaddition reactions. With aryl&#8208;substituted alkynyl boronates, the products of double [2+2] cycloaddition were obtained predominantly. Using the developed protocol, a cyclobutene&#8208;derived analogue of Thalidomide was prepared in one step. Mechanistic studies supported the participation of the triplet&#8208;excited state maleimides and ground state alkynyl boronates in the key step of the process.

         <title>Effects of the Magnetic Orientation of M13 Bacteriophage on Phage Display Selection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although phage display selection using a library of M13 bacteriophage has become a powerful tool for finding peptides binding to target materials, a remaining concern of this method is the interference by the M13 main body, which is a huge filament &gt;103 times larger than the displayed peptide, and therefore would nonspecifically adhere to the target or sterically inhibit the binding of the displayed peptide. Meanwhile, filamentous phages are known to be orientable by a magnetic field. If M13 filaments are magnetically oriented during the selection, their angular arrangement toward the target surface would be changed, being expected to control the interference by the M13 main body. Here we report that the magnetic orientation of M13 filaments vertical to the target surface significantly affects the selection. When the target surface was affinitive to the M13 main body, this orientation notably suppressed the nonspecific adhesion. Furthermore, when the target surface was less affinitive to the M13 main body and intrinsically free from the nonspecific adhesion, this orientation drastically changed the population of M13 clones obtained through selection. Our method of using no chemicals but only a physical stimulus, is simple, clean, and expected to expand the scope of phage display selection.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Hydrogen Storage Capacity in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: A Bayesian Optimization Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks (MOFs) can be employed for gas storage, capture, and sensing.&#160; Finding the MOF with the best adsorption property from a big database is usual for adsorption calculations. In high&#8208;throughput computational research, the expense of computing thermodynamic quantities limits the finding of MOFs for separations and storage.&#160;In this work, we demonstrate the usefulness of Bayesian optimization (BO) for estimating the H2 uptake capability of MOFs by using an existing dataset containing 98 000 real as well as hypothetical MOFs. It is demonstrated that in order to recover the best candidate MOFs, less than 0.027% of the database needs to be screened using the BO method. This allows future adsorption experiments on a small sample of MOFs to be undertaken with minimal experimental effort by effectively screening MOF databases. In addition, the presented BO can provide comprehensible material design insights, and the framework will be transferable to the setting of other target properties. We suggest using particle swarm optimisation (PSO), a swarm intelligence technique in artificial intelligence, to estimate MOFs' H2 uptake potential to achieve results comparable to BO. In addition, we have implemented the novel evolutionary&#8208;PSO (EPSO) method for comparison research and found some extremely interesting outcomes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals represent a peculiar class of heterocyclic merocyanines, compounds bearing pronounced and rather short dipoles with great push&#8208;pull characteristics that define their rich properties. They are accessible via a wide array of synthetic concepts and procedures, ranging from addition&#8208;elimination and condensation procedures up to rearrangement and metal&#8208;mediated reactions. With our work from 2020, aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals have been identified as powerful and promising dyes with pronounced and vastly tunable solid&#8208;state emission and aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. One characteristic trademark of this class of dye molecules is the level of control that could be exerted and which was thoroughly explored. Based on these results, the field was opened to extend the system to bi&#8208; and multichromophoric systems by the full toolkit of synthetic organic chemistry thus giving access to even more exciting properties and manifolded substance libraries capitalizing on the AIE properties. This review aims at outlining the reaction&#8208;based principles that allow for a swift and facile access to aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals, their methodological and structural evolution and the plethora of fluorescence and aggregation properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Slow Magnetization Relaxation in a Family of Triangular {CoIII2LnIII} Clusters: The Effect of Diamagnetic CoIII Ions on the LnIII Magnetic Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first use of the Schiff base chelate N&#8208;naphthalidene&#8208;o&#8208;aminophenol (naphH2) in Co/Ln chemistry has afforded a family of isostructural [CoIII2LnIII(OMe)2(naph)2(O2CMe)3(MeOH)2] (Ln = Tb, Dy and Er) complexes, revealing a rare {CoIII2Ln(&#956;3&#8208;OMe)}8+ triangular core composed of two diamagnetic CoIII ions and a 4f&#8208;ion with slightly distorted square antiprismatic geometry. Alternating current (ac) magnetic susceptibility studies revealed that {Co2Dy}, and its magnetic diluted analogue {Co2Dy0.05Y0.95}, behave as mononuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with similar energy barriers for the magnetization reversal, Ueff, of ~85&#8208;90 K. SMM properties were also detected for {Co2Er}, with the compound exhibiting a Ueff of 18.7 K under an applied magnetic field of 800 Oe. To interpret the experimental magnetic results, ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO and DFT calculations were performed as a means of exploring the single&#8208;ion characteristics of LnIII ions and comprehend the role of the diamagnetic CoIII ions in the magnetization relaxation of the three heterometallic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic nucleobase modification of oligonucleotides by Sonogashira coupling and influence of alkynyl modifications on the duplex&#8208;forming ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, we reported that the alkynyl modification of nucleobases mitigates the toxicity of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) while maintaining the efficacy. However, the general effect of alkynyl modifications on the duplex&#8208;forming ability of oligonucleotides (ONs) is unclear. In this study, post&#8208;synthetic nucleobase modification by Sonogashira coupling in aqueous medium was carried out to efficiently evaluate the physiological properties of various ONs with alkynyl&#8208;modified nucleobases. Although several undesired reactions, including nucleobase cyclization, were observed, various types of alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs were successfully obtained via Sonogashira coupling of ONs containing iodinated nucleobases. Evaluation of the stability of the duplex formed by the synthesized alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs showed that the alkynyl modification of pyrimidine was less tolerated than that of purine, although both the modifications occurred in the major groove of the duplex. These results can be attributed to the bond angle of the alkyne on the pyrimidine and the close proximity of the alkynyl substituents to the phosphodiester backbone. The synthetic method developed in this study may contribute to the screening of the optimal chemical modification of ASO because various alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs that are effective in reducing the toxicity of ASO can be easily synthesized by this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Weakly Self&#8208;Assembled [6]helicenes:&#160;Circularly Polarized Light and Spin Filtering Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein on the self&#8208;assembling features, chiroptical activity, and spin filtering properties of 2,15&#8208; and 4,13&#8208;disubstituted [6]helicenes decorated in their periphery with 3,4,5&#8208;tris(dodecyloxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)benzamide moieties. The weak non&#8208;covalent interaction between these units conditions the corresponding circularly polarized luminescence and spin polarization. The self&#8208;assembly is overall weak for these [6]helicene derivatives that, despite the formation of H&#8208;bonding interactions between the amide groups present in the peripheral moieties, shows very similar chiroptical properties both in the monomeric or aggregated states. This effect could be explained by considering the steric effect that these groups could generate in the growing of the corresponding aggregate formed. Importantly, the self&#8208;assembling features also condition chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS effect), with experimental spin polarization (SP) values found between 35&#8208;40% for both systems, as measured by magnetic&#8208;conducting atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique.</dc:description>

         <title>Acetylene Semi&#8208;hydrogenation at Room Temperature over Pd&#8208;Zn Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetylene impurity in the ethylene feedstock used in the polyethylene industry poisons the Ziegler&#8208;Natta catalyst which adversely affects the polymer quality. Pd based catalysts often employed for converting acetylene into ethylene, involves a tradeoff between the conversion and the selectivity and generally requires high temperatures. Here, bimetallic Pd&#8208;Zn nanoparticles capped by hexadecylamine (HDA) have been synthesized by co&#8208;digestive ripening of Pd and Zn nanoparticles and studied for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene. The catalyst showed a high selectivity of ~85% towards ethylene with a high ethylene productivity to the tune of ~4341 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 min&#8208;1, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. It also exhibited excellent stability with ethylene selectivity remaining greater than 85% even after 70 h on stream. This is the first report of room temperature acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation, with the catalyst effecting high amount of acetylene conversion to ethylene retaining excellent selectivity and stability among all the reported catalysts thus far. DFT calculations show that the disordered Pd&#8208;Zn nanocatalyst exhibits a change in the d&#8208;band center of Pd and Zn which in turn enhances the selectivity towards ethylene. In&#8208;depth analysis into the reaction mechanism, indicate the key role of particle size, surface area, Pd&#8208;Zn interactions, and the capping agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;Stabilized Phosphinidene Oxide, Imide and Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene was used to prepare phosphinidene oxide, imide and sulfide. Labile phosphinidene oxide and imide were trapped with p&#8208;tolyl isocyanate, the mechanism of the process was elaborated by DFT calculations. Phosphinidene sulfide was isolated and structurally characterized.







Abstract
Oxidation of a base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene (&#954;2&#8208;NNP)P (12, NNP=phosphinoamidinate) with N2O afforded a labile phosphinidene oxide (&#954;2&#8208;NNP)P=O (16) which was characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Further oxidation of 16 by N2O or reaction of 12 with two equivalents of pyridine oxide afforded the isolable dioxide (&#954;2&#8208;NNP)PO2 which was characterized by NMR and SC XRD. Trapping of 16 with tolyl isocyanate resulted in P=O/N=C metathesis, eventually affording a urea&#8208;ligated phosphine (&#954;1&#8208;NNP)P(NTol)2C=O (17) The mechanism of this reaction was elucidated by DFT calculations. Reactions of phosphinidene 12 with azides generated transient imines (NNP)P=NR, which in the case of R=Tol underwent cycloaddition with tolyl Isocyanate to afford the urea product 17, and in the case of R=SiMe3 reacts with N3SiMe3 via the addition of N&#8722;Si across the P=N bond affording, after the extrusion of dinitrogen, a P,N&#8208;heterocyclic compound. Both products of the reactions with azides have been fully characterized, both in solution and the solid&#8208;state. Finally, reaction of phosphinidene 12 with one equivalent of sulfur resulted in the isolation of the base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene sulfide (&#954;2&#8208;NNP)P=S that has also been fully characterized.

A membrane&#8208;free decoupled alkaline water electrolyzer was constructed using a graphite felt supported nickel&#8208;cobalt phosphate material as the tri&#8208;functional electrode, which significantly improves the flexibility of water splitting.







Abstract
Water electrolysis has been considered a promising technology for the conversion of renewables to hydrogen. However, preventing mixing of products (H2 and O2) and exploring cost&#8208;efficient electrolysis components remains challenging for conventional water electrolyzers. Herein, we designed a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis system by using graphite felt supported nickel&#8208;cobalt phosphate (GF@NixCoy&#8208;P) material as a tri&#8208;functional (redox mediator, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) electrode. The versatile GF@Ni1Co1&#8208;P electrode obtained by a one&#8208;step electrodeposition not only exhibits high specific capacity (176&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (80&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles) as a redox mediator, but also has relatively outstanding catalytic activities for HER and OER. The excellent properties of the GF@NixCoy&#8208;P electrode endow this decoupled system with more flexibility for H2 production by fluctuating renewable energies. This work provides guidance for multifunctional applications of transition metal compounds between energy storage and electrocatalysis.

         <title>Panchromatic Light&#8208;Capturing Bis&#8208;styryl BODIPY&#8208;Perylenediimide Donor&#8208;Acceptor Constructs: Occurrence of Sequential Energy Transfer Followed by Electron Transfer</title>

Two wide&#8208;band&#8208;capturing donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates featuring bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY and perylenediimide have been newly synthesized, and the occurrence of ultrafast excitation transfer from the singlet excited perylenediimide to BODIPY, and subsequent electron transfer from the excited BODIPY to PDI have been demonstrated.







Abstract
Two wide&#8208;band&#8208;capturing donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates featuring bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY and perylenediimide (PDI) have been newly synthesized, and the occurrence of ultrafast excitation transfer from the 1PDI* to BODIPY, and a subsequent electron transfer from the 1BODIPY* to PDI have been demonstrated. Optical absorption studies revealed panchromatic light capture but offered no evidence of ground&#8208;state interactions between the donor and acceptor entities. Steady&#8208;state fluorescence and excitation spectral recordings provided evidence of singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer in these dyads, and quenched fluorescence of bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY emission in the dyads suggested additional photo&#8208;events. The facile oxidation of bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY and facile reduction of PDI, establishing their relative roles of electron donor and acceptor, were borne out by electrochemical studies. The electrostatic potential surfaces of the S1 and S2 states, derived from time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations, supported excited charge transfer in these dyads. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies on one&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidized and one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced dyads and the monomeric precursor compounds were also performed in a thin&#8208;layer optical cell under corresponding applied potentials. From this study, both bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY&#8901;+ and PDI&#8901;&#8722; could be spectrally characterizes and were subsequently used in characterizing the electron&#8208;transfer products. Finally, pump&#8211;probe spectral studies were performed in dichlorobenzene under selective PDI and bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY excitation to secure energy and electron&#8208;transfer evidence. The measured rate constants for energy transfer, kENT, were in the range of 1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, while the electron transfer rate constants, kET, were in the range of 1010&#8197;s&#8722;1, thus highlighting their potential use in solar energy harvesting and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A New Pathway for the Synthesis of Ketones from Aldehydes and Sulfonylhydrazones: Is Diazo the Key Intermediate?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and efficient method suitable for the preparation of a wide variety of ketones via new intermediate V has been developed.







Abstract
A new pathway via a cyclic intermediate for the synthesis of ketones from aldehydes and sulfonylhydrazone derivatives under basic conditions is proposed. Several control experiments were performed along with analysis of the mass spectra and in&#8208;situ IR spectra of the reaction mixture. Inspired by the new mechanism, an efficient and scalable method for homologation of aldehydes to ketones was developed. A wide variety of target ketones were obtained in yields of 42&#8211;95&#8201;% by simply heating the 3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)benzene sulfonylhydrazones (3&#8208;(Tfsyl)hydrazone) for 2&#8197;h at 110&#8201;&#176;C with aldehydes and with K2CO3 and DMSO as base and solvent, respectively.

         <title>Diiminium Nucleophile Adducts Are Stable and Convenient Strong Lewis Acids
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diiminium nucleophile adducts, convenient Lewis acids that satisfy some measures for superacidity, have been synthesised by coordination with stabilising pyridine donors. Even in their abstraction of half an equivalent of oxide from a P=O bond, favourable abstraction kinetics were observed. Our preliminary results combined with price and safety considerations suggest that the adducts are excellent acylation reagents.







Abstract
Strong Lewis acids are essential tools for manifold chemical procedures, but their scalable deployment is limited by their costs and safety concerns. We report a scalable, convenient, and inexpensive synthesis of stable diiminium&#8208;based reagents with a Lewis acidic carbon centre. Coordination with pyridine donors stabilises these centres; the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine adduct shows a chelation effect at carbon. Due to high fluoride, hydride, and oxide affinities, the diiminium pyridine adducts are promising soft and hard Lewis acids. They effectively produce acylpyridinium salts from carboxylates that can acylate amines to give amides and imides even from electronically intractable coupling partners.

         <title>Merging Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis and Automated Glycan Assembly to Prepare Lipid&#8208;Peptide&#8208;Glycan Chimeras</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid&#8208;peptide&#8208;glycan chimeras are prepared in a stepwise&#8208;automated manner combing their solid&#8208;phase syntheses, as an alternative to classic late&#8208;stage conjugation. A variety of supramolecular structures are generated my merging peptide amphiphiles and lipids with oligosaccharides.







Abstract
Biomaterials with improved biological features can be obtained by conjugating glycans to nanostructured peptides. Creating peptide&#8208;glycan chimeras requires superb chemoselectivity. We expedite access to such chimeras by merging peptide and glycan solid&#8208;phase syntheses employing a bifunctional monosaccharide. The concept was explored in the context of the on&#8208;resin generation of a model &#945;(1&#8594;6)tetramannoside linked to peptides, lipids, steroids, and adamantane. Chimeras containing a &#946;(1&#8594;6)tetraglucoside and self&#8208;assembling peptides such as FF, FFKLVFF, and the amphiphile palmitoyl&#8208;VVVAAAKKK were prepared in a fully automated manner. The robust synthetic protocol requires a single purification step to obtain overall yields of about 20&#8201;%. The &#946;(1&#8594;6)tetraglucoside FFKLVFF chimera produces micelles rather than nanofibers formed by the peptide alone as judged by microscopy and circular dichroism. The peptide amphiphile&#8208;glycan chimera forms a disperse fiber network, creating opportunities for new glycan&#8208;based nanomaterials.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of ABCD&#8208;Porphyrin Platinum(II) Complexes via Dehydrative Aromatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes synthesis of ABCD&#8208;porphryin Pt(II) complexes via dehydrative aromatization in one&#8208;pot from corresponding dipyrrinatoPt(II) complexes and bisformyldipyrrins. This procedure also enables the construction of a C1&#8208;symmetrical ABCD&#8208;porphyrin with intrinsic chirality from achiral precursors. The photophysical properties of obtained molecules are also described in detail.







Abstract
Since the development of the first method for porphyrin synthesis by Rothemund in 1935, porphyrin derivatives have been widely investigated and have played an essential role in chemical sciences. Most synthetic routes of porphyrins involve oxidative aromatization. Herein, we present a synthetic method to produce ABCD&#8208;porphyrins, including chiral ones, through a one&#8208;pot reaction involving &#8220;coordination, cyclization, and dehydrative aromatization&#8221; using a mono&#8208;dipyrrinatoPt(II)Cl(COE) (COE=cyclooctene) complex as a platinum template.

         <title>Mn(II) Polypyridyl Complexes: Precursors to High Valent Mn(V)=O Species and Inhibitors of Cancer Cell Proliferation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

High valent MnV=O at room temperature: This works highlights the identification and characterization of a transient MnV=O species with the help of an in&#8197;situ generated anionic moiety. The oxidative species are mapped to trigger intracellular redox modulation to prevent cancer cell proliferation.







Abstract
The reaction of [(L)MnII]2+ (L = neutral polypyridine ligand framework) in the presence of mCPBA (mCPBA = m&#8208;Chloroperoxybenzoic acid) generates a putative MnV=O species at RT. The proposed MnV=O species is capable of performing the aromatic hydroxylation of Cl&#8208;benzoic acid derived from mCPBA to give [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, which in the presence of excess mCPBA generates a metastable [(L)MnV(O)(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, characterized by UV/Vis absorption, EPR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and ESI&#8208;MS studies. The current study highlights the fact that [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ formation may not be a dead end for catalysis. Further, a plausible mechanism has been proposed for the formation of [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ from [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+. The characterized transient [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ reported in the current work exhibits high reactivity for oxygen atom transfer reactions, supported by the electrophilic character depicted from Hammett studies using a series of para&#8208;substituted thioanisoles. The unprecedented study starting from a non&#8208;heme neutral polypyridine ligand framework paves a path for mimicking the natural active site of photosystem II under ambient conditions. Finally, evaluating the intracellular effect of Mn(II) complexes revealed an enhanced intracellular ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction to prevent the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer cells.

         <title>2H&#8208;Phosphindole&#8208;Enabled Dearomatization and [4+2] Cycloaddition of (Hetero)Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their unique electronic properties, the low&#8208;coordinate heavier main&#8208;group element species display high reactivity toward inert small molecules. Transient 2H&#8208;phosphinidole working as reactive phosphadiene undergoes phospha&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with a wide range of non&#8208;activated aromatic carbocycles and heterocycles, providing simple but straightforward access to a range of polycyclic fused rings feature with bridgehead phosphorus.







Abstract
The heavier main group multiple bonds offer an effective tool for small molecule activation. Transient 2H&#8208;phosphinidole working as a reactive phosphadiene system undergoes phospha&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with a wide range of non&#8208;activated aromatic carbocycles and heterocycles, including naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, furan, thiophene, pyrrole, pyridine, and benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, affording concise access to a range of polycyclic fused rings feature with phosphorus at the bridgehead. These results demonstrate that non&#8208;activated (hetero)arenes are capable of acting as 2&#960; systems in [4+2] cycloaddition with highly reactive 2H&#8208;phosphindole complex.

         <title>Multicomponent Reaction: Pd/Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Borocarbonylation of Aryldiazonium Salts with Aliphatic Terminal Alkynes to gem&#8208;Bis(boryl) Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convenient multicomponent procedure for the borocarbonylative synthesis of gem&#8208;bis(boryl) ketones has been developed. With aliphatic terminal alkynes, CO, aryldiazonium salts, and B2pin2 as the substrates, saturated &#946;&#8208;bis(boryl) ketones were isolated in moderate to good yields by using ethyl acetate as a proton source.







Abstract
We report the development of Pd/Cu&#8208;catalyzed selective 2,1&#8208;borocarbonylation reactions of aliphatic terminal alkynes with aryldiazonium salts and B2Pin2 to prepare gem&#8208;bis(boryl) ketones in one&#8208;pot. A series of corresponding products are obtained with good to excellent yields under a carbon monoxide atmosphere (10&#8197;bar). In addition, wide functional&#8208;group tolerance can be observed. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that ethyl acetate serves as a proton source in the reaction.

         <title>Investigations of the Photothermal Properties of a Series of Molecular Gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) Complexes Absorbing in the NIR&#8208;III Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photothermal properties of a series of hydrophobic gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) absorbing in the NIR&#8208;III region were evaluated in organic solvents and in aqueous solution after encapsulation in polymer nanoparticles.







Abstract
The photothermal properties of a series of neutral radical gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes absorbing in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;III window (1550&#8211;1870&#8197;nm) have been investigated. This class of complexes was found to be good photothermal agents (PTAs) in toluene under 1600&#8197;nm laser irradiation with photothermal efficiencies around 40 and 60&#8201;% depending on the nature of the dithiolene ligand. To the best of our knowledge, these complexes are the first small molecular photothermal agents to absorb so far into the near infrared.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The photothermal properties of a series of hydrophobic gold-bis(dithiolene)&lt;/b&gt; absorbing in the NIR-III region were evaluated in organic solvents and in aqueous solution after encapsulation in polymer nanoparticles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photothermal properties of a series of neutral radical gold-bis(dithiolene) complexes absorbing in the near-infrared-III window (1550&#8211;1870&#8197;nm) have been investigated. This class of complexes was found to be good photothermal agents (PTAs) in toluene under 1600&#8197;nm laser irradiation with photothermal efficiencies around 40 and 60&#8201;% depending on the nature of the dithiolene ligand. To the best of our knowledge, these complexes are the first small molecular photothermal agents to absorb so far into the near infrared. To test their applicability in water, these hydrophobic complexes have been encapsulated into nanoparticles constituted by amphiphilic block-copolymers. Stable suspensions of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating the gold-bis(dithiolene) complexes have been prepared which show a diameter around 100&#8197;nm. The encapsulation rate was found to be strongly dependent on the nature of the dithiolene ligands. The photothermal properties of the aqueous suspensions containing gold-bis(dithiolene) complexes were then studied under 1600&#8197;nm laser irradiation. These studies demonstrate that water has strong photothermal activity in the NIR-III region that, cannot be overcome even with the addition of gold complexes displaying good photothermal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antimalarial Agents Derived from Metal&#8208;Amodiaquine Complexes with Activity in Multiple Stages of the Plasmodium Life Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meet to defeat: A strategic round&#8208;table meeting has been convened between inorganic chemistry and pharmacology to tackle malaria, one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. As a result, metals have been deliberately conjugated with the antimalarial quinoline Amodiaquine. These metal&#8211;amodiaquine complexes have overcome the limitations of metal&#8208;free quinolines, and light has been shed on their potential as a chemical tool for designing new drugs against malaria and other infectious diseases susceptible to quinoline treatment.

         <title>Identification of In&#8208;Droplet Multicellular Communities by Light&#8208;Induced Combinatorial DNA Barcoding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for labeling cells with microdroplet identifiers generated from a set of DNA&#8208;functionalized microbeads is demonstrated. By employing a combinatorial approach, in which combinations of DNA barcodes from randomly encapsulated multiple DNA&#8208;functionalized microbeads collectively serve as unique molecular identifiers, generating many unique identifiers becomes feasible. In microdroplets, DNA barcoding molecules released from microbeads tag cell membranes, which are then read by single&#8208;cell sequencing.







Abstract
A microdroplet co&#8208;culture system is useful for the parallel assessment of numerous possible cell&#8211;cell interactions by generating isolated subcommunities from a pool of heterogeneous cells. However, the integration of single&#8208;cell sequencing into such analysis has been limited due to the lack of effective molecular identifiers for each in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Herein, we present a strategy for generating in&#8208;droplet subcommunity identifiers using DNA&#8208;functionalized microparticles encapsulated within microdroplets. These microparticles serve as initial information carriers, where their combinations act as distinct identifiers for in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Upon optical trigger, DNA barcoding molecules encoding the microparticle information are once released in the microdroplets and then tag cell membranes. The tagged DNA molecules then serve as a second information carrier readable by single&#8208;cell sequencing to reconstitute the community in silico in the single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing data space.

         <title>Temperature Directs the Majority&#8208;Rules Principle in Supramolecular Copolymers Driven by Triazine&#8211;Benzene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular copolymerization of chiral comonomers into helical assemblies can introduce competing polymerization pathways. Temperature can be used to control the composition of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;based copolymers and thereby invert the helical screw&#8208;sense of the assemblies. By combining spectroscopy with computations, the authors show that the temperature&#8208;dependent helical structure originates from the copolymerization mechanism.







Abstract
Supramolecular copolymers have typically been studied in the extreme cases, such as self&#8208;sorting or highly mixed copolymer systems, while the intermediate systems have been less understood. We have reported the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure in copolymers of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives based on charge&#8208;transfer interactions with a highly alternating microstructure at low temperatures. Here, we investigate the temperature&#8208;dependent copolymerization further and increase the complexity by combining triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives with opposite preferred helicities. In this case, intercalation of the benzene&#8208;derivative into the triazine&#8208;derivative assemblies causes a helical inversion. The inversion of the net helicity was rationalized by comparing the mismatch penalties of the individual monomers, which indicated that the benzene&#8208;derivative dictates the helical screw&#8208;sense of the supramolecular copolymers. Surprisingly, this was not reflected in further investigations of slightly modified triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives, thus highlighting that the outcome is a subtle balance between structural features, where small differences can be amplified due to the competitive nature of the interactions. Overall, these findings suggest that the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;based supramolecular copolymers determines the copolymer helicity of the presented system in a similar way as the mixed majority&#8208;rules phenomenon.
