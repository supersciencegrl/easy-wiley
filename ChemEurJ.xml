         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Aminoglycoside Antibiotics Overcomes Bacterial Resistance Mediated by APH(3&#8217;) Kinases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The continuous emergence of antimicrobial resistance is causing a threat to patients infected by multidrug&#8208;resistant pathogens. In particular, the clinical use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterials of last resort, is limited due to rising bacterial resistance. One of the major resistance mechanisms in Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria is phosphorylation of these amino sugars at the 3&#8217;&#8208;position by  O  &#8208;phosphotransferases [APH(3&#8217;)s]. Structural alteration of these antibiotics at the 3&#8217;&#8208;position would be an obvious strategy to tackle this resistance mechanism. However, the access to such derivatives requires cumbersome multi&#8208;step synthesis, which is not appealing for pharma industry in this low&#8208;return&#8208;on&#8208;investment market. To overcome this obstacle and combat bacterial resistance mediated by APH(3&#8217;)s, we introduce a novel regioselective modification of aminoglycosides in the 3&#8217;&#8208;position  via  palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation. To underline the effectiveness of our method for structural modification of aminoglycosides, we have developed two novel antibiotic candidates overcoming APH(3&#8217;)s&#8208;mediated resistance employing only four synthetic steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Promoted Rh(I)&#8208;Catalyzed C2&#8208;Selective C&#8210;H Alkenylation and Polyenylation of Imidazoles with Alkenyl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed directed decarbonylative C2&#8210;H alkenylation of imidazoles with readily available alkenyl carboxylic acids is reported. The reaction proceeds in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective manner, providing efficient access to C2&#8208;alkenylated imidazoles that are generally inaccessible by known C&#8210;H alkenylation methods. This transformation accommodates a wide range of alkenyl carboxylic acids, including challenging conjugated polyene carboxylic acids, and diversely decorated imidazoles with high functional group compatibility. The presence of a removable pyrimidine directing group, and the use of a bidentate phosphine ligand are pivotal to the success of the catalytic reaction. In addition to imidazoles, this process is also suitable for benzimidazoles. Importantly, the scalability as well as diversification of the products highlight the potential of this protocol in practical applications. Detailed experimental and computational studies provide important insights into the underlying reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photochemical Olefin Isomerization of Unsaturated Ketones via 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bring on the Light: An efficient photochemical metal/catalyst&#8208;free system has been uncovered for the selective one&#8208;bond olefin migration of unsaturated ketones. Diverse substrate scope, functional group tolerance and its application for dehomologation and one&#8208;carbon selective olefin migration processes in linear alkenes highlights the usefulness of this method.







Abstract
The photochemical isomerization of &#945;,&#946;&#8208; to &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones through a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer mechanism under mild conditions with high efficiency and selectivity is reported. The reaction is carried out in the absence of metal catalysts or other additives, and its stereoselectivity can be tuned by selecting appropriate solvent mixtures. The reaction&#8216;s scope and tolerance towards functional groups, including light&#8208;sensitive halogens, free acids and alcohols, were studied, providing reliable access to a wide variety of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. This methodology details the deconjugation of a wide range of unsaturated ketones and, when combined with olefin metathesis, provides an efficient process for either dehomologation or one&#8208;carbon double&#8208;bond migration of terminal alkenes.

         <title>A Terphenyl Supported Dioxophosphorane Dimer: the Light Congener of Lawesson's and Woollins&#8217; Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridines have been shown to mediate the release of ethene from a terphenyl supported 1,3&#8208;dioxo&#8208;2&#8208;phospholane. This generates a dioxophosphorane dimer which is an oxygen analogue of Lawesson's and Woollins&#8217; reagents. This compound was structurally characterised and its solution behaviour interrogated. Insight into the ethene release reaction is provided by the isolation of a DMAP&#8208;coordinated dioxophosphorane







Abstract
Thermolysis of a 1,3&#8208;dioxa&#8208;2&#8208;phospholane supported by the terphenyl ligand AriPr4 (AriPr4=[C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;(C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;iPr2)]) at 150&#8201;&#176;C gives [AriPr4PO2]2 via loss of ethene. [AriPr4PO2]2 was characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy; it contains a 4&#8208;membered P&#8722;O&#8722;P&#8722;O ring and is the isostructural oxygen analogue of Lawesson's and Woollins&#8217; reagents. The dimeric structure of [AriPr4PO2]2 was found to persist in solution through VT&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and DOSY, supported by DFT calculations. The addition of DMAP to the 1,3&#8208;dioxa&#8208;2&#8208;phospholane facilitates the loss of ethene to give AriPr4(DMAP)PO2 after days at room temperature, with this product also characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. Replacement of the DMAP with pyridine induces ethene loss from the 1,3&#8208;dioxa&#8208;2&#8208;phospholane to provide gram&#8208;scale samples of [AriPr4PO2]2 in 75&#8201;% yield in 2&#8197;days at only 100&#8201;&#176;C.

&lt;p&gt;Pyridines have been shown to mediate the release of ethene from a terphenyl supported 1,3-dioxo-2-phospholane. This generates a dioxophosphorane dimer which is an oxygen analogue of Lawesson's and Woollins&#8217; reagents. This compound was structurally characterised and its solution behaviour interrogated.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Quantum Tunneling and Hydrogen Bonding Rearrangements Characterize the Solid&#8208;Solid Phase Transitions in a Phosphonium&#8208;Based Protic Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunneling driven dynamics for the PD3 group of the octyl phosphonium cation in an ionic liquid has been observed by means of solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Deuteron line&#8208;shape analysis and relaxation time measurements provide information about the structure, mobility and rearrangements of the cations in the solid, supercooled and liquid states. Hydrogen bonds of different strengths allow the change in molecular ordering upon phase transformation to be mapped. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;I. Kolokolov, R. Ludwig et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200257). The illustrations of the tunnel are used with the kind support of NOCH GmbH &amp; Co. KG, who owns the copyright.

         <title>Stereochemical Behavior of Pairs of P&#8208;stereogenic Phosphanyl Groups at the Dimethylxanthene Backbone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 20, April 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pair of vinyl phosphanyl substituents at the dimethylxanthene backbone undergoes a rather rapid epimerization reaction with a DFT calculated meso to rac isomerization barrier of ca. 22&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The low inversion barrier at phosphorus is likely due to a &#960;&#8208;conjugative effect. The addition of the strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 to the P&#8208;stereogenic phosphane probably proceeds through a reactive phospha&#8208;iminium intermediate with loss of the stereochemical information.







Abstract
The P&#8208;stereogenic bis(phosphanes) 7 and 9, featuring pairs of P(Mes)&#8208;ethynyl or vinyl substituents at the dimethyl xanthene backbone show rather low barriers of stereochemical inversion at phosphorus. &#960;&#8208;Conjugative effects are probably causing these low inversion barriers. Compound 7 reacted with B(C6F5)3 to form the nine&#8208;membered heterocyclic product 10, featuring a [P]&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;B(C6F5)3 substituent. Compound 7 was converted to the bis[P(Mes)vinyl] xanthene derivative 9, which gave the zwitterionic P(H)(Mes)&#8722;CH=CH&#8722;B(C6F5)3 containing product 16 upon treatment with B(C6F5)3. Thermally induced epimerization barriers at phosphorus of ca. 20 to 27&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 were calculated by DFT for the alkenyl&#8208; and alkynyl&#8208;P derived systems 6 to 9, 15 and 16 and experimentally determined for the examples 7 and 16.

         <title>A New Class of Task&#8208;Specific Imidazolium Salts and Ionic Liquids and Their Corresponding Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes for Immobilization on Electrochemically Active Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 20, April 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of asymmetrically, para&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;bi&#8208; and terphenyl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;alkyl substituted imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids and their corresponding N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes for adsorption on surfaces were investigated concerning their structural, thermochemical and magnetic behavior. Moreover, the development of a hetero dinuclear complex as structural motif facilitates the structural and magnetic studies of surface&#8208;adsorbed ionic liquids.







Abstract
Adding to the versatile class of ionic liquids, we report the detailed structure and property analysis of a new class of asymmetrically substituted imidazolium salts, offering interesting thermal characteristics, such as liquid crystalline behavior, polymorphism or glass transitions. A scalable general synthetic procedure for N&#8208;polyaryl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;functionalized imidazolium salts with para&#8208;substituted linker (L) moieties at the aryl chain, namely [LPhmImHR]+ (L=Br, CN, SMe, CO2Et, OH; m=2, 3; R=C12, PEGn; n=2, 3, 4), was developed. These imidazolium salts were studied by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD), NMR spectroscopy and thermochemical methods (DSC, TGA). Furthermore, these imidazolium salts were used as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand precursors for mononuclear, first&#8208;row transition metal complexes (MnII, FeII, CoII, NiII, ZnII, CuI, AgI, AuI) and for the dinuclear Ti&#8208;supported Fe&#8208;NHC complex [(OPy)2Ti(OPh2ImC12)2(FeI2)] (OPy=pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethanolate). The complexes were studied concerning their structural and magnetic behavior via multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy, SC&#8208;XRD analyses, variable temperature and field&#8208;dependent (VT&#8208;VF) SQUID magnetization methods, X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy and, where appropriate, zero&#8208;field 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy.

         <title>Controlling the Dual&#8208;Emission Character of Aryl&#8208;Modified o&#8208;Carboranes by Intramolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Interaction Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 20, April 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;emission character of aryl&#8208;modified o&#8208;carboranes can be regulated by intramolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. Stronger interactions can afford a higher LE/ICT (LE: locally excited, ICT: intramolecular charge transfer) ratio because of the tightly locked molecular orientation favorable for LE emission. Well&#8208;balanced LE/ICT dual emission could be achieved by tuning intramolecular interaction sites in the solid state. The more activated molecular motions at higher temperature gradually perturbed LE/ICT ratio, resulting in the thermoresponsivity in solid.







Abstract
It is still challenging to realize a dual&#8208;emission system, in which two luminescent bands simultaneously appear by photoexcitation, in solid with organic dyes due to the difficulty in regulation of electronic properties in the excited state and concentration quenching. o&#8208;Carborane is known to be a versatile platform for constructing solid&#8208;state emitters since the sphere boron cluster is favorable for suppressing intermolecular interactions and subsequently concentration quenching. Here, we show solid&#8208;state dual&#8208;emissive o&#8208;carborane derivatives. We prepared 4 types of o&#8208;carborane derivatives and found dual&#8208;emission behaviors both in solution and solid states. By regulating the rotation at the o&#8208;carborane unit with the intramolecular CcageH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction, the dual&#8208;emission intensity ratios were changed. Finally, it was demonstrated that the overall photoluminescence spectra can be estimated using the binding energy of intramolecular interactions.

         <title>Fast and Cysteine&#8208;Specific Modification of Peptides, Proteins and Bacteriophage Using Chlorooximes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 20, April 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast and cysteine&#8208;specific modifications are reported using chlorooximes. This cysteine conjugation reaction can be carried out with single&#8208;digit micromolar concentrations of the labeling reagent under physiological conditions. The conjugates show high stability towards acid, base, and external thiol nucleophiles. A nitrile oxide species generated in&#8197;situ is likely involved as the key intermediate. These methods are applied to native peptide modification, proteins modification, and chemically modified phage libraries construction.







Abstract
This work reports a novel chlorooxime mediated modification of native peptides and proteins under physiologic conditions. This method features fast reaction kinetics (apparent k2=306&#177;4&#8197;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1 for GSH) and exquisite selectivity for cysteine residues. This cysteine conjugation reaction can be carried out with just single&#8208;digit micromolar concentrations of the labeling reagent. The conjugates show high stability towards acid, base, and external thiol nucleophiles. A nitrile oxide species generated in&#8197;situ is likely involved as the key intermediate. Furthermore, a bis&#8208;chlorooxime reagent is synthesized to enable facile Cys&#8208;Cys stapling in native peptides and proteins. This highly efficient cysteine conjugation and stapling was further implemented on bacteriophage to construct chemically modified phage libraries.

Oxidative fusion of meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrin&#8208;bis&#8208;ZnII [36]octaphyrin&#8208;porphyrin hybrid trimer afforded a triply&#8208;linked hybrid tape as the first example of porphyrin tapes exhibiting M&#246;bius aromaticity. The electronic conjugation was fully extended over the whole molecule, showing red&#8208;shifted absorption up to 1274&#8197;nm. The extent of electronic perturbation was compared with planar porphyrin&#8208;[26]hexaphyrin&#8208;porphyrin hybrid tape to illuminate the consequence of twisted &#960;&#8208;surface.

Abstract
Directly meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrin&#8208;tetrabromo[36]octaphyrin&#8208;porphyrin hybrid trimer 10 was successfully synthesized via acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation reaction and subsequent oxidation. ZnII&#8208;metalation of 10 induced transannular meso&#8208;meso bond formation to give M&#246;bius aromatic bis&#8208;ZnII octaphyrin 11, which was oxidized by DDQ/Sc(OTf)3 to provide fully conjugated porphyrin&#8208;[36]octaphyrin&#8208;porphyrin hybrid tape 12 as the first example of porphyrin tape exhibiting M&#246;bius aromaticity. Hybrid tape 12 displays significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption and small electrochemical HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, indicating the effective conjugation through the whole chromophores.

         <title>Marriage of Heterobuckybowls with Triptycene: Molecular Waterwheels for Separating C60 and C70</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 20, April 6, 2022. </description>

Waterwheel&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional polycycles have been created by fusing the heterobuckybowls and triptycene. The molecular waterwheels are excellent fullerene receptors that can be used to separate C60 and C70 from their mixture.







Abstract
Exploration of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles, particularly those have &#960;&#8208;frameworks spread over the three&#8208;dimensional space, is essential in materials science and synthetic chemistry as these chemical entities possess featured optoelectronic properties and supramolecular assembly. Herein, the bowl&#8208;shaped trichalcogenasumanenes are fused onto three branches of triptycene through pyrazine units, affording waterwheel&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional polycycles 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b. Because the three branches on 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b are chemically equal, the molecular orbitals of 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b show degenerate feature that results in the strong UV&#8208;Vis absorbance at steady state. 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b exhibit photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;separation and subsequent charge&#8208;redistribution at transient state, leading to excited state absorption in NIR&#8208;II window (1165&#8211;1400&#8197;nm). 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b are excellent fullerene receptors, and they form 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complexes with C60/C70 as proved by spectroscopic titrations and single crystal structure analysis. Moreover, 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b show much stronger affinity toward C70 than C60. Consequently, 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b are able to separate C60 and C70 from their mixture, giving the purity of C60 up to 99.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Nanohybridization of CoS2/MoS2 Heterostructure with Polyoxometalate on Functionalized Reduced Graphene Oxide for High&#8208;Performance LIBs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 20, April 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To take full advantages of enriched charge storage capabilities of CoS2/MoS2, the high electrical conductivity of PDDA&#8208;rGO, the multi&#8208;electron transfer of PMo12, the CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 nanocomposites were successfully fabricated and explored as anode materials for rechargeable LIBs. The CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 nanocomposites show superior energy storage behavior and rate capability for LIBs, which provides a scientific basis for solving the problems of poor cycling stability and low rate capability of MoS2 as electrode materials for LIBs.







Abstract
To address the poor cycling stability and low rate capability of MoS2 as electrode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), herein, the CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 nanocomposites are constructed via a simple hydrothermal process, combining the advantages of all three, namely, CoS2/MoS2 heterojunction and polyoxometalates (POMs) provide abundant catalytically active sites and increase the multi&#8208;electron transfer ability, and the positively charged poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) modified reduced graphene oxide (PDDA&#8208;rGO) improve electronic conductivity and effectively prevent the aggregation of MoS2, meanwhile stabilize the negatively charged [PMo12O40]3&#8722;. After the electrochemical testing, the resulting CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 nanocomposite achieved 1055&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 initial specific capacities and stabilized at 740&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150 cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 current density. And the specific capacities of MoS2, MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO, CoS2/MoS2, and CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO were 201, 421, 518, and 589 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150 cycles, respectively. The fact of the greatly improving capacity of MoS2&#8208;based nanocomposites suggests its potential for high performance electrode materials of LIBs. Moreover, the lithium storage mechanism of CoS2/MoS2/PDDA&#8208;rGO/PMo12 has been discussed on the basis of cyclic voltammetry with different scan rates.

After the electrochemical testing, the resulting CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PDDA-rGO/PMo&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposite achieved 1055&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; initial specific capacities and stabilized at 740&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 150 cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; current density. And the specific capacities of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PDDA-rGO, CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PDDA-rGO were 201, 421, 518, and 589 at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 150 cycles, respectively. The fact of the greatly improving capacity of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based nanocomposites suggests its potential for high performance electrode materials of LIBs. Moreover, the lithium storage mechanism of CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PDDA-rGO/PMo&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; has been discussed on the basis of cyclic voltammetry with different scan rates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic Circular Dichroism&#8208;Circularly Polarized Raman (eCP&#8208;Raman): A New Form of Chiral Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 20, April 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly developed chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, which combines high chirality sensitivity of electronic CD and high resolution capability of Raman is reported in this Concept article. The model for quantifying eCP&#8208;Raman effects is derived and multiple examples, which show strong eCP&#8208;Raman responses of solvents and the resonating chiral solutes, are discussed. Its usage in untangling complex excited state phenomena is also mentioned.







Abstract
This Concept article summarizes recent work on the development of a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, which combines two spectroscopies: electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized Raman (CP&#8208;Raman). First, some puzzling observations while carrying out Raman optical activity (ROA) measurements of several transition metal complexes under resonance are described, as well as the search for the mechanisms responsible. Then an equation for quantifying the eCP&#8208;Raman contribution is presented, followed by several examples of how eCP&#8208;Raman influences the IR&#8722;IL spectra of achiral and chiral solvent molecules and of a number of chiral solutes under resonance. The conditions to extract resonance ROA, when the eCP&#8208;Raman contribution is minimized, are also discussed. Finally, we comment on the potential applications of eCP&#8208;Raman.

         <title>Developing Flexible Quinacridone&#8208;Derivatives&#8208;Based Photothermal Evaporaters for Solar Steam and Thermoelectric Power Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 20, April 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic molecule (DCN&#8722;4CQA) with the absorbance region at 300&#8211;800&#8197;nm and photothermal conversion efficiency of 18.2&#8201;% under one sun was employed for fabricating flexible photothermal evaporators for solar steam and thermoelectric power generation.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial vaporization by localizing solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion to the air&#8722;water interface has attracted tremendous attention. In the process of converting solar energy into heat energy, photothermal materials play an essential role. Herein, a flexible solar&#8208;thermal material di&#8208;cyan substituted 5,12&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DCN&#8722;4CQA)@Paper was developed by coating photothermal quinacridone derivatives on the cellulose paper. The DCN&#8722;4CQA@Paper combines desired chemical and physical properties, broadband light&#8208;absorbing, and shape&#8208;conforming abilities that render efficient photothermic vaporization. Notably, synergetic coupling of solar&#8208;steam and solar&#8208;electricity technologies by integrating DCN&#8722;4CQA@Paper and the thermoelectric devices is realized without trade&#8208;offs, highlighting the practical consideration toward more impactful solar heat exploitation. Such solar distillation and low&#8208;grade heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity generation functions can provide potential opportunities for fresh water and electricity supply in off&#8208;grid or remote areas.

         <title>Cyanide&#8208;Free Cyanation of sp2 and sp&#8208;Carbon Atoms by an Oxazole&#8208;Based Masked CN Source Using Flow Microreactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 20, April 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8722;CN behind the mask: Continuous&#8208;flow methodology for versatile cyanide&#8208;free cyanation of C(sp2) and C(sp) carbons has been developed by in&#8197;situ generating a novel oxazole based (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyloxazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) boronic acid [OxBA] reagent as a non&#8208;toxic carbon&#8208;bound masked &#8722;CN source. The four&#8208;step flow sequence consisting of lithiation/borylation, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and [4+2]/retro&#8208;[4+2] produced medicinally important benzonitrile analogues with good to excellent yields.







Abstract
This work reports a cyanide&#8208;free continuous&#8208;flow process for cyanation of sp2 and sp carbons to synthesize aryl, vinyl and acetylenic nitriles from (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyloxazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) boronic acid [OxBA] reagent as a sole source of carbon&#8208;bound masked &#8722;CN source. Non&#8208;toxic and stable OxBA reagent is generated by lithiation&#8208;borylation of bromo&#8208;oxazole, and the consecutive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with aryl, vinyl, or acetylenic halides and demasking [4+2]/retro&#8208;[4+2] sequence were successfully accomplished to give the desired cyano compounds with reasonably good yields in a four&#8208;step flow manner. A unique feature of this cyanation protocol in flow enables to cyanate a variety of sp2 and sp carbons to produce a broad spectrum of aryl acetonitrile. It is envisaged that the OxBA based cyanation would replace existing unstable and toxic approaches as well as non&#8208;toxic cyanation using two different sources of &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221; to incorporate the &#8722;CN group.

The late&#8208;stage functionalization of indole&#8208; and tryptophan (Trp)&#8208;containing compounds with reactive moieties facilitates downstream diversification and leads to changes in their biological properties. The synthesis of two hydroxy&#8208;bearing allyl pyrophosphates is described and a chemoenzymatic method is demonstrated which uses a promiscuous indole prenyltransferase (IPT) enzyme to install a dual reactive hydroxy&#8208;bearing allyl group directly on the indole ring of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structure Correction of the Cyclic Lipodepsipeptide Orfamide A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 20, April 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the total synthesis of orfamide A an efficient synthesis format for cyclic lipodepsipeptide natural products on solid phase was developed. A strategy using side chain anchoring, an ester building block, and O&#8594;N acyl migration suppression enabled high&#8208;yielding synthesis on solid support and facilitated compound library synthesis. The configuration of the proposed structure of orfamide A was corrected at two positions. Studies in Chlamydomonas algae uncovered the impact of orfamide A stereochemistry on compound bioactivity.







Abstract
A total synthesis of the cyclic lipodepsipeptide natural product orfamide A was achieved. By developing a synthesis format using an aminoacid ester building block and SPPS protocol adaptation, a focused library of target compounds was obtained, in high yield and purity. Spectral and LC&#8208;HRMS data of all library members with the isolated natural product identified the 5Leu residue to be d&#8208; and the 3&#8217;&#8208;OH group to be R&#8208;configured. The structural correction of orfamide A by chemical synthesis and analysis was confirmed by biological activity comparison in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which indicated compound configuration to be important for bioactivity. Acute toxicity was also found against Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite causing African sleeping sickness.

         <title>Control of Crystallinity of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Polymers by Rational Monomer Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 20, April 6, 2022. </description>

We reveal the control of crystallinity during the solvothermal synthesis of 2D&#8208;poly(phenylenequinoxalinevinylene)s (2D&#8208;PPQVs) and 2D&#8208;poly(phenylene&#8208;vinylene)s (2D&#8208;PPVs) through the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) polycondensation by the employment of fluorinated phosphonates and rigid aldehyde building blocks.







Abstract
The interest in two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers (2D CPs) has increased significantly in recent years. In particular, vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs with fully in&#8208;plane sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated structures, high thermal and chemical stability, have become the focus of attention. Although the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reaction has been recently demonstrated in synthesizing vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs, it remains largely unexplored due to the challenge in synthesis. In this work, we reveal the control of crystallinity of 2D CPs during the solvothermal synthesis of 2D&#8208;poly(phenylene&#8208;quinoxaline&#8208;vinylene)s (2D&#8208;PPQVs) and 2D&#8208;poly(phenylene&#8208;vinylene)s through the HWE polycondensation. The employment of fluorinated phosphonates and rigid aldehyde building blocks is demonstrated as crucial factors in enhancing the crystallinity of the obtained 2D CPs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the critical role of the fluorinated phosphonate in enhancing the reversibility of the (semi)reversible C&#8722;C single bond formation.

Task&#8208;specific polyaryl&#8208;/oligoether&#8208;substituted, imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) with linker moieties enable interaction with electrochemically active surfaces. Thus, electron and proton transfer ought to be facilitated along the side chains. When used as a precursor for carbene ligands, the complex's reactivity and potential catalytic activity can be increased by interaction with an electrode. The ether functionality also enhances the catalyst's solubility, for example, in oligoether&#8208;based ILs. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Meyer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200100).

The gold&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization reactions has gained significant attention as it often provides complementary chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities as compared to other transition metal&#8208;catalyzed processes. This review focuses on the recent developments in the field of enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization reactions under gold catalysis and also highlights the mechanistic rationale at the appropriate places.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective functionalization of ubiquitous C&#8722;H bonds has proven to be promising field as it offers the construction of chiral molecular complexity in a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical manner. In recent years, gold has emerged as an attractive contender for catalyzing such reactions. The unique reactivities and selectivities offered by gold catalysts have been exploited to access numerous asymmetric transformations based on gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization processes. Herein, this review critically highlights the major advances and discoveries made in the enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization under gold catalysis which is accompanied by mechanistic insights at appropriate places.

         <title>The Potential of Micellar Media in the Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 20, April 6, 2022. </description>

DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have become a widely used technology in drug discovery. The use of micelle&#8208;forming surfactants provides new possibilities for synthetic organic chemistry and could be a promising technique for DNA&#8208;compatible chemistry as well. This review provides a summary of existing examples of micellar DEL approaches, together with a selection of micellar organic transformations fundamentally suitable for DEL synthesis.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology has become widely used in drug discovery research. The construction of DELs requires robust organic transformations that proceed in aqueous media under mild conditions. Unfortunately, the application of water as reaction medium for organic synthesis is not evident due to the generally limited solubility of organic reagents. However, the use of surfactants can offer a solution to this issue. Oil&#8208;in&#8208;water microemulsions formed by surfactant micelles are able to localize hydrophobic reagents inside them, resulting in high local concentrations of the organic substances in an otherwise poorly solvated environment. This review provides a conceptual and critical summary of micellar synthesis possibilities that are well suited to DEL synthesis. Existing examples of micellar DEL approaches, together with a selection of micellar organic transformations fundamentally suitable for DEL are discussed.

         <title>Isopropenyl esters (iPEs) in green organic synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The need for greener compounds able to replace conventional ones with similar reactivity is crucial for the development of sustainable chemistry. Isopropenyl esters (iPEs) represent one eco&#8208;friendly alternative to acyl halides and anhydrides. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the preparation methodologies and reported synthetic applications of iPEs and, in particular, of isopropenyl acetate (iPAc). Intriguingly, the presence of a C=C double bond adjacent to the ester functionality makes iPEs appealing in different chemoselective organic synthesis transformations. For instance, the acyl moiety is suitable for transesterification reactions in presence of different heteroatom&#8208;based nucleophiles (  C  &#8208;,  O  &#8208;,  N  &#8208;,  S  &#8208;,  Se  &#8208;); these reactions are irreversible thanks to the formation of acetone, obtained upon keto&#8208;enol tautomerization of the prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;2&#8208;ol (isopropenyl) leaving group. Similarly, the unsaturation contained in the isopropenyl synthon could be selectively exploited in organic synthesis for electrophilic and/or radical additions as well as in metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. To conclude, iPEs recently found major interest in the direct modification of biomass (  i.e.  lignin or cellulose) and in the implementation of tandem reactions of esterification&#8208;acetalization by exploiting the co&#8208;formation of acetone during the reaction.</dc:description>

To conclude, iPEs recently found major interest in the direct modification of biomass (  i.e.  lignin or cellulose) and in the implementation of tandem reactions of esterification-acetalization by exploiting the co-formation of acetone during the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced cycling performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S battery enabled by PVP&#8208;blended PEO&#8208;based double&#8208;layer electrolyte</title>

         <dc:description>Despite the high specific capacity of Li&#8208;S battery, shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and safety issue pose a great challenge to realize its commercial application. Replacing liquid electrolyte with poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) &#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte is considered as a promising method to boost the safety, but the shuttle effect of LiPSs cannot be completely eliminated. In this work, a new kind of double&#8208;layer PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolyte is designed to restrict the LiPSs. The layer next to cathode consists of PEO and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). The other layer consists of PEO. PVP with abundant of amide groups are electron&#8208;rich groups that have been proved to have strong affinity to LiPSs. The strong interaction between LiPSs and carbonyl groups in amide is verified by Attenuated Total Reflection&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy tests. As a result, the assembled Li&#8208;S battery exhibits a specific capacity of 1100 mAh g  &#8208;1  &#160;and capacity retention of 347 mAh g  &#8208;1  &#160;after 200 cycles at 60&#176;C&#160;and 0.05&#160;C, while the capacity retention of the battery without PVP&#8208;blended PEO electrolyte remains only 27% at the same conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Deposition of vertically aligned Ag/Ag2S nanoflakes on EGaIn particles for humidity sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid metals, which possess both good electrical conductivity and liquid&#8208;like processability, have drawn much attention recently. They are also capable of acting as synthesis templates to guide the deposition of other functional materials. Herein, through an in&#8208;situ galvanic replacement reaction assisted by ultrasonication, core&#8208;shell EGaIn/Ag particles composed of EGaIn cores and vertically aligned Ag nanoflakes as shells were prepared, which were further sulfurized to yield ternary EGaIn/Ag/Ag  2  S core&#8208;shell composite particles. The humidity sensor based on EGaIn/Ag/Ag  2  S particles showed much higher sensing response as compared to EGaIn and EGaIn/Ag. Such superior performance could be attributed to the n&#8208;type semiconducting character of Ag  2  S to receive electrons from water molecules at low humidity, and its highly hydrophilic surface to absorb more water molecules at higher humidity to enable the formation of ion&#8208;conductive paths.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Acid&#8208;Triggered Formation of Reversibly Photoswitchable Stenhouse Salts from Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In acidic conditions, the end&#8208;groups of water&#8208;soluble donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts exhibit an unexpected fast scrambling, which generates attractive reversibly photoswitchable Stenhouse salts.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are reversibly photoswitchable dyes, which are able to interconvert between a red/NIR absorbing triene&#8208;like state and a colorless cyclic state. Although optically attractive for multiple applications, their low solubility and lack of photoswitching in water impede their use in aqueous environments. We developed water&#8208;soluble DASAs based on indoline as donor and methyl, or trifluoromethyl, pyrazolone&#8208;based acceptors. In acetonitrile, photophysical analysis and photochemical studies, accounted with a three&#8208;state kinetic model, confirmed the reversible photoswitching mechanism previously proposed. In water, the colorless cyclic state is a thermodynamic sink at neutral pH values. In contrast, in acidic conditions, we observed a fast scrambling of DASAs&#8217; end&#8208;group resulting in the in&#8197;situ formation of Stenhouse salts (StS), which are in turn capable of reversible photoswitching. We believe that this unexpected result is of interest not only for the future design of DASAs with improved stability, but also for further development and applications of StS as photoswitchable probes.

         <title>Sulfonyl Nitrene and Amidyl Radical: Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical activation of sulfonyl azides leads to generation of reactive radicals that activate aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds. This study compares intrinsic reactivities of triplet sulfonyl nitrene, sulfonyl amidyl radicals and sulfonyl nitrene radical anions in the gas phase towards a series of hydrocarbons and correlates it to their structures investigated by ion spectroscopy. The most reactive triplet nitrene abstracts a hydrogen atom from ethane.







Abstract
Photocatalytic generation of nitrenes and radicals can be used to tune or even control their reactivity. Photocatalytic activation of sulfonyl azides leads to the elimination of N2 and the resulting reactive species initiate C&#8722;H activations and amide formation reactions. Here, we present reactive radicals that are generated from sulfonyl azides: sulfonyl nitrene radical anion, sulfonyl nitrene and sulfonyl amidyl radical, and test their gas phase reactivity in C&#8722;H activation reactions. The sulfonyl nitrene radical anion is the least reactive and its reactivity is governed by the proton coupled electron transfer mechanism. In contrast, sulfonyl nitrene and sulfonyl amidyl radicals react via hydrogen atom transfer pathways. These reactivities and detailed characterization of the radicals with vibrational spectroscopy and with DFT calculations provide information necessary for taking control over the reactivity of these intermediates.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Metathesis of an Ionic Liquid on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of the surface preparation: 0.5&#8197;ML [dema][TfO] and 1.0&#8197;ML [C8C1Im][PF6] were sequentially deposited on Ag(111) at 90&#8197;K. Subsequently, the sample was heated to 500&#8197;K, which leads to the selective desorption of [dema][PF6] and [C8C1Im][PF6] at &#8764;235 and &#8764;380&#8197;K, respectively. Hereby, the new IL [C8C1Im][TfO] is formed by on&#8208;surface metathesis at the IL/metal interface, which then completely desorbs at &#8764;480&#8197;K.







Abstract
We investigated the adsorption, surface enrichment, ion exchange, and on&#8208;surface metathesis of ultrathin mixed IL films on Ag(111). We stepwise deposited 0.5&#8197;ML of the protic IL diethylmethylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([dema][TfO]) and 1.0&#8197;ML of the aprotic IL 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;octylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C8C1Im][PF6]) at around 90&#8197;K. Thereafter, the resulting layered frozen film was heated to 550&#8197;K, and the thermally induced phenomena were monitored in&#8197;situ by angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Between 135 and 200&#8197;K, [TfO]&#8722; anions at the Ag(111) surface are exchanged by [PF6]&#8722; anions and enriched together with [C8C1Im]+ cations at the IL/vacuum interface. Upon further heating, [dema][PF6] and [OMIm][PF6] desorb selectively at &#8764;235 and &#8764;380&#8197;K, respectively. Hereby, a wetting layer of pure [C8C1Im][TfO] is formed by on&#8208;surface metathesis at the IL/metal interface, which completely desorbs at &#8764;480&#8197;K. For comparison, ion enrichment at the vacuum/IL interface was also studied in macroscopic IL mixtures, where no influence of the solid support is expected.

Thereafter, the resulting layered frozen film was heated to 550&#8197;K, and the thermally induced phenomena were monitored in&#8197;situ by angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Between 135 and 200&#8197;K, [TfO]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions at the Ag(111) surface are exchanged by [PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions and enriched together with [C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Im]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations at the IL/vacuum interface. Upon further heating, [dema][PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] and [OMIm][PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] desorb selectively at &#8764;235 and &#8764;380&#8197;K, respectively. Hereby, a wetting layer of pure [C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Im][TfO] is formed by on-surface metathesis at the IL/metal interface, which completely desorbs at &#8764;480&#8197;K. For comparison, ion enrichment at the vacuum/IL interface was also studied in macroscopic IL mixtures, where no influence of the solid support is expected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Taming of the DIBAL Promoted Debenzylation of &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin. Kinetics, Substituent Effects and Efficient Synthesis of Lings Tetrol**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the kinetics of a reaction is important if one wish to control it. It was realized that diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL) promoted debenzylation of the secondary alcohols in 2A&#8211;F,3A&#8211;F,6B,C,E,F&#8208;hexadecabenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (4) was zero order in DIBAL and most likely following an intramolecular mechanism. Using this information, 2A&#8211;F,3B,C,E,F,6B,C,E,F&#8208;tetradecabenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (Lings tetrol), an extremely useful building block, could be formed as sole product and in good yield by conducting the reaction at low DIBAL concentration.







Abstract
The kinetics of the reaction of perbenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin was studied varying the concentration of DIBAL and substrate, and the temperature. The initial debenzylation was found to be 1st order in substrate and follow the relationship 0.0675+0.179[DIBAL]2 with respect to the concentration of DIBAL. The second and the third debenzylation which led to the 3A,6A,6D&#8208;triol (Lings triol) were both found to be 1st order in substrate concentration and zero order in DIBAL concentration. Longer reaction times with DIBAL in high concentration gave further debenzylation to comparatively complex mixtures containing the 2B,3A,6A,6D&#8208;tetrol and the 3A,6A,6C,6D&#8208;tetrol. In contrast reaction at 0.1&#8197;M DIBAL gave the symmetrical 3A,6A,3D,6D&#8208;tetrol (Lings tetrol) in 60&#8201;% yield. The effect of chlorine or methyl substitution of the phenyl groups of perbenzyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin was also investigated. Per 4&#8208;chlorobenzyl slowed down the reaction with DIBAL, while 4&#8208;methylbenzyl increased the reaction rate, but still gave the corresponding 6&#8197;A&#8208;monool or 6A,6D&#8208;diol products. A Hammett reaction constant of &#8722;4.9 was found for the first debenzylation showing a high degree of positive charge in the transition state. The per(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzyl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;derivative was completely resistant to DIBAL, however upon addition of trimethyl aluminium this derivative also reacted to give the 6A,6D&#8208;diol product.

         <title>A Tale of Two Complexes: Electro&#8208;Assisted Oxidation of Thioanisole by an &#8220;O2 Activator/Oxidizing Species&#8221; Tandem System of Non&#8208;Heme Iron Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electro&#8208;assisted oxidation of thioanisole by O2 was achieved using a tandem couple &#8220;O2 activator/oxidation system&#8221; of non&#8208;heme complexes: at an electrode, L2FeIII(OTf) is reduced to FeII, which activates O2 to superoxide and transfers it to (TPEN)FeII(PF6). The latter generates a reactive species capable of substrate oxygenation.







Abstract
We report two new FeIII complexes [L1FeIII(H2O)](OTf)2 and [L2FeIII(OTf)], obtained by replacing pyridines by phenolates in a known non&#8208;heme aminopyridine iron complex. While the original, starting aminopyridine [(L52)FeII(MeCN)](PF6) complex is stable in air, the potentials of the new FeIII/II couples decrease to the point that [L2FeII] spontaneously reduces O2 to superoxide. We used it as an O2 activator in an electrochemical setup, as its presence allows to generate superoxide at a much more accessible potential (&gt;500&#8197;mV gain). Our aim was to achieve substrate oxidation via the reductive activation of O2. While L2FeIII(OTf) proved to be a good O2 activator but a poor oxidation system, its association with another complex (TPEN)FeII(PF6)2 generates a complementary tandem couple for electro&#8208;assisted oxidation of substrates, working at a very accessible potential: upon reduction, L2FeIII(OTf) activates O2 to superoxide and transfers it to (TPEN)FeII(PF6)2 leading in fine to the oxidation of thioanisole.

         <title>Hydroxy Groups Enhance [2]Rotaxane Anion Binding Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new rotaxanes were synthesized containing phenolic O&#8208;H groups on the axle component. These O&#8208;H groups hydrogen bond to the macrocycle component, rigidifying the binding pocket and resulting in significantly enhanced selectivity for chloride anions over more basic oxoanions.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of two [2]rotaxanes containing an interlocked three dimensional binding cavity formed from a pyridinium bis(amide) axle component containing two phenol donors, and an isophthalamide based macrocycle. In the competitive solvent mixture 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 CDCl3&#8201;:&#8201;CD3OD, one of the receptors exhibits a much higher selectivity preference for chloride than an analogous rotaxane without the hydroxy groups. X&#8208;ray crystal structures reveal the chloride anion guest encapsulated within the interlocked binding cavity, though not all of the hydrogen bond donors are utilised. Computational semi&#8208;empirical simulations indicate that secondary intermolecular interactions occur between the axle hydroxy hydrogen bond donors and the [2]rotaxane macrocycle components, contributing to a more preorganised binding pocket, which may be responsible for the observed enhanced selectivity.

         <title>Photoswitching Affinity and Mechanism of Multivalent Lectin Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arylazopyrazole&#8208;containing divalent ligand was tailored to control multivalent binding to the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) by light irradiation. The ligand was designed in such a way that only the E isomer is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA. The two photoisomers show an unprecedentedly high change in binding affinity, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry and different binding modes (chelating binding for the E isomer and crosslinking binding for the Z isomer).







Abstract
Multivalent receptor&#8211;ligand binding is a key principle in a plethora of biological recognition processes. Immense binding affinities can be achieved with the correct spatial orientation of the ligands. Accordingly, the incorporation of photoswitches, which can be used to reversibly change the spatial orientation of molecules, into multivalent ligands is a means to alter the binding affinity and possibly also the binding mode of such ligands. We report a divalent ligand for the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) containing an arylazopyrazole photoswitch. This switch, which has recently been introduced as an alternative to the more commonly used azobenzene moiety, is characterized by almost quantitative E/Z photoswitching in both directions, high quantum yields, and high thermal stability of the Z isomer. The ligand was designed in a way that only one of the isomers is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA leading to a chelating binding mode. Photoswitching induces an unprecedentedly high change in lectin binding affinity as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Furthermore, additional dynamic light scattering (DLS) data suggest that the binding mode of the ligand changes from chelating binding of the E isomer to crosslinking binding of the Z isomer.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An arylazopyrazole-containing divalent ligand&lt;/b&gt; was tailored to control multivalent binding to the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) by light irradiation. The ligand was designed in such a way that only the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; isomer is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA. The two photoisomers show an unprecedentedly high change in binding affinity, as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry and different binding modes (chelating binding for the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; isomer and crosslinking binding for the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomer).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multivalent receptor&#8211;ligand binding is a key principle in a plethora of biological recognition processes. Immense binding affinities can be achieved with the correct spatial orientation of the ligands. Accordingly, the incorporation of photoswitches, which can be used to reversibly change the spatial orientation of molecules, into multivalent ligands is a means to alter the binding affinity and possibly also the binding mode of such ligands. We report a divalent ligand for the model lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) containing an arylazopyrazole photoswitch. This switch, which has recently been introduced as an alternative to the more commonly used azobenzene moiety, is characterized by almost quantitative &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; photoswitching in both directions, high quantum yields, and high thermal stability of the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomer. The ligand was designed in a way that only one of the isomers is able to bridge adjacent binding sites of WGA leading to a chelating binding mode. Photoswitching induces an unprecedentedly high change in lectin binding affinity as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution over Ce&#8208;Co9S8 Core&#8208;shell Nanoneedle Arrays via Electronic and Architectural Dual Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic and architecture dual engineering strategy is a considerable way to rationally design earth&#8208;abundant and highly&#8208;efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen&#8208;based energy devices. Herein, a carbon cloth supported Ce&#8208;doped Co9S8 core&#8208;shell nanoneedle array (Ce&#8208;Co9S8@CC) is designed and developed for accelerating the sluggish kinetics of OER. Profited by valance alternative Ce doping, well&#8208;fined core&#8208;shell structure and vertically aligned nanoneedle arrayed architecture, the resultant Ce&#8208;Co9S8@CC integrates modulated electronic structure, highly&#8208;exposed active sites and multidimensional mass diffusion channels, which collaboratively afford for the favorable OER catalytic process. The resultant Ce&#8208;Co9S8@CC exhibits remarkable OER performance in an alkaline medium, where the overpotential requires only 242 mV to deliver the current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for the OER, which is 70 mV superior to that of Ce&#8208;free Co9S8 catalyst and other counterparts. The robust stability and impressive selectivity (nearly 100 % Faradic efficiency) are also demonstrated. When integrating in a two&#8208;electrode OER//HER electrolyzer, the as&#8208;prepared Ce&#8208;Co9S8@CC displays a low operation potential of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and distinguished long&#8208;term stability, demonstrating great potential for economical water electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photogeneration of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) finds applications in fields as different as nanomedicine, art preservation, air and water depollution and surface decontamination. Here we present photocatalytic nanoparticles (NP) that are active only at acidic pH while they do not show relevant ROS photo&#8208;generation at neutral pH. This dual responsivity (to light and pH) is achieved by stabilizing the surface of TiO  2  NP with a specific organic shell during the synthesis and it is peculiar of the achieved core shell&#8208;structure, as demonstrated by comparison with commercial photocatalytic TiO  2  NP. For the investigation of the photocatalytic activity we developed two methods that allow real time detection of the process preventing any kind of artifact arising from post&#8208;treatments and delayed analysis. The reversibility of the pH response was also demonstrated as well as the selective photo&#8208;killing of cancer cells at acidic pH.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Surface&#8208;Tethered Polymer Brush Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new key: The incorporation of luminescence into surface&#8208;tethered polymer brushes is discussed in this review. It unlocks new characterization techniques and has been used for a wide range of applications including sensors, cellular labelling, optoelectronics and stenography. These materials can demonstrate enhanced stability compared to physisorbed polymer films or luminescent dyes, and offer improved control over both the composition of thin films and their spatial arrangement.







Abstract
Surface&#8208;tethered polymers are unique molecular architectures that have been recently used in advanced sensors, electronics and biomedical applications. However, techniques for characterizing these materials in their surface&#8208;tethered form remain limited. The incorporation of luminescent functionality into these materials has enabled new characterization methods, while also unlocking new applications in optoelectronics, stenography and sensing. Micron&#8208;scale photolithography techniques have recently enabled the preparation of high&#8208;resolution patterns, as well as architectures with unique photophysical properties. Herein, we provide an overview of the techniques used to prepare luminescent polymer brush materials and their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive sensors, cell adhesion materials, and optoelectronics. We also provide our perspective on the promising future uses of surface&#8208;tethered polymers, as well as the short&#8208;term challenges and opportunities in the field.

         <title>Deciphering the Spectral Tuning Mechanism in Proteorhodopsin: The Dominant Role of Electrostatics Instead of Chromophore Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are two phenotypes of proteorhodopsin exhibiting an environmental adaption to the ocean's depth. These are blue&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (BPR) and green&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (GPR). The key to the blue/green shift between these variants originates from position 105, where BPR contains a glutamine (Q) and GPR a leucine (L). In this work it was found that Q105 is responsible for generating a positive electrostatic potential near the retinal chromophore leading to the observed blue&#8208;shift in BPR.







Abstract
Proteorhodopsin (PR) is a photoactive proton pump found in marine bacteria. There are two phenotypes of PR exhibiting an environmental adaptation to the ocean's depth which tunes their maximum absorption: blue&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (BPR) and green&#8208;absorbing proteorhodopsin (GPR). This blue/green color&#8208;shift is controlled by a glutamine to leucine substitution at position 105 which accounts for a 20&#8197;nm shift. Typically, spectral tuning in rhodopsins is rationalized by the external point charge model but the Q105L mutation is charge neutral. To study this tuning mechanism, we employed the hybrid QM/MM method with sampling from molecular dynamics. Our results reveal that the positive partial charge of glutamine near the C14&#8722;C15 bond of retinal shortens the effective conjugation length of the chromophore compared to the leucine residue. The derived mechanism can be applied to explain the color regulation in other retinal proteins and can serve as a guideline for rational design of spectral shifts.

A cage&#8208;based MOF (Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101) was synthesized with biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid. Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 contains two types of cages based on nickel&#8208;clusters to form a 3D framework. A series of isostructural bimetallic MxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 were synthesized and studied for the electrochemical HER. Among them, the bimetallic CuxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 family exhibit improved electrocatalytic HER performance in 0.5&#8197;M sulfuric acid electrolyte, owing to the synergistic effect of the Cu/Ni bimetallic centers.







Abstract
A cage&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101) with biphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid was synthesized via solvothermal method. Ni&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 contains two types of cages based on trinuclear and octa&#8208;nuclear nickel&#8208;clusters that are connected with each other by the 4&#8208;connected ligands, to form a 3D framework with a new topology. A mixed&#8208;metal strategy was used to synthesize isostructural bimetallic MOFs of MxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 (M=Mn, Co, Cu, Zn). The electrocatalytic studies showed that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of CuxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 is much higher than that of other MxNi1&#8208;x&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 catalysts in acidic aqueous solution, owing to the synergistic effect of the bimetallic centers. The optimized Cu0.19Ni0.81&#8208;NKU&#8208;101 has an overpotential of 324&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 131&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The mechanism of HER activity over these bimetallic MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Red Emissive Squaraine&#8208;AIEgen in Elastomer Enabling High Contrast and Fast Thermoresponse for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting and Temperature Sensing**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new red&#8208;emissive squaraine&#8208;based AIEgen is designed for high performance thermoresponsive materials. Molecularly dispersing the AIEgen into an elastomer&#8208;like poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) (SBR) is shown to significantly improve both the contrast ratio and response time of the resulting thermoresponsive film, making it quite suitable for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and temperature sensing.







Abstract
Two challenges remain for organic thermoresponsive materials; one is to develop high&#8208;performance red&#8208;emissive thermoresponsive materials, while another is to simultaneously achieve high contrast ratio (CR), fast and reversible thermoresponse in a single element. Herein, we not only develop a new deep&#8208;red emissive squaraine&#8208;based AIEgen (TPE&#8208;SQ12) based on a pyrylium end group, which is suitable for fabricating high&#8208;performance thermoresponsive materials, but also show an effective approach to improve both CR (&#8764;ten times increase) and response time (less than 3 seconds), that is, molecularly dispersing AIEgen into an elastomer, attributed to the significantly expanded free volume of elastomer upon increasing the temperature that can activate the AIEgen intramolecular movements more pronouncedly. Double encryption and temperature mapping systems have been separately established by using our designed elastomer/TPE&#8208;SQ12 film, showing the great potential for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and temperature sensing. Finally, white emission is further achieved by co&#8208;doping TPE&#8208;SQ12 with cyan dye into elastomer, which enables fluorescent thermochromism for improving the temperature mapping ability.

         <title>A Photoresponsive Receptor with a 105 Magnitude of Reversible Anion&#8208;Binding Switching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient anion receptor with photoswitchable functionality based on a new photoresponsive chromophore is introduced. Upon photoirradiation with UV light, (E,E)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium displays a switched&#8208;off change in binding strength towards sulfate of more than five orders of magnitude. In DMSO, the open E,E form binds sulfate with extraordinary strength through chelating guanidinium hydrogen bonds. Upon photoisomerization to the Z,Z isomer, the anion&#8208;binding site is shut off by intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the 2&#8208;pyridyl substituents, thereby releasing the bound sulfate.







Abstract
In a leap toward anion separation that uses only energy input for binding and release cycles, we report herein a new class of photoswitchable anion receptors featuring a diiminoguanidinium functionality that displays a change of more than five orders of magnitude in switched&#8208;off binding strength towards sulfate, a representative oxyanion, upon photoirradiation with UV light. The (E,E)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;diiminoguanidinium cation, synthesized as the triflate salt, binds sulfate with extraordinary strength in [D6]DMSO owing to its bidentate guanidinium hydrogen bonding, which can chelate the O&#8722;S&#8722;O edge of sulfate. Upon photoisomerization to the Z,Z isomer, the anion&#8208;binding site is essentially shut off by intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the 2&#8208;pyridyl substituents, as shown by anion&#8208;binding titrations, theoretical calculations, and X&#8208;ray structural analysis. This approach will allow the development of advanced anion&#8208;separation cycles that use only energy input and generate no chemical waste, and thus address challenging chemical separation problems in a more sustainable way.

         <title>Ultrafast Electrochemical Capacitors with Carbon Related Materials as Electrodes for AC Line Filtering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;related electrode materials have been widely demonstrated to significantly increase the performance of electrochemical capacitors because of their light weight, high strength and high processability. The preparation method and structure design of carbon&#8208;related electrode materials are very important to the performance of capacitors.







Abstract
High&#8208;frequency responsive electrochemical capacitors (ECs), which can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC), are getting more essential for the rapid development of electronic devices. In order to satisfy the requirements of ECs with fast rate capability and appreciable capacitance density, numerous efforts have been made towards the preparation and design of the electrode material, which is a decisive factor in the performance of ECs. Carbon&#8208;related electrode materials have been widely shown to significantly increase the performance of ECs because of their light weight, high strength, and high processability. In this concept, the latest advances in the rational design and controllable fabrication of carbon&#8208;related electrode materials, including planar 2D materials, random 3D, and vertical carbon materials are summarized. Moreover, the state of the art of carbon&#8208;based ECs is discussed from the viewpoint of the structure of the electrode and performance of ECs. Finally, this concept presents integrated perspectives on the further design and preparation of carbon related ECs.

         <title>Transition Metal Doping Induces Ti3+ to Promote the Performance of SrTiO3@TiO2 Visible Light Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Prepare C1 Product.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe, Co, Ni, Cu&#8208;doped SrTiO3@TiO2 (strontium titanate&#8208;rich titanate) was prepared by a simple and environmentally friendly hydrothermal method. The photoresponse range of SrTiO3@TiO2 material is broadened to the visible region. The Ti3+ induced by the charge compensation effect greatly promotes the photoelectron&#8208;hole separation, which in turn promotes the ability of the catalyst to reduce CO2 to produce C1 products in water.







Abstract
Transition metal Fe, Co, Ni and Cu doped strontium titanate&#8208;rich SrTiO3@TiO2 (STO@T) materials were prepared by hydrothermal method. The prepared doped materials exhibit better photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 ability under visible light conditions. Among them, Fe&#8208;doped and undoped SrTiO3@TiO2 under visible light conditions CO2 reduction products only CO, while M&#8208;STO@T (M=Co, Ni, Cu) samples converted CO2 to CH4. The average methane yield of Ni&#8208;doped STO@T samples are as high as 73.85&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The production of methane is mainly due to the increase in the response of the doped samples to visible light. And the increase in the separation rate of photogenerated electrons and holes and the efficiency of electron transport caused by the generation of impurity levels. The impurity level caused by Ti3+ plays an important role in the production of methane by CO2 visible light reduction. Ni doping effectively improves the photocatalytic performance of STO@T and CO2 reduction mechanism were explained.

         <title>Photochemical Deracemization of a Medicinally&#8208;Relevant Benzopyran using an Oscillatory Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;transformation: Unlike classical enantiomeric resolution methods, crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformations (CIDTs) allow full conversion to the desired enantiomer. Using photochemical racemization for a CIDT has not before been published in the scientific literature. We report the use of an oscillatory flow reactor for efficient irradiation, allowing high yield and &gt;95&#8201;% ee to be achieved in a reaction time of just a few hours.







Abstract
Dynamic deracemization processes, such as crystallization&#8208;induced diastereomer transformations (CIDTs), offer the opportunity to combine racemization and resolution processes, to provide high yields of enantiomerically pure compounds. To date, few of these processes have incorporated photochemical racemization. By combining batch crystallization with a flow photoreactor for efficient irradiation, it is possible to perform such deracemization in an effective, scalable and high yielding manner. After applying design of experiment (DoE) principles and mathematical modelling, the most efficient parameter set could be identified, leading to excellent results in just 4&#8197;h reaction time: isolated yield of 82&#8201;% and assay ee of 96&#8201;%. Such photochemical racemization methods can serve to open new avenues for preparation of enantiomerically pure functional molecules on both small and industrially&#8208;relevant scales.

         <title>Characterization of Asx Turn Types and Their Connate Relationship with &#946;&#8208;Turns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridging the gap between crystallized proteins and gas&#8208;phase models sheds light on the structure and the function of Asx turns. A comparison of the isolated Asx turns, based on an asparagine residue, observed in model peptides by using laser spectroscopic and quantum chemistry diagnostics, with the structures of crystallized proteins supports the premise that Asx turns foster or stabilize classical &#946;&#8208;turn structures, and even promote &#946;&#8208;bulges when Asn is followed by a Gly residue.

         <title>Eco&#8208;conception of Highly Salt&#8208;Tolerant Alkyl Ether Carboxylate Hydrotropes with a Glyceryl Spacer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eco&#8208;compatible access to new alkyl ether carboxylates with a glyceryl spacer is described and their physicochemical properties are evaluated. The targeted application is a hydrotrope that can be use in numerous domains such as extraction, detergency and solubilisation. The interesting properties of these bio&#8208;based hydrotropes make them serious sustainable candidates for applications where high salinity is required.







Abstract
New alkyl ether carboxylates with a glyceryl spacer instead of ethylene glycol units have been synthesised using environmentally friendly methodology. A cascade synthesis of acetalisation and hydrogenolysis was developed to obtain products containing an alkyl chain linked to a glycerol unit bearing a polar carboxylate head. These products were methylated by using trimethyl phosphate to observe the influence of a free or methoxylated alcohol on the physicochemical properties. Finally, saponification gave the carboxylate anionic group of the new hydrotropes. Studying the amphiphilicity, the tolerance to sodium and calcium ions, and the solubilising power of these bio&#8208;based ionic/nonionic hydrotropes has shown that they exhibit significantly improved application properties compared to similar petro&#8208;based hydrotropes.

The cover feature picture shows the successive expansion of a quinoid imidazolylidene&#8208;substituted central sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic core, which is accompanied by a continuous decrease in the HOMO/LUMO gap. This ultimately results in bench&#8208;stable, open&#8208;shell diradicals, as evidenced by the small singlet&#8208;triplet gap. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Formed Stable PbI2/NiOx Interface with Increased Ni3+ Centers for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultraviolet ozone flushing (UVO) has been used to oxidize the NiOx hole&#8208;transport layer (yellow). The lattice bottom left shows the activation of Ni3+ (red balls) at the top of the NiOx film, which can enhance the electrical properties and hole extraction ability of NiOx. Then, by adopting sequential deposition of perovskites, residual PbI2 is automatically formed at the bottom interface (brown layer); this prevents the NiOx film from coming into direct contact with the perovskite layer, thus avoiding NiOx&#8208;related chemical reactions. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Yang, Y. Hou, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200202).

The lattice bottom left shows the activation of Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (red balls) at the top of the NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; film, which can enhance the electrical properties and hole extraction ability of NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, by adopting sequential deposition of perovskites, residual PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is automatically formed at the bottom interface (brown layer); this prevents the NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; film from coming into direct contact with the perovskite layer, thus avoiding NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-related chemical reactions.

         <title>Elaborated Reaction Pathway of Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Conversion with H2O on Gallium Oxide&#8208;Decorated and &#8208;Defective Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elaborate thermodynamic reaction pathways on Ga2O3&#8208;decorated and &#8208;defective surfaces during photothermal catalytic CO2 conversion with H2O have been established. The basic site generated by Ga2O3 decoration on an anatase TiO2 (101) surface enhances the selective adsorption of CO2, and also balances VO formation and CO2 reduction activity. Surface&#8208;defect VO promotes the reaction thermodynamics but tends to be consumed; Ga2O3 helps to keep VO active. Ga2O3 and VO together further decrease the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, thereby promoting C1 production. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8208;W. Zhang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104490).

         <dc:description>
Reviews are more important today than ever. With the glut of new publications, it has become increasing difficult to read all original papers in detail. So, scientists usually first get an overview from reviews. In the review on &#8220;Cyanine Dyes Containing Quinoline Moieties: History, Synthesis, Optical Properties and Applications&#8221; (Chem Eur. J. 2021, 27, 2430), some aspects were incorrectly described and discussed. This correspondence tries to clarify some basics that have been presented insufficiently in the review.

         <title>Formation and Photoinduced Electron Transfer in Porphyrin&#8208; and Phthalocyanine&#8208;Bearing N&#8208;Doped Graphene Hybrids Synthesized by Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroatom&#8208;doped graphene is emerging as an outstanding material for tailoring the properties of graphene by chemical functionalization. With the use of classical click chemistry, N&#8208;doped graphene has been functionalized to carry well&#8208;known photosensitizer electron donors, viz., zinc porphyrin and zinc phthalocyanine. Efficient singlet quenching of photosensitizers was witnessed in these hybrids, and the ultrafast pump&#8211;probe technique provided evidence of excited&#8208;state charge separation in these hybrids, thus making them useful candidates for applications in harvesting light energy. More information can be found in the Research Article by &#193;. Sastre&#8208;Santos, F. D'Souza, F. Langa et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200254).

         <title>A single bioinspired hexameric nickel catechol&#8208;alloxazine catalyst combines metal and radical mechanisms for alkene hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanisms combining organic radicals and metallic intermediates hold strong potential in homogeneous catalysis. Such activation modes require careful optimization of two interconnected processes: one for the generation of radicals and one for their productive integration towards the final product. We report that a bioinspired polymetallic nickel complex can combine ligand&#8208; and metal&#8208;centered reactivities to perform fast hydrosilylation of alkenes under mild conditions through an unusual dual radical&#8208; and metalbased mechanism. This earth&#8208;abundant polymetallic complex incorporating a catechol&#8208;alloxazine motif as redox&#8208;active ligand operates at low catalyst loading (0.25 mol%) and generates silyl radicals and a nickel&#8208;hydride intermediate through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step. Evidence of an isomerization sequence enabling terminal hydrosilylation of internal alkenes points towards the involvement of the nickel&#8208;hydride species in chain walking. This single catalyst promotes a hybrid pathway by combining synergistically ligand and metal participation in both inner&#8208; and outer&#8208; sphere processes.</dc:description>

The derivatization of these  N  &#8208;heterocycles was realized using Grignard reagents for nucleophilic additions to 5&#8208;chloropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidines and TMP  2  Zn&#183;2MgCl  2  &#183;2LiCl allowed regioselective zincations. In the case of 6&#8208;chloroimidazo[1,2&#8208;  b  ]pyridazine, bases such as TMP  2  Zn&#183;MgCl  2  &#183;2LiCl, in the presence or absence of BF  3  &#183;OEt  2  , led to regioselective metalations at positions 3 or 8. Subsequent functionalizations were achieved with TMPMgCl&#183;LiCl, producing various polysubstituted derivatives (up to penta&#8208;substitution). X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the regioselectivity for key functional heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Zwitterionic Block Copolymers for the Synthesis and Stabilization of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional hot injection methods for the preparation of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbX 3 NCs, where X = Cl, Br, or I) rely on small molecule surfactants to produce NCs with cube, plate, or rod&#8208;like morphologies. Here, we describe a new method whereby zwitterionic block copolymers are employed as macromolecular ligands in the perovskite NC synthesis, affording NCs with excellent colloidal stability, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and in some cases distinctly non&#8208;cubic shapes. The block copolymers used in this study&#8212;composed of a poly( n &#8208;butyl methacrylate) hydrophobic block and zwitterionic methacrylate hydrophilic blocks&#8212;dissolve in useful solvents for PNC growth despite containing large mole percentages of zwitterionic groups. PNCs prepared with block copolymer ligands were found to disperse and retain their fluorescence in a range of polar organic solvents and were amenable to direct integration into optically transparent nanocomposite thin films with high PNC content.</dc:description>

Formation of a tetrameric heteropolyoxometalate ring of bismuth&#8208;containing lacunary phosphomolybdate clusters.







Abstract
A new hetero&#8208;bimetallic polyoxometalate (POM) nano&#8208;ring was synthesized in a one&#8208;pot procedure. The structure consists of tetrameric units containing four bismuth&#8208;substituted monolacunary Keggin anions including distorted [BiO8] cubes. The nano&#8208;ring is formed via self&#8208;assembly from metal precursors in aqueous acidic medium. The compound (NH4)16[(BiPMo11O39)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;22&#8201;H2O; (P4Bi4Mo44) was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), Raman spectroscopy, matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionisation&#8208;time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;TOF), and thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry mass spectrometry (TG&#8208;DSC&#8208;MS). The formation of the nano&#8208;ring in solution was studied by time&#8208;resolved in&#8197;situ small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) and in&#8197;situ EXAFS measurements at the Mo&#8722;K and the Bi&#8722;L3 edge indicating a two&#8208;step process consisting of condensation of Mo&#8208;anions and formation of Bi&#8722;Mo&#8208;units followed by a rapid self&#8208;assembly to yield the final tetrameric ring structure.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding with Diaryl Ditellurides: Evidence from Solid State and Solution Studies.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaryl ditelluride derivatives bearing different functional groups were prepared with the aim to study their ability to interact through chalcogen bonding (ChB). Rectangular Te4 and triangular Te3 motifs were observed in the solid&#8208;state as a result of intermolecular Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te ChB. In solution, the use of the very sensitive 125Te, 17O NMR analyses as well as 19F&#8722;1H HOESY allowed unambiguous detection of a Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bond between the diaryl ditellurides and phosphine oxides.







Abstract
The chalcogen bonding (ChB) ability of Te is studied in symmetrical diaryl ditellurides ArTeTeAr. Among the two Te &#963;&#8208;holes, the one along the less polarized Te&#8722;Te bond was calculated as the more electropositive. This counter&#8208;intuitive situation is due to the hyperconjugation contribution from Te lone pair to the &#963;* of the adjacent Te which coincides with &#963;&#8208;hole along the more polarized Te&#8722;Ar bond. ArTeTeAr showed notable structural features in the solid state as a result of intermolecular Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te ChB, such as a Te4 rectangle through dimer aggregation or a triangular Te3 motif, where one Te interacts with both Te atoms of a neighboring molecule through both its &#963;&#8208;hole and lone pair, in a slightly frustrated geometry. Lewis acidity of ArTeTeAr was also evaluated by NMR with R3PO as &#963;&#8208;hole acceptors in different solvents. Thus, 125Te NMR allowed monitoring Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction and delivering association constants (Ka) for 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts. The highest value of Ka=90&#8197;M&#8722;1 was measured for the adduct between ArTeTeAr bearing CF3 groups and Et3PO in cyclohexane. Notably, by using nBu3PO, Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction was revealed by 19F&#8208;1H HOESY showing spatial proximity between CF3 and CH3 of nBu3PO.

         <title>Azide&#8211;Alkyne Interactions: A Crucial Attractive Force for Their Preorganization for Topochemical Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complete crystallographic, experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical investigation for novel azide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;alkyne supramolecular contacts in molecular crystals has established the directing role of such favorable interactions in topochemical cycloaddition reactions. The origin, geometry, and energetics of azide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;alkyne contacts have been extensively probed through topological analysis, a reduced density gradient method, electrostatic potential maps, and solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase energy decomposition analysis. This new attractive interaction may be used in designing functional crystalline materials.







Abstract
A new class of attractive intermolecular interaction between azide and ethynyl structural entities in a wide range of molecular crystals is reported. This interaction was systematically evaluated by using 11 geometrically different structural motifs that are preorganized to direct a solid&#8208;state topochemical azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (TAAC) reaction. The supramolecular features of the azide&#8211;alkyne interaction were mapped by various crystallographic and quantum chemical approaches. Topological analysis shows the noticeable participation of electron density in the azide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;alkyne interactions. Interestingly, reorientation of the atomic polarizabilities in vicinal azide and alkyne groups upon interaction in crystals favors soft orbital&#8208;guided TAAC reactions. Moreover, various solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase energy decomposition methods of individual azide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;alkyne interactions summarize that the strength (varies from &#8722;5.7 to &#8722;30.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) is primarily guided by the dispersion forces with a influencing contribution from the electrostatics.

         <title>The Non&#8208;Ancillary Nature of Trimethylsilylamide Substituents in Boranes and Borinium Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of borinium cations were generated from boranes by fluoride extraction. The authors investigated the reaction mechanism using observational and density functional calculations and discuss how silyl&#8208;amide substituents in boranes and borinium cations are shown not to be ancillary substituents, but rather act as sources of protons, SiMe3 and methyl groups.







Abstract
The known boranes (R(Me3Si)N)2BF (R=Me3Si 1, tBu 2, C6F5 3, o&#8208;tol 4, Mes 5, Dipp 6) and borinium salts (R(Me3Si)N)2B][B(C6F5)4] (R=Me3Si 7, tBu 8) are prepared and fully characterized. Compound 7 is shown to react with phosphines to generate [R3PSiMe3]+ and [R3PH]+ (R=Me, tBu). Efforts to generate related borinium cations via fluoride abstraction from (R(Me3Si)N)2BF (R=C6F5 3, o&#8208;tol 4, Mes 5) gave complex mixtures suggesting multiple reaction pathways. However for R=Dipp 6, the species [(&#956;&#8208;F)(SiMe2N(Dipp))2BMe][B(C6F5)4] was isolated as the major product, indicating methyl abstraction from silicon and F/Me exchange on boron. These observations together with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT mechanistic studies reveal that the trimethylsilyl&#8208;substituents do not behave as ancillary subsitutents but rather act as sources of proton, SiMe3 and methyl groups.

     alt="The Non-Ancillary Nature of Trimethylsilylamide Substituents in Boranes and Borinium Cations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A series of borinium cations were generated&lt;/b&gt; from boranes by fluoride extraction. The authors investigated the reaction mechanism using observational and density functional calculations and discuss how silyl-amide substituents in boranes and borinium cations are shown not to be ancillary substituents, but rather act as sources of protons, SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and methyl groups.

         <title>An Allyl Uranium(IV) Sandwich Complex: Are &#981; Bonding Interactions Possible?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes of actinide species that employ the unique orbital structure of the f orbitals is still quite rare. We have used theory&#8208;directed synthesis to create a unique uranium&#8208;allyl species with an orbital configuration designed to optimize the potential for ligand&#8208;f orbital bonding. The resulting U&#8208;allyl sandwich complex displays unexpected 3c&#8211;2e bonding between the uranium center and two ligand&#8208;based carbons with a large degree of covalency.







Abstract
A method to explore head&#8208;to&#8208;head &#981; back&#8208;bonding from uranium f&#8208;orbitals into allyl &#960;* orbitals has been pursued. Anionic allyl groups were coordinated to uranium with tethered anilide ligands, then the products were investigated by using NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal XRD, and theoretical methods. The (allyl)silylanilide ligand, N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enylsilyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline (LH), was used as either the fully protonated, singly deprotonated, or doubly deprotonated form, thereby highlighting the stability and versatility of the silylanilide motif. A free, neutral allyl group was observed in UI2(L1)2 (1), which was synthesized by using the mono&#8208;deprotonated ligand [K][N&#8208;((dimethyl)prop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl)silyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] (L1). The desired homoleptic sandwich complex U[L2]2 (2) was prepared from all three ligand precursors, but the most consistent results came from using the dipotassium salt of the doubly deprotonated ligand [K]2[N&#8208;((dimethyl)propenidesilyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilide] (L2). This allyl&#8208;based sandwich complex was studied by using theoretical techniques with supporting experimental spectroscopy to investigate the potential for phi (&#981;) back&#8208;bonding. The bonding between UIV and the allyl fragments is best described as ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal electron donation from a two carbon fragment&#8208;localized electron density into empty f&#8208;orbitals.

         <title>Perovskite Photovoltaics for Artificial Light Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite photovoltaics are being intensely explored as artificial light cells for harvesting and recycling indoor light energy, which would realize self&#8208;powered internet of things. This Review presents the scope of works in perovskite artificial light cells that have been attained with both material and device engineering, and proposes possible solutions and direction for future research.







Abstract
Perovskites have encountered a growing interest as light&#8208;absorbing materials for harvesting and recycling ambient light. This interest comes from the distinct and impressive intrinsic properties of these materials and is necessitated by the need for reliable and sustainable power supplies for wearable and portable internet of things (IoT) applications. Perovskite artificial light cells (PALCs; i.&#8201;e., indoor perovskite photovoltaics) have been intensively explored, and thus their device performance has been rapidly augmented. In this review, we summarize and consolidate the research outputs of PALCs by focusing on the tuning of photo&#8208;absorber and interlayer materials for efficient harvest and collection of artificial light sources. We also emphasize various challenges and possible future research directions that should be addressed for realizing a large market uptake of PALCs.

         <dc:description>
The importance of O/N&#8208;glycosides as biologically active compounds cannot be overstated. This study is focused on the functionalization of glycals and ribals at the C2 position with alkyl, vinyl, aryl, heteroaryl and strained ring substituents. The functionalized glycals and ribals were transformed into 2&#8208;C&#8208;deoxyglycosides and 2&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;deoxynucleosides. The application to the synthesis of an analogue of cladribine and clofarabine is described.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8208;C&#8208;glycals and 2&#8208;C&#8208;ribals was achieved in good yields using a nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling between 2&#8208;iodoglycals and 2&#8208;iodoribal respectively and Grignard reagents. The prepared 2&#8208;C&#8208;glycals and ribals were then transformed into 2&#8208;C&#8208;2&#8208;deoxyglycosides, 2&#8208;C&#8208;diglycosides and 2&#8217;&#8208;C&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxynucleosides. The developed method was applied to the synthesis of a 2&#8208;chloroadenine
2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside &#8211; a structural analogue of cladribine (Mavenclad&#174;, Leustatin&#174;) and clofarabine (Clolar&#174;, Evoltra&#174;), two compounds used in the treatment of relapsing&#8208;remitting multiple sclerosis and hairy cell leukemia.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in Molecular Systems: Thermodynamic Evaluation of the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Strength in Amino&#8208;Ethers and Amino&#8208;Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strength of NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bond in three series of amino&#8208;alcohols characterized by branching, mono&#8208;alkylation of the amino group, or increased chain length between the functional groups, was evaluated by a combination of quantum chemistry and a method based on experimental vaporization enthalpies. It was observed that moderate tertiary branching at the H&#8208;acceptor or at the H&#8208;donor side has only a marginal effect on the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond strength so that it remains in the range of &#8722;4&#8197;kJ&#8901;mol&#8722;1 to &#8722;6&#8197;kJ&#8901;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
The intramolecular hydrogen bond (intra&#8208;HB) is one of the best&#8208;known examples of non&#8208;covalent interactions in molecules. Among the different types of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond in amino&#8208;alcohols and amino&#8208;ethers is one of the weakest. In contrast to the strong OH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N intramolecular hydrogen bond, the strength of the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bond can hardly be measured with conventional spectroscopic methods, even for simple amino&#8208;alcohols, since the band belonging to the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O conformer merges with the free OH band. In this work, we developed a combination of G4 calculations, and a method based on experimental vaporization enthalpies to determine the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonding strength. The archetypal compounds for this study are 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;ethanol and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;propanol as well as their respective methoxy analogs. Based on these molecules, different series were studied to investigate various factors influencing NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O intra&#8208;HB strength. In the first series, the influence of alkylation near the hydroxy or methoxy group and the amino group in sterically hindered aminoalcohols was examined. In the second series, the influence of alkylation of the amino&#8208;group was investigated. In the third series, the effect of extending the alkyl chain between functional groups was studied.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The strength of NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bond&lt;/b&gt; in three series of amino-alcohols characterized by branching, mono-alkylation of the amino group, or increased chain length between the functional groups, was evaluated by a combination of quantum chemistry and a method based on experimental vaporization enthalpies. It was observed that moderate tertiary branching at the H-acceptor or at the H-donor side has only a marginal effect on the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond strength so that it remains in the range of &#8722;4&#8197;kJ&#8901;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to &#8722;6&#8197;kJ&#8901;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The intramolecular hydrogen bond (intra-HB) is one of the best-known examples of non-covalent interactions in molecules. Among the different types of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond in amino-alcohols and amino-ethers is one of the weakest.

In this work, we developed a combination of G4 calculations, and a method based on experimental vaporization enthalpies to determine the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonding strength. The archetypal compounds for this study are 2-amino-1-ethanol and 3-amino-1-propanol as well as their respective methoxy analogs. Based on these molecules, different series were studied to investigate various factors influencing NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O intra-HB strength. In the first series, the influence of alkylation near the hydroxy or methoxy group and the amino group in sterically hindered aminoalcohols was examined.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Dehydroxyazidation of Alcohols Promoted by Trifunctional Hypervalent Azido&#8208;Iodine(III) Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a mild, metal&#8208;free practical method for late&#8208;stage dehydroxyazidation of structurally complex alcohols promoted by trifunctional hypervalent azido&#8208;iodine(III) reagents ABZ. The reactions proceeded via an SN2 pathway and showed excellent chemoselectivity and stereospecificity and gave the corresponding azides in high yields. The reaction mechanism was investigated by means of experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The development of convenient new methods for the synthesis of organic azides is highly desirable. Herein, we report a practical method for dehydroxyazidation of alcohols via an SN2 pathway involving PPh3 and trifunctional benziodazolone&#8208;based hypervalent azido&#8208;iodine(III) reagents, which function as an electrophilic center, an azido source, and a base. This mild, chemoselective method was used for late&#8208;stage azidation of structurally complex alcohols, as well as for a new synthetic route to the antiepileptic drug rufinamide. The reaction mechanism was also investigated both experimentally and computationally.

         <title>Quantum Chemistry&#8208;based Molecular Dynamics Simulations as a Tool for the Assignment of ESI&#8208;MS/MS Spectra of Drug Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The previously unknown fragmentation pathways of the two drug molecules Nateglinide (45 atoms) and Zopiclone (51 atoms) are completely elucidated using a combination of generic formalisms and calculations conducted with the Quantum Chemical Mass Spectrometry (QCxMS) program. The computations of the de novo fragment spectra were conducted with the semi&#8208;empirical GFNn&#8208;xTB (n=1, 2) methods and compared against Orbitrap measured electrospray ionization (ESI) spectra in positive ion mode.







Abstract
In organic mass spectrometry, fragment ions provide important information on the analyte as a central part of its structure elucidation. With increasing molecular size and possible protonation sites, the potential energy surface (PES) of the analyte can become very complex, which results in a large number of possible fragmentation patterns. Quantum chemical (QC) calculations can help here, enabling the fast calculation of the PES and thus enhancing the mass spectrometry&#8208;based structure elucidation processes. In this work, the previously unknown fragmentation pathways of the two drug molecules Nateglinide (45 atoms) and Zopiclone (51 atoms) were investigated using a combination of generic formalisms and calculations conducted with the Quantum Chemical Mass Spectrometry (QCxMS) program. The computations of the de novo fragment spectra were conducted with the semi&#8208;empirical GFNn&#8208;xTB (n=1, 2) methods and compared against Orbitrap measured electrospray ionization (ESI) spectra in positive ion mode. It was found that the unbiased QC calculations are particularly suitable to predict non&#8208;evident fragment ion structures, sometimes contrasting the accepted generic formulation of fragment ion structures from electron migration rules, where the &#8220;true&#8221; ion fragment structures are approximated. For the first time, all fragment and intermediate structures of these large&#8208;sized molecules could be elucidated completely and routinely using this merger of methods, finding new undocumented mechanisms, that are not considered in common rules published so far. Given the importance of ESI for medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and metabolomics, this approach can significantly enhance the mass spectrometry&#8208;based structure elucidation processes and contribute to the understanding of previously unknown fragmentation pathways.

         <title>Cocrystal Formation Precedes the Mechanochemically Acetate&#8208;Assisted C&#8722;H Activation with [Cp*RhCl2]2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic insights into the mechanochemically acetate&#8208;assisted C&#8722;H activation of nitrogen containing substrates with [Cp*RhCl2]2 are reported in this work. Ex&#8208;situ analysis revealed the formation of unexpected crystalline phases prior to the C&#8722;H activation step, making the mechanochemical pathway different from the mechanism in solution. Moreover, the mechanochemical protocol enabled the synthesis of Cp*Rh(2&#8208;benzilpyridine)Cl, a the six&#8208;membered rhodacycle previously reported as impossible to access in solution.







Abstract
This work reports the experimentally studied mechanochemical formation of rhodacycles by ball milling pyridine&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;derived substrates and [Cp*RhCl2]2 in the presence of NaOAc. Ex&#8208;situ analysis of the mechanochemical reactions using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy revealed the formation of unexpected cocrystals between the substrates and the rhodium dimer prior to the C&#8722;H activation step. This sequence of events differs from the generally accepted steps in solution in which cleavage of [Cp*RhCl2]2 is initiated by acetate ions. Additionally, the mechanochemical approach enabled the synthesis of the six&#8208;membered rhodacycle [Cp*Rh(2&#8208;benzilpyridine)Cl], a metal complex repeatedly reported as inaccessible in solution. Altogether, the results of this investigation clarify some of the fundamental aspects of mechanochemical cyclometallations.

Coupling organically: The first metal&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;&#945;&#8208;arylation of carbonyl compounds employing soluble organic base is reported, with transformations spanning a range of (hetero)aryl electrophiles in combination with feedstock small molecule substrates acetone, dimethylacetamide, and for the first time, ethyl acetate.







Abstract
We report on our successful development of the first metal&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;&#945;&#8208;arylation of carbonyl compounds employing a soluble organic base. The scope of these Ni/DalPhos&#8208;catalyzed transformations encompasses a range of (hetero)aryl halides (Cl, Br, I) and phenol&#8208;derived electrophiles (sulfonates, carbonates, carbamates, sulfamates), including active pharmaceutical ingredients (chloroquine, clozapine), in combination with the typically problematic feedstock small molecule substrates acetone, dimethylacetamide, and for the first time with any metal catalyst/base, ethyl acetate.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chromans Through Bifunctional Enamine&#8208;Metal Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise method for the asymmetric synthesis of tricyclic chromans from salicylaldehydes and cyclic ketones was developed through bifunctional enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis. Mechanism of the chroman formation reaction was proposed and investigated with deuterium experiments and DFT calculations. Tricyclic chromans containing three consecutive stereogenic centers were prepared in good yields (up to 87&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee and 11&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).







Abstract
Cooperative enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to construct carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond forming reactions. A concise synthetic method for asymmetric synthesis of chromans from cyclohexanones and salicylaldehydes has been developed to afford tricyclic chromans containing three consecutive stereogenic centers in good yields (up to 87&#8201;%) and stereoselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee and 11&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). This difficult organic transformation was achieved through bifunctional enamine&#8208;metal Lewis acid catalysis. It is believed that the strong activation of the salicylaldehydes through chelating to the metal Lewis acid and the bifunctional nature of the catalyst accounts for the high yields and enantioselectivity of the reaction. The absolute configurations of the chroman products were established through X&#8208;ray crystallography. DFT calculations were conducted to understand the mechanism and stereoselectivity of this reaction.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Site&#8208; and Enantioselective Carbene Insertion into Carbon&#8208;Silicon Bonds of Benzosilacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand&#8208;controlled carbene insertion into C(sp3)&#8722;Si and C(sp2)&#8722;Si bonds of benzosilacyclobutanes has been achieved. With sterically bulky BINOL&#8208;based chiral phosphoramidite ligand L1, carbene insertion into the C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond occurred to afford product A in excellent site&#8208; and enantioselectivity. By employing less sterically hindered chiral spiro&#8208;phosphoramidite ligand L2, carbene C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond insertion occurred to give product B with high site&#8208;selectivity. DFT calculation reveals the reaction mechanism and the factors governing the selectivity.







Abstract
We report herein a highly efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbene insertion into strained Si&#8722;C bonds of benzosilacyclobutanes, which provides an efficient method to access &#945;&#8208;chiral silanes. With a sterically hindered ligand, carbene insertion into the C(sp3)&#8722;Si bond of benzosilacyclobutanes occurred in excellent site&#8208; and enantioselectivity, while C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond insertion occurred selectively with less sterically hindered ligands. Reaction mechanism, in particular the roles of the chiral ligands in controlling the site&#8208;selectivity of the insertion reactions, are elucidated by using hybrid density functional theory.

         <title>Systematic Exploration of Furoindolizine&#8208;Based Molecular Frameworks towards a Versatile Fluorescent Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pair wise: The furoindolizine&#8208;based molecular framework is a versatile single&#8208;core platform capable of modulating various photophysical properties such as emission wavelength, Stokes shift, fluorescent brightness, and charge&#8208;transfer characteristics with a precise prediction. Through an in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;photophysical property relationship study, we demonstrated the rational development of live&#8208;cell imaging probes with two distinct optical features simply by reorganizing a pair of functional moieties.







Abstract
The photophysical behaviors of fluorescent molecules largely determine their major utility in biological studies. Despite their well&#8208;defined characteristics, classical fluorophores have often been challenged by their limited synthetic methodology and tunability in adjusting intrinsic optical properties. A novel heterocyclic core equipped with modular functional groups could offer the flexibility to control its photophysical properties with a minimum synthetic effort. By conducting a systematic analysis guided by quantum calculations, we proposed the furoindolizine&#8208;based molecular framework as a unique fluorescent platform capable of providing versatile photophysical properties with minimal structural modification. A broad tunability of furoindolizine derivatives&#8242; photophysical properties such as emission wavelength, Stokes shift, fluorescent brightness, and charge transfer characteristics was achieved through synergistic interaction between two functional moieties. Furthermore, this modular platform led to live&#8208;cell imaging probes with two distinct optical features simply by reorganizing a pair of functional moieties.

         <title>Reactions of a Four&#8208;Membered Borete with Carbon, Silicon, and Gallium Donor Ligands: Fused and Spiro&#8208;Type Boracycles</title>

         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes or cyclobutanes are dipolar reagents, which are widely used in the synthesis of complex organic (hetero)cycles in ring expansion reactions. Applying this concept to boron containing heterocycles, the four&#8208;membered borete  cyclo  &#8208;  i  Pr  2  N&#8722;BC  10  H  6  reacted with the carbon donor ligands 2,6&#8208;xylylisonitrile and the carbene IMes :C(NMesCH)  2  with ring expansion and ring fusion, respectively. In particular, the tetracyclic structure formed with&#160;IMes displays zwitterionic character and absorption in the visible region. In contrast to the carbene IMes, the heavier carbenoids :Si(NDippCH)  2  and :Ga(AmIm) with a two&#8208;coordinate donor atom afford  spiro  &#8208;type bicyclic compounds, which display four&#8208;coordinate geometry at silicon or gallium. (TD&#8208;)DFT calculations provide deeper insight into the mechanism of formation and the absorption properties of these new compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Fundamental Polymer Chemistry of Inverse Vulcanization for Statistical and Segmented Copolymers from Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We discuss in this CONCEPT mini&#8208;review the fundamental and polymerization chemistry of inverse vulcanization for the preparation of statistical and segmented sulfur copolymers, which have been actively developed and advanced in various applications over the past decade. We explicitly delve into a discussion of step&#8208;growth polymerization constructs to describe the inverse vulcanization process and discuss prepolymer approaches for the synthesis of segmented sulfur polyurethanes. We further discuss the advantages of inverse vulcanization in conjunction with dynamic covalent polymerization and post&#8208;polymerization modifications to prepare segmented block copolymers with enhanced thermomechanical and flame retardant properties of these materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Super&#8208;assembled Hierarchical Asymmetric Magnetic Mesoporous Nanorobots Driven by Smart Confined Catalytic Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Micro&#8208; and nanoscale robots have have been receiving great attention in many important fields including environmental remediation, smart sensing, drug delivery, and biological surgeries. However, it is still a great challenge to construct robots with multifunctionality, well&#8208;controlled directionality, fast and durable motion as well as fully compatible and biodegradable. Herein, a hierarchical asymmetric hollow catalytic magnetic mesoporous nanomotor is fabricated through multistpe interfacial super&#8208;assembly strategy. The multilayer composites consist of hollow silica nanoflask coated sequentially a highly magnetic responsive Fe  3  O  4  layer and mesoporous silica layer with homogeneous vertical channels as well a layer of catalytic Au NPs on both the inner and outer surfaces. Furthermore, p&#8208;nitrophenol was used as a model pollutant to trigger motor motility by confined catalytic degradation (CCD) of Au NP layer inside the cavity. We found that the elongated bottleneck and mesoporous surface both improve CCD effect, thus enabling directional self&#8208;propulsion and durable movement capacity with ~100 hours of nanorobots. Overall, these findings offer important insights into how structure design, particularly cavity feacture, is beneficial for self&#8208;motility and provide fascinating potential in environemntal redmediation, nanoreactor, biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of a Fully Continuous&#8208;Flow Approach Towards Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Tetrahydroprotoberberine Natural Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Continuous flow synthetic technologies have found tremendous applications and thus immensely promoted total synthesis in the past few decades. However, fully continuous flow synthesis are still extremely limited in multi&#8208;step synthesis of complex natural pharmaceutical molecules. Thus, the development of fully continuous flow total synthesis of natural products is in demand but challenging. Herein, we demonstrated the first fully continuous flow approach towards asymmetric total synthesis of natural tetrahydroprotoberberine alkaloids, (&#8211;)&#8208;isocanadine, (&#8211;)&#8208;tetrahydropseudocoptisine, (&#8211;)&#8208;stylopine and (&#8211;)&#8208;nandinine. This method features a concise linear sequence involving four chemical transformations and three on&#8208;line work&#8208;up processing in an integrated flow platform, without any intermediate purification. The overall yield and enantioselectivity of this four&#8208;step continuous flow chemistry were up to 50% and 92% ee , respectively, in a total residence time of 32.5 min, corresponding to a throughput of 145 mg/h.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Eu  2+  , Mn  2+  and Eu  2+  &#8208;Mn  2+  doped CaMgSi  2  O  6  phosphors are prepared by a high temperature solid&#8208;state reaction procedure. It is found that Mn  2+  ions occupy two distinct sites in CaMgSi  2  O  6  by the systematical investigations on concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208; dependent luminescence of Mn  2+  . The electron&#8208;vibrational interaction (EVI) analyses of Mn  2+  ions reveal the Huang&#8208;Rhys factors of 4.73 and 2.82 as well as the effective phonon energies of 313 and 383 cm  &#8208;1  for two sites. Further, the Eu  2+  &#8208;Mn  2+  energy transfer is discussed and its efficiency is estimated by lifetime and luminescence spectra, respectively. The different thermal quenching behaviours of Eu  2+  and Mn  2+  , the distinct emission colours of Eu  2+  (blue, band peak at ~451 nm) and Mn  2+  (yellow&#8208;red range, band peaks at ~583 and 693 nm) endow the co&#8208;doped samples potential applications in luminescence thermometry and temperature/excitation wavelength responsive dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting from a Discrete Hybrid Bismuth Bromide Ferroelectric Templated by Phosphonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bismuth containing hybrid molecular ferroelectrics are receiving tremendous attention in recent years owing to their stable and non&#8208;toxic composition. However, these perovskite&#8208;like structures are primarily limited to ammonium cations. Herein, we report a new phosphonium based discrete perovskite&#8208;like hybrid ferroelectric with a formula [Me(Ph)  3  P]  3  [Bi  2  Br  9  ] (  MTPBB  ) and its mechanical energy harvesting capability. The Polarization&#8208;Electric field (  P&#8208;E  ) measurements resulted in a well&#8208;defined ferroelectric hysteresis loop with a remnant polarization value of 2.1  &#181;  C cm  &#8208;2  . Piezoresponse force microscopy experiments enabled visualization of the ferroelectric domain structure and evaluation of the piezoelectric strain coefficient (  d  33  ) for an&#160; MTPBB  single crystal and thin film sample. Furthermore, flexible devices incorporating  MTPBB  in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix at various concentrations were fabricated and explored for their mechanical energy harvesting properties. The champion device with 20 wt. % of  MTPBB  in PDMS rendered a maximum peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of 22.9 V and a maximum power density of 7  &#181;  W cm  &#8208;2  at an optimal load of 4 M&#937;. Moreover, the potential of  MTPBB  &#8208;based devices in low power electronics was demonstrated by storing the harvested energy in various electrolytic capacitors.</dc:description>

         <title>First&#8208;principles design of Na&#8208;ion superionic conductors: Interstitial&#8208;based Na diffusion in NaCuZrS3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SS&#8208;SIBs) have drawn significant attention due to their potential to be safer and lower cost than lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the lack of sodium solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity has become one of the major challenges. Here, with first&#8208;principles computation we took NaCuZrS3 , consisting of earth&#8208;abundant and environmentally benign elements only, as an example to study Na&#8208;ion transport in the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like structure and used computation&#8208;guided design to improve its potential as a solid&#8208;state electrolyte. With ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and nudged elastic band calculation, we studied possible diffusion mechanisms in this material and found that Na ion interstitials have a favorable migration barrier of 0.22 eV, which is among the smallest in the literature reported values. Considering the large formation energy of Frenkel defects, we proposed doping strategy to introduce extra Na interstitials in the material. Our study suggests that the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like sulfides are worth of exploration for applications in SS&#8208;SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Glucosylated 5&#8208;hydroxymethylpyrimidines as epigenetic DNA bases regulating transcription and restriction cleavage</title>

         <dc:description>5&#8208;(&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Glucopyranosyloxymethyl)&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine and &#8208;cytidine 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates were prepared and used for polymerase&#8208;mediated (primer extension or PCR) synthesis of DNA containing glucosylated 5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) or 5&#8208;hydroxymethyluracil (5hmC). The presence of any glucosylated pyrimidines fully protected DNA from cleavage by type II restriction endonucleases. On the other hand, while the presence of glucosylated 5hmU completely inhibited transcription by bacterial ( Escherichia coli ) RNA polymerase, the DNA containing the corresponding glucosylated 5hmC allowed a similar level of transcription as natural DNA. This suggests different roles of these hypermodified bases in epigenetic regulation of transcription in bacteriophages or kinetoplastid parasites. Consequently, enzymatic glucosylation of 5hmC&#8208;containing DNA can be used for tuning of transcription activity.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes Carrying Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this concept article we provide a brief overview of the design and preparation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes carrying weakly coordinating anions (WCA&#8208;NHCs). The anionic charge in these ligand systems is located on an exocyclic group,  e.g  ., B(C6F5)3  , tethered to the backbone of the imidazole ring, thus resembling a weakly coordinating moiety. With the general guiding principle behind the application of WCA&#8208;NHCs being the conversion of otherwise cationic NHC complexes into their overall neutral congeners, numerous transition metal as well as main group element complexes were isolated during the last decade, which are summarized herein.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of the carbene&#8208;stabilized boryl phosphinidenes (  1  &#8208;  3  ). The compounds (  1  &#8208;  3  ) are obtained by reaction of Me&#8208;cAAC=PK (Me  2  &#8208;cAAC = dimethyl cyclic (alkyl) (amino) carbene) and dihaloarylborane in toluene. All three compounds are characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Quantum mechanical studies indicate that these compounds have two lone pairs on the P&#8208;center viz., &#963;&#8208;type&#8208;lone pair, and a 'hidden' p&#8208;type&#8208;lone pair. Hence, these compounds can act as double Lewis bases, and the basicity of the p&#8208;type lone pair is higher than the &#963;&#8208;type&#8208;lone pair.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes a homometallic spin &#189; tetrabromocuprate adopting a bilayer structure. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show a broad maximum centered near 70 K, with fits to this data using a Heisenberg model consistent with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between neighboring Cu in different layers of the bilayer. There are further weak intralayer ferromagnetic interactions between Cu cations in neighboring dimers. First principles calculations are consistent with this but suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this would suggest the presence of a spin&#8208;ladder within the bilayer with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical and Electrochemical Strategies for Hydrodefluorination of Fluorinated Organic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrodefluorination (HDF) is a very important fundamental transformation for conversion of the C&#8722;F bond into the C&#8722;H bond in organic synthesis. In this Review, we mainly focus on the HDF of fluorinated organic compounds (FOCs) by photo&#8208; and electrochemical strategies, along with mechanistic insights.







Abstract
Hydrodefluorination (HDF) is a very important fundamental transformation for conversion of the C&#8722;F bond into the C&#8722;H bond in organic synthesis. In the past decade, much progress has been achieved with HDF through the utility of low&#8208;valent metals, transition&#8208;metal complexes and main&#8208;group Lewis acids. Recently, novel methods have been introduced for this purpose through photo&#8208; and electrochemical pathways, which are of great significance, due to their considerable environmental and economical advantages. This Review highlights the HDF of fluorinated organic compounds (FOCs) through photo&#8208; and electrochemical strategies, along with mechanistic insights.

         <title>Diradicals Photogeneration from Chloroaryl&#8208;Substituted Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New classes of thermally inaccessible diradicals having aggressive or stabilized radical sites have been generated under mild conditions by an Intramolecular Electron Transfer (IET) process occurring in photogenerated triplet phenyl cations.







Abstract
With the aim of generating new, thermally inaccessible diradicals, potentially able to induce a double&#8208;strand DNA cleavage, the photochemistry of a set of chloroaryl&#8208;substituted carboxylic acids in polar media was investigated. The photoheterolytic cleavage of the Ar&#8722;Cl bond occurred in each case to form the corresponding triplet phenyl cations. Under basic conditions, the photorelease of the chloride anion was accompanied by an intramolecular electron&#8208;transfer from the carboxylate group to the aromatic radical cationic site to give a diradical species. This latter intermediate could then undergo CO2 loss in a structure&#8208;dependent fashion, according to the stability of the resulting diradical, or abstract a hydrogen atom from the medium. In aqueous environment at physiological pH (pH=7.3), both a phenyl cation and a diradical chemistry was observed. The mechanistic scenario and the role of the various intermediates (aryl cations and diradicals) involved in the process was supported by computational analysis.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work explores the benefits of single&#8208;phase oxalate precursors for the preparation of spinel ferrites by thermal decomposition. A direct comparison between the genuine oxalate solid solution and the physical mixture of simple oxalates is presented using the case study of cobalt ferrite preparation. The mixing of metal cations within a single oxalate structure could be verified prior to its thermal decomposition by several non&#8208;destructive experimental techniques, namely M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction (XRD) and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. In&#8208;situ XRD experiments were conducted to compare the decomposition processes of the solid solution and the physical mixture. Additionally, the decomposition products of the FeCo oxalate solid solution were studied ex&#8208;situ by means of N  2  adsorption, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and XRD. The results obtained for different reaction temperatures demonstrate the possibilities to easily control the physical properties of the prepared oxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonalization of polyaryl linkers as a route to more porous phosphonate metal&#8208;organic frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphonate metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer more robust structures than the majority of MOFs. However, the coordinative pliancy of the phosphonate functional group means that metal&#8208;phosphonate materials have easier routes to well&#8208;packed structures with minimal porosity as efficient inter&#8208;ligand packing is enabled. Here, we apply a ligand orthogonalization strategy to form more porous phosphonate MOFs. We report a multistep synthesis of an orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphonophenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene (H6L2). To illustrate the general structure directing role of the linker, we report a series of six crystalline metal&#8208;phosphonate frameworks (CALF 35&#8208;39) by coordinating divalent metals (Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, Zn). When coordinated to metals, H6L2 is unable to pack efficiently and, as a consequence, yields several distinct microporous structures. The resulting structures are discussed in detail, with a focus on solid&#8208;state packing of the sterically rigidified linker. Combined with larger cations (Sr, and Ba), H6L2 packs in a parallel&#8208;offset manner, yielding isomorphous and microporous metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CALF&#8208;35 (Sr), and (Ba)). When coordinated to smaller metals (Ca, Mg, Zn), H6L2 forms four new structures. Two Ca MOFs of different stoichiometry, (CALF&#8208;36 and 37) and a Mg MOF CALF&#8211;38 show narrow pores and have high selectivities for CO2 over N2 and CH4. Finally, in CALF&#8208;39 (Zn), H6L2 linkers pack in a herringbone fashion, resulting in a material with 10.9 x 10.1 &#197;2 square channels. Stability testing of all structures was carried out and the most porous structure, CALF&#8208;39 (Zn) retained its structure and gas adsorption after immersion in water over pH 3&#8208;11.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetranuclear Dicationic Aurophilic Gold(I) Catalysts in Enyne Cycloisomerization: Cooperativity for a Dramatic Shift in Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards specific &#8220;cluster&#8208;like&#8221; reactivity? Ligands pre&#8208;organizing gold centers in a constrained environment, assisted by aurophilic interactions, push further the selectivity not achieved by mono&#8208; and digold complexes from previously unseen cooperative tetragold catalysis.







Abstract
In comparison to mononuclear gold Lewis acid catalysts, digold complexes and dual&#8208;gold catalysis have illustrated a distinct and powerful potential for the activation of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds. Herein, this concept is pushed further by designing novel tetranuclear gold(I) dicationic complexes structurally supported by strongly stabilizing constraint diphosphinoferrocenyl ligands and attractive closed&#8208;shell Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au aurophilic interactions. The use of a molecularly&#8208;defined tetranuclear dicationic aurophilic gold(I) precatalyst for the selectivity&#8208;challenging cycloisomerization of low&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes favors the formation with high selectivity of strained azabicyclo[4.1.0]hept&#8208;4&#8208;enes &#8211; even in the complete absence of activating/orienting substituents on alkyne and olefin reactive functions. This selectivity is not achieved by the reported phosphine&#8208; and carbene&#8208;stabilized mono&#8208; and dinuclear cationic gold(I) complexes, including the ones formed from the same ligands. More importantly this selectivity differs also from nanoparticles and heterogeneous gold catalysts reported to date. DFT studies correlated to experimental mechanistic investigations support an unprecedented &#8220;cluster&#8208;like&#8221; reactivity from polynuclear cooperation at the origin of this peculiar selectivity where the aurophilic interactions preexist, and pre&#8208;organize, gold cluster reactive intermediates.

         <title>Different Topologies of Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine 1D Coordination Polymers: Dynamic Behavior in Solvent Adsorption and Exchange Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By reacting the novel bispidine ligand L3 with HgCl2, various coordination polymers having three different topologies (zig&#8208;zag, ribbon&#8208;like and poly[n]catenane), but all constituted by linear 1D arrays, can be formed. Their ability to undergo structural transformation via adsorption or solvent exchange has been reported and related to their structural features.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional (1D) coordination polymers (CPs) featuring three different topologies, comprising zig&#8208;zag, ribbon&#8208;like and poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenane structures, were obtained by reaction of Hg(II) ions with a novel bispidine ligand L3, and structurally characterized by SC&#8208; and P&#8208;XRD methods. The CPs obtained in the form of microcrystalline powders were tested for their ability to undergo solvent adsorption and exchange by P&#8208;XRD and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The extent of their dynamic behavior was then correlated to their structural features, highlighting the role of interchain interactions established among their constituting linear arrays. Zig&#8208;zag CPs proved to be resilient to external chemical stimuli, while they differently respond to thermal treatments, depending on the solvent originally included within the CP. In the case of polycatenated structures, we observed transformations where the original topology was maintained upon guest exchange, but also cases where it changed to zig&#8208;zag, even under solid/vapor conditions (i.&#8201;e., no complete dissolution of the CP). Given the presence of linear interconnected 1D channels, 3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClBz&#8208;polycatenanePwd is also able to trap volatile guests such as n&#8208;hexane when exposed to its vapors.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Photoisomerization of N,N&#8242;&#8208;Disubstituted Indigos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indigo photoswitches can undergo photoisomerization triggered by red&#8208;light, which is of immense potential in applications such as biomedical research and material science. In this mechanistic investigation, the influence of chemical environment and N&#8208;substituents is elucidated through photophysical and computational approaches. This study further provides insights into the course of photoisomerization.







Abstract
N,N&#8242;&#8208;disubstituted indigos are photoswitchable molecules that have recently caught the attention due to their addressability by red&#8208;light. When alkyl and aryl groups are utilized as the N&#8208;substituents, the thermal half&#8208;lives of Z isomers can be tuned independently while maintaining the advantageous red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra. To utilize these molecules in real&#8208;world applications, it is of immense importance to understand how their molecular structures as well as the environment influence their switching properties. To this end, we probed their photoisomerization mechanism by carrying out photophysical and computational studies in solvents of different polarities. The fluorescence and transient absorption experiments suggest for more polar excited and transition states, which explains the bathochromic shifts of absorption spectra and shorter thermal half&#8208;lives. On the other hand, the quantum chemical calculations reveal that in contrast to N&#8208;carbonyl groups, N&#8208;alkyl and N&#8208;aryl substituents are not strongly conjugated with the indigo chromophore and can thus serve as a tool for tuning the thermal stability of Z isomers. Both approaches are combined to provide in&#8208;depth understandings of how indigos undergo photoswitching as well as how they are influenced by N&#8208;substituent and the chemical surroundings. These mechanistic insights will serve as guiding principles for designing molecules eyeing broader applications.

         <title>Type S Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases for the Rapid Generation of Tailormade Peptide Libraries**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following a previously published proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study on generating bipartite type S non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), the de novo generation of non&#8208;ribosomal peptide libraries with unprecedented simplicity was envisaged. By using synthetic zippers, NRPSs were split in up to three subunits to produce 49 peptides at titres up to 145&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
Bacterial natural products in general, and non&#8208;ribosomally synthesized peptides in particular, are structurally diverse and provide us with a broad range of pharmaceutically relevant bioactivities. Yet, traditional natural product research suffers from rediscovering the same scaffolds and has been stigmatized as inefficient, time&#8208;, labour&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive. Combinatorial chemistry, on the other hand, can produce new molecules in greater numbers, cheaper and in less time than traditional natural product discovery, but also fails to meet current medical needs due to the limited biologically relevant chemical space that can be addressed. Consequently, methods for the high throughput generation of new natural products would offer a new approach to identifying novel bioactive chemical entities for the hit to lead phase of drug discovery programs. As a follow&#8208;up to our previously published proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study on generating bipartite type S non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), we now envisaged the de novo generation of non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) on an unreached scale. Using synthetic zippers, we split NRPSs in up to three subunits and rapidly generated different bi&#8208; and tripartite NRPS libraries to produce 49 peptides, peptide derivatives, and de novo peptides at good titres up to 145&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1. A further advantage of type S NRPSs not only is the possibility to easily expand the created libraries by re&#8208;using previously created type S NRPS, but that functions of individual domains as well as domain&#8208;domain interactions can be studied and assigned rapidly.

Pt&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel was found for the first time that it has both significantly enhanced oxidase&#8208;like (OXD&#8208;like) and peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) activities at neutral pH. The strategy of dissociating H+ from Fmoc&#8208;FF at neutral pH break pH limit and has a universal effect on nanomaterials with oxidase&#8208; or peroxidase&#8208;like over a wide pH range, this work accelerates the application of nanozymes in biological system.







Abstract
Nanomaterials with oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like activities have potential in antibacterial therapy. The optimal activity of most nanozymes occurred in acidic pH&#8197;(3.0&#8211;5.0), while the pH in biological systems is mostly near neutral. Herein, a general system using 9&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;modified diphenylalanine (Fmoc&#8208;FF) hydrogel for enhancing oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like activities of Pt NPs and other typical enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials at neutral or even alkaline pH is proposed. In this system, Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel provides an acidic microenvironment for Pt NPs due to hydrogen protons (H+) produced by the dissociation of F at neutral pH. As a result, Pt NPs exhibits 6&#8208;fold enhanced oxidase&#8208;like and 26&#8208;fold peroxidase&#8208;like activity after being encapsulated into Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel at pH&#8197;7.0. Based on outstanding enzymatic activities and the antibacterial activity of Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel itself, Pt&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel realizes excellent antibacterial effect. This design provides a universal strategy to break pH limitation of nanozymes and promotes the biological applications of nanozymes.

Lightning @ surface: The visible&#8208;light irradiation of unharmful and photolabile arylazo sulfones enabled the efficient covalent decoration (i.&#8201;e. arylation) of reduced&#8208;graphene&#8208;oxide (rGO) surfaces under mild, functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and photosensitizer&#8208;free conditions. Nanomanipulation of the tagged rGO surface via Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling was also documented.







Abstract
We present an environmentally benign methodology for the covalent functionalization (arylation) of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets with arylazo sulfones. A variety of tagged aryl units were conveniently accommodated at the rGO surface via visible&#8208;light irradiation of suspensions of carbon nanostructured materials in aqueous media. Mild reaction conditions, absence of photosensitizers, functional group tolerance and high atomic fractions (XPS analysis) represent some of the salient features characterizing the present methodology. Control experiments for the mechanistic elucidation (Raman analysis) and chemical nanomanipulation of the tagged rGO surfaces are also reported.

         <title>Design of Photoactive Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogeneous Catalyst for Preparation of Thiophosphinates from Phosphine Oxides and Thiols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A new covalent organic framework (COF) has been synthesized from 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (DMTA) under solvothermal conditions, which is named as Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF. The designed Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF exhibits better photocatalytic activity, broad substrate applicability and excellent recyclability for the preparation of thiophosphinates from phosphine oxides and thiols, which opens a new way to develop metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, and economical photocatalysts for organic transformations.







Abstract
Two new covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were synthesized from 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(pyrene&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrayl)tetraaniline and 2,5&#8208;dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF) or 2&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;[1,1&#8242;:4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terphenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Py&#8208;DMTPDA&#8208;COF) under solvothermal conditions. These two COFs were further facilely developed as efficient photocatalytic platforms for the synthesis of thiophosphinates. Py&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF exhibited better photocatalytic activity, broad substrate applicability, and excellent recycling capacity for the preparation of thiophosphinates from P(O)H compounds and thiols compared to Py&#8208;DMTPDA&#8208;COF. This methodology was further extended to the seamless gram&#8208;scale production of target phosphorothioate derivatives. The results demonstrate that COFs can provide a robust platform for developing metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;free, highly efficient, and reusable heterogeneous photocatalysts for organic transformations.

         <title>Diarylcuprates for Selective Syntheses of Multifunctionalized Ketones from Thioesters under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;bottomed synthesis: In situ&#8208;generated diarylcuprates enable the selective synthesis of multifunctionalized ketones from thioesters in excellent yields under mild conditions. This reaction could be applied to preparing synthetic intermediates for canagliflozin and (+)&#8208;biotin. A reaction mechanism for this ketone synthesis was proposed based on control experiments with an isolated diphenylcuprate complex, [Mg2Br3(THF)6][CuPh2], and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Ketones were selectively synthesized from thioesters by using diarylcuprates(I) generated in&#8197;situ from copper(I) salts and aryl Grignard reagents in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1.3&#8211;1.5&#8197;ratio under ambient temperature. During the ketone synthesis, various functional groups, such as carbonyl (ketones, esters, and amides), O&#8208;protecting groups, halogens, and heteroarenes, were tolerated to afford multifunctionalized ketones in excellent yields. This copper&#8208;mediated ketone synthesis could be applied to the synthesis of not only gluconolactone&#8208;derived ketone 6, a synthetic intermediate in the transformation to the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin, but also thiolactol 8, a valuable synthetic intermediate for (+)&#8208;biotin. Control experiments on an isolated diphenylcuprate(I), [CuPh2]&#8722; (12), and DFT calculations revealed that this ketone synthesis proceeded by oxidative addition of the C&#8722;S bond of thioesters to [CuPh2]&#8722;, while reductive elimination from the CuIII intermediate produced the corresponding ketone and an inactive species [(RS)CuPh]&#8722;, the latter reacted with [CuPh]4 (11) to regenerate the reactive diphenylcuprate(I).

         <title>Single Crystals of Mixed&#8208;Cation Copper&#8208;Based Perovskite with Trimodal Bandgap Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easily exfoliated, two dimensional mixed&#8208;cation Cu&#8208;perovskite single crystals reveal three different diffraction patterns with trimodal bandgap behavior. Cation engineering has the potential to increase photovoltaic performance of Cu&#8208;perovskites.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskites with novel functionalities and structural diversity are a perfect platform for emerging optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and solar cells. Here, we demonstrate that excess concentration of Cesium bromide (CsBr) is key to the formation of easily exfoliated 2D Cs2Cu(Cl/Br)4 perovskite crystal. Furthermore, by employing this trick to 2D perovskite MA2Cu(Cl/Br)4 (MA=methylammonium), we achieve a phase&#8208;pure easily exfoliated 2D mixed&#8208;cation (MA/Cs)2Cu(Cl/Br)4 perovskite crystal, which exhibits reduced bandgap (1.53&#8197;eV) with ferromagnetic behavior and photovoltaic property. The resultant mixed&#8208;cation structured device reveals enhanced efficiency compared to all MA and all Cs counterparts. These findings demonstrate the importance of cation&#8208;engineering in developing innovative materials with novel properties.

         <title>Impact of Heterocycle Annulation on NIR Absorbance in Quinoid Thioacene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homologous series of quinoid bisimidazolylidene&#8208;derived thioacenes has been synthesised and investigated for their optoelectronic and magnetic properties. All investigated small&#8208;band&#8208;gap quinoids show stability at room temperature in the presence of oxygen and display strong NIR absorption. Three&#8208; and fourfold annulated quinoids display partially open&#8208;shell singlet diradical character.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterisation of a homologous series of quinoid sulfur&#8208;containing imidazolyl&#8208;substituted heteroacenes is described. The optoelectronic and magnetic properties were investigated by UV/vis, fluorescence and EPR spectroscopy as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, and were compared to those of the corresponding benzo congener. The room&#8208;temperature and atmospherically stable quinoids display strong absorption in the NIR region between 678 and 819&#8197;nm. The dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene and the thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene derivatives were EPR active at room temperature. For the latter, variable&#8208;temperature EPR spectroscopy revealed the presence of a thermally accessible triplet state, with a singlet&#8208;triplet separation of 14.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

The dithieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;:2&#8242;,3&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]thiophene and the thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]thieno[2,3-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]thiophene derivatives were EPR active at room temperature. For the latter, variable-temperature EPR spectroscopy revealed the presence of a thermally accessible triplet state, with a singlet-triplet separation of 14.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Existence and Role of Formaldehyde During Aqueous Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Monoxide to Methanol by Cobalt Phthalocyanine</title>

A fresh look: Molecular electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide with Co phthalocyanine leads to methanol, with formaldehyde being formed as an intermediate as well as a secondary product. Demonstration of this rare reactivity and mechanistic insights open a new perspective for the solar fuel community.







Abstract
A long&#8208;time challenge in aqueous CO2 electrochemical reduction is to catalyze the formation of products beyond carbon monoxide with selectivity. Formaldehyde is the simplest of these products and one of the most relevant due to its broad use in the industry. Paradoxically it is one of the less reported product. Such scarcity may be in part explained by difficult identification and quantification using conventional chromatography or proton nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Likewise, indirect detection methods are usually not compatible with labelled studies for asserting product origin. Recently, the possible production of formaldehyde during electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide to methanol at cobalt phthalocyanine molecular catalyst in basic media has been the object of contradictory reports. By applying an analytical procedure based on proton NMR along with labelled studies, we provide definitive evidence for HCHO formation. We have further identified the possible scenarios for methanol formation through formaldehyde and revealed that the formation of the intermediate and its subsequent reduction are taking place at the same single active site. These studies open a new perspective to improve selectivity toward formaldehyde formation and to develop a subsequent chemistry based on reacting it with nucleophiles.

         <title>Iodine Chemisorption, Interpenetration and Polycatenation: Cationic MOFs and CPs from Group 13 Metal Halides and Dipyridyl Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mopping up radioactive iodine: A cationic MOF with the abundant metal aluminium shows chemisorption of iodine from a gas atmosphere at room temperature that is suitable for the capture of the radioisotopes 129I and 131I. The capture is explicitly stable as triiodide ions are formed with iodide inside the MOF pores. High uptake of up to one equivalent of I2 per aluminium centre marks the material out as highly suitable for applications in capturing radioactive isotopes, for example, from toxic nuclear waste as required after an unwanted hazardous exposure to the environment. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. M&#252;ller&#8208;Buschbaum et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104171).

Single crystals of [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] and [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) were obtained from a solvothermal reaction with SO3, and their electronic properties were investigated by means of density functional theory&#8211;based calculations. [Au3Cl4][B(S2O7)2] exhibits a cluster&#8208;like cation, and the cationic gold&#8211;chloride strands in [Au2Cl4][B(S2O7)2](SO3) are found to resemble one&#8208;dimensional metallic wires; this was further confirmed by polarization microscopy.

Polymers for solar cells: This review summarizes high&#8208;performance polymer acceptors based on the recently developed electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, including bithiophene imide (BTI) derivatives, B&#8592;N&#8208;incorporated (hetero)arenes, cyano&#8208;functionalized (hetero)arenes, and fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors. Additionally, the single&#8208;component&#8208;based polymers are also briefly discussed. Finally, we also offer our insights into the materials design for realizing all&#8208;PSCs with further improved device performance and stability.







Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their pronounced advantages of excellent mechanical flexibility/stretchability and greatly enhanced device stability as compared to other types of organic solar cells (OSCs). Thanks to the extensive research efforts dedicated to the development of polymer acceptors, all&#8208;PSCs have achieved remarkable improvement of photovoltaic performance, recently. This review summarizes the recent progress of polymer acceptors based on the key electron&#8208;deficient building blocks, which include bithiophene imide (BTI) derivatives, boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N)&#8208;incorporated (hetero)arenes, cyano&#8208;functionalized (hetero)arenes, and fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREAs). In addition, single&#8208;component&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs are also briefly discussed. The structure&#8208;property correlations of polymer acceptors are elaborated in detail. Finally, we offer our insights into the development of new electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with further optimized properties and the polymers built from them for efficient all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven Swinging of a Nitrobenzyl Pendant Arm in a Nickel Scorpionand Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically driven intra&#8208;molecular motion on cathodic reduction of the NiII macrocyclic complex a, the electron first goes on the nitro group (b), then, following the swinging motion of the nitrobenzyl side chain, it is transferred onto the metal centre, giving rise to an authentic NiI (d9) scorpionate complex (c).







Abstract
A radical anion &#8722;NO2.&#8722; is formed upon an electrochemically reversible one&#8208;electron reduction of the square&#8208;planar NiII complex of N&#8208;nitrobenzylcyclam. The &#8722;NO2.&#8722; group goes to occupy an axial position of the metal ion, thus establishing a significant electronic interaction with the metal center. In particular, the ESR spectrum supports the occurrence of an electron transfer from &#8722;NO2.&#8722; to the metal, which therefore presents a significant NiI character. On re&#8208;oxidation, the nitrobenzyl side chain detaches and the NiII complex is restored, providing an example of a fully reversible redox driven intramolecular motion.

&lt;p&gt;A radical anion &#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is formed upon an electrochemically reversible one-electron reduction of the square-planar Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzylcyclam. The &#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; group goes to occupy an axial position of the metal ion, thus establishing a significant electronic interaction with the metal center. In particular, the ESR spectrum supports the occurrence of an electron transfer from &#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to the metal, which therefore presents a significant Ni&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; character. On re-oxidation, the nitrobenzyl side chain detaches and the Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex is restored, providing an example of a fully reversible redox driven intramolecular motion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions of M  I  Ag  II  F  3  perovskites (M = K, Rb, Cs) have been predicted theoretically for the first time for pressures up to 100 GPa. The sequence of phase transitions for M = K and Rb consists of an orthorhombic to monoclinic and back to orthorhombic transition, associated with progressive bending of infinite chains of corner&#8208;sharing [AgF  6  ]  4&#8211;  octahedra and their mutual approaching via secondary Ag&#183;&#183;&#183;F contacts. In stark contrast, only a single phase transition (tetragonal &#8594; triclinic) is predicted for CsAgF  3  , associated with substantial deformation of the Jahn Teller&#8208;distorted first coordination sphere of Ag(II) and association of the infinite [AgF  6  ]  4&#8211;  chains into a polymeric sublattice. The phase transitions markedly decrease the coupling strength of intra&#8208;chain antiferromagnetic superexchange in MAgF  3  hosts lattices.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;triggered removal of nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water by metal&#8208;organic polyhedra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water pollution threatens human and environmental health worldwide. Thus, there is a pressing need for new approaches to water purification. Herein we report a novel supramolecular strategy based on the use of a metal organic polyhedron (MOP) as a capture agent to remove nitrogenous organic micropollutants from water, even at very low concentrations (ppm), based exclusively on coordination chemistry at the external surface of the MOP. Specifically, we exploit the exohedral coordination positions of Rh(II)&#8208;MOP to coordinatively sequester pollutants bearing N&#8208;donor atoms in aqueous solution, and then harness their exposed surface carboxyl groups to control their aqueous solubility via acid/base reactions. We validated this approach for removal of benzotriazole, benzothiazole, isoquinoline, and 1&#8208;napthylamine from water.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208;Carboboration of Arylallenes by In Situ Generated Alkenylboranes for the Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a novel method for the coupling of unactivated alkynes and arylallenes, which relies on an unprecedented and regioselective 1,2&#8208;carboboration of the allene by an alkenylborane. The alkenylborane is conveniently prepared  in situ  by hydroboration of an alkyne with Piers' borane,  i. e.  HB(C  6  F  5  )  2  . The boryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes that are formed by this carboboration are well&#8208;suited for a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling with aryl iodides. This allowed us to develop a three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes. The generality of the reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of twenty dienes with modular variations of all three reaction partners. The mechanism of the new 1,2&#8208;carboboration was investigated using dispersion corrected double&#8208;hybrid DFT computations that allowed us to rationalize the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of this key step.</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Cis/Trans&#8208;configuration and Ligand Substitution of the Cyanidometal Bridge on Metal to Metal Charge Transfer Properties in Mixed Valence Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>To investigate the effects of cis/trans&#8208;configuration of the cyanidometal bridge and the electron donating ability of the auxiliary ligand on the cyanidometal bridge on metal to metal charge transfer (MMCT) in cyanidometal&#8208;bridged mixed valence compounds, two groups of trinuclear cyanidometal&#8208;bridged compounds cis/trans&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe(&#956;&#8208;NC)Ru(4,4'&#8208;dmbpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]n  (n = 2 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]2), 3 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]3  ), 4 (cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]4)) and cis/trans&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe(&#956;&#8208;NC)Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]3  (cis/trans&#8208;2[PF6]3)&#160;were synthesized and fully characterized. The experimental results indicate that for these one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron oxidation mixed valence compounds, the trans&#8208;configuration compounds are more beneficial for MMCT than the cis&#8208;configuration compounds, and increasing the electron donating ability of the auxiliary ligand on the cyanidometal bridge is also conductive to MMCT. Moreover, compounds  cis/trans&#8208;1[PF6]n  (n = 3, 4) and  cis/trans&#8208;2[PF6]3  belong to localized compounds by analyzing the experimental characterization results, supported by the TDDFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;free thermal synthesis of extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminophosphate zeotype via self&#8208;assembly of double&#8208;four&#8208;ring unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of Ge as framework atom to direct the formation of double&#8208;four&#8208;ring (d4r) unit is an effective way to prepare zeolite with extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore, which however also brings about serious problems with regard to production cost and structure stability for their practical application. A new solvent&#8208;free thermal synthesis strategy is presented here for facile preparation and molecular&#8208;level mechanism study of extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminophosphate zeotype DNL&#8208;1 with &#8208;CLO structure. For the first time, the formation of intermediate d4r in the induction period was successfully confirmed, and was correlated with the synthesis condition of low water content and quaternary ammonium template with suitable alkyl chain length. The self&#8208;assembly pathway via d4r to form lta, afterwards clo and super cages was further revealed. This work shed light on the rational synthesis of Ge&#8208;free extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeotypes based on d4r route.</dc:description>

         <title>On the mediated electron transfer of immobilized galactose oxidase for biotechnological applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of enzymes as catalysts in chemical synthesis offers advantages in terms of clean and highly selective transfor&#173;mations. Galactose oxidase (GalOx) is a remarkable enzyme with several applications in industrial conversions as it catalyzes the oxidation of primary alcohols. We investigate the wiring of GalOx with a redox polymer, enabling mediated electron transfer with the electrode surface. As a result of the electrochemical regeneration with minimal influence from O2, the formation of harmful H2O2 is prevented during enzymatic catalysis. The possibility for catalytic conversion with the introduced bioelectrode is shown with a parti&#173;cular emphasis on glycerol as model substrate. We also show that the enzyme can perform the over&#8208;oxidation of the substrate, lea&#173;ding not only to the corresponding aldehyde but also to the carboxylic acid by further conversion of the former.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Frustrated Aromatic Enes with Various Colors Originating from Multiple Folded and Twisted Conformations in Crystal Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcrowded ethylenes composed of 10&#8208;methyleneanthrone and two bulky aromatic rings contain a twisted carbon&#8208;carbon double (C=C) bond as well as a folded anthrone unit. As such, they are unique frustrated aromatic enes (FAEs). Various colored crystals of these FAEs, obtained using different solvents, correspond to multiple metastable conformations of the FAEs with various twist and fold angles of the C=C bond, as well as various dihedral angles of attached aryl units with respect to the C=C bond. The relationships between color and these parameters associated with conformational features around the C=C bond were elucidated using experimental and theoretical studies. Owing to the fact that they are separated by small energy barriers, the variously colored conformations in the FAE crystal change in response to various external stimuli, such as mechanical grinding, hydrostatic pressure and thermal heating.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic control of microbial movement by photoswitchable ATP antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy source for various biochemical processes and biomolecular motors in living things. Development of ATP antagonists and their stimuli&#8208;controlled actions offer a novel approach to regulate biological processes. Herein, we developed azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable ATP antagonists for controlling the activity of motor proteins; cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins. The new ATP antagonsits showed reversible photoswitching of cytoplasmic dynein activity in an  in vitro  dynein&#8208;microtubule system due to the  trans  and  cis  photoisomerization of their azobenzene segment. Importantly, our ATP antagonists reversibly regulated the axonemal dynein motor activity for the force generation in a demembranated model of  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  . We found that the  trans  and  cis  isomers of ATP antagonists significantly differ in their affinity to the ATP binding site.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Atomic Fe and N Co&#8208;doped Hollow Carbon Nanospheres with A Polymer Encapsulation Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with Accelerated Polysulfide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As competitive next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) could suffer from the shuttle effect and the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides during charge and discharge processes, adversely affecting their electrochemical performances and actual applications. Herein, we demonstrate a polymer encapsulation strategy to synthesize atomic Fe and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe&#8208;NHC) with Fe&#8208;N  x  sites for modifying commercial PP separator of LSBs to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the sluggish kinetics of intermediate polysulfides. Benefiting from the excellent structural design, the doped&#8208;N with positive charges could effectively adsorb negatively charged soluble polysulfides, help attract the soluble polysulfides to the Fe atoms and boost the catalytic transformation of the soluble polysulfides. Additionally, such a thin carbon shell could provide a short mass diffusion pathway and hence promote the adsorption and the catalytic conversion. Therefore, the battery with the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator delivers outstanding cycling and rate performances. At the large current density of 1C, the specific capacity is 1079 mA h g  &#8208;1  and maintains a low loss of 0.076% per cycle within 500 cycles. Even at a harsh current density of 4C, a high capacity of 824 mA h g  &#8208;1  is still achieved, indicating the superiority of the Fe&#8208;NHC/PP separator in LSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Generalizing the aromatic &#948;&#8208;amino acid foldamer helix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of aromatic oligoamide foldamer sequences containing different proportions of three &#948;&#8208;amino acids derived from quinoline, pyridine, and benzene and possessing varying flexibility,  e.g.  due to methylene bridges, were synthesized. Crystallographic structures of two key sequences and  1  H NMR data in water concur to show that a canonical aromatic helix fold prevails in almost all cases and that helix stability critically depends on the ratio between rigid and flexible units. Notwithstanding subtle variations of curvature,  i.e.  the numbers of units per turn, the aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptide helix is therefore shown to be general and tolerant of a great number of sp  3  centers. We also demonstrate canonical helical folding upon alternating two monomers that do not promote folding when taken separately: folding occurs with two methylenes between every other unit, not with one methylene between every unit. These findings highlight that a fine&#8208;tuning of helix handedness inversion kinetics, curvature, and side chain positioning in aromatic &#948;&#8208;peptidic foldamers can be realized by systematically combining different yet compatible &#948;&#8208;amino acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and preparation of electrocatalysts by electrodeposition for CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing emission of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ), the conversion and utilization of CO  2  have become a topic of increasing concern. Electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) is an attractive and sustainable approach for solving energy and environmental problems. Design of efficient catalysts is crucial for achieving highly efficient CO  2  RR. Different methods to prepare catalysts have been reported and used. Among them, electrodeposition is one of the common approaches, which has some obvious advantages, such as requiring simple equipment, environmentally benign. Especially, it can direct deposit catalysts on different substrates to prepare electrodes for CO  2  RR. In this review, we discuss recent advances in design and preparation of the catalysts by electrodeposition and their application in CO  2  RR. Furthermore, the perspective of this promising area is also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;induced dual phosphorescence from (o&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)borane at room temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing highly efficient purely organic phosphors at room temperature remains a challenge because of fast non&#8208;radiative processes and slow intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. The majority of them emit only single component phosphorescence. Herein, we have prepared 3 isomers (  o  ,  m  ,  p  &#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)boranes. Among the 3 isomers (  o  &#8208;,  m  &#8208; and  p  &#8208;  BrTAB  ) synthesized, the  ortho  &#8208;one is the only one which shows dual phosphorescence, with a short lifetime of 0.8 ms and a long lifetime of 234 ms in the crystalline state at room temperature. Based on theoretical calculations and crystal structure analysis of  o  &#8208;  BrTAB  ,  the short lifetime component is ascribed to the T  1  M  state of the monomer which emits the higher energy phosphorescence. The long&#8208;lived, lower energy phosphorescence emission is attributed to the T  1  A  state of an aggregate, with multiple intermolecular interactions existing in crystalline  o  &#8208;  BrTAB  inhibiting nonradiative decay and stabilizing the triplet states efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of an Asymmetric Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present that an asymmetric reaction can be implemented and refined in a helical cavity of aromatic oligoamide sequences. These sequences bearing a chiral inducer can fold into helical structures with absolute control of the helical sense, whereby a ketone substrate covalently linked in the cavity can be asymmetrically reduced to diastereomers. The diastereoselectivity of the reduction reaction is highly dependent on the shielding efficiency of the helical cavity. Iterative modifications of the sequence, such as addition and replacement of monomers, can fine&#8208;tune the cavity for realizing the asymmetric reaction, thereby progressive increasing the diastereomeric excess up to 90%.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Triarylmethyl Radicals and Cobalt(II) Ions Based 1D/2D Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of organic radicals into coordination polymers was considered as a promising strategy to promote metal&#8208;ligand exchange interaction, but there are only very limited number of stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands that can serve well such purpose. Herein, we report two new tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical&#8208;based ligands  L1  and  L2  with two and three imidazole substituents, respectively. The imidazole unit serves as a coordination site and it can also stabilize the TTM radical by intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interaction. Coordination of  L1  and  L2  with cobalt(II) ions gave the corresponding one&#8208;dimensional (  CoCP&#8208;1  ) and two&#8208;dimensional (  CoCP&#8208;2  ) coordination polymers, the structures of which were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Magnetic measurements and theoretical calculations suggest antiferromagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic  cobalt(II) ions  and the radical ligands. Our study provides a rational design for stable organic radical&#8208;based ligands and further demonstrated the feasibility of metal&#8208;radical approach toward magnetic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Designer Gold&#8208;Framed Palladium Nanocubes for Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Ethanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface plasmon of coinage metal nanostructures has been employed as a powerful route in boosting the performances in heterogenous catalysis. Development of efficient plasmonic nanocatalysts with high catalytic performance and efficient light harvesting properties is of vital importance. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a plasmonic nanocatalyst composed of Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes by an Ag(I)&#8208;assisted seed&#8208;mediated growth method. In the synthesis, the incorporation of Ag(I) suppresses the reduction of Au on the {100} surface of cubic Pd seeds and leads to the formation of Au nanoframes on the Pd nanocubes. The unique Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes can integrate the superior electrocatalytic of Pd and the outstanding plasmonic properties of Au. Thus, these nanostructures were employed as plasmonic nanocatalysts for plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol with improved stability.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold complexes: the putative intermediate in Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkenes does not protodemetalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination proceeds well for alkynes but not alkenes. We report gas&#8208;phase binding energies of alkenes and alkynes to a cationic Au center which indicate that differences in binding are not the origin of the disparate chemical behavior. We further report the synthesis and characterization of 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes which would be the intermediates in a hypothetical Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of styrene. The reactivity of the well&#8208;characterized and isolable complexes reveals that protonation or alkylation of the 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes results in amine elimination in solution, and in the gas phase, indicating that the failure of Au&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydroamination derives from a non&#8208;competitive protodeauration step. We analyze possible transition states for the protodeauration, and identify an insufficiently strong Au&#8208;proton interaction as the reason that the transition states lie too high in energy to compete.</dc:description>

         <title>How the Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates the Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor Capability of Carboxamides, Thioamides, and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amino groups of thio&#8208; and selenoamides can act as stronger hydrogen&#8208;bond donors than of carboxamides, despite the lower electronegativity of S and Se. This phenomenon has been experimentally explored, particularly in organocatalysis, but a sound electronic explanation is lacking. Our quantum chemical investigations show that the NH 2 groups in thio&#8208; and selenoamides are more positively charged than in carboxamides. This originates from the larger electronic density flow from the nitrogen lone pair of the NH 2 group towards the lower&#8208;lying &#960;* C=S and &#960;* C=Se orbitals, than to the high&#8208;lying &#960;* C=O . The relative energies of the &#960;* orbitals result from the overlap between the chalcogen n p and carbon 2p atomic orbitals, which is set by the carbon&#8211;chalcogen equilibrium distance, a consequence of the Pauli repulsion between the two bonded atoms. Thus, not the electronegativity nor the often&#8208;suggested polarizability but the steric size of the chalcogen atom determines the amide&#8217;s hydrogen&#8208;bond donor capability.</dc:description>

         <title>Anomeric stereoauxiliary cleavage of the C&#8208;N bond of D&#8208;glucosamine for the preparation of imidazo[1,5&#8208;&#945;]pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The targeted cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds of alkyl primary amines in sustainable compounds of biomass  via  a metal&#8208;free pathway and the conjunction of nitrogen in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines are still highly challenging. Despite tremendous progress in the synthesis of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines over the past decade, many of them can still not be efficiently prepared. Herein, we report an anomeric stereoauxiliary approach for the synthesis of a wide range of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines after cleaving the C&#8722;N bond of D&#8208;glucosamine (&#945;&#8208;2&#176; amine) from biobased resources. This new approach expands the scope of readily accessible imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines relative to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. A key strategic advantage of this approach is that the &#945;&#8208;anomer of D&#8208;glucosamine enables C&#8722;N bond cleavage through a seven&#8208;membered ring transition state. Using this novel method, a series of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives (more than 80 examples) were synthesized from pyridine ketones (including para&#8208;dipyridine ketone) and aldehydes (including para&#8208;dialdehyde). Moreover, imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines derivatives containing diverse important deuterated C(sp  2  )&#8722;H and C(sp  3  )&#8722;H bonds were also efficiently achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Groups Assisted Tunable Dielectric Permittivity of Guest&#8208;Free Zn&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers for Gate Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dielectric properties of coordination polymers has been a topic of recent interest, but the role of different functional groups on the dielectric properties of these polymers has not yet been fully addressed. Herein, the effects of electron&#8208;donating (R = NH  2  ) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (R = NO  2  ) groups on the dielectric behavior of such materials were investigated for two thermally stable and guest&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Zn(L  1  )(L  2  )]  n  (  1  ) and [Zn(L  1  )(L  3  )]  n  (  2  ) [L  1  = 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole, L  2  = Pbim 5&#8208;aminoisophthalate (Aip), and L  3  = 5&#8208;nitroisophthalate (Nip)]. The results of dielectric studies of  1  revealed that it possesses a high dielectric constant (&#954; = 65.5 at 1 kHz), while compound  2  displayed an even higher dielectric constant (&#954; = 110.3 at 1 kHz). The electron donating and withdrawing effects of the NH  2  and NO  2  substituents induce changes in the polarity of the polymers, which is due to the inductive effect from the aryl ring for both NO  2  and NH  2  but the effect is more pronounced. Theoretical results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which also support the experimental findings, show that both compounds have a distinct electronic behavior with diverse wide bandgaps. The significance of the current work is to provide information about the structure&#8208;dielectric property relationships. So, this study promises to pave the way for further research on the effects of different functional groups on coordination polymers on their dielectric properties.</dc:description>

         <title>The Influence of UiO&#8208;66 Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Structural Defects on Adsorption and Separation of Hexane Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, adsorption properties of theUiO&#8208;66 metal&#8208;organic framework were investigated, with particular emphasis on the influence of structural defects. A series of UiO&#8208;66 samples were synthesized and characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques. Type I adsorption isotherms for low&#8208;temperature adsorption of N2 and Ar showed that micropore volume and specific surface area significantly increase with the number of defects. Adsorption of hexane isomers in UiO&#8208;66 was studied by means of quasi&#8208;equilibrated temperature&#8208;programmed desorption and adsorption (QE&#8208;TPDA) experimental and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. QE&#8208;TPDA profiles revealed that only defect&#8208;free UiO&#8208;66 exhibits distinct two adsorption states. This technique also yielded high&#8208;quality adsorption isobars that were successfully recreated using Grand&#8208;Canonical Monte Carlo molecular simulations, which, however, required refinement of the existing force fields. The calculations demonstrated the detailed mechanism of adsorption and separation of hexane isomers in the UiO&#8208;66 structure. The preferred tetrahedral cages provide suitable voids for bulky molecules, which is the reason for unusual "reverse" selectivity of UiO&#8208;66 towards di&#8208;branched alkanes. Interconnection of the tetrahedral cavities due to missing organic linkers greatly reduces the selectivity of the defected material.</dc:description>

         <title>Acenaphthenoannulation Induced by Dual Lewis Acidity of Alumina</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have discovered dual (i.e., soft and hard) Lewis acidity of alumina that enables rapid one&#8208;pot &#960;&#8208;extension through activation of terminal alkynes followed by C&#8208;F activation. The tandem reaction introduces acenaphthene fragment &#8211; an essential moiety of geodesic polyarenes. This reaction provides quick access to elusive non&#8208;alternant polyarenes such as &#960;&#8208;extended buckybowls and helicenes via three&#8208;point annulation of naphthalene&#8217;s moiety. The versatility of the developed method is demonstrated by the synthesis of unprecedented structural fragments of elusive geodesic graphene nanoribbons.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has emerged as one of the interesting sub&#8208;cellular organelles due to its role in myriads of biological phenomena. Subsequently, visualization of the structure&#8208;function and dynamics of ER remained a major challenge to understand its involvement in different diseased states including cancer. To illuminate the ER, herein we have designed and synthesized &#947;&#8208;resorcyclic acid&#8208;based small molecules which showed remarkable aggregation induced emission (AIE) property in water. This AIE property was originated from the dual intramolecular H&#8208;bonding leading to the self&#8208;assembled 2D aggregation confirmed by the pH and temperature dependent fluorescence quenching studies as well as scanning electron microscopy. These small molecules illuminated the sub&#8208;cellular ER in HeLa cervical cancer cells as well as non&#8208;cancerous RPE&#8208;1 human retinal epithelial cells within 1h. These novel small molecules have the potential to light up ER chemical biology in diseased states.</dc:description>

         <title>Acyl group migration in pyranosides as studied by experimental and computational methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyl group migration affects the synthesis, isolation, manipulation and purification of all acylated organic compounds containing free hydroxyl groups, in particular carbohydrates. While several isolated studies on the migration phenomenon in different buffers have been reported, comprehensive insights into the overall migration process in different monosaccharides under similar conditions have been lacking. Here, we have studied the acyl migration in different monosaccharides using five different acyl groups by a combination of experimental, kinetic and theoretical tools. The results show that the anomeric configuration in the monosaccharide has a major influence on the migration rate, together with the relative configurations of the other hydroxyl groups and the nature of the migrating acyl group. Full mechanistic model, based on computations, demonstrates that the acyl migration proceeds through an anionic stepwise mechanism with linear dependence on the [OH&#8208;] and the pKa of the hydroxyl group toward which the acyl group is migrating.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) macrocyclic dyads con&#173;sisting of an electron&#8208;poor perylene bisimide (PBI) &#960;&#8208;scaffold bridged with electron&#8208;rich &#945;&#8208;oligothiophenes bearing four, five, six and seven thiophene units between the two phenyl&#8208;imide substituents has been synthesized and characterized by steady&#8208;state UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry as well as transient absorption spectroscopy. Tying the oligothio&#173;phene strands in a conformationally fixed macrocyclic arrangement leads to a more rigid &#960;&#8208;scaffold with vibronic fine structure in the respective absorption spectra. Electrochemical analysis disclosed charged state properties in solution which are strongly dependent on the degree of rigidification within the individual macrocycle.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Reductive Coupling of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with 4&#8208;Cyanopyridines Enabled by Pyridine&#8208;Boryl Radicals: Access to Pyridylated Diarylmethanes with Anti&#8208;Cancer Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is a streamlined protocol to produce pyridylated diarylmethanes through pyridine&#8208;boryl radical induced reductive coupling between para  &#8208;quinone methides ( p  &#8208;QMs) and 4&#8208;cyanopyridines using bis(pinacolato)diboron (B 2  pin 2  ) as a templated reagent. The metal&#8208;free process is characterized by an operationally simple approach, excellent chemoselectivity (1,2&#8208; vs 1,6&#8208;selectivity), and a broad substrate scope with good functional group compatibility. The mechanistic studies provided important insights into the reductive cross&#8208;coupling process between diarylmethyl radical and pyridine&#8208;boryl radical. Moreover, part of the obtained pyridylated diarylmethane products were screened against a panel of cancer cell lines, and 3v  was confirmed to significantly inhibit the proliferation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. This method offers a platform for the preparation of new lead compounds with antitumor activity.</dc:description>

This method offers a platform for the preparation of new lead compounds with antitumor activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Four novel intensively blue luminescent chromophores were readily synthesized by bromine&#8208;lithium exchange borylationSuzuki (BLEBS) sequence in moderate to good yields. Their electronic properties were studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations revealing deep&#8208;blue emission in solution as well as in the solid state and upon embedding into a PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) matrix with small FWHM (full width at half maximum) values and CIE y values smaller than 0.1. Moreover, high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), partially close to unity, are found.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Bridged Triphenylamines Comprising Five&#8208; and Seven&#8208;Membered Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of fully bridged triphenylamines with embedded 5&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered rings is presented. The compounds are potent electron donors capable to undergo donor/acceptor interactions with strong cyano&#8208;based acceptors both in the solid state and solution. These interactions were evaluated by IR and UV/vis spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray crystallography. The vinylene&#8208;bridged compound was oxidized to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;diketone which readily underwent acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation with selected 1,2&#8208;phenylenediamines. The resulting &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline derivatives represent valuable building blocks for the development of functional chromophores upon appropriate functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Pyrrole&#8208;based Phosphaphenalene Gold Complexes: A Versatile Anticancer Tool with a Wide Applicability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Brain cancer, one of the most lethal diseases, urgently requires the discovery of novel theranostic agents. In this context, molecules based on six&#8208;membered phosphorus heterocycles &#8211; phosphaphenalenes &#8211; are especially attractive; they possess unique characteristics that allow for precise chemical engineering. Herein, we demonstrate that subtle structural modifications of phospha&#8208;phenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes lead to altered electronic distribution, may provide them with marked photophysical properties and enhance their efficacy against cancer. Particularly, phosphaphenalene&#8208;based gold(I) complexes containing a pyrrole ring show anti&#8208;proliferative properties in 14 cell lines including gliomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancer, reaching IC  50  values as low as 0.73 &#956;M. The bioactivity of this new family of drugs in combination with the photophysical properties thus offer new research possibilities for both the fundamental investigation and treatment of brain cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Irreversible inhibition of IspG, a target for the development of new antimicrobials, by a 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of its MEcPP substrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>IspG (also called GcpE) is an oxygen&#8208;sensitive [4Fe&#8208;4S] enzyme catalyzing the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a validated target for drug development. It converts 2&#8208;C&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;erythritol&#8208;2,4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;diphosphate (MEcPP) into (E)&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;but&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;1&#8208;diphosphate (HMBPP). The reaction, assimilated to a reductive dehydration, involves redox partners responsible for the formal transfer of two electrons to substrate MEcPP. The 2&#8208;vinyl analogue of MEcPP was designed to generate conjugated species during enzyme catalysis, with the aim of providing new reactive centers to be covalently trapped by neighbouring amino acid residues. The synthesized substrate analogue displayed irreversible inhibition towards IspG. Furthermore, we showed that electron transfer occurs prior to inhibition, which might designate conjugated intermediates as probable affinity tags through covalent interaction at the catalytic site. This is the first report of an irreversible inhibitor of the IspG metalloenzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles and activation volumes of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene dimerizations computed by the extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum chemical calculations are reported for the thermal dimerizations of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene at 1 atm and high pressures up the GPa range. Computed activation enthalpies of plausible dimerization pathways at 1 atm agree well with the experiment activation energies and the values from previous calculations. High&#8208;pressure reaction profiles, computed by the recently&#8208;developed extreme pressure&#8208;polarizable continuum model (XP&#8208;PCM), show that the reduction of reaction barrier is more profound in concerted reactions than in stepwise reactions, which is rationalized on the basis of the volume profiles of different mechanisms. A clear shift of the transition state towards the reactant under pressure is revealed for the [6+4]&#8208;ene reaction by the calculations. The computed activation volumes by XP&#8208;PCM agree excellently with the experimental values, confirming the existence of competing mechanisms in the thermal dimerization of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene.</dc:description>
