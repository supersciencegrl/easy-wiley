         <title>Oxidative Thiolated Aromatization of Terpenes for Divergent Construction of Organosulfur Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic transformation of terpenoids represents a long&#8208;standing research topic in organic synthesis. Due to the presence of multiple oxidation states and isomers in naturally abundant terpenoids, their separation and efficient utilization pose challenges. Convergent transformations of various terpenes can circumvent these issues. We herein developed a convergent and divergent strategy for control of oxidation states, enabling the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing terpenoid derivatives using various terpenes. This protocol features broad substrate scope, good functional compatibility, and high redox&#8208;selectivity. Convergent synthesis strategy was implemented smoothly by using drug and plant extracts. The synthesis of sulfoxide and sulfone products was further achieved by modulating the oxidation conditions, respectively. Additionally, the products can undergo an array of elaborate transformations, which highlight the potential applications of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;talented Bismuthinidenes: Double C(sp3)&#8208;I Bond Activation Using Single or Two Bi Centers.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of [2,6&#8208;(DippN=CH)2C6H3]Bi (1Dipp, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPrC6H3) with CH2I2 proceeded via double C&#8208;I bond activation yielding [2,6&#8208;(DippN=CH)2C6H3]Bi(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,N)&#8208;CH2)I2 (3). By contrast, the reaction of 1Dipp with 1,2&#8208;diiodoethane provided [2,6&#8208;(DippN=CH)2C6H3]BiI2 (1DippI2) and ethene. The tert&#8208;butyl analogue [2,6&#8208;(tBuN=CH)2C6H3]Bi (1tBu) reacted with CH2ClX to give [2,6&#8208;(tBuN=CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2Cl)X (X = I (4) or Cl (5)). Further, its reactivity with CH2I2 was sensitive towards the stoichiometry since using a 1:1 ratio gave a mixture of dinuclear complex {[2,6&#8208;(tBuN=CH)2C6H3]Bi(I)}2(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,Bi)&#8208;CH2) (6) and [2,6&#8208;(tBuN=CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2I)I (7). The reaction could be shifted in favor of 7 using an excess of CH2I2, but with 0.45 eq. of CH2I2 compound 6, as a product of double C&#8208;I bond activation mediated by two Bi atoms was isolated as the main product.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyl&#8208;&#960; Liquids as Condensed&#8208;State Singlet Oxygen Photosensitisers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functional materials capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2), a highly reactive but short&#8208;lived species used to destroy organic materials, including chemical pollutants and biological entities, typically incorporate a chromophore that acts as a photosensitiser into a tertiary scaffold. Current functional materials that produce 1O2 include metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), polymeric nanoparticles, modified glasses, and supramolecular assemblies. Whilst multi&#8208;component functional materials have been widely reported, producing functional materials using a single small molecule in a condensed state has hardly been reported. Herein, we report the first use of functional molecular liquids (alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids), non&#8208;volatile singlecomponent condensed&#8208;state fluidic materials, as photosensitisers for the generation of 1O2 at an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquidwater interface. We investigate the incorporation of various chromophores into alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids that are suitable for 1O2 production and analyse the molecular structure required to produce efficient alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid photosensitisers. The alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquids were studied, impregnated into porous membranes, and as thin films on quartz and Si wafers, the limitations of 1O2 production were investigated. A system was successfully fabricated that can generate 1O2 within an alkyl&#8208;&#960; liquid impregnated membrane and migrate across a membrane&#8208;water interface to destroy small organic molecules, demonstrating the potential of these systems for water decontamination.</dc:description>

         <title>Bionanocomposite of Dual Antioxidant and Protease Function by Co&#8208;Immobilization of Tannic Acid and Papain on Anionic Clays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of highly stable bionanocomposite dispersions of antioxidant and protease activities was achieved by co&#8208;immobilization of TA and papain on LDH nanoparticles.








Abstract
The synchronized operation of antioxidants and enzymes is necessary for the proper functioning of living organisms and various industrial processes. The drawback that these biomolecules are susceptible to several environmental factors can be overcome by their immobilization on appropriate host materials. Here, molecular antioxidant tannic acid (TA) and papain enzyme (PPN) were co&#8208;immobilized on layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles to enhance their stability and facilitate their combined function. In the sequential adsorption method governed by electrostatic interactions, TA was first adsorbed on oppositely charged LDH (LDH/TA) and then, PPN was immobilized on the surface of the nanoparticles (LDH/TA/PPN). The optimal TA and PPN doses were determined by systematic size and charge measurements of the particles in dispersions to obtain stable colloids in each preparation step. The co&#8208;immobilization of the biomolecules was confirmed by spectroscopy methods. The resulting LDH/TA/PPN nanocomposite exhibited remarkable antioxidant and protease activities. The dual biological function together with the considerable colloidal stability make the LDH/TA/PPN material a promising candidate in various processes in academia and more applied disciplines, where simultaneous antioxidant and proteolytic functions are desired.

         <title>Ir/Ni Metallaphotoredox Catalysis for the C(sp3)&#8211;H Bond &#945;&#8208;Arylation and Alkylation of N&#8208;Alkyl N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report a regioselective C(sp3)&#8211;H bond &#945;&#8208;arylation and alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl heterocycles (carbazoles, indoles and indazoles) using a Ir/Ni metallaphotoredox catalysis. This approach enables the direct functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds at the &#945;&#8208;position of nitrogen heterocycles, offering an efficient alternative to traditional Sn2 methods and providing complementary regioselectivity to transition metal catalysis, which often results in C(sp2)&#8211;H bond arylation. The reaction employs [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)][PF6] as the photocatalyst and NiCl2(dtbbpy) as the nickel source, facilitating single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) to promote radical generation and organometallic elementary cross&#8208;coupling steps. The methodology allows the use of diverse aryl chlorides and alkenes, demonstrating broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, including radical trapping and and Stern&#8208;Volmer experiments, support a photocatalytic radical pathway. This new metallaphotoredox protocol presents a robust and atom&#8208;economical route to synthesizing valuable N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;aryl heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present a new synthesis of ritlecitinib, employing asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary group, combined with intramolecular amide formation. This method employs a Ti(OEt)4/NaBH4 reductive system to achieve a one&#8208;pot condensation&#8208;reduction of the ketone&#8208;amino acid derivative with (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine, resulting in an 85% yield of the di&#8208;amino acid derivative with a diastereomeric ratio of 86:14. The incorporation of a chiral auxiliary substantially enhances the diastereopurity. Subsequently, acetic acid&#8208;mediated cyclization then forms the &#948;&#8208;lactam in 60% yield. This lactam is converted to ritlecitinib via a five&#8208;step sequence in 62% overall yield. This approach effectively circumvents the use of precious metal catalysts or hazardous reagents for constructing the chiral piperidine moiety, which were essential components in prior synthetic route.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyimides with Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Properties by End&#8208;capping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyimides HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI demonstrate simultaneous excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) when end&#8208;capped with ESIPT fluorophores. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that their keto forms facilitate more efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) channels, exhibiting significantly larger spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) constants compared to the enol form, thereby enhancing their RTP performance.








Abstract
Organic polymers possessing excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) significantly impact their electronic and optical properties through stimulus response, leading to unique photoluminescence behaviors such as large Stokes shifts, dual emission, and environmental sensitivity. In this work, polyimides (PIs) exhibiting both ESIPT and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties were designed and synthesized by end&#8208;capping with 5&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBTA) and 5&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzimidazole (HBIA), respectively. HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI exhibit bright yellow&#8208;green and sky&#8208;blue fluorescence at 510&#160;nm and 470&#160;nm, with a relatively high photoluminescence quantum yields of about 27.2% and 25.1%, respectively. Importantly, HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI show excellent RTP emissions at 520&#160;nm and 485&#160;nm, with decay lifetimes of 76.5&#160;ms and 53.2&#160;ms. The theoretical results indicate that the effective and large spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) constants from their keto forms in the excited state can enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC) process to produce triplet excitons. The rigid polyimide networks further inhibit the nonradiative decay of triplet excitons and enhance phosphorescence emission. Additionally, the excellent ESIPT properties of HBTA&#8208;PI and HBIA&#8208;PI enable the detection of HCl vapor, which induces multiple fluorescent and phosphorescent color changes. This work provides good examples of polyimides for organic polymers with ESIPT properties and multi&#8208;stimulus response emissions.

         <title>Structure and Photoluminescence Properties of EuSiN2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With EuSiN2 a novel Eu&#8208;nitridosilicate is presented including a very comprehensive structure description and a comparison with its related compounds MSiN2. A different way of displaying the structure as M&#8208;N polyhedra layers is introduced. The dark red luminescent EuSiN2 exhibits two clearly shaped luminescent peaks which present a novel feature for nitridosilicates.








Abstract
With the europium nitridosilicate, EuSiN2 a novel member of the multifaceted MSiN2 family is presented and compared with the structural similar compounds MSiN2 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba). A different way of presenting the structure as M&#8208;N polyhedra layers is introduced. The crystal structure of EuSiN2, being isotypical to SrSiN2, was determined and refined based on powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data in space group P21/c (no. 14) with a = 5.96381(2) &#197;, b&#160; = 7.25982(3) &#197;, c&#160; = 5.488338(19) &#197;, &#946; = 113.33&#176;, V&#160; = 218.18(5) &#197;3, and Z&#160; = 4. As the Eu2+&#8208;doped MSiN2 compounds show excellent luminescence properties as LED phosphors, the luminescence behaviour of dark red emitting EuSiN2 has been investigated as well. Two emission peaks are visible at 708&#160;nm and 764&#160;nm. Many europium&#8208;doped nitridosilicates show more or less developed shoulders for their luminescence peaks, but two clearly shaped emission peaks are a novel feature for nitridosilicates. Comprehensive and detailed comparisons are given and discussed based on works in literature.
The chromaticity coordinate positions of EuSiN2 in the CIE 1931 diagram are x = 0.678 and y = 0.284.

Redox&#8208;driven oxygenation at the backbone of the aldimine derived bridge via O2 activation in isomeric diruthenium set&#8208;up as a function of electronic nature of ancillary ligands has been evaluated.








Abstract
The article describes stepwise oxygenation of the aldimine functions at the backbone of N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylene)naphthyl&#8208;1,5&#8208;diimine (L) in noninterconvertible L&#8208;bridged isomeric diruthenium(II)&#8208;acac complexes [{RuII(acac)2}2(&#956;&#8208;L)] (cis&#8208;1a/trans&#8208;1b, acac&#160;=&#160;acetylacetonate, DFT calculated &#916;Ecis&#8208;trans&#160;=&#160;440 cm&#8722;1) via dioxygen activation. It leads to the formation of the corresponding carboxamido bridged [{RuIII(acac)2}2(&#956;&#8208;Ld2&#8722;)] (cis&#8208;1ad/trans&#8208;1bd; d denotes doubly&#8208;oxygenation) with the concomitant metal oxidation. However, L in doubly oxidized (RuIIIRuIII) congeners, i.e., [{RuIII(acac)2}2(&#956;&#8208;L)](ClO4)2 (cis&#8208;[1a](ClO4)2/trans&#8208;[1b](ClO4)2) as well as electron&#8208;poor metal fragments derived [{RuII(bpy)2}2(&#956;&#8208;L)]4+ [2](ClO4)4 (bpy&#160;=&#160;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) and [{RuII(PPh3)2(CO) (H)}2(&#956;&#8208;L)]2+ [3](ClO4)2 failed to undergo the aforestated oxygenation process on purging O2 even at elevated temperature due to the absence of necessary electron exchange between ruthenium and L (i.e., RuII&#8208;L&#8208;RuII&#8596;RuIII&#8208;L&#8226;&#8722;&#8208;RuII) to initiate the oxygen activation step. Besides structural and spectroscopic characterization of the complexes, oxygenation processes were further monitored through electrochemical, EPR and kinetic experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations, which highlighted mechanistic insights into the reaction sequence.

         <title>Tailored Self&#8208;assembled Biomimetic Nanofibers for Light&#8208;Driven &#946;&#8208;lactam Antibiotics Degradation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The overuse of antibiotics in China and the resulting rise in antibiotic resistance pose an urgent need for effective antibiotic degradation in water. Developing artificial systems that mimic the catalytic efficiency of natural photoactive enzymes for this purpose remains a critical challenge. Despite decades of research, there is a notable scarcity of precisely designed scaffolds that can replicate the structural and functional efficiency of natural enzymes for waterborne antibiotic degradation, particularly at the nano&#8208; to micrometer scale. In this study, we present a core&#8208;corona type fiber&#8208;like micellar system designed for photothermal&#8208;assisted &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic degradation (PAD) in water. This system integrates photothermal molecular chromophores (zinc porphyrin) and ionic copper degradation catalysts in close proximity within grafted solvophilic coronal chains on the surface of fiber&#8208;like crystalline scaffold. By employing a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) strategy, we fine&#8208;tune the composition, dimensions, and antibiotic degradation performance of the PAD nanofibers. The tailored colloidal stable PAD nanofibers achieve a penicillin G degradation rate of 0.35 min&#8208;1 per micromole of copper under simulated sunlight irradiation (A.M. 1.5) in deionized water, offering a promising platform for sustainable environmental remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Triflic Anhydride&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Anthraquinones and Anthrones via Unusual Intramolecular Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triflic anhydride (Tf2O) is a potent electrophilic activator for carbonyl groups, facilitating the formation of versatile triflate intermediates that undergo nucleophilic trapping to generate a broad array of valuable compounds. In this work, we have developed a novel method that utilizes Tf2O as a mediator for carbonyl activation and subsequent intramolecular rearrangement of 3,3&#8208;diarylbenzofuranones into anthraquinones 2 and anthrones 3. Both anthraquinones and anthrones are important molecules in the fields of natural products research, pharmaceuticals, and traditional chinese medicines. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed involving Tf2O&#8208;mediated activation, carbocation formation, nucleophilic addition, and intramolecular cyclization, ultimately leading to the formation of anthraquinones and anthrones. The developed methodology is both operationally simple and convenient, without the need for an inert atmosphere. This study broadens the scope of Tf2O utility and extends the practical application of intriguing intramolecular rearrangement to the synthesis of biologically active compounds, pharmaceuticals and functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances In The Fixation of CO2 to form N&#8208;containing Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds are common chemical structures in drugs, bioactive compounds, and natural products. Using CO2 as a C1 source for synthesizing N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds aligns with the concepts of green chemistry and sustainability. In recent years, the synthesis of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds has been extensively and intensively studied. However, significant challenges remain, such as thermodynamic limitations, low catalytic efficiency, and harsh reaction conditions. Catalysts play an essential role in the catalytic activation of CO2 and/or substrates, thereby facilitating CO2 conversion. This review provides an overview of several typical N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds converted from CO2, such as oxazolidinones, quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;diones, benzimidazoles, and benzimidazolones. The most recent catalysts used in these reactions are discussed, emphasizing their mechanistic roles in the reaction process.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt&#8208;Decorated NiMo/Carbon Hybrid Catalysts for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Hydrogen Evolution: Synergistic Electronic Modulation and Industrial Application Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In response to the urgent demand for sustainable hydrogen production under industrial high&#8208;current&#8208;density conditions, this study presents the development of a Pt&#8208;decorated NiMo&#8208;based carbon&#8208;supported catalyst (Pt&#8208;NiMo/C) for efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The catalyst was synthesized via a solvent evaporation method followed by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, achieving uniform dispersion of Pt&#8208;NiMo nanoparticles on conductive carbon. Electrochemical evaluations revealed exceptional HER performance with ultralow overpotentials of &#8208;0.02 mV and &#8208;0.17 mV vs RHE at current densities of 10 mA cm&#8208;&#178; and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively, surpassing commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The Pt&#8208;NiMo/C catalyst demonstrated robust stability over 50 hours at 100 mA cm&#8208;&#178;, attributed to its hierarchical structure and synergistic electronic interactions between Pt and NiMo. The MEA configuration showcased stable electrochemical performance with a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;&#178; at a cell voltage of 1.53 V vs RHE, highlighting its potential for efficient energy conversion applications such as water electrolysis or fuel cells. These results underscore the catalyst's potential for industrial&#8208;scale water electrolysis, offering a cost&#8208;effective and durable solution for green hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogs via a Solid&#8208;Solution Storage Mechanism for Long&#160;Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The open&#8208;framework characteristics of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been recognized as advantages for cathode application in Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, lattice distortions during charge&#8208;discharge cycles critically compromise their cyclability. Recent advancements in high&#8208;entropy design strategies have significantly improved structural stability and energy storage efficiency within functional materials. In this study, we developed the high&#8208;entropy PBAs, K1.68Mn0.21Cu0.20Ni0.20Co0.19Fe0.20[Fe(CN)6]0.87&#9633;0.13&#183;0.66H2O, via a cost&#8208;effective aqueous coprecipitation protocol. Notably, this approach facilitates&#160;the concurrent incorporation of five transition metals (Mn, Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe), thereby establishing a stable crystalline framework. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates&#160;that the cathode achieves a specific capacity of 124.9 mAh g&#8722;1&#160;at 0.025 A g&#8722;1. At various current densities (0.025&#8208;1 A g&#8722;1), the cathode maintains&#160;a particular capacity retention&#160;of 62.1% during rate testing. Furthermore, the cathode exhibits&#160;exceptional cyclability, preserving 78.7% capacity at 1 A g&#8722;1&#160;after 3000 cycles. Operando&#160;X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms&#160;the formation of a reversible solid&#8208;solution intercalation/extraction mechanism process, which prevents phase transitions and enhances cyclability. This high&#8208;entropy material holds significant potential as a cathode for SIBs, offering high specific capacity and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability. These superior properties position it as a competitive candidate for advanced energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of Arsines and Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane towards Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various combinations of Lewis acids and bases, particularly frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), have been investigated for their distinctive reactivities. Nevertheless, to date, no systematic study of arsine&#8211;borane Lewis pairs has been reported. In this study, tertiary arsines with different degrees of steric hindrance and electron&#8208;donating abilities were used. Depending on their steric and electronic properties, arsines form classical Lewis adducts, FLPs, or arsonium borate adducts with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3). Experimental and computational analyses revealed that trimesitylarsine and B(C6F5)3 form an encounter complex in solution, which is referred to as an FLP adduct. Furthermore, the arsine&#8211;borane pairs react with phenylacetylene and diphenyl disulfide to afford the corresponding arsonium borate adduct and thioarsonium thioborate salt, respectively. The structures of the products were characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) triflate/ Vitamin&#8208;C Promoted Modified Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman Annulation: A Facile Route to Fluorescent Cyclopentene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a rapid and efficient method for the synthesis of fused cyclopentenoids via Intramolecular Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (IMBH) annulation. In this approach, copper triflate (Cu(OTf)&#8322;) serves as the promoter, favoring cyclization and aromatization over the conventional MBH addition product. A characteristic feature among most of the cyclized product contain two non&#8208;separable isomeric mixture of cyclopentene derivatives which has been readily interconverted via 1,5&#8208;H shift. Additionally, the same compounds have also been synthesized in solvent&#8208;free conditions using organic acids, which reduces the use of hazardous substances, providing an alternate pathway for the IMBH reaction. Moreover, this novel IMBH reaction has been thoroughly investigated and elucidated using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The construction of such fluorescent derivatives and the evaluation of their unique photophysical properties revealed acid&#8208;base interactions with active methylene groups, facilitating their use as sensors of hazardous amine derivatives via fluorescence quenching mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Peripheral Designed Indigo Bola&#8208;Amphiphiles for Supramolecular Assembled Nanoarchitectonics in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indigo, an ancient natural dye, featured excellent biodegradability to advance in sustainable polymer. Indigo amphiphiles can pave a way for sustainable supramolecular polymers in aqueous media for potential biomedical functional materials. However, contemporary indigo amphiphiles supramolecular commonly assemble into low aspect ratio nanostructures, which hampers the macroscopic soft scaffolds fabrications and smart functional material applications. Herein, we report a novel peripheral designed indigo bola&#8208;amphiphiles (IBAs), which assemble into high aspect ratio supramolecular nanofibers in aqueous media. By employing shear&#8208;flow assembly technique with bio&#8208;abundant calcium ions, IBAs assemble across multiple length&#8208;scales into supramolecular macroscopic scaffolds. The structural characterizations of IBAs macroscopic soft scaffolds show different supramolecular structural packing information by scanning electron microscope and X&#8208;ray scattering/diffraction techniques. Our supramolecular nanoarchitectonic approach indicates the feasibility of using IBAs molecular design to construct supramolecular macroscopic materials with higher structural order for the future smart bio&#8208;functional materials and sustainable supramolecular polymer under more environmentally friendly conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Stannylenes Bearing an Amino&#8208;Linked NHC Ligand as Efficient Catalysts for Hydroboration of Carbonyls and Imines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed and synthesized a series of three&#8208;coordinated stannylenes featuring an amino&#8208;linked NHC ligand, specifically tailored for the hydroboration of carbonyl compounds and imines. To fine&#8208;tune the catalytic performance both sterically and electronically, various substituents (chloro, triflate, and bis(trimethylsilyl)amino groups) were introduced at the tin center, generating structurally diverse stannylenes. The hydroboration of carbonyl compounds catalyzed by these stannylenes proceeded under mild reaction conditions, affording the corresponding boryl esters in excellent yields with high chemoselectivity. Notably, bis(trimethylsilyl)aminostannylene exhibited outstanding catalytic efficiency, enabling hydroboration with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.01 mol% for aldehydes and 0.1 mol% for ketones, and was tolerant of a wide range of substrates, including sterically hindered and electronically diverse carbonyl compounds.&#12288;Furthermore, in the hydroboration of imines, the reaction proceeded efficiently with just 5 mol% catalyst, furnishing the corresponding borylamines in high yields. Based on stoichiometric experiments, we propose a plausible catalytic cycle for stannylene&#8208;mediated hydroboration.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Water&#8208;Soluble Platinum(II) Complexes: From Emission Modulation to Cell Imaging in Specific Organelles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of amphiphilic Pt(II) complexes with tetradentate ligands exhibits distinct self&#8208;assembly properties, forming phosphorescent structures that can be tuned by variation of concentration and solvent composition. Initial in vitro studies on cells suggest structure&#8208;dependent and selective subcellular localization, pointing towards their potential as bioimaging probes.







Abstract
The control of self&#8208;organized metal complexes presents advantages regarding the modulation of luminescence through dynamic assembly, rendering them promising for bioimaging. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy towards a series of amphiphilic Pt(II) complexes featuring bis&#8208;cyclometalated ligands as tetradentate luminophores, which exhibit enhanced water solubility and tuneable self&#8208;assembly properties. The resulting nanostructures can be precisely controlled by adjusting concentration and solvent composition, yielding switchable luminescence from red (i.&#8201;e., excimer&#8208;based) to green (i.&#8201;e., monomer&#8208;centred) and reversible (dis&#8722;)assembly of the aggregates. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed the innocuous nature of these luminophores at concentrations below 10&#8197;&#956;M, while cellular uptake studies demonstrated effective internalization in both living and fixed cells. Using photoluminescence lifetime imaging micro(spectro)scopy, we determined that the complexes localized preferentially within lysosomes of living cells, while accumulating in the nuclei of fixed cells, with differences in photophysical behavior depending on whether the species were monomeric or excimeric in nature. These new findings provide insights into the systematic design of water&#8208;soluble Pt(II)&#8208;based luminophores with photophysical properties controlled by supramolecular interactions, underlining their potential for use in cellular imaging and diagnostics.

         <title>Conception and Synthesis of Sequence&#8208;Coded Morpholinos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morpholino oligomer chemistry, which relies on the coupling of a chlorophosphoramidate group with the secondary amine of a morpholine ring, has been to date only explored for the synthesis of xeno nucleic acids. Here, we report that it can also be used for the design of digital polymers. Oligomers with different sizes and sequences were synthesized using a binary monomer alphabet.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;phase morpholino chemistry was explored as a new route to synthesize abiological sequence&#8208;defined oligomers. Two comonomers, 0 and 1 containing (i) a chlorophosphoramidate reactive function, (ii) a trityl&#8208;protected morpholine, and (iii) a coding substituent (H or CH3 for 0 and 1, respectively) on the morpholine ring were first synthesized and characterized. This binary alphabet was afterwards tested for the synthesis of digitally&#8208;encoded oligomers with different lengths and sequences. The oligomers were prepared on a modified polystyrene resin, cleaved, and characterized by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. When using a repetitive cycle containing only morpholino coupling and trityl deprotection steps, the formed oligomers were not uniform. Thus, an additional capping step was added. In these conditions, uniform coded sequences were prepared in most cases. Furthermore, the oligomers were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. In the studied collision&#8208;induced dissociation conditions, the repeat units of the oligomers undergo two main&#8208;chain fragmentations and full sequence coverage was observed for all studied sequences. Therefore, the binary messages stored in the oligomers could be decoded and retrieved in all cases.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrophosphination Using Calcium Precatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium compounds are competent photocatalysts for hydrophosphination. Returning to the compounds reported by Barrett and Hill, visible light irradiation at ambient temperature activates simple calcium derivatives comparable to thermal catalysis. Ancillary ligands are key to radical versus nonradical reactivity under these conditions.








Abstract
Hydrophosphination using calcium compounds as catalysts under irradiation is described as a foray into s&#8208;block photocatalysis. Transition&#8208;metal compounds have been highly successful hydrophosphination catalysts under photochemical conditions, utilizing substrates previously considered inaccessible. A calcium hydrophosphination precatalyst, Ca(nacnac) (THF) (N(SiMe3)2) (1, nacnac&#160;=&#160;HC[(C(Me)N&#8208;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)]2), reported by Barrett and Hill, as well as the presumed intermediate, Ca(nacnac) (THF) (PPh2) (2), and the Schlenk equilibrium product, Ca[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2 (3) were screened under photochemical conditions with a range of unsaturated substrates including styrenic alkenes, Michael acceptors, and dienes with modest to excellent conversions, though unactivated alkenes were inaccessible. All compounds exhibit enhanced catalysis under irradiation by light emitting diode (LED)&#8208;generated blue light. Nacnac&#8208;supported compounds generate radicals as evidenced by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and radical trapping reactions, whereas unsupported calcium compounds are EPR silent and appear to undergo hydrophosphination akin to thermal reactions with these compounds.

     alt="Photocatalytic Hydrophosphination Using Calcium Precatalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calcium compounds are competent photocatalysts for hydrophosphination. Returning to the compounds reported by Barrett and Hill, visible light irradiation at ambient temperature activates simple calcium derivatives comparable to thermal catalysis. Ancillary ligands are key to radical versus nonradical reactivity under these conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrophosphination using calcium compounds as catalysts under irradiation is described as a foray into s-block photocatalysis. Transition-metal compounds have been highly successful hydrophosphination catalysts under photochemical conditions, utilizing substrates previously considered inaccessible. A calcium hydrophosphination precatalyst, Ca(nacnac) (THF) (N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, nacnac&#160;=&#160;HC[(C(Me)N-2,6-&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), reported by Barrett and Hill, as well as the presumed intermediate, Ca(nacnac) (THF) (PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), and the Schlenk equilibrium product, Ca[N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(THF)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) were screened under photochemical conditions with a range of unsaturated substrates including styrenic alkenes, Michael acceptors, and dienes with modest to excellent conversions, though unactivated alkenes were inaccessible. All compounds exhibit enhanced catalysis under irradiation by light emitting diode (LED)-generated blue light. Nacnac-supported compounds generate radicals as evidenced by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and radical trapping reactions, whereas unsupported calcium compounds are EPR silent and appear to undergo hydrophosphination akin to thermal reactions with these compounds. These results buttress the notion that photoactivation of &#960;-basic ligands is a broad phenomenon, extending beyond the d-block, but like d-block metals, consideration of ancillary ligands is essential to avoid radical reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A daisy chain architecture without a preferred low energy arrangement of the mechanically linked components is presented. The molecular design combines a rigid&#8208;rod type oligophenylene ethynylene subunit with an oligoethylene glycol macrocycle that features a bipyridine coordination site. The daisy chain dimer was synthesized via kinetic trapping of the interlocked structure using a Cadiot&#8208;Chodkiewicz active metal template reaction. Comparison of the isolated interlocked dimer with its monomeric analogue indicates the presence of a variety of different geometries for the molecular daisy chain. The dynamic sliding motion in the daisy chain is studied by variable temperature UV&#8208;vis and NMR spectroscopy experiments, which point to a highly mobile system even at low temperatures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have experienced a concerning global increase in incidence over recent decades. The advent of molecular imaging probes has revolutionized real&#8208;time biomarker monitoring in IBD pathophysiology, enabling visualization of critical pathological processes. These probes provide dynamic insights into oxidative stress mediators (including reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species) and enzymatic biomarkers (e.g., caspase&#8208;1, pantetheinase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, nitroreductase, elastase, myeloperoxidase, and carboxylesterase 2), which are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. Despite significant technological advancements, there remains a lack of systematic analyses exploring the diagnostic potential and therapeutic monitoring applications of these molecular probes in IBD management. This review comprehensively analyzes the design of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular probes targeting IBD&#8208;specific biomarkers, with particular focus on their detection mechanisms and biological applicability. Through a mechanistic elucidation of detection paradigms, this review aims to guide the development of future probes for diagnosing IBD.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted aromatic amine cages are well known in the literature for a wide array of applications including catalysis, sensing, imaging, etc. In this work, we report the first example of amine cages with the capacity to exhibit two&#8208;step light&#8208;harvesting behavior. The aforementioned property was further utilized to achieve anticounterfeiting properties.








Abstract
A new platinum (II)&#8208;triphenylamine tetra aldehyde&#8208;based barrel&#8208;shaped rectangular covalent cage was prepared using dynamic imine condensation and subsequent reduction. The cage was found to exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior in 60% water in THF solvent composition and the AIE property was successively utilized to achieve excellent sequential light&#8208;harvesting behavior in aggregate form in the presence of acceptors such as Eosin Y and Nile Red. Moreover, the light&#8208;harvesting capability was employed to prepare a new type of security ink whose potential was demonstrated using TLC plates and commercial banknotes.

         <title>CuOx&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;TiOx Composite Interfaces with Strong Lewis Acid Activity for Electrooxidation of Methane to Acetic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZrO2&#8208;TiOx was in situ synthesized on Ti substrates via the hydrothermal reaction of TiO2 nanowires with H2C2O4 and Zr(NO3)4. Subsequently, CuOx was uniformly disposed on ZrO2&#8208;TiOx with the assistance of PVP and citric acid. The prepared catalyst with rich interfaces exhibits strong Lewis acid activity and high CH4 adsorption capacity. And the optimized electrode achieves the FE of 60.1% for CH3COOH at the current density of 10.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a production rate of 3312.5&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1&#160;hour&#8722;1.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of methane (CH4) to valuable oxygenates is an attractive approach to utilize abundant natural gas, however, the chemical inertness of CH4 and its low solubility in electrolytes impede effective electrooxidation. Enhancing the adsorption and activation of CH4 on catalysts is crucial for electrocatalytic methane oxidation reaction (eMOR). In this study, we developed the CuOx&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;TiOx composite catalyst for the selective electrooxidation of CH4 to CH3COOH. The ZrO2&#8208;TiOx was in situ synthesized on Ti substrates via the hydrothermal reaction of TiO2 nanowires with H2C2O4 and Zr(NO3)4. Subsequently, CuOx was uniformly disposed on ZrO2&#8208;TiOx with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and citric acid. The prepared electrode achieves the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.1% for CH3COOH at the current density of 10.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, corresponding to the generation rate of 3312.5&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. Mechanism studies confirm that the synergistic effect of CuOx and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces enhances the efficiency of eMOR. CuOx oxidizes H2O to produce hydroxyl radicals (*OH) and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces with strong Lewis acid activity adsorb and activate CH4. The CuOx and ZrO2&#8208;TiOx interfaces synergistically oxidize CH4 to generate a series of intermediates (*CH3, *CH3O, *CH2O, *COOH), promoting C&#8208;C coupling to produce CH3COOH.

&lt;p&gt;The ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; was in situ synthesized on Ti substrates via the hydrothermal reaction of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Zr(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;hour&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical conversion of methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to valuable oxygenates is an attractive approach to utilize abundant natural gas, however, the chemical inertness of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and its low solubility in electrolytes impede effective electrooxidation. Enhancing the adsorption and activation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; on catalysts is crucial for electrocatalytic methane oxidation reaction (eMOR). In this study, we developed the CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; composite catalyst for the selective electrooxidation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH. The ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; was in situ synthesized on Ti substrates via the hydrothermal reaction of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Zr(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Subsequently, CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; was uniformly disposed on ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; with the assistance of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and citric acid. The prepared electrode achieves the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.1% for CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH at the current density of 10.8&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to the generation rate of 3312.5&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Mechanism studies confirm that the synergistic effect of CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces enhances the efficiency of eMOR. CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; oxidizes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to produce hydroxyl radicals (*OH) and ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces with strong Lewis acid activity adsorb and activate CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces synergistically oxidize CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to generate a series of intermediates (*CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, *CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O, *CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, *COOH), promoting C-C coupling to produce CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation of a Homochiral Porous Organic Cage RCC2&#8208;S&#8208;Bonded Silica as a Stationary Phase for High&#8208;Performance Liquid Chromatography Enantioseparation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel chiral stationary phase (CSP), RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH, was prepared by bonding a homochiral porous organic cage onto thiolated silica (SiO2&#8208;SH) by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. The CSP shows excellent chiral separation capability not only in normal&#8208;phase HPLC (NP&#8208;HPLC) but also in reversed&#8208;phase HPLC (RP&#8208;HPLC), as shown by the enantioseparation of various racemates.








Abstract
In this work, a reduced homochiral porous organic cage (RCC2&#8208;S)&#8208;based chiral stationary phase (CSP), RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH, was prepared by bonding RCC2&#8208;S on thiolated silica (SiO2&#8208;SH) via a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. The CSP (RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH) showed excellent enantioseparation in both normal&#8208;phase HPLC (NP&#8208;HPLC) and reversed&#8208;phase HPLC (RP&#8208;HPLC) modes, effectively separating various chiral compounds, including alcohols, esters, ketones, amines, imidazoles, epoxides, and organic acids. As a result, 12 racemates were enantioseparated under NP&#8208;HPLC, and 17 racemates were enantioseparated under RP&#8208;HPLC. The CSP also exhibited good complementarity in chiral separation with commercial Chiralpak AD&#8208;H, Chiralcel OD&#8208;H, and the previously reported chiral POC CC19&#8208;R columns, successfully separating some racemates that remained unresolved or poorly resolved on these three columns. Additionally, the fabricated RCC2&#8208;S@SiO2&#8208;SH packed column demonstrated good reproducibility and stability. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of retention time and resolution value were less than 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively, after the column had been subjected to hundreds of injections. This work indicates that chiral porous organic cages have great potential for the separation of enantiomers in HPLC.

         <title>Pyrazine&#8208;Functionalized Ru(II)&#8208;Complexes as Visible&#8208;Light Activated Photobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light excitation leads to the accumulation of electron density in pyrazine&#8208;containing Ru(II) complexes via metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT). In aqueous solutions of appropriate pH, excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) takes place on a timescale of hundreds of ps. We resolve the underlying kinetics via transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and corroborate our studies by photometric titrations and DFT calculations.








Abstract
Excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) roots in significantly increased acidities or basicities of up to ca. 10 pKa units in the excited state compared to the ground state. While organic photobases are either of &#8220;single use&#8221; in the case of photobase generators or are limited functionally by their UV absorption, metal complex&#8208;based photobases offer intriguing properties. By exciting the characteristic metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions in the visible range, multiple and reversible ESPT processes can be triggered. In this contribution we present the synthesis of two novel Ruthenium(II)&#8208;complexes with pyrazine&#8208;functionalized polypyridyl ligands and study their photobasic properties by ultrafast spectroscopy. We find that MLCT excitation in aqueous solution leads to a &#916;pKa of 9 units and that the involved ESPT process takes place within ca. 300 picoseconds. Our investigations combine experimental spectroscopy with theoretical calculations.

         <title>Tuning of Thermal Back Reactivity of Aza&#8208;Diarylethene Photoswitches by Introducing Benzazole Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aza&#8208;diarylethenes bearing benzazole groups as nitrogen sources for 6&#960; azaelectrocyclization were synthesized, and their thermal back reactivity was investigated. Kinetic analysis revealed that the thermal back reaction half&#8208;lives (t&#8321;/&#8322;) at 293&#160;K largely depended on the type of benzazole group. Theoretical calculations clarified that the variation in thermal back reactivity approximately follows the change in the energy difference between open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers.








Abstract
Molecular photoswitches have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in materials science and life science. In this study, we synthesize a series of aza&#8208;diarylethenes incorporating benzazole groups as the nitrogen atom source for 6&#960; azaelectrocyclization and investigate their photochromic behaviors. Compounds 1&#8211;3, bearing benzothiazole, benzoxazole, and benzimidazole groups, exhibit thermally reversible type photochromism with thermal back reaction half&#8208;lives (t1/2) ranging from milliseconds to seconds at 293&#160;K. Additional derivatives 4&#8211;6 with benzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide at the ethene bridge moiety further expand the range of thermal back reactivity, with t1/2 values extending up to tens of minutes. Quantum chemical calculations confirm that the variation in thermal back reactivity is governed by the energy difference between open&#8208; and closed&#8208;ring isomers, in accordance with the Bell&#8722;Evans&#8722;Polanyi principle. These findings provide a molecular design strategy for controlling the thermal back reactivity of aza&#8208;diarylethenes, enabling further development of functional photochromic materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
The direct &#945;&#8208;arylation of a protected 4&#8208;hydroxy piperidine via a one&#8208;pot Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction is described. The methodology uses a single solvent, toluene, for the lithiation/transmetallation/Negishi sequence and 20 examples are presented. Of note, the high&#8208;yielding cross&#8208;coupling of a range of pharmaceutically relevant heteroaryl bromides is reported. The reactions show high levels of 2,4&#8208;cis&#8208;diastereoselectivity and further functionalizations are also described. Piperidine is the most common nitrogen heterocycle in approved drugs and our approach delivers such heterocycles via a direct diastereoselective &#945;&#8208;functionalization of 4&#8208;substituted N&#8208;Boc piperidines; as such, the approach is ready to be utilized in the pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Oxidative Folding of a Two&#8208;Chain Protein Having Three Interchain Disulfide Bonds. Synthesis of Bromelain Inhibitor VI through Native Chain Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recently renovated two&#8208;chain folding method, in which two native peptide chains without any sidechain protections and interchain scaffolds are just mixed in a buffer solution under optimized conditions, called native chain assembly (NCA), enabled efficient chemical synthesis of &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich insulin and its analogs, which are stabilized by two interchain disulfide (SS) bridges. Herein, this simple folding method has been successfully applied to the folding of a different&#8208;type two&#8208;chain protein, i.e., bromelain inhibitor VI (BI&#8208;VI), which has abundant &#946;&#8208;sheet structures and is stabilized by three interchain SS bridges. When the chemically synthesized native heavy (H)&#8208; and light (L)&#8208;chains of BI&#8208;VI were mixed at 4 &#176;C in a pH 10.0 buffer solution containing 2 mM GSH and 0.4 mM GSSG, native BI&#8208;VI was obtained surprisingly in a high isolated yield (53 %) after 2 weeks. The obtained BI&#8208;VI showed complete inhibitory activity against bromelain, whereas each component chain exhibited essentially non&#8208;activity. The rate&#8208;limiting step of the two&#8208;chain folding was assumed to be the chain coupling between three&#8208;SS intermediates of the H&#8208;chain (3SSH) and one&#8208;SS intermediates of the L&#8208;chain (1SSL). This achievement opens a door to the chemical synthesis of unprecedent multi&#8208;chain proteins with more complicated SS&#8208;bond topologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis(Dipyrrinate) Based Bis(Germylenes): Synthesis, Reactivity, and UV&#8208;Vis Spectroscopic Analysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Bis(germylenes) 5&#8211;9 and bis(germacarbonyl) compounds 10&#8211;12, which exhibit stability in air and water, have been isolated for the first time. This accomplishment was made possible by the stabilization offered by the bulky bis(dipyrromethene) ligand framework.








Abstract
The first examples of air and water stable bis(germylenes) 5&#8211;9 and bis(germacarbonyl) compounds 10&#8211;12 are reported. Bis(germylene monochloride) 5 is isolated by starting from bis(dipyrromethene) 4, which in turn has been synthesized by oxidizing bis(dipyrromethane) 3 using DDQ. Terephthaldehyde 1 and mesityl pyrrole 2 were the precursors for compound 3. Bis(germylene monochloride) 5 reacts with alcohols and phenol in the presence of a mild base (Cs&#8322;CO&#8323;) to afford bis(germylene alkoxides) 6&#8211;7 and bis(germylene phenoxide) 8, respectively. Compound 5&#8242;s reaction with sodium pyrrolide has resulted in bis(germylene pyrrolide) 9. Further, compounds 7 and 9 react with elemental sulfur and selenium under ambient conditions, resulting in bis(germacarbonyl) compounds 10&#8211;12. The UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic investigations on compounds 4&#8211;12 are done experimentally and computationally.

         <title>Singlet, Doublet, and Triplet Emissions of Diarylamine&#8208;Modified Bismuth Pincer Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Reversibly oxidizable diarylamine&#8208;modified phenyl&#8208;bis(dimethylaminomethyl) pincer bismuth complexes and their radical cations emit via excited singlet and triplet or doublet excited states at 77&#160;K in solvent matrices, in solution, or in the solid state.








Abstract
We present six bismuth complexes (NCRN)BiX2 (X = Cl, I) with diarylamine&#8208;modified pincer ligands (NCRN = (4&#8208;R&#8208;C6H4)2N&#8208;C6H2&#8208;(CH2NMe2)2&#8208;1,3; R&#160;=&#160;Me, O, NMe2) and report on their optoelectronic, photophysical, and electrochemical properties. The complexes exhibit intriguing photophysical behavior, with the p&#8208;tolyl and p&#8208;anisyl derivatives showing phosphorescence at 77 K in frozen solvent matrices and at room temperature (r.t.) in the solid state. In THF solutions at r.t., only ligand&#8208;based fluorescence is observed with strongly reduced quantum yields compared to free proligands NCHRN. Electrochemical studies reveal up to three reversible one&#8208;electron oxidations. The NMe2&#8208;substituted complexes display the lowest oxidation potentials and the largest number of redox waves. Radical cations [NCHNMe2N]+ and [(NCNMe2N)BiX2]+ are chemically stable and fluoresce weakly in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) at ca. 1200&#160;nm.

         <title>A Cyclic Peptide&#8208;Based Radiotheranostic Agent for Urokinase&#8208;Type Plasminogen Activator in Tumors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three cyclic peptide&#8208;based radioligands for uPA&#8208;targeted theranostics are designed, synthesized, and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Outperforming the clinically used [64Cu]DOTA&#8208;AE105, [64Cu]CAP&#8208;1 exhibits enhanced tumor uptake and reduced off&#8208;target accumulation in tumor model mice. In addition, mice treated with [64Cu]CAP&#8208;1 exhibit significant tumor growth inhibition. These findings indicate the potential of cyclic peptide&#8208;based radiopharmaceuticals for uPA&#8208;targeting theranostics.








Abstract
The plasminogen activator system is critically involved in tumor progression regulation. Aberrant activation of urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator (uPA) induces proteolytic degradation of cellular membranes and the extracellular matrix, thereby promoting tumor invasion and metastasis. Consequently, uPA has emerged as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target. Herein, we designed and evaluated three cyclic peptide&#8208;based radioligands ([&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1, [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;2, and [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;3) as potential PET tracers for uPA visualization in mouse tumor models, assessing their binding ability, specificity, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Among them, [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1, featuring a native disulfide bond, emerged as the optimal candidate. This radioligand demonstrated superior tumor uptake and reduced hepatic accumulation compared to the clinically advanced uPAR&#8208;targeted tracer [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]DOTA&#8208;AE105, currently in Phase 2 trials. A single administration of [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1 (2 mCi/mouse) significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in mouse models. These findings position [&#8310;&#8308;Cu]CAP&#8208;1 as a potent radiotheranostic agent for uPA&#8208;overexpressing tumors, offering a novel strategy for precision targeting of the uPA/uPAR axis.

         <title>Parent, Unsubstituted Corrphycene: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of unsubstituted corrphycene and its precursor, 11,18&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcorrphycene. This porphine isomer exists in the form of a doubly degenerate trans tautomeric species in which two intramolecular H&#8208;bonds are not equivalent. Corrphycene turns out to be a soft chromophore, and, as such, seems to be an attractive candidate for sensing changes in its environment.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of a porphyrin isomer that, until now, has only been obtained in the form of multiply substituted derivatives. Structural, spectral, and electrochemical characteristics of unsubstituted corrphycene (Cp) are described along with the data for its precursor, 11,18&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcorrphycene. Similar to porphine, Cp turns out to be a soft chromophore, characterized by very similar energy splittings between the pairs of frontier HOMO and LUMO orbitals. Magnetic circular dichroism spectra indicate that the splitting in the HOMO orbitals is larger than in the LUMO, opposite to the DFT predictions. Corrphycene exists in the form of a doubly degenerate trans tautomeric species. The two intramolecular H&#8208;bonds are not equivalent, which strongly suggests a stepwise mechanism of trans&#8208;trans conversion. Being a nearly perfect soft chromophore, Cp emerges as an attractive candidate for sensing changes in its environment.

         <title>Extrudable Thermosets Based on Dynamic Covalent Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent polymers (DCPs) hold significant promise for the development of high&#8208;performance materials. However, their compatibility with contemporary mass production and processing techniques, such as extrusion, presents a considerable challenge. This review discusses the design principles and overviews the recent advancements in extrudable thermosets derived from DCPs, while also addressing the associated challenges, future prospects, and potential applications.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymers (DCPs) have attracted considerable attention for fabricating self&#8208;healing, recyclable, adaptive, and malleable thermosets. However, their processing has largely depended on compression molding, which requires extended time due to the crosslinked nature of these materials. This limitation poses significant challenges for applications in continuous processes like extrusion, a technique highly valued in industry for producing long, uninterrupted products. Recently, continuous processing methods for DCPs have emerged, offering the potential to streamline their production by providing scalability and consistency&#8208;factors that could transform sectors such as automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods. Yet, developing extrudable DCPs remains a complex task, demanding the precise design of dynamic crosslinks with rapid kinetics, high thermal stability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, all while ensuring compatibility with suitable molecular backbones. In this review, we summarize the key requirements for designing extrudable DCPs and discuss recent advancements in continuous processing techniques aligned with various design strategies. We also highlight the challenges and outline future directions for optimizing high&#8208;performance DCP extrusion, aiming to offer a valuable resource for researchers and industry professionals looking to leverage these techniques.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Prodrug Linkers That Simultaneously Release Cargo and Neutralize In Situ Generated (Aza)Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly reactive (aza)quinone methides are electrophiles generated from many stimuli&#8208;responsive prodrugs and probes. A new linker has been designed to quench the electrophilic methide, forming a tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) heterocycle in high yields, even when a competing nucleophile is present. Upon neutralizing the electrophile, the THIQ itself is relatively nontoxic, boding well for future prodrug linker strategies






.

Abstract
Self&#8208;immolative linkers that use p&#8208;amino/hydroxy&#8208;benzyloxycarbonyl (PABC/PHBC) spacers are essential to the mechanism of many prodrugs. However, a highly reactive (aza)quinone methide is generated as a potential toxic byproduct. To remove the methide as it forms, we synthesized a series of novel tripartite prodrugs, comprising different triggers (nitro, amide, azide, boronate) and a PABC/PHBC&#8208;type self&#8208;immolative spacer with an integrated nucleophile (amine). Upon reductive, hydrolytic, or oxidative&#8208;trigger activation, the release of the cargo is facilitated via a 1,6&#8208;elimination that generates a reactive (aza)quinone methide. With the built&#8208;in nucleophile, the (aza)quinone methide is rapidly self&#8208;quenched to generate tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs). One of the selected THIQs does not exhibit an anti&#8208;proliferative effect on the A431 mammalian tumor cell line. The new prodrug strategy has broad scope, enabling the use of a trigger that matches the targeted stimulus, while allowing for a diverse range of drug/cargo attachment. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study adds a new linker strategy that quenches the electrophilic (aza)quinone methide generated in many self&#8208;immolative linker systems and could find applications in prodrug and antibody&#8208;drug conjugate strategies, or as a linker for probes in chemical biology.

         <title>Design and Evaluation of Bivalent K&#8208;Ras Inhibitors That Target the CAAX Binding Site and the Acidic Surface of Farnesyltransferase and Geranylgeranyltransferase I</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical inhibition of K&#8208;Ras posttranslational prenylation represents a promising strategy against aggressive cancers. A structure&#8208;based design produces piperidine&#8208;based peptidomimetics conjugated to cationic modules, effectively inhibiting FTase and GGTase I at single&#8208;digit nanomolar concentrations. This dual&#8208;targeting approach demonstrates promise for treating K&#8208;Ras&#8208;driven cancers.








Abstract
Mutant K&#8208;Ras drives cancer through its membrane localization, which requires posttranslational modification by farnesyltransferase (FTase). FTase attaches farnesyl to the K&#8208;Ras C&#8208;terminal CVIM tetrapeptide, enabling membrane binding. However, K&#8208;Ras can also undergo compensatory geranylgeranylation by geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I), making FTase inhibition alone ineffective. Dual inhibition of FTase and GGTase I is necessary to fully block K&#8208;Ras localization and its cancer activity. We developed bivalent inhibitors targeting both FTase and GGTase I by binding to the CVIM (C = cysteine, V = valine, I = isoleucine, M = methionine) site and an adjacent acidic surface. A nonthiol CVIM peptidomimetic based on a piperidine scaffold showed potent FTase inhibition (Ki = 2.1&#160;nM) with less effect on GGTase I (Ki = 210&#160;nM). Adding cationic modules to this compound produced dual inhibitors with enhanced potency (Ki = 2&#8211;5&#160;nM), significantly improving upon previous agents. These bivalent inhibitors effectively reduced mutant K&#8208;Ras cancer cell viability and inhibited K&#8208;Ras farnesylation and geranylgeranylation in cells. This dual&#8208;targeting approach shows promise for treating K&#8208;Ras&#8208;driven cancers.

&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.1&#160;nM) with less effect on GGTase I (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 210&#160;nM). Adding cationic modules to this compound produced dual inhibitors with enhanced potency (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&#8211;5&#160;nM), significantly improving upon previous agents. These bivalent inhibitors effectively reduced mutant K-Ras cancer cell viability and inhibited K-Ras farnesylation and geranylgeranylation in cells. This dual-targeting approach shows promise for treating K-Ras-driven cancers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From C&#8208;H Bond Insertion to Hydrogen Atom Transfer: Tuning the Reaction Mechanisms of Methane Activation by the Oxidation of Ta2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of methane under mild conditions is a challenging but rewarding goal, the underlying key parameters, however, remain elusive. In this study on isolated tantalum Ta2+ compounds exposed to methane in a ring&#8208;electrode ion trap, strong changes in the reactivity are observed depending on the compound&#8217;s degree of oxidation. While the general reaction behavior is presented for species ranging from Ta2+ to Ta2O6+ based on experimental kinetic studies, we focus in more detail on the dehydrogenation reactions occurring on Ta2O2+ and the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) on Ta2O5+, for which density functional theory calculations were performed. In the first part, we elucidate the role of Ta&#8208;C&#8208;Ta bridging motifs in product structures as driving forces for the dehydrogenation of methane on Ta2O2+; in the second part, we investigate the origins of the HAT &#8211; a hitherto unknown reaction scheme for binary tantalum oxides. For the latter, we show that the reactivity originates from the spin density on oxygen atoms, which is a typical characteristic of the reaction on other metal oxides. This reflects a change in the reactivity from oxidized metallic systems to metal oxides and demonstrates that chemical modifications of tantalum compounds can achieve different methane activation schemes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Energetics of Electron Transfer in Redox&#8208;DNA Layers Mimics that of Redox Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;DNA layers have recently shown unique properties, such as tunable reorganization energy of electron transfer that can be modulated by DNA length or hybridization state, and completely suppressed under nanoconfinement. These discoveries, attributed to the changes in the solvation of the redox marker and/or fast chain dynamics, provide a unique opportunity to use electrochemical measurements as a tool to address open questions in ion solvation. Moreover, they offer a pathway to clarify the origin of the largely unsolved problem of establishing low activation barriers for biological electron transfer. Here, high&#8208;scan&#8208;rate, variable&#8208;temperature cyclic voltammetry, analyzed using the Marcus formalism and molecular dynamics simulations, reveals that the total free energy barrier of electron transfer consists of two additive elements: the reorganization energy of the partially desolvated redox marker and the energy cost for solvation changes of the redox marker at the solid/liquid interface. These results may have profound implications for our understanding of electron transfer and solvation effects in redox proteins, providing opportunities for better design of artificial photosynthetic systems, biosensing, and energy conversion devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinitrogen Splitting Without Barrier or Visible Light&#8208;Driven: Reactions of Vanadium Trimers and Dimers with Dinitrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of V atoms and small clusters with dinitrogen has been investigated by matrix&#8208;isolation in solid Ne and by complementary quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The experiments disclose striking differences between the reactivity of V atoms, dimers, and trimers towards dinitrogen. Whereas V atoms react only by formation of complexes, both V2 and V3 react by cleavage of the N2 triple&#8208;bond to form nitride clusters. Whereas V3 reacts immediately at the conditions of matrix&#8208;deposition, the reaction of V2 requires the activation by visible&#8208;light irradiation. There is evidence for two isomers of V2N2, a planar one with a 5Au electronic term and long V&#8722;V distance and a folded one with a 1A1 term and a short V&#8722;V distance. Furthermore, there are also complexes of V2 and V3 with N2 containing activated N2 units.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic switches of DNA glycosylase OGG1 catalyze a highly efficient AP&#8208;lyase function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>8&#8208;oxoGuanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) is the first known target of organocatalytic switches (ORCAs), which rewrite the biochemical function of the enzyme through redirection of its preferred substrate from 8&#8208;oxoG to AP sites. Previously, different ORCA chemotypes were shown to enhance the operational pH window for OGG1, possibly through direct involvement in proton transfer events during DNA strand cleavage. Accordingly, compound pKa is a crucial and necessary consideration for the identification and application of future OGG1 ORCAs. Here, we identify a minimal structure of organocatalytic switches &#8208; 4&#8208;anilino pyridines and 6&#8208;anilino pyrimidines &#8208; which are dimethyl&#8208;amino&#8208;pyridine (DMAP) type Br&#248;nsted bases binding the active site of OGG1. Systematic interrogation of compound basicity through modulation of electron&#8208;withdrawing (EWG) and electron&#8208;donating (EDG) substituents reveals that a pKa less or equal to the assay pH, is a viable parameter for prediction of compound activity. The lead structure (AC50 13 nM, pKa 7.0) was then identified as a potent scaffold from a screen in a patient&#8208;derived 3D model of metabolic dysfunction&#8208;associated steatohepatitis (MASH), where it reduced hepatic fibrosis by 35%. Collectively, these findings deepen the knowledge of this novel modulator class, with important implications for future enzyme targets and probe development.</dc:description>

         <title>Salt or cocrystal puzzle solved by mechanochemistry: the role of solvent in the pamoic acid case study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many drugs are nowadays marketed as salts. Cocrystallization is also emerging as a convenient tool to modify in vivo activity of pharmacologically active compounds. Given the marked difference in physicochemical properties between salts and cocrystals, the possibility of obtaining crystalline systems composed of the same building blocks in their neutral or charged form is desirable. Pamoic acid is widely used in pharmaceutical formulation as pamoate salt, and we here propose a unique synthetic strategy to obtain a cocrystal of pamoic acid rather than a salt by tuning mechanochemical conditions. Our findings have been corroborated by means of computational analyses, relating to&#160;the noncovalent interactions in the crystal structure with the formation of the different crystalline forms. A detailed analysis of the structure containing pamoic acid in its neutral, anionic or dianionic form present in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) helped generalizing our results.</dc:description>

         <title>Negative Cooperativity in the UHRF1 TTD&#8208;PHD Dual Domain Masks the Contributions of Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions Between Trimethyllysine and the TTD Aromatic Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the comparative interaction of the UHRF1 TTD or dual domain (TTD&#8208;PHD) with a histone 3 tail containing trimethyllysine, Kme3, or its neutral isostere. We show that the TTD alone binds K9me3 via electrostatically tunable cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, whereas with the TTD&#8208;PHD, binding of R2 to the PHD dominates, demonstrating negative cooperativity and masking the electrostatic tunability of K9me3 binding.








Abstract
UHRF1 is a promising epigenetic target in oncology, but inhibitor development has proven challenging due to the interplay between its tandem Tudor domain (TTD) and plant homeodomain (PHD). The TTD binds trimethyllysine (Kme3) at position 9 while the PHD binds Arg at position 2 on histone 3. Herein, we report how the PHD influences TTD recognition of the histone 3 tail containing Kme3 (H3K9me3) versus its neutral isostere, tert&#8208;butyl norleucine (tBuNle). Our findings show that the dual domain binds both peptides equally, supporting tBuNle's potential for inhibitor development. However, unexpectedly, the binding mechanism of H3K9me3 differs between the single and dual domains. In the TTD alone, Kme3 is bound in the aromatic cage via electrostatically tunable cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, but in the dual domain, Kme3 binding is independent of electrostatics in the aromatic cage&#8212;an unprecedented observation. Computational studies suggest cation&#8208;&#960; interactions should contribute in both cases. The contrasting experimental and computational results point to an unusual example of negative chelate cooperativity: interactions between the histone and PHD mask the mechanism of TTD recognition of K9me3. This work underscores the complexity of histone post&#8208;translational modification (PTM) readout in multi&#8208;domain proteins and demonstrates the first example of a masked cation&#8208;&#960; interaction.

         <dc:description>
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed, substrate&#8208;controlled, site&#8208;selective one&#8208;pot cascade reaction is reported for the synthesis of biologically active 4H&#8208;benzo[d][1,3]oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives. The method involves the three&#8208;component coupling of benzoxazinones, amines, and diaryl/dialkyl&#8208;substituted alkynes yielding the corresponding products with high efficiency. It also enables the synthesis of various dihydroisoquinoline benzamide derivatives with chemo&#8208;selectivity.








Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;assisted substrate&#8208;controlled, site&#8208;selective, one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component cascade dehydrogenative annulation reaction is reported here. The developed methodology leads to the synthesis of biologically active 4H&#8208;benzo[d] [1,3] oxazin&#8208;4&#8208;one derivatives by the nucleophilic addition of amines to benzoxazinones followed by coupling with diphenyl acetylenes. In addition to providing excellent yields of products, the method is also regioselective. This new protocol has been demonstrated to have an easy access to a variety of dihydroisoquinoline benzamide derivatives.

         <title>Synthesis and Electrochemistry of Copper(I) Complexes with Weakly Basic, Fluorinated, and Multicyclic Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weak Coordination, High Potentials: Making use of the weakly coordinated copper(I)&#8208;dinitrogen complex [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (RF&#160;=&#160;C(CF3)3) as a precursor, homoleptic Cu(I)&#8208;arene complexes with weakly basic (fluorinated) arene ligands were synthesized. The higher the degree of fluorination of the arenes, the weaker are their interaction with Cu(I) and the higher are their Cu+/Cu redox potentials reaching +1.5&#160;V versus Fc+/Fc in pentafluorobenzene.








Abstract
The dinitrogen complex [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (RF&#160;=&#160;C(CF3)3) acts as the precursor for the synthesis of homoleptic, weakly bound Cu(I)&#8208;arene complexes with benzene, fluorinated, and multicyclic arenes. Upon dissolution of [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] in benzene or the fluorinated arenes xFB (x&#160;=&#160;number of fluorine atoms, x&#160;=&#160;1&#8722;4), the complexes [Cu(C6H6)2&#8722;3]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;, [Cu(xFB)2&#8722;3]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (x&#160;=&#160;1&#8722;3), or the ion pair [(xFB)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (x&#160;=&#160;4) form. Both the benzene and fluorobenzene complexes are also available in larger scales by oxidation of elemental copper in the respective solvents using [NO]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; as an oxidant. A higher degree of fluorination of the arene ligand leads to a weaker coordination of the Cu(I) atom and thus to higher Cu+/Cu redox potentials in solution that reach an unprecedentedly high value of +1.5&#160;V (!) versus the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple in pentafluorobenzene. The versatile applicability of [(N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] as a &#8220;naked&#8221; Cu(I) source is demonstrated by complexation reactions with the multicyclic arenes anthracene and hexaphenylbenzene that yielded multiply charged cations. All complexes presented in this work were characterized by their single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction structures.

A Copper&#8208;catalyzed meta C&#9472;H olefination of pivanilides with &#946;&#8208;styrenyl and &#946;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;alkenyl iodonium salts was achieved using a weakly coordinated directing group (DG). The involvement of a Heck&#8208;like four&#8208;membered transition state was plausibly critical in ensuring the challenging meta selectivity.








Abstract
Herein, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;olefination of anilides using alkenyl iodonium salts. The olefination of a panel of pivanilides was achieved using an additive&#8208;free copper&#8208;based catalytic system under mild reaction conditions (25 examples, up to 60% yield). By favoring a Heck&#8208;like four&#8208;membered transition state, the approach demonstrated an excellent regioselectivity for the meta C&#9472;H functionalization with &#946;&#8208;styrenyl and &#946;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;alkenyl groups using a weakly coordinated directing group (DG). Postfunctionalization reactions were conducted, highlighting both the synthetic interest of the products and the potential atom&#8208;efficiency of the process.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydroazulene&#8208;spiropyran (DHA&#8208;SP) photochromic dyads were prepared and investigated by stationary and ultrafast spectroscopies. By comparing the overall properties, including dynamics of photoswitching, to those of monomeric units, the dyads satisfy the so&#8208;called &#8220;meta&#8208;rule&#8221;.

Multistate switches are interesting systems for a plethora of potential applications, such as for data storage involving many different states or for logic operations characterized by specific outputs. The main challenge is to achieve a precise control of accessibility to a specific state via a given sequence of multiple stimuli. Here, we have connected dihydroazulene (DHA) and spiropyran (SP) photoswitches in dyads to elucidate differences in optical and switching properties between ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged dyads. Dyads were prepared by Suzuki and Sonogashira coupling reactions and photoisomerizations studied in detail by stationary and ultrafast spectroscopies. Moreover, the kinetics of thermal back&#8208;reactions of meta&#8208;stable states were studied. The results show path&#8208;dependent switchings of the dyads using light in combination with other stimuli (acid/base/heat), allowing access to eight distinct states. The accessibility to some specific states via only one sequence of external stimuli provides an additional degree of data storage&#8212;information is not only stored as the state itself but also as the unique sequence of stimuli required to reach this state. By changing the bridging unit between the photoswitches, various properties (outputs) were finely tuned such as absorption and fluorescence behaviors, lifetime of meta&#8208;stable state, and photoisomerization dynamics.

&lt;p&gt;Dihydroazulene-spiropyran (DHA-SP) photochromic dyads were prepared and investigated by stationary and ultrafast spectroscopies. By comparing the overall properties, including dynamics of photoswitching, to those of monomeric units, the dyads satisfy the so-called &#8220;&lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-rule&#8221;. The dyads can reach eight different states, some only by a specific sequence of stimuli, here represented by a finite-state-machine diagram&#8212;this path-dependent switching adds an additional degree of data storage.

         <title>Bis(10&#8208;oxacorrole) with Fused Pyridine as a Linker: Synthesis, Structure, and Interaction between the Subunits in the Neutral, Mono&#8208;, and Dicationic States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of aromatic pyridine&#8208;fused bis(oxacorrole) nickel(II) complexes was obtained starting from antiaromatic norcorrolatonickel(II). Interaction between the subunits of the dimer allowed observation of four&#8208;step oxidation, giving rise to strong absorptions in the NIR region.








Abstract
Pyridine&#8208;fused bis(oxacorrole)s are obtained by a Hantzsch&#8208;type cyclization using arylaldehydes and 3&#8208;amino&#8208;10&#8208;oxacorrole. Spectroscopic characteristics, corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, indicate aromaticity of the dimer and strong interaction between the subunits. Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical analyses indicate facile access to cation radicals and dicationic species. The oxidized forms are characterized by electronic and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopies as well as by DFT calculations. Monocations give rise to strong absorption bands in the near infra&#8208;red (NIR) region between 1500 and 2500&#160;nm, while dications are characterized by a series of absorptions between 1000 and 2200&#160;nm. ESR and variable temperature (VT) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments indicate the presence of singlet&#8208;triplet spin equilibria for the solution of the dication. For the dication of bis(oxacorrole) in the singlet ground state, neither aromaticity nor antiaromaticity has been detected by low&#8208;temperature 1H NMR and gauge independent atomic orbital (GIAO) calculations despite delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons.

         <title>Supramolecular Nanochannels: Suprasome&#8208;Mediated Delivery of Ionophore to Regulate Transmembrane Zn2+&#160;Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed bis(vinylbenzimidazole)phenol derivatives that generate nanochannels within the lipid bilayers for the selective transmembrane transport of Zn2&#8314; ions. These transporters were delivered to bacterial cells using &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD)&#8208;based suprasome assemblies, activated by Zn2&#8314;&#8208;induced disassembly. The disruption in ionic homeostasis generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the death of Gram&#8208;positive Gram&#8208;negative and drug&#8208;resistant bacteria.








Abstract
The development of synthetic ion channels and stimuli&#8208;responsive suprasomes represents two crucial yet largely disconnected areas of supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we demonstrated that suprasomes can effectively deliver hydrophobic synthetic ion transporters to lipid membranes, regulating physiologically significant transition metal ions and subsequently modulating activity within lipid&#8208;bound compartments. We showed that a potent bis(vinylbenzimidazole)phenol derivative self&#8208;assembles within the lipid bilayer to form a supramolecular nanochannel, which facilitates selective and efficient transport of Zn2+ ions from the external aqueous solution across the lipid bilayer and into the internal solution of large unilamellar vesicles via an electrogenic pathway. The hydrophobic ion transporter could also be delivered to lipid bilayers due to its inherent ability to form suprasomal assembly with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) through dynamic host&#8211;guest interactions. The Zn2&#8314; ions serve as stimuli to disassemble the suprasomes and release the ion transporter, which further penetrates the bilayers of lipid vesicles and regulates transmembrane Zn2+ ion transport. The application of this strategy of stimuli&#8208;mediated delivery of synthetic ion transporters to regulate transmembrane Zn2+ ion transport showed antibacterial activities against Gram&#8208;positive, Gram&#8208;negative, and drug&#8208;resistant bacterial cells.

A visible light&#8211;driven [2+2+1] bicyclization of N&#8208;cyanamide alkenes and alkyl bromides, catalyzed by 3DPA2FBN and 2,6&#8208;lutidine and mediated by iminyl radicals, has been established. This metal&#8208;free, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical, eco&#8208;friendly method is performed under mild conditions, yielding a series of pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;b]pyridine derivatives.

Abstract
A visible light&#8211;promoted cascade [2+2+1] bicyclization reaction of N&#8208;cyanamide alkenes and activated alkyl bromides has been successfully established. This reaction exhibits mild conditions, metal&#8208;free characteristics, and excellent atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy, along with environmental friendliness. It demonstrates broad substrate tolerance and scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, underscoring its potential for practical applications. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through a photoinduced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) process and a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process mediated by an iminyl radical.

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Mononucleotide Coacervates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;responsive mononucleotide coacervates undergo reversible phase transitions via azobenzene photoisomerization. Coacervates with high&#8208;valency azobenzenes remain stable under UV light, while those with low&#8208;valency azobenzenes dissolve, enabling nucleotide release. This minimal system highlights the potential role of light for exploring energy&#8208;driven phase separation in de novo protocells.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) is central to the formation of biomolecular condensates in modern cells and is also explored as a mechanism for assembling protocells. Phase&#8208;separated droplets provide dynamic micro&#8208;environments that concentrate reactants, enhance reactions, and allow molecular exchange, essential for both cellular regulation, and adaptive compartmentalization. While modern cells achieve dynamic LLPS through enzymatic and metabolic pathways, protocells may be designed to harness external stimuli such as pH, temperature, redox potential, or light. However, existing studies of light&#8208;responsive coacervates rely on complex biomolecules, limiting their use as minimal platforms of energy&#8208;driven phase separation. Here, we develop a minimal system of light&#8208;responsive coacervates composed of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight species: mononucleotides and azobenzene&#8208;based amphiphiles with varying charge valency. These coacervates undergo reversible phase transitions through azobenzene photoisomerization, with their behavior governed by charge valency and nucleotide structure. We demonstrate that coacervates formed with high&#8208;valency azobenzenes remain stable under UV irradiation but exhibit significant property changes, while those with low&#8208;valency azobenzenes dissolve, enabling light&#8208;controlled nucleotide release. Additionally, we achieved hierarchical droplet organization and light&#8208;actuated biomolecular localization within multiphase systems. Overall, these findings establish a minimal platform for designing light&#8208;responsive synthetic protocells, providing insights into dynamic compartmentalization in de novo life&#8208;like systems.

Overall, these findings establish a minimal platform for designing light-responsive synthetic protocells, providing insights into dynamic compartmentalization in de novo life-like systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>S&#8208;Heterocyclic s&#8208;Indacenodifluorene: Synthesis, Properties, and Thermally Tunable Ambipolar Field&#8208;Effect Mobility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We unveiled the thermally tunable nature of charge carriers from p&#8208;type to balanced ambipolar to n&#8208;type charge transport for a heterocyclic s&#8208;indacenodifluorene derivative comprising antiaromatic S&#8208;heterocyclic as&#8208;indacene unit in the &#960;&#8208;backbone.








Abstract
Design of semiconducting materials with facile control of charge transport and the nature of charge carriers is essential for realizing niche applications with organic electronics. Described herein are the synthesis, crystal structure, and analysis of the electronic properties of a four&#8208;stage redox amphoteric S&#8208;heterocyclic s&#8208;indacenodifluorene 6, including the study of its ambipolar charge carrier mobility (&#181;h and &#181;e) in organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) devices. Despite being electron&#8208;rich, our investigation revealed reversible reduction potentials for 6 in the cyclic voltammetry, which is attributed to the recovery of locally aromatic thiophene and cyclopentadienyl anion units upon electron injection for the two antiaromatic S&#8208;heterocyclic as&#8208;indacene units in accordance with the Glidewell&#8208;Lloyd rule of aromaticity. In line with this, we observed an interesting thermal tunability of the nature of charge carriers from p&#8208;type to balanced ambipolar to n&#8208;type charge transport with reasonable semiconductor mobility in all regimes of transport. This behavior is correlated with the modification of the transport levels upon annealing of the semiconductor and possible increase in the extent of &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization with increasing temperature. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept tunability of the nature of charge transport indicates the efficacy of our molecular design.

         <title>Multi&#8208;site CuZn alloy boosts nitrate reduction to ammonia via optimized intermediate adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is an effective way to solve nitrate pollution and a promising strategy for ammonia (NH3) synthesis under the ambient temperature and pressure. However, NO3RR is still hindered by the lack of efficient catalysts and an understanding of mechanisms that enhance the catalytic performance. Herein, we propose intermetallic alloying as a promising strategy to optimize NO3RR reaction pathway by tuning the adsorption energies and configurations of intermediates, as demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations comparing NO3RR performance of Cu (111) and CuZn (110) surfaces. In CuZn alloy, the electron&#8208;donating property of Cu weakens the adsorption of NOx (x = 1, 2, and 3) intermediates, while the electron&#8208;accepting property of Zn strengthens the binding of NOxH intermediates, thus lowering the protonation reaction energy. Zn sites preferentially promote the removal of O species, while Cu sites dominate the protonation of N species. This synergistic effect enables CuZn (110) surface to successfully break the undesirable scaling relationship in traditional metal catalysts, resulting in excellent catalytic activity for NO3RR, with an ultra&#8208;low limiting potential of &#8722;0.28 V. This work provides valuable insights and theoretical guidance for NO3RR.</dc:description>

         <title>Differentiating Ligand Tailoring and Cation Incorporation as Strategies for Tuning Heterobimetallic Cerium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning of redox&#8208;active complexes featuring metals with high coordination numbers by incorporation of secondary redox&#8208;inactive cations has received far less attention than it deserves.&#160; Here, appending moderate steric bulk to a tripodal ligand framework has been tested for its influence on secondary&#8208;cation&#8208;driven structural and electrochemical tuning of cerium, a lanthanide that tends to adopt high coordination numbers. A quasi&#8208;C3&#8208;symmetric cerium(III) complex denoted [Ce] has been prepared that features pendant benzyloxy groups, and this work demonstrates that this species offers a site capable of binding of single Na+ or Ca2+ ions. Electrochemical and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopic studies reveal equilibrium binding affinity of [Ce] for Na+ in acetonitrile solvent, contrasting with tight binding of all cations in all other previously studied systems of this type. The modulated cation binding can be attributed to the bulky benzyloxy groups, which impact the thermodynamics of cation binding but do not impede formation of cerium centers with coordination number 8 upon binding of either Na+ or Ca2+. The Ce(IV/III) reduction potential was found to be tunable under the equilibrium binding conditions, highlighting the potentially significant role that controlled structural changes can play in modulating the solution properties of heterobimetallic complexes.</dc:description>

Recent developments in molecular design, self&#8208;assembly strategies, and applications of naphthalimides were discussed. This review offers insights into the utilization of naphthalimides&#8208;based materials for technological advancements.








Abstract
Naphthalimide&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled materials have gained significant attention in recent years because of their exceptional versatility and wide range of applications, from sensors and electronics to biomedical. Naphthalimides derivatives, with ease of functionalization and robust photophysical properties, became an ideal platform for creating highly ordered self&#8208;assembled architectures with tailored functionalities. This review provides an overall understanding of the recent developments in the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly of naphthalimide&#8208;based materials, focusing on how self&#8208;assembly enhances their performance in various applications. The review examines the role of self&#8208;assembly in improving these materials&#8217; optical, mechanical, and electronic properties, highlighting their use in sensors for detecting gases, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and amines. Furthermore, the integration of self&#8208;assembled naphthalimides in light&#8208;emitting devices, energy&#8208;harvesting systems, and fluorescence&#8208;based imaging demonstrates their potential in both electronic and biological applications. By analyzing recent developments in molecular design, self&#8208;assembly strategies, and applications, this review aims to offer insights into how these materials can be optimized for future technological advancements.

         <title>A Reversible Nitroamino&#8208;Based Switch Modulates Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks in Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising nitroamino&#8208;based switch has been introduced into energetic compounds that can effectively coordinate twin crystals induced by hydrogen&#8208;bonding competition, thereby leading to explosives with excellent overall performance as a result of constrained planarity. This nitroamino&#8208;based switching is also expected to have applications in hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#160;self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
The regulation of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks in molecular switches is critical for adaptive materials. However, most of the reported molecular switches are not capable of modulating hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks in energetic materials, limiting high&#8208;demand applications in explosives. In this work, the first high&#8208;energy nitroamino&#8208;based molecular switch is reported. It can control the complex hydrogen&#8208;bonding systems of energetic materials by reversible cycling for property modulation. Through alkali&#8208;acid stimulation, the nitroamino&#8208;based switch undergoes dynamic transitions, which reconfigure H&#8208;bond networks and separate twin crystals (in x&#8208;ray verification). Supported by crystallography and theoretical modeling (e.g., the density of states), this switching mechanism modulates molecular planarity (&#916;&#952;&#160;&gt;&#160;60&#176;) and optimizes the energy&#8208;stability balance, obtaining a compound 6&#8208;&#946; with comprehensive properties comparable to classical explosives (e.g., RDX and HMX). By linking hydrogen&#8208;bonding engineering and energetic materials science through the nitroamino&#8208;based molecular switch, it facilitates superior energetic compounds that can be applied to defense equipment. In addition, our work establishes the nitroamino&#8208;based switch as a generalized tool for molecular engineering, bridging dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding control and self&#8208;assembly materials design.

         <title>Exploiting a New Strategy to Prepare Water&#8208;Soluble Heteroleptic Iridium(III) Complexes to Control Electrochemiluminescence Reaction Pathways in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble luminophores prepared by sulfonation of heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes enable judicious tailoring of properties for unprecedented control of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction pathways in aqueous solution. This approach removes a longstanding barrier to the translation of high&#8208;efficiency and multicolored ECL systems developed in organic solvents to the aqueous conditions desired for many analytical applications.








Abstract
The direct derivatization of heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes with sulfonate groups removes the limitations of prior strategies for the preparation of water&#8208;soluble analogues, in which complexes were prepared from a narrow range of ligands with suitably polar or charged functional groups. Phenylpyridine, phenylpyrazole, and phenylbenzothiazole ligands were selectively sulfonated opposite to their cyclometalated carbon within iridium(III) complexes containing bipyridine or N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ancillary ligands. Altering reaction conditions enabled additional sulfonation of the benzothiazole fragments. Informed by the electrochemical and photophysical properties of the parent complexes in organic solvents, we adopted this strategy to design six novel luminophores that proceeded through three different sets of coreactant electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reaction pathways under aqueous conditions. The intensity of the indirect coreactant ECL of one of the iridium(III) luminophores was enhanced by over an order of magnitude by introducing a redox mediator, extending this promising analytical approach beyond the conventional [Ru(bpy)3]2+ electrochemiluminophore.

         <title>Simple Large&#8208;Scale Preparation of Carbon Dot Composites with High Luminescent Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study describes the large&#8208;scale preparation of carbon dot composites. These composites have high deep blue fluorescence quantum yield and long green phosphorescence which can be used as deep blue LEDs and advanced digital encryption. Meanwhile, the formation mechanism of the structures of the composites are proposed.








Abstract
At present, the demand for high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective luminescent materials has increasingly grown and carbon dots (CDs) stand out due to their distinctive advantages. However, their preparation and purification process are too complex to commercialize. Issues such as fluorescence quenching, low quantum yield of short&#8208;wavelength emission, and short room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence lifetimes still need to be addressed. Here, we successfully prepared CD composites on a large scale for the applications of deep&#8208;blue LEDs and phosphorescent encryption through the combination of several easy, controllable, and repeatable strategies. Their luminescent properties are similar to the precursor and the luminescent performance are more excellent, achieving a fluorescence quantum yield of 65.46% and a phosphorescence lifetime of 1489.2&#160;ms. Through various characterizations, it was found that ammonia, polar groups, and urea content affect the whole crystallization process of matrix. We put forward that surface free energy leads to different morphologies and the special structure of the composites which provide new ideas for the subsequent developments, explain about reaction process between CDs and matrix. The success of the scale&#8208;up experiment demonstrates the potential for large&#8208;scale preparation of this scheme, thereby inspiring future large&#8208;scale production of solid CDs.

         <title>Molecular Hybrid Photocatalysts for CO2 Photoreduction by Hybridization of Molecular Catalysts and Photoactive Covalent Organic Frameworks &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews the hybridization and immobilization strategies of molecular catalysts for CO2 photoreduction on semiconducting covalent organic frameworks, in the absence of additional photosensitizers. The ligand scaffolds of the molecular catalytic motifs involving porphyrin, (poly)pyridine, and salen structures have been discussed for covalent or non&#8208;covalently immobilized examples. Last, future challenges and opportunities are discussed and summarized.








Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to obtain storable fuels is an effective way to fix and utilize greenhouse gas CO2, ultimately achieving a carbon&#8208;free energy cycle. The core of this goal lies the development of efficient, sustainable, and economically practical catalysts and light absorbers. Currently, hybrid photocatalytic systems that immobilize molecular catalysts on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are of intensified interest, as this strategy enables the simultaneous exploitation of the catalytic properties of high&#8208;performance molecular catalysts, together with the durability of heterogeneous semiconductors, based on the readily available synthetic tunability of both components. This review focuses on the significant progress and challenges that have been overcome for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, mediated by COFs hybridized with molecular catalysts, aiming to provide strong guidance for innovative utilization towards sustainable photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the future.

         <title>Efficient Access of Heterocycles Utilizing Inherent Carbodicationic Reactivity of Ynone via Lewis Acid Catalysed C&#8208;C Triple bond Cleavage.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divalent carbodicationic synthon has attracted significant attention due to its unique reactivity and bonding. The application of this synthon in synthetic settings is still fancy owing to its super&#8208;electrophilicity. Generation of this reactive intermediate in a catalytic fashion is challenging. For the first time, the reactivity of divalent dication has been realised&#160;via&#160;Lewis acid&#8208;catalysed heterolytic ionisation of ynone via sequential conjugate addition to ynone followed by C&#8208;C bond cleavage to afford heteroarenes. A library of quinazolinones and 2&#8208;substituted quinazolinones have been synthesised with good to excellent yields, having a wide range of functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope using 2&#8208;amino benzamides as a nucleophilic partner. Furthermore, 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes afforded the corresponding benzimidazole in synthetically good yield. The generality of this strategy has been demonstrated by the successful synthesis of 6&#8208;mono&#160;and 2,6&#8208;di&#160;substituted quinazolinones and 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted quinazoline with very high efficiency. The mechanistic study confirmed the role of the cooperative effect and secondary orbital interaction in grob&#8208;type fragmentation and not the involvement of any radical intermediate in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>A Copper(I) Catenane Decorated Metal&#8208;Organic Layer as a Heterogenous Catalyst for Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported in this work is a metal&#8208;organic layer decorated with a 2D array of catalytically active Cu(I) catenanes for dehydrogenative C&#9472;O coupling. Kinetic stabilization effects from the interlocked ligands not only preserve the structural integrity of the molecular Cu(I) catalyst for a straightforward attachment onto the solid support, but also maintain the metal in a well&#8208;defined coordination sphere and prevent its undesired oxidation to Cu(II) to give a side product from C&#9472;C coupling.








Abstract
While earth&#8208;abundant metals are green and sustainable alternatives to precious metals for catalytic chemical conversions, the fast ligand exchange involving most of the base metals renders their development into robust, reusable catalysts very challenging. Described in this work is a new type of heterogeneous catalyst derived from a 2D metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) grafted with catenane&#8208;coordinated Cu(I) complexes. In addition to the good substrate accessibility, easy functionalization, and other favorable features due to the MOL support, the mechanical bond in the anchored catenane ligands also represents a new mechanism to dynamically confine the coordination environment and kinetically stabilize the coordinated Cu(I) to give a well&#8208;defined, active yet stable heterogeneous catalyst. Pilot catalytic studies using a model dehydrogenative C&#9472;O cross&#8208;coupling reaction showed that the Cu(I) catenane&#8208;grafted MOL led to exclusive formation of the C&#9472;O coupled product, whereas control catalysis using a similar Cu(I) catalyst supported by non&#8208;interlocked macrocyclic ligands was found to also give a C&#9472;C coupled by&#8208;product, whose formation was found to be mediated by the uncontrolled oxidation of the Cu(I) to Cu(II), highlighting the distinctive roles and untapped potential of the catenane coordination in developing base metal&#8208;derived catalysts for challenging catalytic conditions.

         <title>Strategies for the Synthesis of Mechanically Planar Chiral Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a systematic overview of the synthetic strategies for mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. It covers chiral separation techniques, the utilization of chiral auxiliaries, and asymmetric catalysis, highlighting their versatility in constructing such rotaxanes. Furthermore, the review discusses the applications and future development prospects of mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes.








Abstract
Rotaxanes, belonging to the class of classical mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), exhibit chiral properties that diverge from those of traditional chiral elements, particularly displaying mechanically planar chirality. Their distinctive spatial structure further augments their chiral significance, thereby imparting them with vast potential for applications in the realm of chiral materials and asymmetric catalysis. In recent years, mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes have garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this review, we summarize the recent advancements in obtaining enantiopure mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. In this regard, chiral separation techniques, the use of chiral auxiliaries, and asymmetric catalytic synthesis have emerged as potent methodologies for constructing chiral rotaxanes, thereby enabling the synthesis of diverse types of mechanically planar chiral rotaxanes. Additionally, we analyze the current challenges faced in this field and look forward to the future development opportunities that lie ahead.

         <title>C3&#8208;symmetric Triple Thia/Sulfone[6]Helicene with Dual Emissions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel triple thia/sulfone[6]helicenes with C3 symmetry are synthesized via Scholl reaction and sulfonation. Their helical structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis. The sulfonation strategy can significantly improve fluorescence quantum yield of thia[6]helicenes. BTT[6]H exhibits unique dual emissions phenomenon circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP), due to the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) caused by small energy gap between the lowest excited singlet state (S1) and T5,6 and strong spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC).

         <title>Total Synthesis of Kanamycins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports on creating a novel synthetic route of kanamycins A and B using the desymmetric boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) reaction of meso&#8208;diol acceptor with 1,2&#8208;anhydro donor and regio&#8208; and stereoselective glycosylation of diol acceptor with trichloroacetimidate donor for introduction of a set of challenging 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages as key steps.








Abstract
Structurally modified aminoglycosides, such as kanamycin, have shown promise as antibiotics and premature termination codon read&#8208;through drugs to fight against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and to treat genetic diseases, respectively. Therefore, research on developing and discovering aminoglycoside antibiotics has recently increased. However, synthetic strategies for controllably positioning the two 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycoside moieties on the symmetrical structure of kanamycin have not yet been established. Herein, we report on a novel route for the total synthesis of kanamycins A and B via regio&#8208; and stereoselective introduction of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages as the key step. We successfully synthesized &#945;(1,6)&#8208;linked glycoside using a 1,2&#8208;anhydro donor and 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;myo&#8208;inositol 1,3,5&#8208;orthoformate acceptor in the presence of a boronic acid catalyst via desymmetric boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery. In addition, we also synthesized &#945;(1,4)&#8208;linked glycoside using its corresponding trichloroacetimidate donor.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Cyanoborate&#8208;Bridged Cubane&#8208;Type Tetranuclear Ru Complex: Synthesis, Pseudopolymorphism, and Coordination Polymer Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal engineering of a cyanoborate&#8208;based cubane complex. A cubane&#8208;type tetranuclear Ru cage complex bridged by the B(CN)&#8324;&#8315; anion was synthesized via a simple photochemical reaction and yielded various pseudopolymorphs upon recrystallization. This complex was subsequently employed as a building block for the formation of coordination polymers.








Abstract
Cyanoborate anions are versatile bridging ligands that lead to structurally diverse compounds from a crystal engineering perspective. Herein, we report the synthesis of a cubane&#8208;type tetranuclear Ru complex, [Ru4(Cp)4{B(CN)4}4] (1, Cp = C5H5),&#160;obtained by photoirradiation of [Ru(Cp)(C6H6)]B(CN)4 in solution or by the reaction of [CpRu(MeCN)3]+ with KB(CN)4. This complex served as a host for various solvents, generating different pseudopolymorphs, including 1&#183;nCH2Cl2 (n = 1, 2, 3), 1&#183;0.5C6H6, 1&#183;C6H5Me, and 1&#183;3THF upon recrystallization. Moreover, the four free cyano groups in 1 allow it to act as a bridging ligand, facilitating the formation of 1D and 2D coordination polymers through reactions with transition metal complexes.

         <title>Recent Advances in MOF&#8722;Based Dual&#8722;Atom Catalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an overview of recent advancements in MOF&#8722;based dual&#8722;atom catalysts (DACs) for CO2 reduction. It covers strategies for designing MOF&#8722;DACs, their role in photocatalytic and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, and the influence of dual&#8722;metal synergistic catalysis on catalytic performance for sustainable energy conversion.








Abstract
In recent years, the development of efficient catalysts for photo&#8722;/electro&#8722;catalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has become a major research focus due to growing environmental concerns and energy demands. Dual&#8722;atom catalysts (DACs), composed of two metal atoms with suitable metal&#8722;metal distance integrated into the supports, have shown great promise in enhancing catalytic performance via the dual&#8722;metal synergistic catalysis (DMSC) effect. This review highlights the advancements in Metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)&#8722;based DACs, which combine the high atomic efficiency of DACs with tunable and defined structures and high metal loadings. In this review, we summarized the recent developments on the synthesis strategies of MOF&#8722;based DACs and their applications in CO2RR, focusing on the role of DMSC effect in improving catalytic activity, stability, and selectivity. Additionally, we also discuss the influence of the local electronic structure, coordination environment, and metal atom interactions on catalytic performance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of MOF&#8722;based DACs and offers insights into their future potential in sustainable energy conversion.

         <title>Synthesis of C4&#8208;Acyl Glycosides by Cross&#8208;Ketonization: The Importance of Precise Temperature Control in Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of reversed C&#8208;glycosides from carboxylic acid building blocks is enabled by metallaphotoredox cross&#8208;ketonization. Precise temperature control is essential for matching the rates of the photoredox and Ni catalytic processes, an understudied factor in photoredox chemistry that could be critical in the study of other dual&#8208;catalytic photoredox systems.








Abstract
We describe herein a method for the synthesis of reversed C&#8208;acyl glycosides by direct cross&#8208;ketonization of linear carboxylic acids with carboxy sugars under metallaphotoredox conditions. This reaction proves to be highly sensitive to reaction temperature, with the reproducibility and yield of ketonization highly dependent upon precise temperature control. Analysis of the reaction mechanism suggests this sensitivity reflects the need to match the rate of Ni catalytic turnover with the rate of photocatalytic decarboxylation of the carboxy sugar. The insights gained from this study have important implications for the study of all metallaphotoredox reactions as well as other photoreactions that involve dual catalytic cycles.

         <title>Litchi&#8208;skin&#8208;like NiMoP2 microspheres supported on MOF&#8208;derived carbon layer as high performance composite positive electrode of asymmetric supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing ideal positive electrodes with excellent performance and structural stability for supercapacitors is crucial in enhancing the application potential. Herein, we successfully fabricate a composite structure of NiMoP2@C on nickel foam (NMP@C/NF), which is formed by loading a litchi&#8208;skin&#8208;like morphology NiMoP2 microspheres onto MOF&#8208;derived carbon layer with the two&#8208;step electrodeposition method. The carbon layer acts as a structurally stable framework, and its synergistic effect with active materials suppresses volume expansion while enhancing electron transport efficiency. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous interface between crystalline/amorphous phases optimizes redox reaction kinetics, and the unique morphology composed of multi&#8208;scale components increases the accessible surface area for redox reactions. As a result, the NMP@C/NF obtains a high specific capacitance of 2224.8 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention rate is 94.97% after 8000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with NMP@C/NF positive electrode and active carbon negative electrode generates an energy density of 52.52 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 784.55 W kg&#8722;1, and its capacitance retention rate reaches up to 78% after 8000 cycles. This study provides promising pathway for the rational design of high&#8208;performance and environmentally friendly positive electrodes for supercapacitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Studies on Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Tabercarpamines and Voacangine&#8208;Type Indole Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The proposed post&#8208;iboga natural products, (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I, along with their corresponding C20 stereoisomers and C10&#8208;methoxy&#8208;regioisomers were synthesized. An extensive NMR spectroscopic study showed that the spectral data of these synthetic compounds were not consistent with the proposed (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I in isolation report, indicating that the proposed structures were misassigned. Subsequently, from the advanced intermediates for the synthesis of the proposed (+)&#8208;tabercarpamines G and I, the unified enantioselective syntheses of six iboga&#8210;type natural products including (&#8208;)&#8208;isovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;voacangine, (&#8208;)&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;isovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;voacangine, and (&#8208;)&#8208;(3S)&#8208;cyanoisovoacangine and (&#8208;)&#8208;(3S)&#8208;cyanovoacangine were accomplished via a divergent manner. The synthetic route provided the first catalytic asymmetric approach to access these three types of iboga&#8210;type natural products and achieved the first enantioselective syntheses of (3S)&#8208;cyano(iso)voacangines. Our synthesis hinged on a catalytic asymmetric Michael/aldol reaction for the construction of chiral aza&#8208;[3.3.1]&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework at the early stage and a ring reorganization process from [3.3.1]&#8208; to [2.2.2]&#8208;bicyclic ring system&#8213;a pathway opposite to the proposed biogenic synthesis&#8213;at the late stage.</dc:description>

         <title>Amination of 1&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;Bromoanthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;Sulfonic Acid Enabled by Alternating Current Electrolysis of Symmetrical Copper Electrodes</title>

         <dc:description>Amination of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;bromoanthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (BAA), crucial for anthraquinone&#8208;type dyes production, relies on Cu+ catalysis. However, Cu+ disproportionation causes catalyst deactivation, requiring large amounts of Cu catalysts (e.g., CuSO4 or CuCl) and reductants (e.g., FeSO4), introducing heavy metals and increasing water consumption to remove byproducts and metals, raising both environmental and economic costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a groundbreaking strategy for the in&#8208;situ generation of Cu+ using symmetrical Cu electrodes under alternating current (AC) electrolysis. This method achieves 100% conversion of BAA in the amination with 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene sulfonic acid (M Acid) with 95% yield, while also providing a solution to the issue of Cu+ disproportionation without the need for any additional copper catalysts or reductants, demonstrating a broad substrate scope and significantly reducing water usage in post&#8208;treatment. Characterization techniques, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reveal that the passive Cu2O film formed on the symmetrical Cu electrodes under AC electrolysis continuously generates Cu+, which is crucial for the reaction. This approach is scalable, environmentally friendly, and holds great potential for industrial applications, offering substantial economic benefits while reducing environmental impact.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric Differentiation of Al(I) Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimeric potassium alumanyl reacts with phenyl&#8208;substituted alkynes to provide not only alkyne cycloaddition but also para&#8208;C&#8211;H activation of the phenyl substituent. Supported by a theoretical study, this outcome is judged to arise from a sequence of cooperative steps and a mode of kinetic discrimination that is suggested to be allosteric in origin.








Abstract
The dimeric potassium alumanyl, [{SiNDipp}AlK]2 ({SiNDipp} = {CH2SiMe2N(Dipp)}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3), reacts with two equivalents of PhC&#8801;CR (R = Ph or SiMe3) with the exclusive formation of the aluminacyclopropene derivatives, [{SiNDipp}Al{&#951;2&#8208;C2(R1)(R2)}]. In contrast, reactions with an equal stoichiometry of both alumanyl and alkyne reagents provide the products of not only alkyne cycloaddition but also para&#8208;C&#8211;H activation of a phenyl substituent. Supported by a theoretical study, this outcome is judged to result from a sequence of cooperative steps and the introduction of a modicum of kinetic discrimination that is suggested to be allosteric in origin.

         <title>Influence of Polymeric Dispersants on the Dissolution Rate of Tricalcium Silicate and the Nucleation of Calcium&#8208;Silicate&#8208;Hydrate and Portlandite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comb&#8208;copolymers with anionic functional groups and poly(ethylene glycol) side chains are concrete dispersants. However, they retard the hydration of the main Portland cement phase Ca3SiO5${\rm Ca}_{3}{\rm S}{\rm iO}_{5}$. Herein, we report on their influence on the dissolution rate of Ca3SiO5${\rm Ca}_{3}{\rm S}{\rm iO}_{5}$ and their nucleation&#8208;inhibiting effect on calcium&#8208;silicate&#8208;hydrate and calcium hydroxide. For phosphate and carboxylate groups, higher charge densities lead to stronger nucleation&#160;inhibition.

Polycarboxylate ether (PCE) and polyphosphate ether (PPE) dispersants (also known as superplasticizers) are indispensable components of modern concrete mix designs. They reduce the yield stress of cement suspensions and thereby facilitate the reduction of the water&#8208;to&#8208;cement ratio. However, PCEs and PPEs also cause retardation of the cement hydration as a secondary effect, which causes delayed concrete strength development. It is proposed that the retardation is caused by the polymer influence on the tricalcium silicate dissolution rate and the crystallization of the hydration products (e.g., calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2$_2$ and calcium&#8208;silicate&#8208;hydrate 1.7CaO&#183;SiO2&#183;4H2O$1.7\mathrm{CaO}\cdot {\mathrm{SiO}}_{2}\cdot 4{\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ or C&#8208;S&#8208;H). This study examines the effect of four different polymeric superplasticizers with carboxylate and phosphate groups on the reaction kinetics of the pure cement phase tricalcium silicate (in cement shorthand C3S${\rm C}_{3}{\rm S}$). Our results confirm the strong retarding effect of the polymers on the hydration reaction of the C3S${\rm C}_{3}{\rm S}$ paste. Based on model experiments, we studied the polymer influence on the dissolution of C3S${\rm C}_{3}{\rm S}$ and the nucleation of the hydration products. We observed no C3S${\rm C}_{3}{\rm S}$ dissolution&#8208;inhibiting effect of the polymers at the chosen concentrations and undersaturation. However, such an inhibiting effect may occur at solution conditions closer to the saturation limit. Titrimetric analyses indicate that all polymers suppress the nucleation of portlandite and C&#8208;S&#8208;H, with a higher polymer charge density leading to a more pronounced&#160;inhibition.

&lt;p&gt;Comb-copolymers with anionic functional groups and poly(ethylene glycol) side chains are concrete dispersants. However, they retard the hydration of the main Portland cement phase Ca3SiO5${\rm Ca}_{3}{\rm S}{\rm iO}_{5}$. Herein, we report on their influence on the dissolution rate of Ca3SiO5${\rm Ca}_{3}{\rm S}{\rm iO}_{5}$ and their nucleation-inhibiting effect on calcium-silicate-hydrate and calcium hydroxide. For phosphate and carboxylate groups, higher charge densities lead to stronger nucleation&#160;inhibition.

         <title>Spatial Confinement of Pd Nanoclusters in Pyrene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COFs rich in N and S sites were utilized to anchor Pd ions and grow in situ into Pd nanoclusters. This enabled the IEF enhancement to drive the directional migration of photogenerated electrons and promote carrier separation. Meanwhile, the introduced Pd NCs act as active sites for CO2 adsorption and activation, realizing the efficiency enhancement of CO2 conversion to CO under visible light.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction offers a promising strategy to mitigate the greenhouse effect, yet it remains a challenging process due to the high energy barrier associated with the high stability of CO2. In this study, we synthesized Py&#8208;bTDC, a pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) enriched with nitrogen and sulfur atoms, and anchored palladium nanoclusters (Pd NCs) onto its structure to enhance CO2 reduction efficiency. The confined Pd NCs amplify the built&#8208;in electric field (IEF), enabling efficient photogenerated carrier migration and suppressing electron&#8208;hole recombination. Simultaneously, Pd NCs serve as catalytic active sites, optimizing CO2 adsorption and activation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Pd reduces the energy barrier for forming the critical intermediate (*COOH), thereby accelerating CO production. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation in a gas&#8208;solid system using water as a proton donor, the Pd3/Py&#8208;bTDC composite achieved a CO evolution rate of 17.75 &#181;mol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1 with 86.0% selectivity. This study advances the design of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts by synergistically modulating IEF and the engineering active sites for efficient CO2 reduction.

         <title>Specific Quenching of Natural Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Emission Probes for Rapid Fluorescent Detection of Antipsychotics</title>

Natural bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a fluorescent probe with clusterization&#8208;triggered emission (CTE) for detecting chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ) and perphenazine (PPZ) by static fluorescence quenching.

Abstract
The development of rapid, cost&#8208;effective fluorescent probes for antipsychotic drug detection remains challenging due to the synthetic complexity of conventional probes and limited exploration of natural alternatives. Herein, we pioneered bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a natural clusterization&#8208;triggered emission (CTE) probe for one&#8208;step detection of chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ) and perphenazine (PPZ). The unique CTE property of BSA displayed concentration&#8208;dependent quenching with CPZ and PPZ. Moreover, the quenching effect achieved balance within 5&#160;minutes and maintained stability for more than 30&#160;minutes. Based on these advantages, the proposed detection platform showed rapid response, operational simplicity, visual signal readout, wide detection range, ultra&#8208;low detection limits, compared with other methods. Moreover, the assay method exhibited excellent selectivity, facilitating satisfactory reliability for the real sample assay. Thermodynamic analyses revealed distinct interaction mechanisms between BSA and antipsychotics, both inducing static quenching by suppressing clusterization&#8208;induced electron transitions. Overall, this research not only develops a novel assay method for CPZ and PPZ, but also broadens the application potential of the CTE effect in natural biomacromolecules. As the first demonstration of natural CTE probes for antipsychotic detection, this work opens new frontiers for sustainable analytical technologies by circumventing synthetic probe complexities and leveraging inherent biorecognition.

In this study, we report the first synthesis of Lewis&#8208;X&#8208;containing triterpenoid saponins featuring betulinic acid and echinocystic acid as aglycones. These saponins were stereoselectively and efficiently synthesized in six linear steps using a convergent approach that leveraged thioglycoside and trichloroacetimidate glycosylation chemistries.

         <title>Influence of Protonation and Iron(II) Complexation on Magnetic Interactions in Spin&#8208;Labeled Mechanically Interlocked Molecules</title>

         <dc:description>
The study investigates the influence of protonation and Fe(II) complexation on exchange coupling and magnetic properties in a [2]&#8208;rotaxane and its free&#8208;axle biradicals. Mechanical bonding markedly modifies magnetic interactions, highlighting its potential for enabling the design of interlocked molecules with tunable spin states for advanced applications in molecular electronics and spintronics.








Abstract
This study reports the effects of protonation and Fe(II) complexation on the exchange coupling and magnetic properties of a [2]&#8208;rotaxane and its corresponding free&#8208;axle biradicals. The rotaxane features nitronyl&#8208;nitroxide units as bulky stopper groups, a triazole&#8208;pyridine&#8208;triazole ligand as the axle component, and a bipyridine moiety within the macrocyclic ring. Our findings, obtained by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy in solution and magnetometry in solid state, demonstrate that rotaxanation and protonation induce profound changes in the magnetic interactions of the biradical both in its free form and as complexed with Fe(II). These results highlight the transformative impact of the mechanical bond on the electronic structure of interlocked radical systems.

         <title>Unlocking Thermodynamic Enolate for Kinetically Controlled Desymmetrizing Vinylogous (4+1) Carbospiroannulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective (4+1) carbospiroannulation is catalyzed by an l&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine dipeptide thiourea catalyst, which efficiently constructs chiral [4,4]nonane frameworks with exceptional stereocontrol. The reaction is effective on a wide variety of substrates, resulting in high yields. DFT studies offer critical mechanistic insights, while additional transformations demonstrate the synthetic potential of the products.








Abstract
An unprecedented thermodynamically unfavorable (4+1) deysmmetrizing spiroannulation through a thermodynamic enolate intermediate, enabling a single&#8208;step synthesis of ubiquitous scaffolds such as all&#8208;carbon chiral spirocycles, is disclosed. In this spiroannulation, we present a vinylogous organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing (4+1) cycloaddition approach involving alkylidene malononitrile and cyclopent&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienone. This carbospiroannulation method produces functionally enriched spiro[4,4]nonane structures with three stereocenters, has presented good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Detailed DFT calculations reveal an intriguing reaction mechanism, which validates our observations.

         <title>Understanding the Properties of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Substituted Boron Difluoride 3&#8208;Cyanoformazanate Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron difluoride 3&#8208;cyanoformazanate dyes are easily synthesized and offer far red to near&#8208;IR emission properties despite their relatively simple structure. This work focuses on understanding these unexpected properties and shows that the electron poor boron difluoride formazanate core leads to these dyes operating outside of the traditional understanding of electronic structure augmentation upon substitution with donor and acceptor substituents.








Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated materials offer attractive traits including semiconductivity, low&#8208;energy light absorption/photoluminescence, and solution processability that render them ubiquitous within the organic electronics field. Among many strategies for property tuning, the creation of asymmetric electronic structures through the installation of donor and acceptor substituents commonly results in low&#8208;energy absorption/photoluminescence bands. Boron difluoride formazanate dyes are readily synthesized, can be asymmetrically substituted with donor and acceptor groups, and have unexpectedly low&#8208;energy absorption/photoluminescence bands that extend into the near&#8208;infrared. In this study, we prepared a series of donor&#8208;acceptor substituted boron difluoride 3&#8208;cyanoformazanate dyes and compared their properties to symmetric analogues. Our findings suggest that donor&#8208;acceptor derivatives are highly delocalized with properties intermediate of their symmetric counterparts. Furthermore, the data obtained suggest that the N&#8208;aryl substituents act as donors to the strongly accepting boron difluoride formazanate core, regardless of the functional groups appended to them. These properties were reproduced computationally, and while the frontier orbitals calculated for donor&#8208;acceptor dyes were modestly asymmetric, there was no evidence of charge&#8208;transfer character. This work provides significant insight into the unexpected properties of boron difluoride formazanates and reveals that their strongly accepting nature circumvents the predicted augmentation of electronic structure commonly observed for donor&#8208;accepter substituted dyes.

         <title>High&#8208;Valent Nickel Complexes Supported by a Functionalized PC(sp3)P Pincer Ligand: Properties and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of interconvertible high&#8208;valent nickel complexes supported by a rigid pincer ligand is described. The nickel center exhibits remarkable stability and predictable coordination in oxidation states +2, +3, and +4. Notably, the Ni(III) complex functions as an efficient and selective catalyst for the hydrosilylation of alkenes.








Abstract
This article presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of robust high&#8208;valent organometallic nickel (Ni) complexes stabilized by a functionalized PC(sp3)P pincer ligand. Notably, the nickel center, covalently confined within the 3D ligand framework, demonstrates predictable coordination and redox behavior, coupled with remarkable stability across oxidation states +2, +3, and +4. These states were found to interconvert via one&#8208;electron transfer reactions. Among these complexes, the Ni(III)&#8208;PC(sp3)P species was identified as an efficient catalyst for the mild and selective hydrosilylation of alkenes, operating through a nonoxidative reaction mechanism.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Lactam Ylidenes: an Overlooked Class of N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, the underappreciated class of &#946;&#8208;lactam carbenes (BLCs) is revisited and systematically explored. The required precursors are available in a highly modular synthetic approach from simple starting materials. Two routes may be followed for the generation of the free BLCs: thermal fragmentation of spiro&#8208;fused oxadiazoles (110 &#176;C, toluene), or deprotonation of carbene HCl&#8208;adducts at &#8208;80 &#176;C with a strong base. TEP values (2065&#8208;2072 cm&#8208;1), 77Se NMR shifts of selenium&#8208;adducts (812&#8208;995 ppm) as well as DFT calculations reveal moderate &#963;&#8208;donor and strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of BLCs, leading to a pronounced ambiphilic reactivity. The formation of a wide variety of products under thermal conditions in the cause of oxadiazole fragmentation (110 &#176;C, toluene) is rationalized by a combination of computational reaction discovery and experimental validation. Products include olefinic dimers as well as unprecedented N2&#8208;bridged dimers arising from bimolecular reactions, while sterically more demanding precursors are converted in a monomolecular fragmentation reaction via CO release to form ketenimines as intermediates, which finally form amides. With substituents providing appropriate steric protection, a persistent BLC is available via the low temperature route, characterized by its 13C NMR shift of 287 ppm at &#8208;20 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>A Very Readily Prepared Ligand for Rhodium Catalysed Propene Hydroformylation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for an easy&#8208;to&#8208;make ligand that would lead to Rh catalysts that give very rare preferential formation of&#160;iso&#8208;butanal from propene hydroformylation,&#160;bis&#8208;phosphonites and&#160;bis&#8208;phosphoramidites were designed. Catalysts derived from&#160;bis&#8208;phosphonites gave the desired low&#160;n:isoratios, but were unstable to hydrolysis.&#160;A&#160;bis&#8208;phosphoramidite ligand (EasyDiPhos) that can be made in just one synthetic step has been discovered that enables Rh&#8208;catalysed hydroformylations to proceed with unusually low&#160;n:iso&#160;ratios. They were also found to have significant stability to moisture, air, and to relatively high temperatures during hydroformylation conditions. The latter was studied using a combination of High&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Infra&#8208;Red spectroscopy and NMR analysis of the catalyst resting state after 1 week under relevant conditions. Propene hydroformylation with&#160;n:iso&#160;ratios well below 1 was carried out and with turnover numbers around 1000 mol/mol in one hour reaction time. One of the ligands, whilst not being the most&#160;iso&#8208;selective example, had a partially flexible&#160;n:iso&#160;ratio depending on temperature and pressure.

Catalysts derived from&#160;bis-phosphonites gave the desired low&#160;n:isoratios, but were unstable to hydrolysis.&#160;A&#160;bis-phosphoramidite ligand (EasyDiPhos) that can be made in just one synthetic step has been discovered that enables Rh-catalysed hydroformylations to proceed with unusually low&#160;n:iso&#160;ratios. They were also found to have significant stability to moisture, air, and to relatively high temperatures during hydroformylation conditions. The latter was studied using a combination of High-Pressure-Infra-Red spectroscopy and NMR analysis of the catalyst resting state after 1 week under relevant conditions. Propene hydroformylation with&#160;n:iso&#160;ratios well below 1 was carried out and with turnover numbers around 1000 mol/mol in one hour reaction time. One of the ligands, whilst not being the most&#160;iso-selective example, had a partially flexible&#160;n:iso&#160;ratio depending on temperature and pressure. Two Pt(II) complexes were prepared and their X-ray crystal structures determined.&#160;The most&#160;iso-selective catalyst was examined at low temperature(prioritising&#160;iso-selectivity over rates) in hydroformylation of some other terminal alkenes with significant branched selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single Crystals of A Covalent Organic Polymer for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic polymers (COPs) with high crystallinity and excellent stability is very important for potential applications in photocatalysis and environmental remediation. However, most COPs are amorphous, limiting their structural characterization, photocatalytic performance and mechanism exploration. In this study, we report the construction of a crystalline one&#8208;dimensional COP (CityU&#8208;49) via dative boron&#8592;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) bonds using 3,6&#8208;di(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (DPC) as the nitrogen donor and 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxaborole) as the boron donor. The dynamic and directional nature of B&#8592;N bonds enables a self&#8208;healing and self&#8208;correcting assembly process, resulting in a highly crystalline and stable structure. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) revealed the precise structure of CityU&#8208;49, providing insights into its ordered architecture. The photocatalytic performance of CityU&#8208;49 was conducted to investigat the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) (a persistent and toxic organic pollutant). Under UV light irradiation, CityU&#8208;49 achieves 95% degradation of RhB in 300 minutes, demonstrating excellent photocatalytic activity and environmental applicability. This study highlights the potential of crystalline COPs as efficient and sustainable photocatalysts, paving the way for the development of advanced materials for environmental remediation and green technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Release of Natural Glycans (ORNG): Preparation of Truncated N&#8208;glycans for Engineering Glycoproteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;glycosylation on asparagine is one of the most common post&#8208;translational modifications of proteins. The synthesis of homogeneous N&#8208;glycopeptides and glycoproteins is crucial for elucidating the concerted functions of glycans and peptides. Multiple endoglycosidase mutants have been developed to efficiently catalyze the coupling of oxazoline derivatives of N&#8208;glycans lacking the innermost N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) (mono&#8208;GlcNAc N&#8208;glycan) with peptide chains bearing a GlcNAcylated asparagine. However, the bottleneck for N&#8208;glycopeptide and glycoprotein synthesis remains access to these complex truncated N&#8208;glycan substrates in sufficient diversity and quantity. Here, we report a novel chemical method using modified oxidative release of natural glycans (ORNG) to produce a diverse library of mono&#8208;GlcNAc N&#8208;glycans and their oxazoline derivatives, paving the way for the facile synthesis of N&#8208;glycopeptides and glycoproteins. Using these substrates, homogeneous N&#8208;glycosylation of monoclonal antibodies can be efficiently achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>In Pursuit of Carbon Neutrality: Progresses and Innovations in Sorbents for Direct Air Capture of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses cutting&#8208;edge sorbents emphasizing on material design with critical evaluation of performance metrics, limitations, and future possibilities, establishing a robust foundation for advancing scalable DAC technologies and contributing to global efforts toward achieving carbon neutrality.








Abstract
Direct air capture (DAC) is of immense current interest, as a means to facilitate CO2 capture at low concentrations (&#8764;400&#160;ppm) directly from the atmosphere, with the aim of addressing global warming caused by excessive anthropogenic CO2 production. Traditionally, DAC of CO2 has relied on amine scrubbing and metal carbonate /hydroxide solutions. However, recent years have seen notable progress in DAC sorbents, with key advancements aimed at improving efficiency, capacity, and regenerability while reducing energy consumption. This review delivers an exhaustive analysis of contemporary developments in DAC sorbents, addressing the innovations in material design and consequent performance enhancement. The limitations of the sorbents have also been discussed, with future perspectives for improving sustainable CO2 capture strategies. We anticipate that this overview will help lay the groundwork for further development and large&#8208;scale implementation of sustainable sorbents and cutting&#8208;edge technologies toward attaining carbon neutrality.

         <title>Protonation&#8208;Induced&#160;Reversible Switching of Electronic Delocalization in a Linear Ru&#8208;Ru&#8208;Ru Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the first example of a molecular switch between electronic delocalization and electronic localization in cyanidometal&#8208;bridged trinuclear mixed&#8208;valence (MV) complex controlled by a protonation reaction. A MV complex with the terminal 2,3&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)pyridine (L) ligand which has a higher proton&#8208;accepting character, LRuIII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuIIL (13+) was synthesized and well characterized. The investigations indicate that the interaction between the two terminal Ru centers of 13+ is so strong that it is fully delocalized and can be described as LRuII+0.5&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII+0.5L. Most interestingly, 13+ can be reversibly protonated to 13+&#8208;2H coupled with an electron transfer from the central RuII to the terminal RuIII, resulting in a change in electronic structure from LRuII+0.5&#8208;NC&#8208;RuII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuII+0.5L to HLRuII&#8208;NC&#8208;RuIII&#8208;CN&#8208;RuIILH. Cyclic voltammetry of 13+&#8208;2H showed very weak interaction between the two terminal Ru centers. The remarkable change in electronic states by protonation&#8208;induced electron transfer is also strongly supported by the (TD)DFT calculations. Complex 13+ may be potential for an excellent candidate of molecular switch.</dc:description>

         <title>p&#8208;&#960; Conjugate Triggered Red Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Single Benzene&#160;Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzene is the simplest and the most basic building block for the construction of &#960; conjugated systems, which are widely used in various fields from fluorescent dyes to optoelectronic displays. However, achieving the red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from single benzene is still challenging. Utilizing the p&#8208;&#960; conjugation strategy, herein, we report a single benzene&#8208;based push&#8208;pull system with red RTP under ambient condition. One of the phosphors shows maximum RTP peak at 585 nm, along with shoulder peaks at 545 nm, 635 nm, and 700 nm. This architecture is uniquely separate from conventional extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and minimizes the requirement for red/NIR phosphors to a single benzene ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Excimer&#8208;Like Emission From a &#960;&#8208;Stacked Trichromophore Comprising Perylene Monoimide and Perylene Diimide Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ground&#8208;state structure of the target trichromophore has the individual modules arranged in a parallel stack, with moderate excitonic coupling leading to a distorted absorption spectrum. Under illumination, the tripartite molecular arrangement shifts in favor of a bipartite system displaying broad excimer emission at room temperature. The dynamics for this structural displacement are monitored by transient spectroscopy.








Abstract
A trichromophore has been synthesized comprising a perylene diimide sandwiched between two perylene monoimide diester (PMIDE) units and held in place by xanthene spacers. The DFT computed structure indicates &#960;&#8208;stacking of the three polycycles, with a mean interplanar separation of 4.2&#258;, but with the central unit displaced sideways. Phenyl groups inserted between xanthene and perylene help to rigidify the structure. Electronic interactions between perylene polycycles splits the absorption spectrum, which is dominated by transitions to the upper&#8208;lying H&#8208;state. Excimer&#8208;like emission is observed in solution at room temperature, for which the lifetime is &#8776;22&#160;ns in toluene and &#8776;8&#160;ns in CH2Cl2. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicates the instantaneous formation of a Franck&#8208;Condon state, which undergoes rapid vibrational cooling to populate the low&#8208;lying J&#8208;state. This species transforms over 40&#8211;60&#160;ps into an excimer&#8208;like state wherein the exciton is delocalized over all three perylenes. A slower structural re&#8208;arrangement, complete within 1&#160;ns, minimizes electronic interactions with one of the PMIDE units and stabilizes the resultant bipartite excimer&#8208;like state.

Abstract
Herein, an &#945;&#8208;selective synthesis of C&#8208;glycoside with 1&#8208;bromosugars and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones is reported, leveraging visible light&#8208;mediated excited&#8208;state palladium catalysis. This process involves the generation of glycosyl radicals from easily accessible 1&#8208;bromosugar precursors, which can capture quinoxalinone under photoinduced Pd(0) catalysis. The reaction operates under mild conditions, offering excellent axial selectivity with a diverse array of substrates. This methodology will provide a valuable platform for constructing potent biologically active C&#8208;glycosides.

         <dc:description>
Two thermal stability and insensitive energetic compounds were design and synthesized by constructing conjugated planar structure based on imino bridged nitrogen&#8208;rich frameworks. All the newly prepared compounds exhibit excellent thermal stabilities (Td: 316.5&#8211;343.9&#8201;&#176;C) and sensitivities (IS &gt;40&#8197;J, FS &gt;360&#8197;N), which are superior to those of the widely used heat&#8208;resistant explosive HNS. indicating its potential to be used as heat&#8208;resistant and insensitive energetic materials.







Abstract
Developing insensitive heat&#8208;resistant energetic materials is currently a significant challenge in the research of energetic materials. In this study, two heat&#8208;resistant and insensitive energetic materials (compounds 3 and 4) were designed and prepared by constructing conjugated planar structure based on the imino bridged (&#8722;NH&#8722;) azoles and 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,6&#8208;dinitropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;7&#8208;amine. All the newly synthesized compounds exhibit excellent thermal stabilities (Td: 316.5&#8211;343.9&#8201;&#176;C) and good detonation performances (D: 8183&#8211;8206&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1), as well as satisfactory sensitivities (IS &gt;40&#8197;J, FS &gt;360&#8197;N). These remarkable stabilities are attributed to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar structures and strong weak interactions in crystals. The comprehensive performances of compound 4 (Td: 343.9&#8201;&#176;C, D: 8183&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, IS &gt;40&#8197;J, FS &gt;360&#8197;N) are superior to those of the widely used heat&#8208;resistant explosive 2,2&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;hexanitrostilbene (HNS) (Td: 318&#8201;&#176;C, D: 7612&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, IS: 5&#8197;J, FS: 240&#8197;N), indicating its potential to be used as heat&#8208;resistant and insensitive energetic materials.

This study explores electroneutrality&#8242;s role in synthesizing sodium&#8208;based Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs), focusing on Na+ ion diffusion and its effect on crystal structure. It examines how temperature, viscosity, and stirring speed influence Na+ incorporation, vacancies, and water content, offering insights for optimizing PBAs in energy storage.







Abstract
This study explores how various experimental factors, such as temperature, viscosity, and stirring speed, affect Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) materials&#8216; structural properties and electroneutrality. These factors influence key attributes like sodium ions, vacancies, and water content, which is governed by electroneutrality. Higher temperatures, faster stirring, low viscosity, and high Na+ concentration enhance Na+ incorporation because of the sufficient Na+ supplement, leading to a densified monoclinic structure with fewer vacancies and lower water content. In contrast, lower temperatures, slow stirring, high viscosity, and low Na+ concentration lead to less monoclinic or cubic structures with more vacancies and higher water content. Adding carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) increases viscosity, enables lower Na+ diffusion, and renders less Na+ incorporation. As a result, an intermediate structure forms with balanced Na+ and water content, bridging the cubic and monoclinic forms. The electrochemical performance of cubic structures (PW&#8208;Cub) is superior, demonstrating better C&#8208;rate performance with distinct charge&#8208;discharge plateaus than monoclinic structures acquired at high temperatures (PW&#8208;Mc&#8208;HT). The PW&#8208;Mc&#8208;HT shows the mixed redox reactions between Fe2+/Fe3+ and Mn2+/Mn3+. This study reveals the root cause for the variation in PBAs&#8242; chemical composition and provides a guideline for synthesizing high&#8208;quality PBAs for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Molecular Bowls Comprising Adjacent Pentagons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended nitrogen&#8208;centered molecular bowls containing adjacent pentagonal rings are synthesized and characterized. While the peripherally fused benzene rings contribute minimally to the bowl curvature, the functional groups in the molecular bowls exert a pronounced influence on the host&#8208;guest binding constants observed in solution&#8208;phase interactions with fullerene.








Abstract
While the classical buckybowls, such as corannulene, and sumanene, have been extensively investigated, research on other molecular bowls containing double neighboring pentagonal rings remains underdeveloped. Here we present the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped molecular bowls incorporating adjacent pentagonal motifs with an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated surface. Their molecular curvatures are preserved according to the analyses of bowl&#8208;depth, &#960;&#8208;orbital axis vector angles, and inversion energy barrier when compared to those of their parent structures. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation induces the bathochromic shifts of both absorption and emission spectra, the narrowed energy gaps of the frontier molecular orbitals, as well as the enhanced aromatic character in the fused pentagonal rings. Furthermore, the extended aromatic surface enables the binding with fullerene C60 in solution.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Selective Electrochemical Decarboxylative Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical decarboxylative late&#8208;stage functionalization of the C&#8208; or N&#8208;terminus of natural amino acids is presented. Metal and catalyst&#8208;free protocol widely explored the synthesis of hindered ethers, amines, or di&#8208;peptide.








Abstract
A unified electrochemical decarboxylative strategy for the site&#8208;selective construction of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds is disclosed herein. The metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free decarboxylation provides access to the functionalization of C&#8208; and N&#8208;terminus from the simple amino acid feedstock. A wide variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary acids or alcohols were well tolerated. Late&#8208;stage functionalization using &#945;&#8208;D&#8208;galactopyranose, di&#8208;peptide, steroid derivatives, and bio&#8208;active drug molecules established the robustness and synthesis potential of our approach.

         <title>An ESIPT&#8208;Based Fluorochromogenic Tweezer for Reversible and Portable Detection of Al3+ Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ESIPT&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;naphtholphthalein&#8208;derived &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; regenerable fluoro&#8208;chromogenic molecular tweezer NPDM is employed for the portable and selective detection and visualization of Al3&#8314; in real samples. NPDM can trace intracellular Al3&#8314; and F&#8315; ions without interference from oxidative stress, and it is the first reported smart molecular tweezer capable of detecting Al3&#8314; ions generated during the electroporation within living cells.








Abstract
ESIPT&#8208;based fluorochromes are promising materials for the detection of various chemical and biological species, particularly metal cations. Herein, we have meticulously designed a prototypical ESIPT&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;naphtholphthalein&#8208;derived &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorogenic tweezer, NPDM, for&#160;the selective detection and visualization of Al3&#8314; in biological and environmental samples. NPDM was found to specifically interact with Al3&#8314;, exhibiting dual emissions, high sensitivity (50 s), large Stokes shifts (140 and 176&#160;nm), and a low detection limit of 16.3&#160;nM. Notably, the sensing mechanism of NPDM for Al3&#8314; involves metal ion&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement (CHEF), ESIPT &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; effect as well as restricted intramolecular rotation (RIR). This mechanism is supported by Job's plot, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (&#185;H NMR) titrations,&#160;and density functional (DFT) calculations. Interestingly, the NPDM&#8208;Al3+ ensemble can function as a secondary chromo&#8208;fluorogenic tweezer for monitoring fluoride ions (F&#8722;) with a low detection limit of 34.8&#160;nM. Thus, an advanced molecular memory device was constructed based on the fluorescence &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8208;off&#8221; strategy and its excellent sensing properties. Moreover, a portable, smartphone&#8208;assisted intelligent platform has been developed to facilitate in&#8208;field, cost&#8208;effective, and accurate detection of Al3&#8314; in real environmental water samples. Significantly, NPDM was successfully employed to image intracellular Al3&#8314; and F&#8315; ions in HeLa cells without interference from oxidative stress. This represents the first reported smart molecular tweezer capable of detecting Al3&#8314; ions generated during electroporation within living cells. Furthermore, the strategy developed here is valuable for the creation of novel, practically beneficial luminescent molecules and offers an advanced luminescent detection platform for point&#8208;of&#8208;care sensing of health&#8208;related ionic species.

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Dependent Energy&#8208;Gap Modulation of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems Based on Hypervalent Silicon(IV)&#8208;Fused Azomethine Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel system to modulate the energy gaps of &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds by using geometrical isomers, square pyramidal (SPY) and trigonal bipyramidal (TBPY) geometries, based on five&#8208;coordinated hypervalent silicon&#8208;fused azomethine compounds. It is revealed that the energy gap in the TBPY geometry is narrower than that of the SPY one owing to the stronger contribution of a three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) bond and a nitrogen&#8211;silicon (N&#8722;Si) coordination, and the geometries are dynamically changeable with external stimuli such as photoirradiation and temperature variations.








Abstract
The colors of substances and emissions are determined by the width of the energy gap between frontier molecular orbitals. In general, significant structural transformation or chemical modification is essential to tune the energy gap. Herein, we reveal a hypervalent silicon compound that can form both square pyramidal (SPY) and trigonal bipyramidal (TBPY) geometries and demonstrate a novel technique to modulate the energy gap of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system. The energy gap in the TBPY geometry is narrower than that in the SPY geometry owing to the stronger contribution of a polarized three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8208;4e) bond and a nitrogen&#8211;silicon (N&#8722;Si) coordination, and the geometries are changeable by external stimuli such as photoirradiation and temperature variations. Correspondingly, the emission bands in the orange (&#955;PL = 640&#160;nm) and yellow (&#955;PL = 579&#160;nm) regions were observed from the TBPY geometry at room temperature and the SPY geometry at &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Furthermore, the geometry can be fixed to the TBPY geometry by introducing bulky substituents at silicon. These mechanisms are experimentally and theoretically clarified in detail. Our findings described here are expected to be a novel molecular design for creating stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

It is revealed that the energy gap in the TBPY geometry is narrower than that of the SPY one owing to the stronger contribution of a three-center four-electron (3c-4e) bond and a nitrogen&#8211;silicon (N&#8722;Si) coordination, and the geometries are dynamically changeable with external stimuli such as photoirradiation and temperature variations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colors of substances and emissions are determined by the width of the energy gap between frontier molecular orbitals. In general, significant structural transformation or chemical modification is essential to tune the energy gap. Herein, we reveal a hypervalent silicon compound that can form both square pyramidal (SPY) and trigonal bipyramidal (TBPY) geometries and demonstrate a novel technique to modulate the energy gap of the &#960;-conjugated system. The energy gap in the TBPY geometry is narrower than that in the SPY geometry owing to the stronger contribution of a polarized three-center four-electron (3c-4e) bond and a nitrogen&#8211;silicon (N&#8722;Si) coordination, and the geometries are changeable by external stimuli such as photoirradiation and temperature variations. Correspondingly, the emission bands in the orange (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt; = 640&#160;nm) and yellow (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt; = 579&#160;nm) regions were observed from the TBPY geometry at room temperature and the SPY geometry at &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Furthermore, the geometry can be fixed to the TBPY geometry by introducing bulky substituents at silicon. These mechanisms are experimentally and theoretically clarified in detail. Our findings described here are expected to be a novel molecular design for creating stimuli-responsive materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Minisci Reaction by an MW&#8208;Boost. A Simple Protocol for Site&#8208;Selective Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling between Nitrogen&#8208;Aromatics and C(sp3)&#8208;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Minisci&#8208;type reaction between C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds and nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatics was carried out using a simple protocol based on the persulfate anion (PS) under microwave (MW) irradiation. The MW/PS protocol has been found to be applicable to a wide variety of dehydrogenative coupling reactions of N&#8208;heteroaromatics and C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds, leading to the formation of alkylated heteroaromatics. Site&#8208;selectivity is ensured by HAT with the sulfate radical affecting the polar/steric effects in the transition state. The MW/PS protocol was applicable to direct intramolecular cyclization to give five and six&#8208;membered rings fused by pyridine and lutidine, which, in previous methods, it was necessary to use tedious derivatization to imino&#8208;oxyacetic acids as HAT precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Conclusive Insight into the Coordination Complexes of a Flexible Bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) Ligand and their Phase&#8208;dependent Structure: a Multi&#8208;technique Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multichelating ligands with nuclear spin&#8208;free donor atoms are of particular interest for creating stable electronic spin qubits based on paramagnetic transition metal ions. We recently focused on the coordinating ability of the bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) ligand bdhb2&#8211;, featuring two &#8220;acac&#8221; moieties connected through a 1,3&#8208;phenylene bridge (H2bdhb = 1,3&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1&#8208;hexyl)benzene). The two crystalline complexes of bdhb2&#8211; so far isolated and structurally characterized, namely [(VO)2(bdhb)2] (1) and [Co2(bdhb)2(py)4] (2), are dimeric and contain bridging bdhb2&#8211; ligands; however, they become mononuclear and quasi&#8208;macrocyclic in organic solution. To investigate this unique structural isomerism by high&#8208;resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy, we have now synthesized a diamagnetic Zn2+ analogue of 1 and 2, namely [Zn2(bdhb)2(py)2] (3). Although both 2 and 3 are dimeric and contain the same ligands, 3 features only one pyridine molecule per metal ion, whose coordination geometry is square pyramidal rather than tetragonally elongated octahedral. The ESI&#8208;MS spectra of 3 in THF and CH2Cl2&#160;contain peaks from both monomeric and dimeric species. However, molecular weight determinations by DOSY and conformational studies based on J&#8208;coupling analysis and DFT calculations conclusively prove the rearrangement of 3 into quasi&#8208;macrocyclic monomers in THF&#8208;d8 and CD2Cl2 solution at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Click&#8208;Functionalized Cyanine Fluorogenic Dimers for Improved Detection of GPCRs: Application to imaging of ApelinR in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorogenic dimers enable background&#8208;free imaging of biological targets under wash&#8208;free conditions owing to a strong fluorescence enhancement in the apolar cell microenvironment. However, it is crucial that the imaging probe interacts solely with the target receptor to avoid non&#8208;specific interactions and ensure detection with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Herein, we describe a convenient and rapid approach for the synthesis of various functionalized cyanine dyes by click chemistry allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of the physicochemical and fluorogenic properties of the dimers. A structure&#8208;interaction relationship study was conducted for the fluorogenic dimers in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and liposomes as models of serum proteins and cell membranes. We identified d&#8208;Cy&#8208;E which combined the lowest non&#8208;specific interactions with the optimal fluorescence turn&#8208;on properties. By conjugating d&#8208;Cy&#8208;E to a peptide ligand of the apelin GPCR, we developed Ap&#8208;d&#8208;Cy&#8208;E, the first fluorescent turn&#8208;on probe for the background&#8208;free imaging of this receptor in living cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Membrane separation technology is one of the most important techniques in modern separation science. To understand the self&#8208;regulation mechanisms of cell membranes and mimic their working principles, a plethora of artificial membranes with responsive abilities to external stimuli have been engineered and prepared, whose smart sieving functions continue to attract attention and are applied in various fields. Among all the known stimuli, gas as a new trigger mode exhibits certain biocompatibility and offer irreplaceable advantages compared to other stimuli, such as cleanliness, ease&#8208;of&#8208;handling, and non&#8208;destructive, which make gas&#8208;responsive membranes as one of the most promising smart separation materials. In this review, we summarize recent breakthroughs in the development of gas&#8208;responsive membranes, outline the novel strategies on membrane fabrication, and highlight their advanced applications in controlled cargo release, size&#8208;/charge&#8208;based substance separation, oil&#8208;water separation, and selfcleaning. We also outlook the perspectives on the potential research directions and opportunities in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed ethylene methoxycarbonylation using bidentate phosphines: How the stereochemistry of the ligand affects the catalyst's activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To elucidate the diastereomeric control of bidentate P&#8208;ligands in the ethylene methoxycarbonylation, a comparative and systematic experimental and computational investigation was conducted on the catalytic activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of the racemic, meso, and epimerized LIKATphos ligands (pytbpx, B) as well as the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A). The experimental study revealed that the racemic ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited the highest catalytic activity, while the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A) exhibited the lowest activity, and the meso ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited moderate activity. This activity order is confirmed by the computed apparent Gibbs free energy barrier (57.7, 79.7, and 91.4 kJ mol&#8208;1, respectively). The enhanced catalytic activity exhibited by the chiral pytbpx (B) is attributed to its higher stability compared to the hydride complex and lower stability compared to the CO complex, in contrast to the meso pytbpx (B). The higher activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of pytbpx (B) over the Pd&#8208;complexes of dtbpx (A) is attributed to the built&#8208;in base effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning for Developing Sustainable Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainable polymers from renewable resources have been gaining importance due to their recyclability and reduced environmental impact. However, their development through conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods remains inefficient and resource&#8208;intensive. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in polymer science, enabling rapid prediction and discovery of new chemicals and materials. In this review, we examine emerging trends in machine learning applications for sustainable polymer development, focusing on catalyst discovery, property optimization, and new polymer design. We analyze unique challenges in applying machine learning to sustainable polymers and evaluate proposed solutions, providing insights for future development in this rapidly evolving field.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure and Catalytic Mechanism of the cis&#8208;Eunicellane Cyclase AriE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Eunicellane diterpenoids, with over 360 known examples characterized by a cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;6/10&#8208;bicyclic carbon skeleton, exhibit diverse biological activities. To date, five eunicellane cyclases (ECs) have been reported: cis&#8208;ECs (Bnd4, CpDTS2 and EcTPS1) and trans&#8208;ECs (AlbS and MicA), yet the structural basis and molecular mechanisms governing their distinct cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;cyclization modes remain unsolved. Here, we present the crystal structure of a cis&#8208;EC AriE from Amycolatopsis arida, which catalyzes geranylgeranyl diphosphate to form cis&#8208;6/10&#8208;fused bicyclic benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene (1) in aridacin biosynthesis. Through surface entropy reduction, we obtained the 1.87 &#197; resolution structure of AriED128A. Structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis identified W73 as a key regulatory hotspot controlling product diversity, with its variants generating diverse diterpene products. Y203A converted AriE into a highly specific (&#8211;)&#8208;(R)&#8208;cembrene A synthase. Our findings provide the first structural insights into this type of terpene synthase and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering EC variants for selective product formation.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Benzyl&#8208;Naphthalimide Dyes Revealing Diverse Structural Evolution Dynamics at The Single&#8208;Assembly Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence imaging has emerged as a powerful technique for in situ monitoring of self&#8208;assembly dynamics, providing critical insights into structural evolution and functional potential. However, the inherent complexity of supramolecular systems presents significant challenges for real&#8208;time visualization, particularly in capturing the growth kinetics of individual assemblies and the hierarchical formation of network structures at the single&#8208;assembly level. Here, we visualized the dynamic growth and network formation of benzyl&#8208;naphthalimide dye assemblies in situ by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In situ time&#8208;lapse imaging revealed distinct dynamic growth mechanisms among the three assemblies. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that different amino substituents significantly influenced assembly morphologies by modulating the planarity of the naphthalene ring. Furthermore, fluorescence lifetime imaging revealed pronounced intra&#8208;assembly heterogeneity, highlighting diverse molecular packing arrangements within individual assemblies. The confocal in situ visualization technique provided single&#8208;assembly growth dynamics, offering insights unattainable through conventional spectroscopic methods. Our work reveals that naphthalimide&#8208;based molecules can self&#8208;assemble into a variety of distinct architectures, underscoring their potential for designing advanced functional materials with tunable properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;induced C&#8208;C Bond Cleavage for the Construction of Ketone Using Molecular Oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective cleavage of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds by photocatalysis with the participation of oxygen for ketone synthesis and drug derivatization is reported. In this oxidation&#8208;based ketone formation reaction, molecular oxygen complexes with the substrate, which is subsequently photoexcited to generate a charge transfer (CT) state. This CT state facilitates energy transfer with molecular oxygen, producing singlet oxygen, which facilitates hydrogen atom process and promotes the subsequent cleavage of the carbon&#8208;carbon bond, ultimately leading to the formation of aryl ketone compounds. 48 aryl ketone compounds and pharmaceutical derivatives were synthesized using this method. A notable feature of this reaction is its catalyst&#8208;free, additive&#8208;free, and transition metals&#8208;free nature, combined with green, mild, and environmentally friendly reaction conditions, enabling high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies towards synthesis and conversion of lignin model compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The push towards a renewable society where the chemicals being used on a daily basis come from sources which are not going to be depleted within the next few decades is highly sought after. Biomass is one of the most promising opportunities to establish self&#8208;sustainability for the human race. This review article takes a look at some of the key methods which have been employed for the synthesis of important lignin model compounds and the synthetic techniques are discussed throughout the first section. The second section of this review is focused on some of the major strategies for the conversion of lignin model compounds throughout the literature and what the product streams identified are. This review serves as a good starting point for someone who is relatively new to the field of lignin model synthesis and valorisation.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Octahedral Aluminium Sites on Guest Molecule Adsorption in Zeolites: A Computational Study of 5&#8208;Fluorouracil in Zeolite FAU</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many aluminosilicate zeolites contain octahedral aluminium sites, which may occur as extra&#8208;framework or framework&#8208;associated sites. Due to the Lewis acidity of these sites, their impact on catalytic properties has been investigated frequently. Comparatively less emphasis has been placed on their role in adsorption, despite evidence for an irreversible binding of some guest molecules like the anticancer drug 5&#8208;fluorouracil (5&#8208;FU) to octahedral Al atoms. In the present study, dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations and DFT&#8208;based ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) are employed to investigate the adsorption of 5&#8208;FU at a framework&#8208;associated octahedral Al site in zeolite FAU. The calculations show that 5&#8208;FU remains coordinated to the Al atom at room temperature and in the presence of water. In contrast, 5&#8208;FU molecules adsorbed at framework protons are quickly displaced by water molecules. It is thus demonstrated that octahedral Al atoms will negatively affect the release of 5&#8208;FU from zeolite hosts in drug delivery applications. A comparison of DFT&#8208;calculated infrared (IR) spectra to literature data provides evidence that Al&#8208;coordinated 5&#8208;FU molecules were indeed present in previously investigated samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihalogens Binding and Activation by Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;Chalcogenone Model Derivatives: Insight from a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogenone donors represent a fundamental chemical class of compounds in the treatment of hyperthyroidism; particularly, imidazoline&#8208;based systems are associated with the strongest affinity for I2. Therefore, the reactivity of these types of donors with dihalogens may be insightful to understand the mechanism of action of popular drugs, such as methimazole (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione, MMI). In this work, the reactivity of 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;chalcogenone (S, Se, Te) with dihalogens X2 (X = Cl, Br, I) is evaluated for any combination through a systematic computational study. Three different products are found: a linear charge transfer (CT) &#8220;spoke&#8221; adduct, a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; intermediate (TI) and a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; hypercoordinate species (TY).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chalcogenone donors represent a fundamental chemical class of compounds in the treatment of hyperthyroidism; particularly, imidazoline-based systems are associated with the strongest affinity for I2. Therefore, the reactivity of these types of donors with dihalogens may be insightful to understand the mechanism of action of popular drugs, such as methimazole (1-methyl-4-imidazoline-2-thione, MMI). In this work, the reactivity of 1,3-dimethyl-4-imidazoline-2-chalcogenone (S, Se, Te) with dihalogens X2 (X = Cl, Br, I) is evaluated for any combination through a systematic computational study. Three different products are found: a linear charge transfer (CT) &#8220;spoke&#8221; adduct, a &#8220;T-shaped&#8221; intermediate (TI) and a &#8220;T-shaped&#8221; hypercoordinate species (TY). The halogen and chalcogen effects are discussed separately as for the solvation effects. Furthermore, only the TY species formed from the reaction between 1,3-dimethyl-4-imidazoline-2-thione and I2 resulted to be disfavored with respect to the corresponding CT adduct; therefore, this peculiarity is rationalized in the framework of activation strain analysis. Lastly, a possible alternative mechanism involving the formation of a cationic intermediate species is considered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Water&#8208;soluble 3&#8208;Nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinesulfenate for Disulfide Bond Formation of Peptide under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Establishing an efficient method for the synthesis of disulfide bonds in peptides is an important challenge for the further development of several research fields, including peptide&#8208;based medicinal chemistry and biochemistry. Herein, we report the development of a novel highly water&#8208;soluble 3&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine (Npy) sulfenate that efficiently forms intramolecular disulfide bonds in reduced peptides. Moreover, Npy&#8208;sulfenate formed a disulfide bond in a thiol&#8208;containing peptide prepared by thiol&#8208;additive&#8208;free native chemical ligation, as demonstrated by the one&#8208;pot synthesis of adrenomedullin, which contains 52 amino acid residues. This study provides a new one&#8208;pot synthetic methodology for preparing mid&#8208;sized cyclic disulfide peptides via sulfenate&#8208;mediated oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Vacancies as Key Drivers of Distinct Physicochemistry in MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 for Selective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance the surface reactivity of Mo&#8208;based TMD monolayers &#8211; MoS2, MoSe2, and MoTe2 &#8211; but also amplify differences in their physicochemical properties, leading to distinct surface interactions. This effect originates from the intrinsic characteristics of Mo&#8211;X bonding in these monolayers.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers is intrinsically tied to their physicochemical properties. However, the limited chemical diversity among these materials constrains their versatility for key catalytic processes, including carbon dioxide (CRR), nitrogen (NRR), and oxygen (ORR) reduction reactions. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the impact of chalcogen vacancies on the properties of 

MoS2

 ${{\rm{MoS}}_2 }$



, 

MoSe2

 ${{\rm{MoSe}}_2 }$



, and 

MoTe2

 ${{\rm{MoTe}}_2 }$



, focusing on the adsorption behaviors of CO, NO, and 

NO2

 ${{\rm{NO}}_2 }$



. The findings reveal that chalcogen vacancies not only enhance surface reactivity but also impart distinctive physicochemical characteristics to each TMD. These effects arise from intrinsic bonding differences, resulting in distinct charge availability at exposed Mo atoms and variations in vacancy dimensions, which shape specific surface interactions. Hence, while adsorption differences between pristine surfaces are generally negligible for catalysis, vacancies amplify them by over an order of magnitude, resulting in pronounced material&#8208;specific behaviors. Moreover, varying vacancy dimensions affect how species incorporate into defects, further enhancing the differences. These characteristics unlock substantial potential of TMD sheets for distinct surface chemistries, transforming them from relatively similar to markedly different as defect density rises. Consequently, our findings provide insights for tailoring these materials toward applications in electro&#8208; and photocatalysis.

         <title>Constructing AgO/Ag2O Electrocatalysts with Highly Exposed and Tightly Contacted Active Facets for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of Ag&#8208;based electrode with the highly exposed and tightly contacted AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) active facets was constructed for efficient electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. This work can help understand the effects of crystal orientation and crystal face interface on electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver&#8208;based electrocatalysts (Ag&#8208;x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x=0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver&#8208;based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag&#8208;10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399&#8197;mV at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 456&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag&#8208;10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). This work provides insight for the synthesis of metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts and understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>A Bivalent Iridium(III) Complex Toolkit for Mitochondrial DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Targeted Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>

We present a bivalent iridium(III) complex toolkit for targeting mitochondrial DNA Gquadruplexes, which has the merits of multicolor, ability to discriminate TNBC cells and modular phototheranostics.







Abstract
The G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) is an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in cancers, but the development of theranostic probes for subcellular G4&#8197;s remains challenging. In this work, we report three G4&#8208;targeted theranostic probes by conjugating a pyridostatin&#8208;derived G4 ligand to G4&#8208;specific iridium(III) complexes with desirable photophysical properties. These probes showed specifically enhanced luminescence to mitochondrial G4 in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Of note, complex 3 exhibited NIR emission and the ability to discriminate TNBC cells and normal breast cells. Furthermore, these probes showed much higher PDT toxicity in TNBC cells through ROS&#8208;induced apoptosis, where complex 3 exhibited a type I/II hybrid PDT effect with the potential to overcome hypoxia. These results demonstrate that these complexes are multicolor and modular phototheranostic probes for DNA G4s. We believe that this work offers a multifunctional theranostic toolkit for unmasking subcellular DNA G&#8208;quadruplex functions.

&lt;p&gt;The G-quadruplex (G4) is an important diagnostic and therapeutic target in cancers, but the development of theranostic probes for subcellular G4&#8197;s remains challenging. In this work, we report three G4-targeted theranostic probes by conjugating a pyridostatin-derived G4 ligand to G4-specific iridium(III) complexes with desirable photophysical properties. These probes showed specifically enhanced luminescence to mitochondrial G4 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Of note, complex &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; exhibited NIR emission and the ability to discriminate TNBC cells and normal breast cells. Furthermore, these probes showed much higher PDT toxicity in TNBC cells through ROS-induced apoptosis, where complex &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; exhibited a type I/II hybrid PDT effect with the potential to overcome hypoxia. These results demonstrate that these complexes are multicolor and modular phototheranostic probes for DNA G4s. We believe that this work offers a multifunctional theranostic toolkit for unmasking subcellular DNA G-quadruplex functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of TEMPO Adducts with Hydrogen Atom Transfer: An Alternative Pathway to Versatile Hydrofunctionalizations of Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step cobalt&#8208;catalyzed method is developed for the hydrofunctionalization of olefins, involving TEMPO adduct formation followed by photocatalytic nucleophilic substitution. This approach enables the formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bonds with high efficiency. The method demonstrates potential for PET applications with hydrofluorination and offers an alternative pathway to diastereoselective olefin hydration.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step process is developed to access a broad range of hydrofunctionalization of olefins, by combining a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed formation of TEMPO adduct from olefins and a photocatalytic nucleophilic addition to generate a new C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;F, and C&#8722;Cl bond. Nucleophilic fluorination can be achieved with a short reaction time, showing its potential in PET applications. Combining the two steps, net hydrofunctionalization of olefins with a broad range has been achieved.

         <title>Reusable CuO NPs Catalyzed Chemodivergent Transfer Hydrogenation of Azoarenes to Hydrazoarenes and Aniline Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easy to synthesize CuO NPs catalyzed effective chemodivergent transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes to aniline derivatives and hydrazoarenes under mild conations using ammonia borane is demonstrated. A series of control experiments and deuterium labelling experiments were carried out to understand the catalytic process. Furthermore, the catalyst was recycled up to six consecutive cycles with no significant decrease in catalytic activity.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of different products from a substrate employing a single catalyst by altering the reaction conditions is challenging. Herein, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize and cheap CuO NPs catalyzed chemodivergent transfer hydrogenation (TH) of azoarenes to hydrazoarenes and aniline derivatives using ammonia borane (AB) under mild conditions is disclosed. The practical applicability of the protocol was demonstrated by the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of hydrazo and aniline derivatives as well as by the reduction of a few commercially used dyes such as methyl red, sudan I, sudan III and solvent yellow 7. Several control experiments and deuterium labelling experiments were performed to understand the reaction mechanism. Moreover, the catalyst can be recycled up to six times without considerable loss of catalytic activity.

         <title>Accelerating Toehold&#8208;Mediated DNA Strand Displacement Reaction using Polyquaternium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) is an effective accelerator for toehold&#8208;mediated DNA strand displacement reaction. PQ2 improves reaction rates by up to 105&#8208;fold and alleviates dependence on toehold length, mitigates secondary structure's influences, and ensures robust performance in serum. PQ2 offers a promising solution for advancing applications of DNA nanotechnology, from biosensing to molecular computing.







Abstract
Toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement (TMSD) reaction is a widely used programming language in DNA nanotechnology, but its performance is significantly limited by slow kinetics, especially for low&#8208;concentration reactants. Herein, we report on polyquaternium&#8208;2 (PQ2) as an effective and efficient accelerator of TMSD reaction. We show that PQ2 could drastically increase the reaction constant of 1&#8208;nt TMSD by 105&#8208;fold. Significant acceleration of TMSD reactions with sub&#8208;nanomolar input has been demonstrated in various TMSD&#8208;based catalytic DNA amplifiers. By stabilizing DNA reactants and increasing their effective local concentrations, PQ2 enables much faster reaction kinetics in response to picomolar inputs while eliminating the dependence on toehold length, mitigating the inhibitory effect of secondary structures, maintaining single&#8208;base discriminating power, and protecting TMSD system in serum. Also, it improves cascaded signal transmission over an 11&#8208;layer circuit with 26 rounds of TMSD reactions, with a half&#8208;completion time of only 5.3 minutes. The simple&#8208;to&#8208;use and low&#8208;cost PQ2 offers a promising solution for uncovering the full potential of DNA nanotechnology and will facilitate more efficient and versatile TMSD&#8208;based applications from sensitive biosensing to high&#8208;performance molecular computing.

         <title>Electrochemical Removal Of Doxycycline Hydrochloride with Cerium&#8208;Aluminum Catalytic Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a cerium&#8208;aluminum bimetallic catalyst is fired using a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, and a modified carbon fabric anode is created. Electrochemical degradation of doxycycline hydrochloride without additional oxidizing agents shows excellent results. Simultaneously, several cycle degradation studies yield outstanding results, and a degradation mechanism was presented by characterization and analysis.







Abstract
Doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX) is a widely used broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic that is challenging to degrade, leading to a series of environmental issues. In this study, a bimetallic oxide catalyst was synthesized through hydrothermal calcination followed by annealing. The catalytic carbon cloth anode was fabricated by bonding materials directly onto carbon cloth. Various characterization methods were employed to analyze the surface morphology, composition, and electrochemical properties of the electrodes. The materials exhibited rich surface morphology and exceptional electrochemical surface area. The catalyst primarily consisted of CeO2 and CeAlO3, demonstrating a 93.85&#8201;% removal efficiency of DOX within 2&#8197;hours under optimized conditions. Even after seven consecutive degradation cycles, the DOX degradation rate remained at 82&#8201;%, confirming the remarkable stability of the electrodes. The product distribution generated during the degradation of DOX was identified using LC&#8211;MS analysis, and a potential electrochemical degradation mechanism was proposed. Our results indicate that the bimetallic hybrid coordination significantly enhances the catalytic activity and electrochemical stability of the materials. This work offers a novel approach for preparing modified carbon cloth anodes with high catalytic activity and durability, laying a crucial foundation for the efficient degradation of the antibiotic DOX.

         <title>Tunable G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: Azobenzene Derivatives for Light&#8208;Controlled DNA Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene (AB) is a promising light&#8208;responsive motif for targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) and enabling their light&#8208;controlled modulation. We synthesized a series of novel AB derivatives with diverse structural variations, demonstrating that the interaction mode influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings highlight critical design principles for optimizing photoactive G4 ligands.







Abstract
During transcription, replication, and DNA repair, DNA unwinds to reveal guanine&#8208;rich sequences that form stable G&#8208;quadruplexes. In cancer cells, increased transcription and replication promote G4 formation, making them attractive therapeutic targets. G4&#8197;s block DNA and RNA polymerases, inducing replication stress and causing toxic single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand breaks. Small&#8208;molecule ligands can stabilize G4 structures, prolonging their effects and exacerbating replication stress. However, most G4 ligands operate through a one&#8208;way mechanism that remains permanent over time.

&lt;p&gt;Azobenzene (AB) is a promising light-responsive motif for targeting G-quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) and enabling their light-controlled modulation. We synthesized a series of novel AB derivatives with diverse structural variations, demonstrating that the interaction mode influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings highlight critical design principles for optimizing photoactive G4 ligands.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During transcription, replication, and DNA repair, DNA unwinds to reveal guanine-rich sequences that form stable G-quadruplexes. In cancer cells, increased transcription and replication promote G4 formation, making them attractive therapeutic targets. G4&#8197;s block DNA and RNA polymerases, inducing replication stress and causing toxic single- and double-strand breaks. Small-molecule ligands can stabilize G4 structures, prolonging their effects and exacerbating replication stress. However, most G4 ligands operate through a one-way mechanism that remains permanent over time. A more versatile approach involves systems that can switch between active and inactive states on demand using external stimuli, such as light. This study aims to deepen knowledge of the current state of the design of photoactive G4-ligand through the synthesis of azobenzene-based compounds that vary in substitution patterns, size of the substituent, electronic effects, and molecular structure. Using orthogonal biophysical methods and quantum-chemical calculations, we evaluate how these factors affect the compounds&#8217; ability to bind and stabilize G4 structures. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the interaction mode of the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; isomer with G4 influences its ability to modulate G4 properties bidirectionally. These findings provide insights for designing photoactive G4 ligands with tunable on-off functionality, paving the way for precise control of G4 structures in biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Chemistry of Anticancer Mononuclear and N&#8208;Bridged Dinuclear 8&#8208;Aminoquinoline Half&#8208;sandwich Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
8&#8208;Aminoquinoline half&#8208;sandwich metal chlorido complexes were found to undergo conversion into dimetallic analogues under basic conditions and/or by the addition of AgNO3 to abstract the chlorido ligand. In in&#8197;vitro anticancer activity studies, the dimetallic complexes were found to be in general more potent than the mononuclear analogues which can be explained by higher uptake into cancer cells.







Abstract
Piano&#8208;stool complexes of ruthenium and other platinum group metals have shown promising preclinical results as anticancer agents, often with alternative modes of action to traditional platinum&#8208;based compounds. Quinoline is considered a privileged structure in medicinal chemistry and many complexes with potent anticancer activity have been reported. To assess the effect of incorporating bidentate 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;&#951;2N&#8208;1,N&#8208;8 (AQH) ligands in half&#8208;sandwich piano&#8208;stool metal complexes of the general formula [M(L)(AQH)Cl]+, the respective Ru, Os (L=&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene), Rh and Ir (L=&#951;5&#8208;pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complexes were prepared. Deprotonation of AQH during the reaction gave dinuclear [M(L)(AQ)]22+ complexes with the deprotonated &#956;&#8208;&#954;1N&#8208;8&#8208;aminoquinolinato&#8208;&#951;2N&#8208;1,N&#8208;8 (AQ) ligands acting as bridges between the metal centers. Conversion of the mononuclear Ru, Rh and Ir compounds to the dimetallic analogues was facilitated under basic conditions and improved for the Ru derivative by the addition of AgNO3 to abstract the chlorido ligand. In in&#8197;vitro anticancer activity studies, the dimetallic complexes were in general more potent than mononuclear analogues. The higher activity of the dimetallic compounds can be explained by higher uptake into cancer cells, as demonstrated for the respective Ru complexes, while zebrafish embryo studies demonstrated low toxicity, irrespective of the number of metal centers in the complexes.

         <title>Phenylalanine&#8208;Based Amphiphilic Self&#8208;Assembled Materials: Gels or Crystals?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>

Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrate that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network.







Abstract
We prepared three simple molecules, that we chose as representative examples of amphiphilic and bolamphiphilic amino acid derivatives: N&#8208;lauroyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N&#8208;palmitoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH), N,N&#8208;azeloyl&#8208;L&#8208;diphenylalanine Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2, to study the influence of the aliphatic side chain on the formation of supramolecular materials. We found that Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is a very efficient gelator in contrast with Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 that efficiently forms crystals, while Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH forms metastable hydrogels that slowly become crystals. We demonstrated by X&#8208;ray diffraction that Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH easily form hetero&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the carboxylic and amidic groups, while Az&#8208;(Phe&#8208;OH)2 forms homo&#8208;intermolecular hydrogen bonds, i.&#8201;e., the typical carboxylic ring dimer and chains between the amidic functions, which leads to an extended and robust 2D hydrogen bonding network. Moreover, Lau&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is more ordered than Pal&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH and the comparison of these results clearly indicates that the reduced order of Pal&#8208;L&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH is the main reason for the efficiency of this molecule as supergelator.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Magnesium Organic Batteries using Renewable Biomolecule&#8208;Based Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass&#8208;based molecule (emodin) have been utilized for the first time as cathode in rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs), exhibiting high specific capacity and excellent diffusion kinetics. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that two emodin molecules can form a stable structure capable of incorporating two magnesium ions when arranged with central inversion.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) exhibit significant potential in large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their features of high volumetric capacity, resistance to dendrite formation, and abundant magnesium resources. However, the high polarity of divalent Mg2+ ions results in sluggish diffusion kinetics in conventional inorganic cathode materials, adversely affecting reversible capacity and rate performance. Organic materials such as pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetrone (PTO) and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), achieve rapid and reversible intercalation of magnesium ions through carbonyl enolization, but these materials are challenged by high cost, complex preparation, and poor environmental friendliness. In this study, we employ a carbonyl&#8208;rich biomass&#8208;based small molecule, emodin, as a cathode material for RMBs, achieving rapid diffusion kinetics and notable magnesium storage performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that two emodin molecules can form a stable structure capable of incorporating two magnesium ions when arranged with central inversion. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using biomass materials to prepare high&#8208;performance cathodes for RMBs and provides a novel approach for the development of high&#8208;performance organic cathode materials.

         <title>Influence of a 2nd Sphere Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donor on the Reactivity of Non&#8208;heme Fe(II) Complexes in Alkane, Alkene and Aromatic Oxidation with H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of a 2nd sphere hydrogen bond donor in iron complexes induces the selection of a specific FeIIIOOH species in the presence of H2O2 thanks to the stabilizing H&#8208;bonding interaction with the proximal O. This structural pattern, after OO bond cleavage, enhances the electrophilicity of the resulting high valent oxo species, which improves epoxidation yields.







Abstract
Two iron(II) complexes of the pentadentate aminopyridine ligand L52(OH), bearing a 2nd sphere OH group in ortho position of one pyridine, were studied in the oxidation of various substrates using H2O2. While the addition of the OH group lowers the yields of alkane and aromatic oxidation, it improves the yield in alkene epoxidation. Spectroscopic analyses suggest that the pyridine&#8208;OH group stabilizes an Fe(III)OOH intermediate by hydrogen&#8208;bonding with the proximal O atom of hydroperoxo, but also eventually drives the system towards a dimeric structure, which competes with the oxidation process. The improvement in epoxidation yields is proposed to result from the fast reaction of cyclooctene with the active species, together with an enhanced oxidizing power induced by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern.

     alt="Influence of a 2nd Sphere Hydrogen-Bond Donor on the Reactivity of Non-heme Fe(II) Complexes in Alkane, Alkene and Aromatic Oxidation with H2O2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addition of a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; sphere hydrogen bond donor in iron complexes induces the selection of a specific Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;OOH species in the presence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thanks to the stabilizing H-bonding interaction with the proximal O. This structural pattern, after OO bond cleavage, enhances the electrophilicity of the resulting high valent oxo species, which improves epoxidation yields.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two iron(II) complexes of the pentadentate aminopyridine ligand L&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2(OH)&lt;/sup&gt;, bearing a 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; sphere OH group in ortho position of one pyridine, were studied in the oxidation of various substrates using H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. While the addition of the OH group lowers the yields of alkane and aromatic oxidation, it improves the yield in alkene epoxidation.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Helicity Switching of a Rotor by a Photo&#8208;Responsive Plier</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we present a binary system consisting of an achiral bis&#8208;zinc&#8208;porphyrin rotor and a chiral diazo&#8208;containing photoswitch with two pyridine termini that coordinate to the bis&#8208;zinc porphyrin, forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex. Upon photoisomerization of the diazo group from the E to the Z configuration, drastic structural rearrangements occur throughout the complex, leading to a change in its helicity of bound porphyrin. Exposure to light of a different wavelength reverses this transformation, restoring the original complex.







Abstract
Controlling synchronized motion and transmission of molecular motion to a remotely located guest is not trivial. Here, we demonstrate a light&#8208;triggered, scissor&#8208;like conformational change in a molecular plier to reversibly alter the conformation and helical chirality of a noncovalently bound rotor. The plier comprises three building blocks: an azobenzene unit that controls the open&#8208;close motion of the plier upon light&#8208;activated isomerization from E to Z, a BINOL unit that serves as both a hinge and a chiral inducer and two pyridine moieties that can form a complex with the rotor guest. The light&#8208;induced conformational alteration of the plier was unequivocally demonstrated by 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, and CD spectroscopy. The open&#8208;close motion of the plier was translated to the rotor via a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex. Indeed, CD spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, thermal back isomerization studies, and molecular modelling confirm that the light&#8208;triggered conformational alterations of the plier can induce mechanical twisting and helicity switching in the rotor.

Crystal structures of Cu&#8208;MOF: by changing coordination metal and the position of nitrogen atom in pyridine&#8208;based photochromic ligand, we successfully synthesised a novel photochromic copper&#8208;based MOF using 9,10&#8208;bis(di(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene as the photochromic ligand. Structural analysis revealed a 3D porous architecture (see picture). The Cu&#8208;MOF exhibited exceptional photoelectric properties, demonstrating potential as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and a luminescent MnO&#8324;&#8722; sensor.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;stimulated Polymers have garnered significant attention for their potential applications ranging from optical memory to sensing. Herein, by changing coordination metal and the position of nitrogen atom in pyridine&#8208;based photo&#8208;stimulated ligand, we successfully synthesised a novel photo&#8208;stimulated copper&#8208;based MOF (Cu&#8208;MOF) using 9,10&#8208;bis(di(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl)methylene)&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene as the photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. Structural analysis revealed a 3D porous architecture, offering a distinct advantage over previously reported 1D coordination polymer using similar photo&#8208;stimulated ligand. The Cu&#8208;MOF exhibited exceptional photoelectric properties, demonstrating potential as an anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and a luminescent MnO&#8324;&#8722; sensor. Its electrochemical performance revealed high reversibility, with discharge capacities retaining stability under varying current densities. Additionally, the Cu&#8208;MOF displayed notable photo&#8208;stimulated behavior under UV light irradiation, enhancing its optical properties. Although the structure changes from 1D coordination polymer to 3D MOF, the photocyclized form (c&#8208;Cu MOF) still exhibited superior fluorescence quenching efficiency and sensitivity for MnO&#8324;&#8722; detection with Ksv (quenching constant) 5.24&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1. This work highlights the utility of Cu&#8208;MOF as a multifunctional material for energy storage and environmental sensing applications.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Ultramicroporous Organic&#8208;Linked Zincophosphate with High Thermal, Chemical and Water Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a strategy to enhance ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation by improving stability and scalability. Through topotactic proton replacement with metal ions in bpy&#8208;pillared zincophosphates, a bimetal phosphate, VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w, was developed, showing exceptional stability (pH 2&#8211;12, boiling water). A rapid synthesis reduced production time to 3&#8197;hours, with vanadyl groups providing strong sheets and metal sites for CO2 adsorption.







Abstract
The application of ultramicroporous materials for CO2 separation is limited by the rarity of materials exhibiting stability and rapid scale&#8208;up characteristics. In this study, we propose a rational approach to enhance the structural stability and durability of the pillared layer structure. Through the topotactic replacement of protons with metal ions in the parent 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;pillared zincophosphate, we observed the formation of edge&#8208;sharing dimers of ZnO4N and PO4, as well as the insertion of (VOH2O)2+ into the zinc phosphate layers. This resulted in the modified bpy&#8208;pillared bimetal phosphate, [(VOH2O)(ZnPO4)2(bpy)]&#8901;4H2O (denoted as NTHU&#8208;16 or VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w), which exhibits exceptional structural stability in a wide pH range (pH&#8197;2&#8208;12) and boiling water. Additionally, a rapid scale&#8208;up process reduced the synthesis time of VZn&#8208;bpy&#8208;w from 48&#8197;hours to just 3&#8197;hours, significantly increasing efficiency. The vanadyl groups, with easily displaced coordinated water, enhance the strength of the inorganic sheets and create available metal sites for the adsorption and separation of CO2. This combined strategy of structural enhancement and rapid synthesis offers a new pathway for engineering stable, porous metal phosphates and designing novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with potential applications in CO2 separation.

Specific ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembly is achieved using box&#8208;like molecules and hydrogen bonded aramide macrocycle through an interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions, revealing the importance of the effect of molecular structures and conformational adaptivity upon the assembling outcome.







Abstract
The controlled formation of ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) assemblies is highly desirable as precursors for constructing higher order supramolecular architectures. We report our findings that this goal can be achieved by balancing molecular structures and conformational adaptivity through an interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions. With hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) aramide macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules including naph&#8208;Box, m&#8208;Box and p4p&#8208;Box, ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling systems with 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry are preferentially created. The formation of such assemblies with a defined number of rings threaded on a Box molecule is unprecedented using 2D shape&#8208;persistent macrocycles. The unusual assembly behaviors are rationalized by the aid of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and xTB computation. In sharp contrast to the use of o&#8208;Box and p&#8208;Box in forming ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings complexes where a distribution of various assembled species is observed, the box&#8208;like molecules all afford monodisperse compact assemblies. Conformational adaptivity is deemed as one of the major factors that is accountable for the selectivity observed, which is driven mainly by cooperative action of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions including H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Using pyrimidyl&#8208;incorporated H&#8208;bonded macrocycles and box&#8208;like molecules to form ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings assembling structures may provide opportunities for designing more sophisticated and topologically unique supramolecular systems with potential functions.

         <title>Tuning Decomposition Temperature: A Structural Study of Ligand Directed Bonding and Fluxionality</title>

In this work, we have investigated the design and synthesis of aluminium compounds via systematic variation of ligand type. This is the first example of a ligand directed design and study of aluminium compounds which decompose at low temperatures (&lt;200&#8201;&#176;C). Their dynamic properties have also been investigated, with a focus on the decomposition profiles.







Abstract
In the first study of its kind towards the design and synthesis of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle aluminium precursors that decompose at temperatures &lt;200&#8201;&#176;C: informed ligand choice and structural design of the compounds has caused inbuilt fluxionality leading to a markable decrease in the onset of decomposition temperatures. Eight thiourea ligands [L1H&#8211;L8H] were chosen with the steric bulk on the N atoms of these ligands varied systematically [L1&#8722;4H: RN(H)CS(NMe2) and L5&#8722;8H: RN(H)CS(NEt2); R=Me (L1H and L5H), Et (L2H and L6H), iPr (L3H and L7H) and Ph (L4H and L8H). Three families of aluminium compounds were synthesised by the reaction of these thiourea ligands with trimethylamine alane [Al(Lx)3 (1&#8211;7), trimethylaluminium [MeAl(Lx)2] (8&#8211;11) and triethylaluminium [EtAl(Lx)2] (12&#8211;14) respectively. The three most spatially encumbered compounds (Al(L3)3 (2), Al(L6)3 (5) and Al(L7)3 (6) are highly fluxional in solution and displayed lengthening of the Al&#8722;N bond as compared to the other compounds. Both factors directly affect the activation temperature of these compounds. The remaining compounds were not shown to display any of these behaviours and consequently have higher thermal decomposition temperatures. SCXRD, 1H and 13C{1H} NMR, variable temperature 1H NMR, MS and EA have been used to study the structure and solution dynamics of 1&#8211;14. This has directly been linked to the decomposition profiles of the compounds to assess their viability as precursors, evidencing that what we see in the solution state is present in the solid state too. Density functional theory calculations have been carried out to elucidate the various bonding modes observed for compounds 1&#8211;7. Tandem MS has been employed to better understand the breakdown of the molecules.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Conjugation of Inorganic Phosphate and Sulfate with Aminocyclobutenediones under Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Irradiation of aminocyclobutenediones with blue light in aqueous phosphate or sulfate solution produces butenolides with phosphate or sulfate groups. The reaction is compatible with free amino and carboxy groups, and can be performed under air.







Abstract
Phosphate and sulfate groups play an important role in controlling the physical properties of biomolecules and artificial materials. However, despite their significance, the incorporation of phosphate or sulfate groups into aqueous organic compounds using non&#8208;enzymatic methods has been unprecedented. In this study, we have successfully conjugated inorganic phosphate and sulfate with aminocyclobutenedione derivatives via photochemical reactions under aqueous conditions. A plausible mechanism for the conjugation reactions was proposed on the basis of DFT calculations. These reactions will promote life science research based on organophosphates and organosulfates which have been difficult to access up to now.

         <title>Synthesis of Ag@Pd Nanocubes and Pd&#8208;based Nanoframes via One&#8208;Shot Injection of a Halide&#8208;Free Precursor for Continuous Production in a Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes by templating with Ag nanocubes via one&#8208;shot injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 solution and H2O2 etching. We also extend the one&#8208;shot synthesis from a batch to a continuous flow reactor for continuous production without compromising the quality.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal open nanostructures have remarkable catalytic capabilities toward a wide range of reactions. In particular, Pd&#8208;based open nanostructures have been synthesized and validated for superior catalytic performance toward formic acid oxidation. However, most of the syntheses are based on dropwise addition, making it challenging to increase the production volume. In this work, we present a facile approach to the synthesis of Ag@Pd core&#8208;frame nanocubes and then Pd&#8208;based nanoframes through one&#8208;shot injection. In a typical synthesis, Ag nanocubes are dispersed in an aqueous solution of ascorbic acid and polyvinylpyrrolidone at room temperature, followed by the injection of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor in one shot. The Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 precursor has a much slower reduction kinetics relative to Na2PdCl4, preventing self&#8208;nucleation and enabling controlled deposition of Pd atoms on the Ag nanocubes. The lower reduction potential of Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2 also helps minimize the galvanic replacement reaction, facilitating uniform deposition of Pd atoms. After selectively etching away the Ag template, Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with a rigid cubic structure are obtained. Finally, the synthesis is successfully adapted to a continuous flow system, generating Ag@Pd nanocubes with comparable quality to those obtained via one&#8208;shot synthesis, demonstrating a practical route to large&#8208;scale production of Pd&#8208;based nanoframes with H2O2 etching.

Finally, the synthesis is successfully adapted to a continuous flow system, generating Ag@Pd nanocubes with comparable quality to those obtained &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; one-shot synthesis, demonstrating a practical route to large-scale production of Pd-based nanoframes with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; etching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Working Mechanisms for Enhanced Interface Stability and Electrochemical Properties in Dual&#8208;Salt Polymer Electrolyte with In&#8208;Situ Electrolyte&#8208;Cathode Integration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;salt CSEs with electrolyte&#8208;cathode integrated structure is obtained via in&#8208;situ UV photopolymerization. The working mechanisms of a stable, robust and low&#8208;resistance SEI layer can be revealed by theoretical calculations and electrochemical characterization. The dual&#8208;salt CSEs show an enhanced performance for all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have attracted much attention due to their excellent flexibility, strong interfacial adhesion and good processibility. However, the incompatibility at the electrode/electrolyte interface often results in increased impedance and rapid capacity attenuation. In this work, dual&#8208;salt composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) with an integrated electrolyte/cathode structure are prepared by in&#8208;situ ultraviolet (UV) photopolymerization. With the addition of the lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB), a robust, stable and low&#8208;resistance solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is established during electrochemical reduction, eventually improving the overall performance of all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). The Li||Li symmetric cells with RTS&#8208;TH&#8208;2&#8201;% LiDFOB ASSLB exhibit stable cycling for over 2000&#8197;h at at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2@0.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. LiFePO4||Li cells deliver a high discharge capacity (155&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C) and cycling stability (with the retention rate of more than 90&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;C after 100 cycles) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a facile strategy to enhance electrodes compatibility with poly (ethylene glycol) acrylates (PEGAs)&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>Highly Efficient Separation of Toluene and n&#8208;Heptane by Amorphous Cucurbit[7]uril Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an environmentally friendly and low&#8208;energy adsorption separation method is proposed, which uses cucurbit[7]uril to efficiently separate toluene from toluene/n&#8208;heptane mixture with a purity of 99.65&#8201;% and can be reused, providing an innovative solution for the efficient utilization of petroleum resources.







Abstract
Separating toluene from n&#8208;heptane is a challenging task in the petroleum industry. Traditional methods face problems including elevated energy usage, intricate technical procedures, and residual extractants. Herein, we developed an environmentally friendly, low energy consuming and economically efficient adsorption separation method. This study employed cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) as an adsorbent to efficiently separate toluene from a mixture of toluene and n&#8208;heptane. The purity of toluene was obtained to be 99.38&#8201;% from the mixed vapors and 99.65&#8201;% from the mixed liquids. The kinetic experiment results demonstrate that the adsorption behavior of toluene was chemisorption. Density functional theory calculations show that the structure of toluene@Q[7] is more stable. In addition, vacuum heating can remove toluene from the Q[7] cavity, resulting in a guest&#8208;free Q[7], which can be repeated for the adsorption separation process without loss of performance. This study has the potential value of addressing the pressing need for efficient resource utilization in light of diminishing petroleum supplies.

         <title>The Cooperation of Pd center and Lewis Acid Sites to Achieve High Selectivity Towards Kinetic Carbonate Product for Oxidative Carbonylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two model catalysts, those are, Pd1@NaY with conjuct Pd center and Lewis acid sites, and Pd1@NaY&#8722;T with isolated Pd centers are synthesized and compared their catalytic performance for oxidative carbonylation reaction. Combined in&#8208;situ DRIFTS, and DFT calculation study reveals the cooperation mechanism of Pd and Lewis acid sites towards the carbonate products.







Abstract
Dimethyl carbonate and dimethyl oxalate are competitive products of the carbonylation reaction of methyl nitrite (MN) under Pd&#8208;based catalysts. The chemo&#8208;selectivity is influenced not just by the thermodynamic constraints of reaction conditions but also by the electronic structures of catalysts. Lewis acid sites are extensively employed to modulate the electronic structures of Pd active sites for kinetic carbonate production, but their precise role remains unclear. Herein, we employed a combination of reaction kinetic, in&#8197;situ DRIFTS experiments and DFT calculation, unveiling the indispensable role of Lewis acid sites in activating MN and facilitating the transfer of *OCH3 species, which is the key to obtain the kinetic carbonate outcome. The molecular understanding reveals the cooperation of Pd center and Lewis acid sites in directing selectivity towards carbonate product, which enables the rational design of higher&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>Programming Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalysis: Investigation of Synthesis Methods</title>

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrate significant potential as photocatalysts for hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. This work systematically evaluates four synthesis strategies &#8211; solvothermal, microwave, ultrasonic, and mechanochemical &#8211; to optimize TAPT&#8208;COF preparation, showing how different synthesis methods influence COF properties, and providing valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, porous materials with exceptional potential as high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for applications such as hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production. In this study, we systematically evaluates various synthesis methods to optimize the preparation of COFs, specifically targeting enhanced photocatalytic activity. Four different synthetic strategies including solvothermal synthesis, microwave synthesis, ultrasonic synthesis, and mechanochemical synthesis were explored to prepare TAPT&#8208;COF with identical molecular structures. Although all methods produced COFs with comparable crystallinity, porosity, and light absorption capacity, their photocatalytic efficiencies in hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production varied significantly. Notably, the mechanochemical method, which involves ball milling to disrupt interlayer interactions and produce COF nanosheets, exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance, particularly in the COF&#8208;BM&#8208;30&#8197;min sample. This difference highlights the importance of morphology in photocatalytic activity. Our findings shed light on the impact of synthesis methods on COF properties and provide valuable guidance for molecular strategy development and industrial applications in photocatalysis.

         <title>Systematic Analysis of False&#8208;Positive CH4 Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: The Role of Solvent and Reagent Decomposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>

In photocatalytic CO2 reduction, decomposition of solvents and sacrificial agents leads to CH4 production rather than CO2 reduction. Isotopic labeling experiments revealed that acetone, DMSO, and TEA decompose to produce CH4 at rates as high as 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1.







Abstract
Photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving carbon neutrality under mild reaction conditions. While methane (CH4) is widely regarded as a valuable target product in CO2 reduction studies, the reliability of such measurements can be compromised by unintended CH4 generation from solvent or sacrificial reagent decomposition during photoreactions. Herein, we systematically evaluate the stability of seven common solvents and five sacrificial reagents under visible&#8208;light irradiation (&#955; &gt;420&#8197;nm) in CO2&#8208;, air&#8208;, and N2&#8208;saturated atmosphere, employing three distinct photosensitizers. Notably, acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and triethylamine (TEA) were identified as high&#8208;risk reagents prone to photodecomposition, generating substantial CH4 yields of up to 2770&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1. Isotopic labeling experiments conclusively demonstrated that the source of CH4 originated from the solvents or sacrificial reagents rather than CO2. These findings highlight critical pitfalls in experimental design for photocatalytic CO2 reduction and emphasize the necessity of rigorous reagent screening to avoid artifactual methane production.

Self&#8208;supported three&#8208;dimensional flower&#8208;like Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anode materials with vanadium doping&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies were prepared by a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method, and synergistically interacted with SnO&#8322;&#8208;modified SnO&#8322;/CNTs anode materials to successfully construct high&#8208;performance hybrid supercapacitors.

Abstract
In this work, we present for the first time an innovative strategy to construct high&#8208;performance hybrid supercapacitors through the synergistic optimization of vanadium&#8208;doped self&#8208;supported three&#8208;dimensional Flower&#8208;like Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anodes and SnO&#8322;/CNTs composite anodes. The V&#8208;doped Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323; anode synthesized by a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal method combines vanadium doping&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies, lattice distortion effects and self&#8208;supporting properties of the three&#8208;dimensional floral structure, which enhances the specific surface area of the material to 190.58&#8197;m2/g, and obtains a high specific capacitance of 2,157&#8197;F/g at a current density of 1&#8197;A/g, and undergoes a 15&#8197;A/g After 10,000 cycles at 15&#8197;A/g, the capacitance retention rate is still 98.2&#8201;%. To address the limitations of traditional anode materials, SnO&#8322;/CNTs composites significantly reduce the charge transfer resistance (5.61&#8197;&#937;) and enhance the multiplicity performance by combining the high theoretical capacity of SnO&#8322; with the three&#8208;dimensional conductive network of CNTs. Based on this, the V&#8722;Fe&#8322;(MoO&#8324;)&#8323;//SnO&#8322;/CNTs hybrid supercapacitor achieves a high energy density of 151&#8197;Wh/kg at 3&#8197;A/g, which is a 30&#8211;60&#8201;% enhancement over the conventional molybdate capacitor, and maintains 96.2&#8201;% capacitance stability after 10,000 cycles. This provides a new idea for the development of energy storage devices with high energy density and long cycle life.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Development of a Covalent Inhibitor Targeting Streptococcus Pyogenes over Staphylococcus Aureus Sortase A</title>

The rational design of a selective SpSrtA inhibitor was guided by structural insights from the ML346/SpSrtA structure and the docked ML346/SaSrtA model. Our analysis revealed that head and tail clashes in the binding pocket indicated that reducing the &#8220;C=C&#8221; bond in ML346 could enhance selectivity for SpSrtA over SaSrtA. Through our SAR study, we identified T10 as a promising narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agent for combating S.&#8197;pyogenes infection.







Abstract
Sortase A (SrtA), a cysteine transpeptidase critical for surface protein anchoring in Gram&#8208;positive pathogens, represents an attractive antivirulence target. While covalent SrtA inhibitors show therapeutic potential, existing compounds lack species selectivity. Through structure&#8208;guided design, we developed T10, a covalent inhibitor selectively targeting Streptococcus pyogenes SrtA (SpSrtA) over Staphylococcus aureus SrtA (SaSrtA). Molecular docking revealed that shortening a &#8220;C=C&#8221; bond in lead compound ML346 eliminated SaSrtA inhibition due to steric hindrance from W194, while maintaining SpSrtA binding. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed T10&#8242;s covalent modification of Cys208 in SpSrtA. T10 demonstrated two fold enhanced inhibitory potency and species&#8208;specific disruption of M&#8208;protein anchoring and biofilm formation in Streptococcus pyogenes, without affecting Staphylococcus aureus viability. In a Galleria mellonella infection model, T10 conferred potent protection against lethal infection. This work demonstrates the development of narrow&#8208;spectrum antivirulence agents through a structure&#8208;based rational strategy.

         <title>Isolation and Characterization of [MnFe(CO)10]+: The Missing Link in the 3&#8201;d Dimetal Decacarbonyl Series</title>

Covalent or Lewis&#8208;Pair? The combination of the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; and Mn2(CO)10 yields the first heterodinuclear transition metal cation [MnFe(CO)10]+. With equally distributed charges, it makes the complex cation a borderline case between the covalent 2x17&#8197;VE and the Lewis&#8208;pair 16+18 VE electron counts. Hence, a case for grayscale opposing black and white settings.







Abstract
The heterodinuclear dimetal decacarbonyl cation [MnFe(CO)10]+ has been synthesized by combining the metalloradical [Fe(CO)5]+&#8901; with half an equivalent of Mn2(CO)10. The complex was subsequently isolated and characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction (scXRD), as well as IR, Raman, NMR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. Experimental results, complemented by DFT calculations of the relaxed force constants and an analysis of the electron density, reveal that the interaction between the two {M(CO)5} fragments in [MnFe(CO)10]+ is in between a covalent and a dative bond, representing a borderline case between the 2x17&#8197;VE and the 16+18&#8197;VE electron counting. Additionally, the known isoelectronic anion [CrMn(CO)10]&#8722; was prepared as its [PPN]+ salt and characterized for the first time by scXRD. These finding complete the series of structurally characterized isoelectronic dimetal decacarbonyls, spanning from [Cr2(CO)10]2&#8722; to [Fe2(CO)10]2+, the characteristics of all of which are compared based on experiment and theory.

These finding complete the series of structurally characterized isoelectronic dimetal decacarbonyls, spanning from [Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, the characteristics of all of which are compared based on experiment and theory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mimicking the CuD Site of pMMO via a Copper Cage&#8208;Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper cage complex is presented that mimics the CuD site of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). The CuD site has recently been proposed to be the activite site of pMMO. The cage complex presented here can catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones.







Abstract
The mechanism of action of particulate monooxygenase (pMMO) has yet to be determined. The CuD site with two histidines and an asparagine coordinating to copper has been identified as a potential active site of pMMO. Here, we present a copper cage complex, that assembles this coordination sphere, being a structural mimic of the pMMO. The cage is capable to catalyze aerobic oxidations of organic substrates such as benzylic alcohols to aldehydes and hydroquinones to quinones. This is inspired by the reactivity that is observed for enzymatic active sites possessing copper.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Containing Salen&#8208;Type Chromium Complexes for Selective Carbonylation of Epoxides: A Pathway to Polyesters and Cyclic Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates epoxide carbonylation using salen&#8208;type complexes with Co2(CO)8 to optimize the production of polyesters and cyclic lactones. [ONSO]&#8208;type Cr(III) favoured polyesters, while [ONNO]&#8208;type Cr(III) and Al(III) favoured cyclic lactones. Ethylene oxide carbonylation highlighted the role of catalyst structure, with the [ONNO] type achieving &gt;99% propiolactone selectivity. The results emphasize the influence of ligand design on selectivity, thus facilitating the development of catalytic systems.







Abstract
Carbonylation, a pivotal process in efficient C1 conversion, facilitates the direct incorporation of carbon monoxide into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals. This study investigates the carbonylation of epoxides using salen&#8208;type complexes with varying metal centers and tetradentate dianionic ligands, in conjunction with Co2(CO)8, to optimize selectivity and yield in the production of polyesters and cyclic lactones. The [ONSO]&#8208;type Cr(III) complexes exhibited a pronounced preference for polyester formation, achieving a selectivity of 73&#8201;%. This preference is attributed to the electron&#8208;donating sulfur donors, which stabilize the growing polymer chain. In contrast, [ONNO]&#8208;type complexes with Cr(III) and Al(III) predominantly yielded cyclic lactones (99&#8201;% &#946;&#8208;butyrolactone selectivity), owing to their enhanced electrophilicity that favors the backbiting process. Detailed analyses of ethylene oxide carbonylation underscored the crucial role of catalyst structure in determining reaction pathways and product distribution. Notably, [ONNO]&#8208;type complexes with Cr(III) and Al(III) exhibited over 99&#8201;% propiolactone selectivity during the carbonylation of ethylene oxide, highlighting the significance of catalyst design in optimizing chemical reactions. These results provide valuable insights into the role of ligand design in controlling the selectivity and efficiency of epoxide carbonylation, paving the way for the development of more effective catalytic systems.

         <title>Atmospheric Ignition Chemistry of Green Hypergolic Bipropellant 1&#8208;Ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;Methylimidazolium Cyanoborohydride &#8211; Hydrogen Peroxide in an Acoustic Levitator: Exploring a Potent Universal Propellant</title>

Can hypergolic ionic liquid &#8211; oxidizer combination be universal green propellant? Comprehensive experimental study exploiting droplet merging technique inside an acoustic levitator process chamber reveals such feasibility via comparing the hypergolic and atmospheric ignition reactions through the identification of products and reactive intermediates in&#8197;situ.







Abstract
Hypergolic ionic liquids (HILs) represent a critical pool of reactive ionic liquids which ignite spontaneously in absence of oxygen when mixed with an oxidizer such as white fuming nitric acid (WFNA, HNO3) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These HILs have emerged as greener alternatives to the toxic hydrazine family of fuels for operations in space under anaerobic conditions. Here, we report on the unusual atmospheric ignition chemistry of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cyanoborohydride ([EMIM][CBH])&#8208;H2O2 bipropellant while comparing with the parent hypergolic reaction by exploiting a chirped&#8208;pulse triggered droplet merging technique in an ultrasonic levitation apparatus under controlled environment. Significant enhancements of the ignition performance and noticeable differences of product distribution in the simulated atmosphere containing molecular oxygen are revealed. The critical mechanistic role of the surrounding oxygen plausibly involves the reaction with a suitable intermediate (iminomethyl)boronic acid, [(HO)2BCH=NH] formed in the initial reactions of the IL and H2O2 which eventually generates catalytic hydroperoxyl (&#8901;HO2) and hydroxyl (&#8901;OH) radicals &#8208; further promoting the ignition reaction. This systematic case study conceptually demonstrates that under atmospheric conditions, well&#8208;defined HIL &#8208; oxidizer combinations provide excellent ignition performance and effectively be used as universal fuel both in space and in the terrestrial atmosphere simplifying the multistage propulsion system.

         <title>Enhanced Glycerol Oxidation Toward Dihydroxyacetone Over Gold/Palladium Binary Nanocatalysts by Structure Control</title>

         <dc:description>
Supported AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, Au&#8722;Pd Janus particle and Au+Pd mixture catalysts with different configurations were prepared to selectively oxidize GLY toward DHA, in which AuPd/CNT catalyst with the strongest interaction between the Au and Pd atoms afforded the superior catalytic performance.







Abstract
Gold/palladium binary catalysts have been widely used to the selective oxidation of glycerol to produce value&#8208;added chemicals. However, the essential effect of the structure of Au/Pd binary catalysts on the catalytic performance has not been elucidated yet. In this work, Au, Pd, AuPd alloy, Au@Pd core&#8208;shell, and Au&#8722;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts prepared by sol&#8208;immobilization and photochemical deposition methods were employed to the selective oxidation of glycerol toward dihydroxyacetone (DHA). The results showed that the activation of glycerol and oxygen molecule was significantly promoted with the appropriate interaction between Au and Pd atoms. That was, the turnover frequency of glycerol and DHA generation rate over the alloyed AuPd nanoparticles were remarkably higher than those of Au@Pd core&#8208;shell and Au&#8722;Pd Janus nanoparticle catalysts. It was due to the synergistic effect of Pd and Au atoms remarkably promoted the electron transfer from Pd to Au, resulting in increasing the activity of the exposed Au sites, and moderately inhibiting the activity of the exposed Pd sites, which benefited to generate DHA rapidly. After optimizing, up to 61&#8201;% yield of DHA was achieved at 87&#8201;% glycerol conversion over the alloyed AuPd catalyst.

         <title>Luminescent Trityl&#8208;based Diradicaloids: A Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Charge&#8208;Resonance in Low&#8208;Lying Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lowest&#8208;lying excited states of the TTM&#8208;derived diradicals cannot be related to those of TTM: new low&#8208;lying excited states emerge, corresponding to charge resonance between the two radical units, the lowest one being a dark state for symmetric diradicals. Different approaches than those used for TTM radicals are needed to achieve high PLQY in TTM&#8208;derived diradicals.







Abstract
The tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low&#8208;lying excited states by fine&#8208;tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a combined theoretical and experimental investigation to elucidate the origin of their luminescence. The theoretical analysis explores a series of symmetric TTM&#8208;derived diradicals with singlet ground state and increasingly longer &#960;&#8208;conjugated spacers between radical moieties, focussing on the nature of the lowest excited electronic states governing their photophysics. The study is complemented by a complete spectroscopic characterization of the TTM&#8208;TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure exploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The diradicals feature two novel low&#8208;lying excited states, absent in TTM, arising from charge resonance (CR) between the radical units. The lowest CR state is characterized by the H,H&#8594;L,L double excitation (DE) and is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue&#8208;shifted emission observed by increasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM&#8208;ph&#8208;TTM. This insight suggests different design strategies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM&#8208;derived diradicals.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Catalysed Formation of Hydrocarbon Scaffolds from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogs with Shifted Double Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new geranylgeranyl diphosphate analogs with shifted double bonds were synthesized and together with the known analog iso&#8208;GGPP I converted with 14 diterpene synthases. While two substrate analogs were not accepted by the enzymes, the other three analogs yielded compounds with skeletons that are not observed in nature. Mechanistic key steps were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments and computational chemistry.







Abstract
Four analogs of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) with shifted double bonds were synthesised and enzymatically converted with 14 diterpene synthases of previously reported function, including two newly characterised homologs of the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene synthase Bnd4 and the venezuelaene synthase VenA. In successful cases the products were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy, revealing the formation of various diterpenoids with skeletons that have not been reported from natural sources. Isotopic labelling experiments in conjunction with DFT calculations were performed to give insights into hydride migrations in the biosynthesis of the non&#8208;natural diterpenes benditerpe&#8208;2,7(19),15&#8208;triene and venezuelaxenene and their natural counterparts from GGPP.

The molecular structures of the complexes [CrMn(CO)10]&#8722; and [MnFe(CO)10]+ complete the series of dimetal decacarbonyls reaching from [Cr2(CO)10]2&#8722; to [Fe2(CO)10]2+. In our interpretation of the Wanderer above the Sea of Fog, a chemist is hiking through the dimetal&#8208;decacarbonyl landscape, discovering the hidden heterodinuclear complexes in the fog. The fog also highlights the misty borderline situation between covalent and Lewis&#8208;pair bonding, onto which light is ornately shed. In the background, the vibrational mountain range of the title compound shows its peaks. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Krossing and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500489).

         <title>Radionuclide&#8208;Activated Luminescence for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL) is a versatile platform that enables simultaneous optical imaging and tumor phototherapy, offering significant potential to bridge the gap between radiotheranostics and phototheranostics. This review presents diverse RL probes categorized by their activation mechanisms, emphasizes their applications in cancer theranostics, and provides a comprehensive insight into RL technology to accelerate its clinical translation.







Abstract
Within dielectric media, charged particles emitted from medical radionuclides induce polarization of surrounding molecules, which subsequently generate Cerenkov luminescence (CL) upon returning to their ground state. This CL emission confers clinically approved radiotracers with distinctive potential for applications in phototheranostics. However, the utility of CL in&#8197;vivo has been severely constrained by its ultraviolet&#8208;weighted emission spectrum and extremely low photon flux, particularly in living imaging and triggering photodynamic therapy. Certain optical probes, encompassing fluorescent agents and nanoparticle scintillators, can be activated by radionuclides to generate red&#8208;shifted emissions with amplified luminescence intensity compared to CL. This phenomenon, termed radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (RL), represents a promising strategy for enhancing radionuclide&#8208;induced tumor phototheranostic outcomes. This review systematically summarizes the advances in RL technology, highlighting the development of various RL probes and their innovative applications in laser&#8208;free optical bioimaging and cancer phototherapy. It further delves into the confronting challenges and prospects of RL technology, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview and practical insights to advance the integration of radiotheranostics and phototheranostics in clinical practice.

         <title>Exploring n&#8208;&#960;* Electronic Transitions in Graphitic Carbon Nitride: Fundamentals, Strategies, and Photocatalytic Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>

This review highlights recent advancements in modulating n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 to extend its absorption edge and enhance photocatalytic activity. It covers mechanisms, strategies, and photocatalytic applications in hydrogen generation, CO2 other energy&#8208;related processes, and future research directions.







Abstract
Photocatalysis utilizes solar energy to drive redox reactions, offering a promising solution to global energy and environmental challenges. Up to now, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has been widely studied due to its unique organic structural framework and favourable electronic properties. However, its photocatalytic efficiency is often constrained by a limited light absorption range (up to ~460&#8197;nm) and modest charge&#8208;carrier mobility. Recent findings suggest that n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions can extend the absorption edge of g&#8208;C3N4 to approximately 600&#8197;nm, enhancing the activity. Herein, we first outline the fundamental structural and electronic features of g&#8208;C3N4, highlighting the role of both n&#8208;&#960;* electronic transitions. We then provide a comprehensive overview of various strategies for activating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions, emphasizing the necessity of distorting the planar and symmetric tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units to enable this transition. The subsequent sections demonstrate how modulating n&#8208;&#960;* transitions can broaden the light absorption spectrum and facilitate more efficient charge separation, thereby enhancing photocatalytic processes. Finally, we propose potential future directions for exploiting n&#8208;&#960;* transitions to further advance g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This review aims to fill a gap in the literature by providing a focused summary of n&#8208;&#960;* transitions in g&#8208;C3N4 and their significance for sustainable energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Tandem ADMET and CAMMP to Access Degradable Thermosets and Multiblock Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of degradable polymers and multiblock copolymeric (MBCPs) compatibilizers represents an appealing strategy to address ever&#8208;growing concerns for treating waste plastics of traditional chemical degradation or mechanical recycling. Although recent advancements in cyclic&#8208;acyclic monomers metathesis polymerization (CAMMP) and tandem olefin metathesis polymerization (TOMP) have recently been reported to produce degradable polymers and MBCPs via copolymerization of cyclic monomers with acyclic diene comonomers, there have been no reports of preparing high&#8208;performance thermosetting materials and multi&#8208;block copolymers within the same polymerization system solely through the selection of cycloolefin monomers. To achieve this objective, a tandem olefin metathesis polymerization system has been designed that combines acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization of diene comonomers followed by CAMMP with cyclic olefin monomers (dicyclopentadiene DCPD or cyclooctene COE). The selection of different cyclic olefin monomers provided access to degradable cross&#8208;linked thermosets and multi&#8208;block copolymers. Notably, this one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step process is highly efficient and requires the addition of only one metathesis catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni(OH)x/Ni&#8208;Catalyzed In&#8208;Situ Hydrogenation and Ethanol Ethoxylation of 2&#8208;Methylfuran for Renewable Biofuel Co&#8208;Upgrading</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioethanol and furanics are currently prevailing additives to fossil&#8208;based transportation fuels. With the objective to lift the longstanding limitations of these biofuel additives, this work reports for the first time the synthesis of 2&#8208;Ethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF) as a co&#8208;upgraded fuel by reacting ethanol with 2&#8208;methylfuran (2&#8208;MF). The formation of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF is achieved through ethanol ethoxylation of 2&#8208;MF, enabled by a reverse Ni(OH)x/Ni catalyst under hydrogen pressure. Nickel hydroxide species over the Ni nanoparticles play a crucial role in activating ethanol and polarizing the partially hydrogenated dihydrofuran intermediates, favorably steering the reaction selectively toward the ethoxylation product. The reaction conditions, including pressure and temperature, are systematically optimized to enhance the yield of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF, and provide a mean to beneficially tune the fuel compositions consisting mainly of 2&#8208;EO&#8208;2&#8208;MTHF and 2&#8208;MTHF, both are high energy density molecules. Importantly, the reverse Ni(OH)x&#8208;Ni catalyst allows a one&#8208;pot process to accomplish consecutive partial hydrogenation of 2&#8208;MF and ethanol ethoxylation. This work provides a practical strategy for upgrading biomass&#8208;derived polar primary fuel molecules into more versatile fuels and chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Prediction of Reactivity and Additive Selection for C(sp2)&#8211;(Hetero)atom Bond Couplings in an Adaptive Dynamic Homogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Under visible light&#8208;driven redox conditions, employing transition&#8208;metal catalysis provides a powerful platform for constructing C(sp&#178;)&#8211;(hetero)atom bonds. Although these reactions are highly significant, they require precise optimization of reaction parameters. K&#246;nig, Ghosh and colleagues introduced an adaptive dynamic homogeneous catalysis (AD&#8208;HoC) platform that furnishes robust, high&#8208;yield conditions for photocatalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The AD&#8208;HoC system eliminates the need to optimize catalysts, ligands, and bases; instead, it achieves C(sp&#178;)&#8211;(hetero)atom bond coupling by merely altering additives and substrate molecules. Leveraging the predictability of reaction conditions within the AD&#8208;HoC system, machine learning offers a method to evaluate the reactivity of substrate combinations and the categories of additives. Our research integrates high&#8208;throughput quantum mechanical calculations with cheminformatics approaches to explore the reactivity of substrate combinations and the selection of additives within the AD&#8208;HoC system. Further data&#8208;driven analysis reveals that the electronic characteristics of electrophiles and the geometric characteristics of nucleophiles are key factors regulating reactivity within the AD&#8208;HoC system. Herein, we present an end&#8208;to&#8208;end tool for prediction starting from the SMILES representation. This work demonstrates the collaborative use of computational statistics and machine learning to predict the reactivity and reaction conditions of substrate combinations, thereby enhancing the precision and efficiency of synthetic processes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report an elegant method for the construction of fused pyrrole rings via palladium&#8208;catalyzed reactions of aryl iodides with N&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynylated 3&#8208;aminobenzofurans/3&#8208;aminoindoles leading to the general synthesis of benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles/pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles &#160;via 3&#8208;(arylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro intermediates. Exposing the intermediates to DDQ delivered benzofuro[3,2&#8208;b]indoles (BFIs) &#160;and indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indoles (IIs) containing&#160; vicinal cyano groups. These transformations constitute a rapid intermolecular assembly through several carbon&#8722;carbon bond forming reactions, involving a single electron transfer (SET) process in the crucial steps. Photophysical studies of selected products identified promising candidates for future applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Release by the Rotaxane and Pseudorotaxane Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 23, April 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the employment of rotaxane and pseudorotaxane architecture in the controlled release of target molecules both in solution and in the solid state. The properties conferred by the mechanical bond allow precise control over the release mechanism, thus leading to new forms of molecular cargo delivery when rotaxane&#8208;based systems are employed.







Abstract
The controlled release of target molecules is a relevant application in several areas, such as medicine, fragrance chemistry and catalysis. Systems which pursue this implementation require a fine&#8208;tune of the start and rate of the release, among other properties. In this scenario, rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems are postulated as ideal scaffolds to accomplish a precise cargo release, due to the special features provided by the intertwined arrangement. This short review covers advances towards the controlled release of different molecules using rotaxane&#8208; and pseudorotaxane&#8208;based systems, both in solution and in the solid state.
