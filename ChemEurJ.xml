      <title>Gold(I) Complexation of the Phosphanoxy&#8208;Substituted Phosphaalkenes for the Activation&#8208;Free LAuCl Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The phosphanoxy&#8208;substituted phosphaalkene bearing the P=C&#8211;O&#8211;P skeleton can be prepared from diphosphene Mes*P=PMes* (Mes* = 2,4,6&#8208;  t  Bu  3  C  6  H  2  ), and the use for catalysis is of interest. In this paper, complexation of the phosphanoxy&#8208;substituted phosphaalkenes with gold are investigated, and the catalytic activity of the mono&#8208; and bis(chlorogold) complexes are subsequently evaluated. Reaction of the P=C&#8211;O&#8211;P compound with (tht)AuCl (tht = tetrahydrothiophene) showed dominant coordination on the sp  3  phosphorus, and complete coordination on the sp  2  phosphorus required removal of tetrahydrothiophene. Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules (AIM) analysis based on the X&#8208;ray structure of the chlorogold complex indicated pseudo coordinating interaction between the gold centre and the P=C unit. The bis(chlorogold) complexes indicated the conformational isomerism, and catalyzed cycloisomerization/alkoxyclization of 1,6&#8208;enyne and for hydration of terminal alkyne without the activation treatment. Even the mono(chlorogold) complexes catalyzed the alkoxycyclization reaction without silver co&#8208;catalyst, indicating that the alcohols were effective for the activation of AuCl unit</dc:description>

      <title>Dithieno[a,e]pentalenes: Highly Antiaromatic Yet Stable &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems without Bulky Substituents</title>
      <dc:description>Dithieno[a,e]penalenes (DTPs) with various substituents were synthesized as a class of antiaromatic compounds. Annulation of thiophene rings imparts the pentalene moiety with high thermal stability even without bulky substituents, while retaining antiaromaticity. The higher magnitude of antiaromaticity in DTPs, in addition to the differences in the electronic structures of the fused aromatic rings, resulted in a narrower HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap than that of the corresponding dibenzo[a,e]pentalene analog, giving rise to red&#8208;shifted electronic absorption that reaches the near&#8208;infrared region. Moreover, systematic investigations on the solid&#8208;state packing structure revealed that DTPs prefer offset face&#8208;to&#8208;face packing motifs rather than face&#8208;centered &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. In particular, the thienyl&#8208;substituted DTP bearing hydrophilic side chains exhibited thermochromic behavior in polar solvents, which was ascribed to the formation of aggregates.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantification of Non&#8208;covalent Interactions in Azide&#8208;Pnictogen, &#8208;Chalcogen, and &#8208;Halogen Contacts</title>
      <dc:description>The non&#8208;covalent interaction between azide and oxygen containing moieties is investigated by a computational study based on&#160; experimental findings. Targeted synthesis of organic compounds with close intramolecular azide&#8208;oxygen contacts yielded six new representatives, for which X&#8208;ray structures were determined. Two of those compounds were investigated with respect to their potential conformations in the gas&#8208;phase and a possible significantly short azide&#8208;oxygen contact. Furthermore, a set of 44 high&#8208;quality gas&#8208;phase computational model systems with intermolecular azide&#8208;pnictogen (N, P, As, Sb), chalcogen (O, S, Se, Te), and &#8208;halogen (F, Cl, Br, I) contacts is compiled and investigated by semi&#8208;empirical quantum mechanical methods, density functional approximations and wave function theory. A local energy decomposition analysis is applied to study the nature of the non&#8208;covalent interaction. The special role of electrostatic and London dispersion interactions is discussed in detail. London dispersion is identified as a dominant factor of the&#160;azide&#8208;donor interaction with mean London dispersion energyinteraction energy ratios of 1.3. Electrostatic contributions enhance the azide&#8208;donor coordination motif. The association energies range from &#8208; 1.00 to &#8208; 5.5 kcal &#183; mol  &#8208; 1  .</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Morpholine&#8208;Based Analogs of (&#8722;)&#8208;Zampanolide and Their Biological Activity</title>

The synthesis of the common functionalized morpholine building block involved two consecutive epoxide openings with tosylamide and the product of the first opening reaction, respectively, as nucleophiles.

      <title>Towards Photochromic Azobenzene&#8208;Based Inhibitors for Tryptophan Synthase</title>
      <dc:description>Light&#8208;regulation of drug molecules has gained growing interest in the fields of biochemical and pharmacological research in recent years. In addition, a serious need for novel molecular targets of antibiotics has emerged presently. Here, we present the development of a photo&#8208;controllable, azobenzene&#8208;based antibiotic precursor towards tryptophan synthase (TS), an essential metabolic multienzyme complex in bacteria. The compound exhibited a medium&#8208;strong inhibition of TS in its  E  configuration, and a 5&#8208;fold lower inhibition strength in its  Z  configuration. Using a combination of biochemical, crystallographic, and computational analyses we characterized the inhibition mode of this compound. Remarkably, binding of the inhibitor to a hitherto not considered cavity causes an unproductive conformation of TS leading to non&#8208;competitive inhibition of tryptophan production. In conclusion, we created a promising lead compound for the combat of bacterial diseases, which targets an essential metabolic enzyme, and whose inhibition strength can be controlled with light.</dc:description>

      <title>Development of ADPribosyl ubiquitin analogs to study enzymes involved in Legionella infection</title>
      <dc:description>Legionnaires&#8217; disease is caused by infection with the intracellularly replicating gram&#8208;negative bacterium Legionella pneumophila . This pathogen uses an unconventional way of ubiquitinating host proteins by generating a phosphoribosyl&#8208;linkage between substrate proteins and ubiquitin making use of an ADPribosylated ubiquitin (Ub ADPr ) intermediate.

      <title>Structural Transformations and Spin&#8208;Crossover in [FeL2]2+&#160;Salts (L = 4&#8208;{tertbutylsulfanyl}&#8208;2,6&#8208;di{pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl}pyridine) &#8722; the Influence of Bulky Ligand Substituents</title>
      <dc:description>4&#8208;(Tert&#8208;butylsulfanyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;di(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine (L) was obtained in low yield from a one&#8208;pot reaction of 2,4,6&#8208;trifluoropyridine with 2&#8208;methylpropane&#8208;2&#8208;thiolate and sodium pyrazolate in a 1:1:2 ratio. The materials [FeL2][BF4]2&#183;solv (1[BF4]2&#183;solv) and [FeL2][ClO4]2&#183;solv (1[ClO4]2&#183;solv; solv = MeNO2, MeCN or Me2CO) exhibit a variety of structures and spin&#8208;state behaviors including thermal spin&#8208;crossover (SCO). Solvent loss on heating  1[BF4]2&#183;xMeNO2&#160;(x  &#8776; 2.3) occurs in two steps. The intermediate phase exhibits hysteretic SCO around 250 K, involving a &#8220;reverse&#8208;SCO&#8221; step in its warming cycle at a scan rate of 5 Kmin&#8210;1. The reverse&#8208;SCO is not observed in a slower 1 Kmin&#8210;1  measurement, however, confirming its kinetic nature.

The materials [FeL2][BF4]2&#183;solv (1[BF4]2&#183;solv) and [FeL2][ClO4]2&#183;solv (1[ClO4]2&#183;solv; solv = MeNO2, MeCN or Me2CO) exhibit a variety of structures and spin&#8208;state behaviors including thermal spin&#8208;crossover (SCO). Solvent loss on heating  1[BF4]2&#183;xMeNO2&#160;(x  &#8776; 2.3) occurs in two steps. The intermediate phase exhibits hysteretic SCO around 250 K, involving a &#8220;reverse&#8208;SCO&#8221; step in its warming cycle at a scan rate of 5 Kmin&#8210;1. The reverse&#8208;SCO is not observed in a slower 1 Kmin&#8210;1  measurement, however, confirming its kinetic nature.

      <title>Generation of oxidoreductases with dual alcohol dehydrogenase and amine dehydrogenase activity</title>
      <dc:description>The l&#8208;lysine&#8208;&#949;&#8208;dehydrogenase (LysEDH) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus naturally catalyzes the oxidative deamination of the &#949;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine. We previously engineered this enzyme to create amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) variants that possess a new hydrophobic cavity in their active site such that aromatic ketones can bind and be converted into &#945;&#8208;chiral amines with excellent enantioselectivity. We also recently observed that LysEDH was capable of reducing aromatic aldehydes into primary alcohols. Herein, we harnessed the promiscuous alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity of LysEDH to create new variants that exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for the reduction of substituted benzaldehydes and arylaliphatic aldehydes to primary alcohols. Notably, these novel engineered dehydrogenases also catalyzed the reductive amination of a variety of aldehydes and ketones with excellent enantioselectivity, thus exhibiting a dual AmDH/ADH activity. We envisioned that the catalytic bi&#8208;functionality of these enzymes could be applied for the direct conversion of alcohols into amines. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, we performed an unprecedented one&#8208;pot &#8220;hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8221; cascade to convert benzyl alcohol to benzylamine using a single enzyme. Conducting the same biocatalytic cascade in the presence of cofactor recycling enzymes (i.e., NADH&#8208;oxidase and formate dehydrogenase) increased the reaction yields. In summary, this work provides the first examples of enzymes showing &#8220;alcohol aminase&#8221; activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamic Helicates Self&#8208;Assembly from Homo&#8208; and Heterotopic Dynamic Covalent Ligand Strands</title>
      <dc:description>
Keep it dynamic: The dynamic nature of the helical systems offers an additional level of complexity by combining self&#8208;sorting on two levels: 1)&#8197;the build&#8208;up of the ligand strand constituents from their components through dynamic covalent chemistry; 2)&#8197;the assembly of the helicates from the ligands and the metal cations through dynamic metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
The understanding and the application of reversible covalent reactions and coordination chemistry together with the proper design of the molecular frameworks, allow to achieve not only well&#8208;defined output architectures but also different grades of complex behavior. In this work, the dynamic nature of the helical systems offers an additional level of complexity by combining self&#8208;sorting on two levels: 1)&#8197;the build&#8208;up of the ligand strand constituents from their components through dynamic covalent chemistry; 2)&#8197;the assembly of the helicates from the ligands and the metal cations through dynamic metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry. The information encoded in the ligands constituent molecule was read differently (and accurately at the same time) by metal cations that varied in the coordination algorithms. It enabled the selective formation of a specific type of helicates from a wide library of helicates formed by the possible combination of subcomponents. Ligands containing dynamic tridentate and/or bidentate binding motifs in the same strand were studied to explore the helicates self&#8208;assembly with appropriate metal cations.

The 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl is the origin of the profound structural and dynamical differences between RNA and DNA. By solving the single&#8208;crystal structures of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenosine and 2&#8208;aminoadenosine, this work aims to deepen the understanding of the intrinsic contributions of the 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl in nucleosides at the monomeric level.

     alt="Intrinsic Contributions of 2&#8242;&#8208;Hydroxyl to the Hydration of Nucleosides at the Monomeric Level"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl&lt;/b&gt; is the origin of the profound structural and dynamical differences between RNA and DNA. By solving the single&#8208;crystal structures of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenosine and 2&#8208;aminoadenosine, this work aims to deepen the understanding of the intrinsic contributions of the 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl in nucleosides at the monomeric level. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D. Bai, H. Zhao, et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.20200283510.1002/chem.202002835&lt;/a&gt;).

      <dc:description>
Electrochemical conversion of toxic nitrite using thin film MOF: A thin film of metalloporphyrin MOF was deposited on Carbon Fiber Paper (CFP) for electrochemical oxidation of nitrite. Metalloporphyrinic MOFs with Ni2+ active species at porphyrin ligand provided the highest electrochemical performance with a current density of 950&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The reaction mechanism and role of the active metal species at the porphyrin ligand were elucidated by XANES and XPS techniques. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.

      <title>Combining Photodeprotection and Ligation into a Dual&#8208;Color Gated Reaction System</title>
      <dc:description>
Key wavelengths controlling a dual&#8208;gated one&#8208;pot reaction are paramount for the development of novel printing techniques. The visible&#8208;light gate activates the photocatalyzed deprotection of a dithioacetal leading to a o&#8208;methylbenzaldehyde. Upon the opening of the UV light gate, the o&#8208;methylbenzaldehyde undergoes a light&#8208;mediated Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with a dienophile. This dual&#8208;gated system represents a step closer to two&#8208;color wavelength&#8208;activated photoresists. More information can be found in the Communication by J.&#8197;P. Blinco, C. Barner&#8208;Kowollik, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003546).

On first sight, it may seem quite surprising that such an ancient class or organic coupling reactions (Gabriel, Ullmann, Goldberg, Buchwald, Hartwig and many others) has so few enantioselective solutions, and this in spite of asymmetric synthesis being now a mature concept and field. Why should enantioselective C&#8212;N bond formation be so difficult? This question and some of the first examples that promise an imminent change of paradigm are herein discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhancement of Photocatalytic Activity for Hydrogen Production by Surface Modification of Pt&#8208;TiO2 Nanoparticles with a Double Layer of Photosensitizers</title>
      <dc:description>To investigate the effect of the surface structure of dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalyst nanoparticles, we prepared three types of Ru(II)&#8208;photosensitizer(PS)&#8208;double&#8208;layered Pt&#8208;cocatalyst&#8208;loaded TiO  2  nanoparticles with different surface structures, Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  ,  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  , and  RuCP  2  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  (  N  = 0.2, 1, and 5), and evaluated their photocatalytic H  2  evolution activity in the presence of redox&#8208;reversible iodide (I  &#8208;  ) as the electron donor. Although the driving force of the electron injection from I  &#8208;  to the photooxidized Ru(III) PS is comparable, the activity increased in the following order:  RuCP  2  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  &lt;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  &lt; Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  . The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  in the first hour reached 1%.

Our results indicate that the surface modification of dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalysts is a promising approach to enhance the photocatalytic activity with various redox mediators.</dc:description>

This review details the chemistry of heavier pnictogen&#8208;functionalised C1 ligands, MCARn (A = P, As, Sb, Bi; n = 0&#8208;3), including their syntheses, properties and reactivities, and how these are distinguished from more traditional carbyne complexes.

Substantial changes in the pre&#8208;edge peak intensities were observed that tracked with the V 3d&#8208;electron count. The data also suggested substantial delocalization between the vanadium cations. Meanwhile, the FeIII cations were electronically isolated from the polyoxovanadate core.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Expansion of Chalcogenido Tetrelates in Ionic Liquids by Incorporation of Sulfido Antimonate Units</title>
      <dc:description>
The incorporation of Sb atoms into sulfido germanate and sulfido stannate frameworks, which is reflected by notable narrowing of the optical band gaps of the solid compounds, was realized by ionothermal treatment, and thus reconstruction, of potassium salts of [SnS4]4&#8722; or [Ge4S10]4&#8722; anions with SbCl3 in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids. The image illustrates the highly symmetrical arrangement of one [GeS4]4&#8722; unit and six [Ge2Sb2S7]2&#8722; units in the anionic substructure of one of the title compounds.

      <title>Photocontrolled DNA origami assembly using two photoswitches</title>
      <dc:description>Stimuli responsive switching molecules have been widely investigated for the purpose of mechanical control of biomolecules. The recently developed arylazopyrazole (AAP) shows photoisomerization activity, displaying faster response to light induced conformational change and unique absorption spectral properties different from the conventionally used azobenzene. Here, we demonstrate that AAP can be used as a photoswitching molecule to control photo&#8208;induced assembly and disassembly of DNA origami nanostructures. We designed and constructed AAP&#8208;modified DNA origami. We observed the repeated assembly and disassembly of AAP&#8208;modified X&#8208;shaped DNA origami and hexagonal origami with counterpart complementary strands using alternative UV and visible light irradiation. Closed and linear assemblies of AAP&#8208;modified X&#8208;shaped origami were successfully formed by photoirradiation, and more than 1 &#181;m linear assemblies were formed. Finally, we showed that the two photoswitches, AAP and azobenzene, can be used in tandem to independently control different assembly configurations using different irradiation wavelengths. AAP can extend the variety of available wavelengths of photoswitches and stably work for assembly and disassembly of various DNA origami nanostructures.</dc:description>

      <title>Flexible yet Robust Framework of Tin(II) Oxide Carbodiimide for Reversible Lithium Storage</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can become promising electrode materials for advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), because their loosely&#8208;packed porous structures may mitigate volume expansion and metal atom aggregation which occur to the respective metal oxides. However, they suffer from poor electrical conductivity and irreversible structural degradation upon charge/discharge processes, which impede their practical utilization. Herein, we investigate MOF&#8208;like Sn2O(CN2) as a new electrode material. The conductive yet flexible [N=C=N] linkers are tilted between [Sn4O] nodes and cross&#8208;linked into a porous quasi&#8208;layered structure. Such structure offers abundant channels for fast Li&#8208;ion transport and tolerance of enormous volume expansion. Notably, anisotropic [N=C=N]2&#8722; arrays hardly migrate so that Sn0 nanodots are physically separated via robust [N=C=N]2&#8722; framework during discharge process, thereby effectively preventing the formation of large Sn islands. Owing to the structural advantage, the Sn2O(CN2) electrode exhibits high initial Coulombic efficiency as ~80%. With the addition of graphite as conductive supporter, the electrode provides 978 mA h g&#8722;1 at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 even after 300 cycles. Such MOF&#8208;like carbodiimides hold potential for the advanced electrodes in LIBs and other battery systems.</dc:description>

Notably, anisotropic [N=C=N]2&#8722; arrays hardly migrate so that Sn0 nanodots are physically separated via robust [N=C=N]2&#8722; framework during discharge process, thereby effectively preventing the formation of large Sn islands. Owing to the structural advantage, the Sn2O(CN2) electrode exhibits high initial Coulombic efficiency as ~80%. With the addition of graphite as conductive supporter, the electrode provides 978 mA h g&#8722;1 at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 even after 300 cycles. Such MOF&#8208;like carbodiimides hold potential for the advanced electrodes in LIBs and other battery systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Frontispiece: Photoredox Organic Synthesis Employing Heterogeneous Photocatalysts with Emphasis on Halide Perovskite</title>
      <dc:description>
Heterogeneous photocatalysts employed in the field of visible light induced complex photoredox organic synthesis is reviewed by Yong Yan et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;13118&#8197;ff., with specific emphasis on halide perovskite based photoredox chemistry. They introduce the important photochemical and photophysical properties that govern a photoredox process. The latest progress regarding heterogeneous photocatalysis especially the perovskite based photocatalytic organic synthesis are summarized. They rationalize the great potential of halide perovskite for being the possible replacement of current noble metal based photocatalysts in terms of photophysical properties, band tuning, price, substrate activation, TON, etc., and its potential for being industrialized in future pharmaceutical synthesis application. They also discuss the current existing issue of perovskite photocatalysts and provide some perspectives of future research directions.

      <dc:description>The 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme is an artificially developed Mg2+&#8208;dependent catalytic oligonucleotide that can cleave a RNA substrate in a sequence&#8208;specific fashion. In this study, we designed new split 10&#8208;23 DNAzymes made of two non&#8208;functional fragments, the first one carrying a boronic acid group at its 5' end, while the other one is composed of a ribonucleotide at its 3' end. We demonstrate herein that the addition of Mg2+ ions leads to the assembly of the fragments, which in turn induces the formation of a new boronate internucleoside linkage that restores the DNAzyme activity. A systematic evaluation has been performed that identified the most performant system.

      <title>N&#8208;truncated A&#946; peptides impact on Cu and Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;generated ROS: Cu(I) matters !</title>
      <dc:description>The  in vitro  Cu(A&#946;  1&#8208;x  ) induced ROS production has been extensively and thoroughly studied. Conversely, the ability of N&#8208;truncated isoforms of A&#946; to alter the Cu&#8208;induced ROS production has been overlooked even though they are main constituents of amyloid plaques found in the human brain. N&#8208;truncated peptides at the positions 4 and 11 (A&#946;  4&#8208;x  and A&#946;  11&#8208;x  ) contain an amino&#8208;terminal copper and nickel (ATCUN) binding motif (NH  2  &#8208;Xxx&#8208;Zzz&#8208;His) that confer them different coordination sites and higher affinities for Cu(II) compared to the A&#946; peptide. It has further been proposed that the role of A&#946;  4&#8722;x  peptide is to quench Cu(II) toxicity in the brain. However, the role of Cu(I) coordination has never been investigated so far. In contrast to Cu(II), the Cu(I) coordination is expected to be the same for N&#8208;truncated and N&#8208;intact peptides. Here, we report in&#8208;depth spectroscopic characterizations (Cu(II) and Cu(I)) complexes of the A&#946;  4&#8208;16  and A&#946;  11&#8208;16  N&#8208;truncated peptides and ROS production studies with copper (Cu(II) and Cu(I)) complexes of the A&#946;  4&#8208;16  and A&#946;  11&#8208;16  N&#8208;truncated peptides. Our findings show that the N&#8208;truncated peptides do produce ROS when Cu(I) in present in the medium, although to a lesser extent than the unmodified counterpart. In addition, when used as a drug&#8208;candidate molecule (  id est  , in the presence of A&#946;  1&#8208;16  ), the N&#8208;truncated peptides are not able to fully preclude Cu(A&#946;  1&#8208;16  ) induced ROS production.</dc:description>

      <title>Chalice&#8208;type tridentate silicon Lewis acids of C3 symmetry in a single step starting from hexadehydrotri&#173;benzo[12]annulene</title>
      <dc:description>Tridentate Lewis acids with aligned functions were syn&#173;thesized based on the rigid framework hexadehydrotribenzo[12]annu&#173;lene. The backbone and its fluorinated analogue were synthesised in one&#8208;pot syntheses, with alkyne deprotection and Sonogashira cross coupling reaction being carried out in one step. Hydrosilylation of the annulene with chlorohydrosilanes proceeded highly selectively and afforded rigid poly&#8208;Lewis acids with three SiCl  3  or SiCl  2  Me substitu&#173;ents perfectly oriented to one side of the molecule in a single step. The progress of hydrosilylation was investigated by time&#8208;correlated NMR spectroscopic studies. The crystal structures show that the framework is symme&#173;trically functionalised and the silyl substituents are aligned in one direction. To increase the acidity of the Lewis acids the chlorosilyl substituents were fluorinated with SbF  3  . Further investigation of hydrometallation reactions (M = B, Al, Ga, Sn) did not lead to corresponding structures.</dc:description>

      <title>Tunable Phosphorescence&#8208;Fluorescence Dual Emissions of Organic Isoquinoline&#8208;Benzophenone Doped System by Alkoxy Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>The dual/multi&#8208;component organic doped system with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties has been developed. However, the unknown luminescence mechanism still greatly limits the development of the doped materials. Herein, a new doped system exhibiting phosphorescence&#8208;fluorescence dual emissions (&#1060;Phos.= 4&#8208;24% and &#964;phos. = 101&#8208;343 ms) is successfully constructed through prediction and design. A series of isoquinoline derivatives with different alkoxy chains were selected as the guests. Benzophenone was chosen as the host due to the characteristic of low melting point and good crystallinity. The alkoxy chain lengths of the guests are first reported to be used to control the fluorescence and phosphorescence intensities of the doped materials, which results in different prompt emission colors. Additionally, the doped ratio of the guest and host can also control the luminous intensities of the materials. In particular, the doped materials still exhibit phosphorescent properties even if the ratio of guest&#8208;host is as low as 1:100000.</dc:description>

      <title>Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene (CAAC) Gold(I) Complexes as Chemotherapeutic Agents.</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes (CAACs) have become forceful ligands for gold due to their ability to form very strong ligand&#8208;metal bonds. Inspired by the success of Auranofin and other gold complexes as antitumor agents, we have studied the cytotoxicity of bis&#8208; and mono&#8208;CAAC&#8208;gold complexes on different cancer cell lines: HeLa (cervical cancer), A549 (lung cancer), HT1080 (fibrosarcoma) and Caov&#8208;3 (ovarian cancer). Further investigations aimed at elucidating their mechanism of action are described. This includes quantification of affinities for TrxR, evaluation of their bioavailability and determination of associated cell death process. Moreover, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was used to study morphological changes upon exposure. Noticeably, a significant reduction in non&#8208;specific binding to serum proteins was observed with CAAC complexes when compared to Auranofin. These results confirm the potential of CAAC&#8208;gold complexes in biological environments, which may result in more specific drug&#8208;target interactions and decreased side effects.</dc:description>

      <title>Competition of ligands and the 18&#8208;mer binding domain of the RHAU helicase for G&#8208;quadruplexes &#8211; orthosteric or allosteric binding mechanism?</title>
      <dc:description>Stabilizing particular DNA and RNA structures called G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) using specific ligands (L) is a strategy proposed to fight cancer. However, while G4:L interactions are often investigated, whether or not ligands are able to disrupt interactions between G4s and proteins (P) remains poorly studied. Here, using native mass spectrometry, we investigated ternary G4:L:P complexes formed by G4s, some of the highest affinity ligands, and the binding domain of the RHAU helicase. First, our results suggest that RHAU binds not only preferentially to parallel G4s but to free external G&#8208;quartets. We also found that, depending on the G4, ligands could prevent the binding of the peptide, either by direct competition for the binding sites (orthosteric inhibition) or by inducing conformational changes (allosteric inhibition). Notably, the ligand Cu&#8208;ttpy induced a conformational change that increased the binding of the peptide. This study illustrates that it is important to not only characterize drug&#8208;target interactions but also how the binding to other partners is affected.</dc:description>

      <title>Sulfur Precursor Reactivity Affecting the Crystal Phase and Morphology of Cu2&#8208;xS Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>For plasmonic copper&#8208;deficient Cu2&#8208;xS nanoparticles (NPs), accurate control of crystal phase and morphology is highly desirable since both of which are known to determine the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelength and amplitude. Here, we examine how sulfur precursor reactivity in the synthesis of Cu2&#8208;xS NPs affects the resulting crystal phase and morphology. Djurleite Cu1.94S, roxbyite Cu1.8S, digenite Cu1.8S as well as covellite CuS nanodisks were synthesized by 1&#8208;dodecanethiol,  N,N  &#8208;dibutylthiourea and crystal sulfur 1&#8208;octadecene/oleylamine solutions and their crystal phase dependent LSPR properties were exhaustively discussed. In addition, crystal phase interconversion between covellite CuS and djurleite/roxbyite Cu2&#8208;xS was realized in the presence of above sulfur sources. On the other hand, djurleite Cu1.94S nanorods rather than nanodisks were prepared by replacing 1&#8208;dodecanethiol with more reactive  tert&#8208;dodecanethiol. The structural and morphological Cu2&#8208;xS NPs here holds great promise in the application of photothermal therapy, photocatalysis, SERS and many others.</dc:description>

Here, we examine how sulfur precursor reactivity in the synthesis of Cu2&#8208;xS NPs affects the resulting crystal phase and morphology. Djurleite Cu1.94S, roxbyite Cu1.8S, digenite Cu1.8S as well as covellite CuS nanodisks were synthesized by 1&#8208;dodecanethiol,  N,N  &#8208;dibutylthiourea and crystal sulfur 1&#8208;octadecene/oleylamine solutions and their crystal phase dependent LSPR properties were exhaustively discussed. In addition, crystal phase interconversion between covellite CuS and djurleite/roxbyite Cu2&#8208;xS was realized in the presence of above sulfur sources. On the other hand, djurleite Cu1.94S nanorods rather than nanodisks were prepared by replacing 1&#8208;dodecanethiol with more reactive  tert&#8208;dodecanethiol. The structural and morphological Cu2&#8208;xS NPs here holds great promise in the application of photothermal therapy, photocatalysis, SERS and many others.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Mimicking Biological Recognition: Lessons in Binding Hydrophilic Guests in Water</title>
      <dc:description>Selective molecular recognition of hydrophilic guests in water plays a fundamental role in a vast number of biological processes, but synthetic mimicry of biomolecular recognition in water still proves challenging both in terms of achieving comparable affinities and selectivities. This review highlights strategies that have been developed in the field of supramolecular chemistry to selectively and non&#8208;covalently bind three classes of biologically relevant molecules: nucleotides, carbohydrates, and amino acids. As several groups have systematically modified receptors for a specific guest, an evolutionary perspective is also provided in some cases. Trends in the most effective binding forces for each class are described, providing insight into selectivity and potential directions for future work.</dc:description>

      <title>Regulating mitochondrial pH with light and implications for chemoresistance</title>
      <dc:description>Chemoresistance is one of the major challenges for cancer treatment, more recently ascribed to defective mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), significantly diminishing chemotherapeutic agent&#8208;induced apoptosis. A boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore&#8208;based triarylsulfonium photoacid generator (BD&#8208;PAG) was used to target mitochondria with the aim to regulate mitochondrial pH and further depolarize the mitochondrial membrane. Cell viability assays demonstrated the relative biocompatibility of BD&#8208;PAG in the dark while live cell imaging suggested high accumulation in mitochondria. Specific assays indicated that BD&#8208;PAG is capable of regulating mitochondrial pH with significant effects on mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Therapeutic tests using chlorambucil in combination with BD&#8208;PAG revealed a new strategy in chemoresistance suppression.</dc:description>

      <title>A Promising Approach for Controlling the 2nd Coordination Sphere of Biomimetic Metal Complexes: Encapsulation in a Dynamic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Capsule</title>
      <dc:description>The design of biomimetic models of metalloenzymes needs to take into account many factors and is therefore a challenging task. We propose in this work an original strategy to control the second coordination sphere of a metal centre and its distal environment. A biomimetic complex, reproducing the first coordination sphere, is encapsulated in a self&#8208;assembled hydrogen&#8208;bonded capsule. The cationic complex is co&#8208;encapsulated with its counter&#8208;anion or with solvent molecules. The capsule is dynamic allowing a fast in/out exchange of the co&#8208;encapsulated species. It also provides a hydrogen&#8208;bonding site in the second coordination sphere. The capsule is also a source of proton as it can be deprotonated in presence of the complex providing a globally neutral host&#8208;guest assembly. This simple and broad scope strategy is unprecedented in biomimetic studies. It appears as a very promising method for the stabilization of reactive species and for the study of their reactivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Interface amorphization of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus upon the treatment with diazonium salts</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) represents one of the most appealing 2D materials due to its electronic, optical, and chemical properties. Many strategies have been pursued to face its environmental instability, covalent functionalization being one of the most promising. However, the extremely low functionalization degrees and the limitations in proving the nature of the covalent functionalization still represent challenges in many of these sheet architectures reported to date. Here we shine light on the structural evolution of 2D&#8208;BP upon the addition of electrophilic diazonium salts. We demonstrated the absence of covalent functionalization in both the neutral and the reductive routes, observing in the latter case an unexpected interface conversion of BP to red phosphorus (RP), as characterized by Raman,&#160;  31  P&#8208;MAS NMR, and X&#8208;Ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS). Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (TG&#8208;GC&#8208;MS), as well as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) gave insights into the potential underlying radical mechanism, suggesting a Sandmeyer&#8208;like reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly deformed o&#8208;carborane&#8208;functionalised non&#8208;linear polycyclic aromatics with exceptionally long C&#8208;C bond lengths</title>
      <dc:description>The effect of substituting o&#8208;carborane into the most sterically hindered positions of phenanthrene and benzo(k)tetraphene is reported. Synthesised via a Bull&#8208;Hutchings&#8208;Quayle benzannulation, the crystal structures of these non&#8208;linear polycyclic aromatics exhibited the highest aromatic deformation parameters observed for any reported carborane compound to date, with the largest carboranyl C&#8208;C bond length of all organo&#8208;substituted  o  &#8208;carboranes. Photoluminescence studies of these compounds demonstrated efficient intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer, leading to aggregation induced emission properties. Additionally, an unusual low&#8208;energy excimer was observed for the phenanthryl compound.

      <title>A liposomal FRET assay identifies potent drug&#8208;like inhibitors of the ceramide transport protein CERT</title>
      <dc:description>Ceramide transfer protein (CERT) mediates non&#8208;vesicular transfer of ceramide from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus and thus catalyzes the rate&#8208;limiting step of sphingomyelin biosynthesis. Usually, CERT ligands are evaluated in tedious binding assays or non&#8208;homogenous transfer assays using radiolabeled ceramides. In this study, we present a facile and sensitive assay for CERT, based on F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). To this end, we mixed donor and acceptor vesicles, each containing a different fluorescent ceramide species. By CERT&#8208;mediated transfer of fluorescent ceramide, a FRET system was established, which allows readout in 96&#8208;well plate format, despite the high hydrophobicity of the components. Screening of a 2000 compound library resulted in two new potent CERT inhibitors. One is approved for use in humans and one is approved for use in animals. Evaluation of cellular activity by quantitative mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy showed inhibition of ceramide trafficking and sphingomyelin biosynthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>The Nature of Nonclassical Carbonyl Ligands Explained by Kohn&#8208;Sham Molecular Orbital Theory</title>
      <dc:description>When carbonyl ligands coordinate to transition metals, their bond distance either increases (classical) or decreases (nonclassical) with respect to the bond length in the isolated CO molecule. C&#8211;O expansion can easily be understood by&#160; p &#8208;back&#8208;donation, which results in a population of the CO&#8217;s&#160; p* &#8208;antibonding orbital and hence a weakening of its bond. Nonclassical carbonyl ligands are less straightforward to explain, and their nature is still subject of an ongoing debate. In this work, we studied five isoelectronic octahedral complexes, namely Fe(CO)  6  2+  , Mn(CO)  6  +  , Cr(CO)  6  , V(CO)  6  &#8211;  &#160;and Ti(CO)  6  2&#8211;  , at the ZORA&#8208;BLYP/TZ2P level of theory to explain this nonclassical behavior in the framework of Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory. We show that there are two competing forces that affect the C&#8211;O bond length, namely electrostatic interactions (favoring C&#8211;O contraction) and&#160; p &#8208;back&#8208;donation (favoring C&#8211;O expansion). It is a balance between those two terms that determines whether the carbonyl is classical or nonclassical. By further decomposing the electrostatic interaction &#8710;  V  elstat  &#160;into four fundamental terms, we are able to rationalize why &#8710;  V  elstat  &#160;gives rise to the nonclassical behavior, leading to new insights into the driving forces behind C&#8211;O contraction.</dc:description>

      <title>Eco&#8208;friendly methodology for the formation of aromatic carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond using green ionic liquids</title>
      <dc:description>A new sustainable method is reported for the aromatic carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation in solvent&#8208;free and mild conditions (no co&#8208;oxidant, no strong acid and no toxic reagents) using a new type of green ionic liquid.

      <title>Efficient Imine Formation via Oxidative Coupling at Low Temperature Catalyzed by High&#8208;Surface&#8208;Area Mesoporous CeO2 with an Exceptional Redox Property</title>
      <dc:description>A high&#8208;surface&#8208;area mesoporous CeO2  &#160;  (  hsm  CeO2) was prepared by a facile organic template&#8208;induced homogeneous precipitation method and showed the superior catalytic activity in imine synthesis in absence of base from primary alcohols and amines in air atmosphere at low temperature. In comparison, an ordinary CeO2  &#160;  and  hsm  CeO2  &#160;  after different thermal treatments were also investigated. XRD, N2  &#160;  physisorption, UV&#8208;Raman, H2&#8208;TPR, O2&#8208;TPD, EPR and XPS were used to mainly unravel their structural and redox properties.  hsm  CeO2 calcined at 400 &#176;C shows the highest specific surface area (158 m2  &#160;  g&#8208;1), the highest fraction of surface coordinatively unsaturated Ce3+  &#160;  ions (18.2%), and the highest concentration of reactive oxygen vacancies (2.4&#215;1015 spins g&#8208;1) .  .  In the model reaction of oxidative coupling of benzyl alcohol and aniline, such an exceptional redox property of the  hsm  CeO  2  catalyst can boost benzylideneaniline formation (2.75 and 5.55 mmol gceria&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1) based on a &gt; 99% yield at 60 &#176;C and 80 &#176;C respectively in air with no base additives. It can also work effectively at room temperature of 30 &#176;C, as well as for the gram&#8208;grade synthesis. This is one of the best results among all the ceria benchmark catalysts in literature. Moreover, the  hsm  CeO  2  catalyst displays a wide scope towards primary alcohols and amines with good to excellent yield of imines. The influence of reaction parameters, the reusability of catalyst, and the reaction mechanism were investigated.</dc:description>

      <title>Tri(imidazole)&#8208;derivative Moiety: a New Category of Electron Acceptors for Designing Crystalline Hybrid Photochromic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>The intermarriage of neutral and tripodal imidazole ligand, tris(4&#8208;(1Himidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)amine) (TIPA), with zinc phosphite yields two hybrid phosphites, [Zn2(HPO3)2(TIPA)]&#183;2H2O (1) and [Zn3(HPO3)3(TIPA)]&#183;6H2O (2). 1 has a hybrid sheet with neutral zinc&#8208;phosphite chains as supramolecular building blocks (SBBs). 2 exhibits 3D hybrid architecture with another neutral zincophosphite chains as SBBs. The structural discrepancy of 1 and 2 is mainly due to the distinct linkage modes between organic TIPA ligands and inorganic zincophosphite chains. Interestingly, compounds 1 and 2 feature fast photochromism in response to UV light irradiation under ambient conditions. The discrepancy of photochromic performance between 1 and 2 is mainly due to the different geometrical configuration of TIPA ligand. Different with majority of reported hybrid photochromic compounds driven by photochromic active units, the photochromism in 1 and 2 is derived from the electron transfer (ET) between phosphite and non&#8208;photochromic triimidazole&#8208;derivative ligand TIPA. Compared with the being explored nonphotochromic polypyridine&#8208;derivative as electron acceptors (EAs), our work provides a new EA model for designing hybrid photochromic materials based on the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ET mechanism. The multiple anti&#8208;counterfeiting application based on 1 and 2 was investigated.</dc:description>

In this contribution, we present the synthesis of mixed tetraacylgermanes  4a  &#8208;  c  and  6a  &#8208;  e  with a non&#8208;symmetric substitution pattern. Germenolates are crucial intermediates of these new synthetic protocols. The synthesized compounds show increased solubility, due to lower melting points, compared to the symmetrically substituted (uniform) tetraacylgermanes  1a  &#8208;  d  . Moreover, these mixed derivatives reveal broadened n&#8208;&#960;* absorption bands, enhancing their photo&#8208;activity. Higher absorption at wavelengths above 450 nm of these new derivatives causes efficient photobleaching when using a LED emitting at 470 nm. The quantum yields are in the range of 0.15 &#8211; 0.57, depending on the nature of the aroyl substituents. Based on these properties, mixed functionalized tetraacylgermanes serve as ideal photoinitiators in various applications, especially in those requiring high penetration depth. The synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, NMR and CIDNP spectroscopy, UV/VIS spectroscopy, photolysis experiments and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The CIDNP data suggest that the germyl radicals generated from our new tetraacylgermanes preferentially add to the tail of the monomer butyl acrylate. In case of  6a&#8208;e  only the mesitoyl groups are cleaved off, whereas for  4a&#8208;c  both the mesitoyl and the aroyl group are subject to &#945;&#8208;cleavage.</dc:description>

      <title>Probing alpha&#8208;Amino Aldehydes as Weakly Acidic Pronucleophiles: Direct Access to Quaternary a&#8208;Amino Aldehydes by an Enantioselective Michael Addition Catalyzed by Bronsted Bases</title>
      <dc:description>The high tendency of alpha&#8208;amino aldehydes to undergo 1,2&#8208;additions and their relatively low stability under basic conditions have largely prevented their use as pronucleophiles in the realm of asymmetric catalysis, particularly for the production of quaternary alpha&#8208;amino aldehydes.

The reaction produces densely functionalized products bearing up to two, quaternary and tertiary, vicinal stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. DFT modelling led us to propose that an intramolecular H&#8208;bonding between the &#8208;NH group and the carbonyl oxygen atom in the starting alpha&#8208;amino aldehyde is key for reaction stereocontrol.</dc:description>

      <title>Guest Recognition Control Accompanied by Stepwise Gate&#8208;Closing and Opening of a Macrocyclic Metallohost</title>
      <dc:description>Host&#8208;guest binding behavior of macrocyclic hosts is significantly influenced by the shapes and sizes of the hosts. In particular, closing/opening the apertures of the hosts controls the guest uptake/release. We utilized the post&#8208;metalation modification method, which we have recently developed, to achieve the open/close conversions.

The conversion of this closed complex to the open complex [LCo 2 (hda) 2 (OAc)] + was too slow to be completed, but this gate&#8208;opening was dramatically accelerated by the addition of Na + .

      <title>Concentration&#8208;dependent interactions of amphiphilic PiB&#8208; derivative metal complexes with amyloid peptides A&#946; and amylin</title>
      <dc:description>Metal chelates targeted to amyloid peptides are widely explored as diagnostic tools or therapeutic agents. The attachment of a metal complex to amyloid recognition units typically leads to a decrease in peptide affinity. We show here that by separating a macrocyclic GdL chelate and a PiB targeting unit with a long hydrophobic C10 linker, it is possible to attain nanomolar affinities for both A&#946;  1&#8208;40  (  K  d  = 4.4 nM) and amylin (  K  d  = 4.5 nM), implicated respectively in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and diabetes. The Scatchard analysis of surface plasmon resonance data obtained for a series of amphiphilic, PiB derivative GdL complexes indicate that their A&#946;  1&#8208;40  or amylin binding affinity varies with their concentration, thus micellar aggregation state. The GdL chelates also affect peptide aggregation kinetics, as probed by thioflavin&#8208;T fluorescence assays. A 2D NMR study allowed identifying that the hydrophilic region of A&#946;  1&#8208;40  is involved in the interaction between the monomer peptide and the Gd  3+  complex. Finally,  ex vivo  biodistribution experiments were conducted in healthy mice by using  111  In labelled analogues. Their pancreatic uptake, ~3%ID/g, is promising to envisage amylin imaging in diabetic animals.</dc:description>

We show here that by separating a macrocyclic GdL chelate and a PiB targeting unit with a long hydrophobic C10 linker, it is possible to attain nanomolar affinities for both A&#946;  1&#8208;40  (  K  d  = 4.4 nM) and amylin (  K  d  = 4.5 nM), implicated respectively in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and diabetes. The Scatchard analysis of surface plasmon resonance data obtained for a series of amphiphilic, PiB derivative GdL complexes indicate that their A&#946;  1&#8208;40  or amylin binding affinity varies with their concentration, thus micellar aggregation state. The GdL chelates also affect peptide aggregation kinetics, as probed by thioflavin&#8208;T fluorescence assays. A 2D NMR study allowed identifying that the hydrophilic region of A&#946;  1&#8208;40  is involved in the interaction between the monomer peptide and the Gd  3+  complex. Finally,  ex vivo  biodistribution experiments were conducted in healthy mice by using  111  In labelled analogues. Their pancreatic uptake, ~3%ID/g, is promising to envisage amylin imaging in diabetic animals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Cationic Fe(II)&#8208;Triplex Forming Metallohelices as DNA Bulge Binders</title>
      <dc:description>Bulges are essential structural elements in nucleic acids. The detection and targeting of bulged DNA sequences are highly important. Small molecules capable of targeting DNA bulges have attracted considerable attention because they can be used not only as reagents for bulge recognition but also as potential therapeutic drugs. Here we report on the interaction of DNA duplexes containing bulges of various sizes and base compositions with a series of Fe(II)&#8208;triplex forming metallohelices. The results obtained with the aid of the methods of molecular biophysics show that the investigated metallohelices prefer binding to bulged over double&#8208;stranded DNA and that their binding affinities towards bulges differ among individual metallohelices. Moreover, their binding affinities towards bulges strongly depend on the bulge size and the base composition of the bulge loop. The investigated metallohelices can enter eukaryotic cells and accumulate in the cell nucleus, allowing them to interact with nucleic acids. Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that the interaction of the metallohelices with nucleic acids bulges might contribute to the mechanism of their biological activity.</dc:description>
