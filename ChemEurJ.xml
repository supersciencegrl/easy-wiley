         <title>Structural Insights and Advanced Spectroscopic Characterization of Thiazolothiazoles: Unveiling Potential for Optoelectronic and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiazolothiazoles (TzTzs) are planar, &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocyclic compounds exhibiting unique structural and optoelectronic properties. In this study, a series of symmetrically substituted TzTz derivatives including imidazolyl, o&#8208;vanillyl, p&#8208;vanillyl, phenyl, thiazolyl, cinnamoyl, and trifluoromethylphenyl were synthesized and extensively characterized using X&#8208;ray crystallography (XRD), Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopies, photoluminescence, X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, S K&#8208;edge), and density functional calculations. The compounds demonstrated diverse intermolecular interactions, including &#960;&#215;&#215;&#215;&#960; stacking and chalcogen bonding, which directly influenced their optical properties and electronic band structures. Several derivatives displayed promising features such as large Stokes shifts over 0.4 eV in solution and up to 1 eV in solid state, and reversible resistive switching behavior, positioning them as attractive candidates for use in optoelectronic devices and emerging memristive technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Nitrogen&#8208;doped Nb2C Nanosheets for Electrocatalytic ORR to Selectively Produce H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two&#8208;electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) represents an efficient and environmentally friendly approach for H2O2 production. Among various types of potential catalysts, MXene have garnered significant attention due to their outstanding electrical conductivity, abundant edge active sites, and low costs. In this study, we successfully synthesize porous N&#8208;doped Nb2C nanosheets (N&#8208;Nb2C) via a room&#8208;temperature ammonia etching method and investigate their ORR performance toward the formation of H2O2. The doping of nitrogen effectively modulates the electronic structure of Nb2C nanosheets, while the abundant surface pores formed during ammonia etching facilitate the ORR process. Hence, the electrocatalytic performance of N&#8208;Nb2C nanosheets is significantly improved, demonstrating excellent long&#8208;term stability and durability. Notably, in rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode (RRDE) tests, the N&#8208;Nb2C catalyst achieves a remarkable H2O2 yield of 86.8%, highlighting its potential for selective H2O2 production through electrocatalytic ORR. Our findings suggest that N&#8208;doped Nb2C holds great promise for applications in two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction for H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Isocoumarins via Light&#8208;Driven Carboxylative Cyclization Reaction of o&#8208;Ethynyl Aryl Bromides with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;driven carboxylative cyclization reaction of o&#8208;ethynyl aryl bromides with CO2 selectivity produced isocoumarins. Control experiments revealed that photoirradiation promoted the cyclization process with high selectivity for the isocoumarins over the corresponding phthalides.








Abstract
Isocoumarins are an important class of bicyclic lactones, which are seen in natural products, drugs, and bioactive compounds, and a variety of synthetic methods for isocoumarins have been developed. However, the synthesis of isocoumarins via the catalytic CO2 fixation has been scarcely reported despite the potential incorporation of CO2 into the lactone moiety. Here, we developed the light&#8208;driven carboxylative cyclization reaction of o&#8208;ethynyl aryl bromides with CO2, which selectively produced isocoumarins. Control experiments revealed that photoirradiation promoted the cyclization process with high selectivity.

         <title>Flexible cyclotriphosphonitrile&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks for the capture of iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly efficient materials for trapping radioactive iodine is essential for the safe use of nuclear energy. Herein, we present a strategy to synergistically enhance iodine capture by exploiting the flexible building blocks with the affinity properties of electrically rich heteroatoms by combining the cyclic triphosphonitrile derivative, with amine linkers of different molecular lengths, and constructing triangular pore&#8208;structured flexible cyclotriphosphonitrile&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks. A series of cyclotriphosphonitrile&#8208;based COFs (CTP&#8208;X&#8208;COF, X=PDA, ODA, BPY, DPT) with triangular pore topology were synthesized usingCTP&#8208;6 as the node and connection point of p&#8208;phenylenediamine (PDA), 4,4&#8208;diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA), 5,5&#8208;diamino2,2&#8208;bipyridine (BPY), and 4,4&#8208;diaminotribiphenyl (DPT) with different molecular lengths. It was found that the adsorption capacities of CTP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;ODA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, and CTP&#8208;DPT&#8208;COF for iodine vapor were 4.65 g g&#8208;1, 4.18 g g&#8208;1, 2.38 g g&#8208;1 and 3.57 g g&#8208;1, respectively. The results showed that the adsorption capacities of CTP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;ODA&#8208;COF, CTP&#8208;BPY&#8208;COF, and CTP&#8208;DPT&#8208;COF for iodine in cyclohexane were 281.50 mg g&#8208;1, 221.67 mg g&#8208;1, 161.14 mg g&#8208;1, and 222.67 mg g&#8208;1, respectively. It was found that the four COFs adsorbed iodine in cyclohexane solution was a mixed adsorption process with chemical adsorption playing a predominant role and physical adsorption as an auxiliary mechanism.</dc:description>

A series of cyclotriphosphonitrile-based COFs (CTP-X-COF, X=PDA, ODA, BPY, DPT) with triangular pore topology were synthesized usingCTP-6 as the node and connection point of p-phenylenediamine (PDA), 4,4-diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA), 5,5-diamino2,2-bipyridine (BPY), and 4,4-diaminotribiphenyl (DPT) with different molecular lengths.

         <title>Hybrid Cyclopeptide&#8208;Based Chemical Models for Allosteric Disulfide and Amyloid Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present here designer water soluble triazolophanes as a platform for mimicking the allosteric disulfide conformation. The allosteric &#8208;LHHook disulfide conformation has been stabilized by a protein like intramolecular S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The striking similarity of the fibrils of the designer macrocycle with amyloids and its autofluorescence is a noteworthy finding.








Abstract
We present here a series of isomeric disulfide&#8208;based hybrid cyclic peptides with different ring sizes. The water soluble pseudopeptidic macrocycles display a high intrinsic tendency to self&#8208;assemble. Microscopic investigations revealed amyloid like fibrillar morphology with autofluorescence. X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 23&#8208;membered macrocycle showed the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and a unique S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction. We delineate that the macrocyclic framework is an ideal platform to generate various classes of disulfide conformations. X&#8208;ray structure of the macrocycle further revealed the presence of an allosteric disulfide bond with &#8208;LHHook geometry.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present here a series of isomeric disulfide-based hybrid cyclic peptides with different ring sizes. The water soluble pseudopeptidic macrocycles display a high intrinsic tendency to self-assemble. Microscopic investigations revealed amyloid like fibrillar morphology with autofluorescence. X-ray crystal structure of 23-membered macrocycle showed the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and a unique S&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction. We delineate that the macrocyclic framework is an ideal platform to generate various classes of disulfide conformations. X-ray structure of the macrocycle further revealed the presence of an allosteric disulfide bond with -LHHook geometry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>ENHANCED POLYSULFIDE REGULATION IN RECHARGEABLE LI&#8208;S BATTERIES WITH ZnS AS ELECTROCATALYST: EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION AND INTERFACIAL INSIGHTS FROM SIMULATIONS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery cathode based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;decorated ZnS nanosphere structure, which serves as a multifunctional sulfur host. The rGO framework provides a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area conductive network for enhanced sulfur loading, while ZnS acts as an electrocatalyst to accelerate polysulfide conversion. Fabricated via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method, the composite achieves a high sulfur content (~80%) with efficient polysulfide confinement and catalytic conversion as a Li&#8208;S battery cathode. As a result, it delivers an initial capacity of 1014 mAh/g at 0.1 C and retains 592 mAh/g at 1C, demonstrating excellent rate capability and cycling stability (479 mAh/g over 200 cycles at 1C). To further understand the interfacial interactions, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted, revealing the role of ZnS in accelerating lithium polysulfide (LiPS) conversion, particularly from Li&#8322;S&#8324; to Li&#8322;S. The study analyzed LiPS diffusion coefficients and potential energy across different sulfur species, confirming the superior efficiency of the rGO@ZnS host. These findings highlight the potential of ZnS&#8208;decorated rGO structures as a promising approach to improving Li&#8208;S battery performance through enhanced sulfur utilization and polysulfide regulation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperbranched polysiloxanes are a class of nonconventional polymers with unique structural features and excellent physicochemical properties, which have attracted great attention in the field of luminescent materials. This review summarizes the recent progress in the study of luminescence mechanisms and optical properties of various hyperbranched polymers containing Si&#8208;O&#8208;C segments with Si as branching points, including hyperbranched polysiloxanes, hyperbranched polyborosiloxanes, and hyperbranched polysilphosphates. Through molecular design and structural regulation, researchers have successfully achieved multi&#8208;color fluorescence and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence emission ranging from blue to red in these polymers, with quantum yields reaching up to 54.1% and fluorescence lifetimes up to 9.73 &#956;s. The AIE properties and excellent biocompatibility of these polymers provide new materials and strategies for applications in bioimaging, controlled drug release, information security encryption, and ion detection. Moreover, the opportunities and challenges for further development are briefly discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Wheel Movement in a [2]Rotaxane Using a Competing Kinetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wheel movement of rotaxanes is typically fast in solution. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring of such movement is one of the challenging topics. Herein, we report real&#8208;time monitoring of wheel movement in a [2]rotaxane (comprising hydrophilic pillar[5]arene as a wheel and hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with hydrophilic tetra(ethylene oxide) ends as an axle) via a competing kinetic pathway, i.e., aggregation/dissociation equilibrium. In non&#8208;aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane shows blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety because the pillar[5]arene wheel shuttles over the whole axle. In aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane forms aggregates owing to its amphiphilic nature. Because the [2]rotaxane forms the kinetically stable aggregates, location of the pillar[5]arene wheel on the axle is maintained, resulting in the locally excited emission even in the polar conditions. Surprisingly, the emission color gradually changes from blue&#8211;purple to light&#8208;blue over 720 h because exposure of the monomeric [2]rotaxane generated by dissociation of the kinetically stable aggregates, to the polar environment triggers movement of the hydrophilic wheel to the hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety by hydrophobic effect. After this movement, the monomeric [2]rotaxane forms the thermodynamically stable aggregates, which exhibit light&#8208;blue emission from charge&#8208;transfer complex between the electron&#8208;donating pillar[5]arene wheel and the electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>A Parameter&#8208;Driven Approach to Modulating Chemical Composition in Prussian Blue Analogues Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>

This study explores electroneutrality&#8242;s role in synthesizing sodium&#8208;based Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs), focusing on Na+ ion diffusion and its effect on crystal structure. It examines how temperature, viscosity, and stirring speed influence Na+ incorporation, vacancies, and water content, offering insights for optimizing PBAs in energy storage.







Abstract
This study explores how various experimental factors, such as temperature, viscosity, and stirring speed, affect Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) materials&#8216; structural properties and electroneutrality. These factors influence key attributes like sodium ions, vacancies, and water content, which is governed by electroneutrality. Higher temperatures, faster stirring, low viscosity, and high Na+ concentration enhance Na+ incorporation because of the sufficient Na+ supplement, leading to a densified monoclinic structure with fewer vacancies and lower water content. In contrast, lower temperatures, slow stirring, high viscosity, and low Na+ concentration lead to less monoclinic or cubic structures with more vacancies and higher water content. Adding carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) increases viscosity, enables lower Na+ diffusion, and renders less Na+ incorporation. As a result, an intermediate structure forms with balanced Na+ and water content, bridging the cubic and monoclinic forms. The electrochemical performance of cubic structures (PW&#8208;Cub) is superior, demonstrating better C&#8208;rate performance with distinct charge&#8208;discharge plateaus than monoclinic structures acquired at high temperatures (PW&#8208;Mc&#8208;HT). The PW&#8208;Mc&#8208;HT shows the mixed redox reactions between Fe2+/Fe3+ and Mn2+/Mn3+. This study reveals the root cause for the variation in PBAs&#8242; chemical composition and provides a guideline for synthesizing high&#8208;quality PBAs for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

Abstract
Developing insensitive heat&#8208;resistant energetic materials is currently a significant challenge in the research of energetic materials. In this study, two heat&#8208;resistant and insensitive energetic materials (compounds 3 and 4) were designed and prepared by constructing conjugated planar structure based on the imino bridged (&#8722;NH&#8722;) azoles and 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,6&#8208;dinitropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidin&#8208;7&#8208;amine. All the newly synthesized compounds exhibit excellent thermal stabilities (Td: 316.5&#8211;343.9&#8201;&#176;C) and good detonation performances (D: 8183&#8211;8206&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1), as well as satisfactory sensitivities (IS &gt;40&#8197;J, FS &gt;360&#8197;N). These remarkable stabilities are attributed to the &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar structures and strong weak interactions in crystals. The comprehensive performances of compound 4 (Td: 343.9&#8201;&#176;C, D: 8183&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, IS &gt;40&#8197;J, FS &gt;360&#8197;N) are superior to those of the widely used heat&#8208;resistant explosive 2,2&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;hexanitrostilbene (HNS) (Td: 318&#8201;&#176;C, D: 7612&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, IS: 5&#8197;J, FS: 240&#8197;N), indicating its potential to be used as heat&#8208;resistant and insensitive energetic materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing insensitive heat-resistant energetic materials is currently a significant challenge in the research of energetic materials. In this study, two heat-resistant and insensitive energetic materials (compounds &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) were designed and prepared by constructing conjugated planar structure based on the imino bridged (&#8722;NH&#8722;) azoles and 5-chloro-3,6-dinitropyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-amine. All the newly synthesized compounds exhibit excellent thermal stabilities (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;: 316.5&#8211;343.9&#8201;&#176;C) and good detonation performances (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;: 8183&#8211;8206&#8197;m&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), as well as satisfactory sensitivities (&lt;i&gt;IS&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;40&#8197;J, &lt;i&gt;FS&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;360&#8197;N). These remarkable stabilities are attributed to the &#960;-conjugated planar structures and strong weak interactions in crystals. The comprehensive performances of compound &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;: 343.9&#8201;&#176;C, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;: 8183&#8197;m&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IS&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;40&#8197;J, &lt;i&gt;FS&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;360&#8197;N) are superior to those of the widely used heat-resistant explosive 2,2&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,6,6&#8242;-hexanitrostilbene (&lt;b&gt;HNS&lt;/b&gt;) (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;: 318&#8201;&#176;C, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;: 7612&#8197;m&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IS&lt;/i&gt;: 5&#8197;J, &lt;i&gt;FS&lt;/i&gt;: 240&#8197;N), indicating its potential to be used as heat-resistant and insensitive energetic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Front Cover: Tethered Enantiopure Boramidines for Advanced Chiroptical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a boramidine chromophore being excited by a linearly polarized UV wave (purple). The molecule is capable of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) represented as a CP blue wave coming from the enantiopure H8&#8208;BINOL moiety. A blurred mirror reinforces the concept of chirality, since the antipodal enantiomer is also excited and emits CPL. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500490), N. Saleh, E. Vauthey, J. Lacour and co&#8208;workers report the synthesis, characterization, and photophysical analysis of novel BINOL&#8208; and H8&#8208;BINOL&#8208;tethered boramidines, leveraging the chiral perturbation strategy for CPL material design. These enantiopure compounds, prepared in a concise three&#8208;step synthesis, exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields &#981; (up to 95% in N&#8322;&#8208;saturated solutions) and luminescence dissymmetry factors (|glum| &#8764;10&#8210;3). Transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide insight into their singlet&#8211;triplet spin&#8208;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing mechanisms.

         <title>Cover Feature: On the Facile Synthesis of Triazaarsoles Using Acyclic Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new portal has opened to aromatic triazaarsoles. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500514), C. M&#252;ller and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that novel triazaarsoles, the arsenic analogues of tetrazoles and triazaphospholes can be synthesized from easily accessible dichloroarsanes, organic azides and a suitable base. Their findings pave the way to access and fully investigate these aromatic arsenic heterocycles.

Shine on organic crystals. The Cover Feature illustrates how the organic solid state can be recast not just as a medium for structure but as a reactive stage for molecular synthesis and a form of supramolecular matter. The Review by C. Li and L.&#160;R. MacGillivray (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202500756) highlights how merging post&#8208;synthetic modification methods with supramolecular chemistry creates new opportunities in solid&#8208;state synthesis, allowing chemists to precisely construct organic molecules that are challenging to obtain by using solution methods.

         <title>Carbohydrate Synthesis is Entering the Data&#8208;Driven Digital Era</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>

The outcome of glycosylations, essential for glycochemistry, is difficult to predict due to its intricate mechanism and the influence of protective groups. Recent advances illustrate that integrating digital tools like automation, computational modelling, and data management drives progress in the carbohydrate synthesis field.








Abstract
Glycans are vital in biological processes, but their nontemplated, heterogeneous structures complicate structure&#8208;function analyses. Glycosylation, the key reaction in synthetic glycochemistry, remains not entirely predictable due to its complex mechanism and the need for protecting groups that impact reaction outcomes. This concept highlights recent advancements in glycochemistry and emphasizes the integration of digital tools, including automation, computational modelling, and data management, to improve carbohydrate synthesis and support further progress in the field.

         <title>Research Progress of Polyacrylate Binders for Silicon&#8208;Based Anodes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents a comprehensive review of recently developed polyacrylic acid (PAA)&#8208;based adhesives in linear, branched, and 3D&#8208;network types. In&#8208;depth insights are offered to elucidate the mechanisms by which these structural modifications augment the properties of the binders and the performance of the cells. The prospective directions for the evolution of PAA&#8208;based binders designed for Si&#8208;based anodes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries are deliberated.








Abstract
Silicon (Si) has emerged as a preeminent candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) anodes, primarily attributed to its exceptionally high specific capacity. Nevertheless, the substantial volumetric expansion accompanying lithium alloying reactions has long posed a critical challenge to the commercial viability of silicon&#8208;based anodes. Binders as connectors between the active Si particles, conductive agents, and current collectors, playing a crucial role in stabilizing the structure of silicon anodes in LIBs. Polyacrylic acid (PAA) water&#8208;based binders contain abundant carboxyl groups (&#9472;COOH) that can enhance adhesive strength. However, simple linear PAA does not adequately accommodate the significant volume expansion of silicon anodes. To address this issue, various structural optimization strategies have been applied to modify PAA binders. In this context, a comprehensive review is conducted on the recently developed PAA&#8208;based binders, which cover linear, branched, and 3D network configurations. A meticulous comparison is carried out regarding their initial coulombic efficiency, areal capacity, and material costs. Moreover, in&#8208;depth insights are offered to elucidate the mechanisms by which these structural modifications augment the properties of the binders and the performance of the cells. Ultimately, the prospective directions for the evolution of PAA&#8208;based binders designed for Si&#8208;based anodes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs are deliberated.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Mediated Polymers: Strengthening, Toughening, and Stabilizing Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>

This Concept article presents a new paradigm in polymer innovation through the fabrication of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated polymers (HBMPs) by judiciously tuning interchain/intersegment H&#8208;bonding interactions alongside the rational design of covalent polymer structures. It explores the impact of hydrogen&#8208;bond multivalence cooperativity and dynamicity on the mechanical properties, stability, and sustainability of polymers, offering a pathway for advanced and sustainable material development.








Abstract
Traditionally, the design and synthesis of polymers have centered on engineering their covalent chain or network structures. However, noncovalent interactions between polymer chains can influence the properties of polymers to a degree comparable to or even greater than their covalent structures. Therefore, shifting the focus of polymer design from covalent structure engineering to noncovalent interaction modulation represents a new paradigm for polymer innovation. This concept article summarizes our recent advances in H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated polymers (HBMPs), fabricated by meticulously tuning the interchain/intersegment H&#8208;bonding interactions, in conjunction with rational design of the covalent polymer chain or network structures. We demonstrate that H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated assembly provides an effective strategy to fabricate new polymers with unprecedented properties and sustainability, using commodity polymers as building blocks. Importantly, the synergy of multivalence cooperativity and dynamic nature of the H&#8208;bonding interactions in HBMPs can reconcile the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between mechanical strength and toughness of polymers, achieving both superhigh strength and superhigh toughness. Moreover, optimizing multivalence cooperativity can make the H&#8208;bonded crosslinks exhibit a covalent crosslinking effect, offering thermoset&#8208;like stability while preserving thermoplastic&#8208;like recyclability. The concept of HBMPs can be extended to noncovalent&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated systems, opening new avenues for polymer innovation and expanding the potential for creating functional and sustainable materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chemistry provides possibilities in organic synthesis by harnessing dynamic environments of crystalline solids for controlled covalent bond formation, highlighting potential as a form of supramolecular matter for precise molecular synthesis. This review explores supramolecular control of molecular orientation, template&#8208;directed reactivity, and postsynthetic modifications to expand functional diversity and enable transformations to generate molecules in solids that are unattainable in solution.








Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry can transform organic synthesis by revealing that crystalline materials are not static but rather dynamic environments for controlled covalent bond formations and manipulations. This review focuses on how supramolecular chemistry can be developed to direct molecular synthesis in the organic solid state, directing reliable C&#9472;C bond formations to enable transformations difficult or impossible in solution. Special attention is given to postsynthetic modifications that serve to broaden the functional scope of solid&#8208;state reactivity allowing organic crystals to be developed as molecular flasks and a form of supramolecular matter.

         <title>Structural Reconstruction of Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts in CO2 Electroreduction Reaction: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in structural reconstruction of Cu based catalyst in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, focusing on mechanism of dynamic reconstruction. It discusses fundamental theories for structural reconstruction, and optimization strategies to enhance CO2RR while suppressing structural reconstruction.








Abstract
The escalating concerns over climate change and environmental pollution have intensified the pursuit for sustainable solutions to mitigate CO2 emissions, with the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) emerging as a promising strategy to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. Central to this process is the development of efficient electrocatalysts, where Cu&#8208;based catalysts have garnered significant attention due to their high activity towards multi&#8208;carbon products. However, understanding of structural reconstruction of Cu&#8208;based catalysts under operational conditions presents a substantial challenge, complicating the identification of real active sites and the elucidation of structure&#8208;performance relationships. Herein, we first highlight the fundamental principles governing the structural reconstruction in CO2RR, encompassing both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. We then introduce advanced Operando techniques employed to monitor the structural changes of catalysts. The review further delves into the dynamic evolution behaviors of Cu&#8208;based catalysts, including atomic rearrangement and morphology evolution, with a focus on correlating these behaviors with catalytic properties such as activity, selectivity, and stability. Finally, we discuss cases of emerging strategies, such as heteroatom doping and electrolyte engineering, that hold promise for manipulating the structural reconstruction of Cu&#8208;based catalysts, and we explore future opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>A Cytotoxic Indazole&#8208;based Gold(III) Carboxamide Pincer Complex Targeting DNA Through Dual Binding Modes of Groove Binding and Alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>

Toward new gold(III) anticancer agents. Herein, we report on an indazole&#8208;based gold(III) carboxamide pincer complex exhibiting significant cytotoxicity, likely mediated through dual interactions with DNA. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the complex binds to the DNA and forms specific interactions with nucleotide bases. Structural studies with thymine reveal its DNA base recognition mechanism, offering insights into its anticancer activity.








Abstract
Gold(III) complexes have garnered increasing attention in drug delivery due to their structural and mechanistic similarities to cisplatin. This study investigates an indazole&#8208;based gold(III) carboxamide pincer complex, [N2&#183;N6&#8208;bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;indazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;2&#183;6&#8208;dicarboxamide]gold(III) chloride (AuL), for its potential as an anticancer agent. Speciation analysis at physiological pH revealed that AuL predominantly exists as a neutral chlorinated species. The complex exhibited strong cytotoxicity against the MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cell line, with an impressive IC50 value of 9&#160;&#181;M, while showing no significant activity against the HT&#8208;29 colon cancer cell line. Comprehensive analysis using electrophoresis, viscometry, ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy (UV&#8208;Vis), circular dichroism (CD), linear dichroism (LD) spectroscopy, and biomolecular simulations demonstrated that AuL binds to DNA via a dual mechanism, specifically minor groove binding and alkylation, with binding constants Ka1 = 1.48 &#215; 109 M&#8722;1 and Ka2 = 6.59 &#215; 105 M&#8722;1, respectively. Our data indicate that AuL initially binds to the minor groove of DNA, at which point a nucleobase substitutes the Cl ion, resulting in AuL binding directly to the DNA bases. In conclusion, the dual binding mode of AuL with DNA underscores its potential as a promising anticancer agent, opening new avenues for drug discovery and the development of metal&#8208;based therapeutics.

Mechanistic investigations suggest that the complex binds to the DNA and forms specific interactions with nucleotide bases. Structural studies with thymine reveal its DNA base recognition mechanism, offering insights into its anticancer activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold(III) complexes have garnered increasing attention in drug delivery due to their structural and mechanistic similarities to cisplatin. This study investigates an indazole-based gold(III) carboxamide pincer complex, [N&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-bis(1-methyl-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-indazol-3-yl)pyridine-2&#183;6-dicarboxamide]gold(III) chloride (&lt;b&gt;AuL&lt;/b&gt;), for its potential as an anticancer agent. Speciation analysis at physiological pH revealed that &lt;b&gt;AuL&lt;/b&gt; predominantly exists as a neutral chlorinated species. The complex exhibited strong cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, with an impressive IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 9&#160;&#181;M, while showing no significant activity against the HT-29 colon cancer cell line. Comprehensive analysis using electrophoresis, viscometry, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), circular dichroism (CD), linear dichroism (LD) spectroscopy, and biomolecular simulations demonstrated that &lt;b&gt;AuL&lt;/b&gt; binds to DNA via a dual mechanism, specifically minor groove binding and alkylation, with binding constants &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.48 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.59 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Our data indicate that &lt;b&gt;AuL&lt;/b&gt; initially binds to the minor groove of DNA, at which point a nucleobase substitutes the Cl ion, resulting in &lt;b&gt;AuL&lt;/b&gt; binding directly to the DNA bases. In conclusion, the dual binding mode of &lt;b&gt;AuL&lt;/b&gt; with DNA underscores its potential as a promising anticancer agent, opening new avenues for drug discovery and the development of metal-based therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An ESIPT&#8208;Based Fluorochromogenic Tweezer for Reversible and Portable Detection of Al3+ Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>

An ESIPT&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;naphtholphthalein&#8208;derived &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; regenerable fluoro&#8208;chromogenic molecular tweezer NPDM is employed for the portable and selective detection and visualization of Al3&#8314; in real samples. NPDM can trace intracellular Al3&#8314; and F&#8315; ions without interference from oxidative stress, and it is the first reported smart molecular tweezer capable of detecting Al3&#8314; ions generated during the electroporation within living cells.








Abstract
ESIPT&#8208;based fluorochromes are promising materials for the detection of various chemical and biological species, particularly metal cations. Herein, we have meticulously designed a prototypical ESIPT&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;naphtholphthalein&#8208;derived &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorogenic tweezer, NPDM, for&#160;the selective detection and visualization of Al3&#8314; in biological and environmental samples. NPDM was found to specifically interact with Al3&#8314;, exhibiting dual emissions, high sensitivity (50 s), large Stokes shifts (140 and 176&#160;nm), and a low detection limit of 16.3&#160;nM. Notably, the sensing mechanism of NPDM for Al3&#8314; involves metal ion&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced fluorescence enhancement (CHEF), ESIPT &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; effect as well as restricted intramolecular rotation (RIR). This mechanism is supported by Job's plot, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (&#185;H NMR) titrations,&#160;and density functional (DFT) calculations. Interestingly, the NPDM&#8208;Al3+ ensemble can function as a secondary chromo&#8208;fluorogenic tweezer for monitoring fluoride ions (F&#8722;) with a low detection limit of 34.8&#160;nM. Thus, an advanced molecular memory device was constructed based on the fluorescence &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8208;off&#8221; strategy and its excellent sensing properties. Moreover, a portable, smartphone&#8208;assisted intelligent platform has been developed to facilitate in&#8208;field, cost&#8208;effective, and accurate detection of Al3&#8314; in real environmental water samples. Significantly, NPDM was successfully employed to image intracellular Al3&#8314; and F&#8315; ions in HeLa cells without interference from oxidative stress. This represents the first reported smart molecular tweezer capable of detecting Al3&#8314; ions generated during electroporation within living cells. Furthermore, the strategy developed here is valuable for the creation of novel, practically beneficial luminescent molecules and offers an advanced luminescent detection platform for point&#8208;of&#8208;care sensing of health&#8208;related ionic species.

         <title>Scrambled RGD Hexameric Peptide Hydrogel Supports Efficient Self&#8208;Assembly and Cell Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled peptide hydrogels that incorporate bioactive motifs such as the integrin&#8208;binding epitope Arginine&#8208;Glycine&#8208;Aspartic acid (RGD), are known for supporting cell growth. Surprisingly, scrambling the peptide cell&#8208;adhesion motif RGD to RDG in an Fmoc&#8208;hexapeptide peptide gelator (Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD) results in superior properties in terms of minimum gelation concentration and biocompatibility.








Abstract
The amino acid sequence is crucial in controlling peptide&#8208;based hydrogel formation, whereby changing the position of a single amino acid can significantly alter the gel's properties. Herein, we report the gelation kinetics and cell viability of scrFmoc&#8208;GFFRDG (where we have scrambled the RGD&#8208;based gel hexapeptide; Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD). The scrambled sequence showed improved gelation properties compared to the original Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD sequence, with scrFmoc&#8208;GFFRDG forming a gel in under 10 min, significantly faster than the 2&#8208;h gelation time, and at a concentration eight times lower than the original Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD sequence. We also examined the combination of the two gelators in a ratio of 1:1, final concentration of 0.4% (w/v). Interestingly, the stiffness of the hybrid hydrogel was &#8764;3&#160;kPa, whereas individually, neither gelator at the same concentration exceeded 0.5&#160;kPa. The cell&#8208;adhesion motif RGD improves the ability of the peptides to promote attachment of cells due to integrin recognition. However, when fibroblasts were cultured on the hydrogels, scrFmoc&#8208;GFFRDG yielded a higher level of &#945;&#8208;SMA expression in cells than those cultured on Fmoc&#8208;GFFRGD, suggesting a microenvironment conducive to myofibroblast transitions. This study provides a new outlook on how a well&#8208;known scrambled peptide motif (RDG) can fine&#8208;tune hydrogel assembly and cell culture applications.

Dynamic nitroaldol reactions lead to alternating macrocyclization and polymerization. Aromatic dialdehydes with even&#8208;carbon dinitroalkanes form lowellane macrocycles, while odd&#8208;carbon dinitrocompounds promote polymerization. The alkyl chain folding patterns appear to significantly influence the reaction outcomes.








Abstract
Alternating macrocyclization and polymerization was observed in dynamic nitroaldol reaction systems. The reaction of an aromatic dialdehyde reacting with linear &#945;,&#969;&#8208;dinitroalkanes with even numbers of carbon atoms favored the formation of lowellane macrocycles, while the reactions involving dinitrocompounds consisted of odd numbers of carbon atoms promoted polymerization.

         <title>Construction of a Cyclic Regular&#8208;Triangle Trimer of Cytochrome c555 with a Central Hole Using Sortase A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>

CL&#8208;(c555)3 is a cyclic and symmetric regular&#8208;triangle building block protein that comprises three Aquifex aeolicus cytochrome c555 molecules and three &#945;&#8208;helical linkers. It was designed and constructed by covalently connecting the amino acid termini using sortase A&#8208;mediated ligation. CL&#8208;(c555)3 was assembled into a nanoporous supramolecular structure with approximately 16 and 30 &#197;&#8208;diameter pores in the crystal.








Abstract
Protein&#8208;based supramolecules require precise arrangement of building blocks. A regular&#8208;triangle trimer (cp&#8208;c555)3 has been constructed using an &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;inserted&#8208;circular permutant (cp&#8208;c555) of Aquifex aeolicus cytochrome (cyt) c555, where the trimers may dissociate to monomers. In this study, we stabilized the regular&#8208;triangle structure by constructing a cyclic regular&#8208;triangle of three &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;linked cyt c555 molecules using sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML). Comparing SML using sortase A for six cp&#8208;c555 variant trimers, the variant with GGG at the N&#8208;terminus and LPETG at the C&#8208;terminus reacted most efficiently. OP&#8208;(c555)3 was designed, in which two cyt c555 molecules were fused using an &#945;&#8208;helix, generating a dimer. The cyt c555 C&#8208;terminal region was attached to the N&#8208;terminus of the dimer, and the cyt c555 N&#8208;terminal region was attached to the C&#8208;terminus of the dimer using the same &#945;&#8208;helix. OP&#8208;(c555)3 was expressed in Escherichia coli cells, and the termini were connected by SML, forming a cyclic regular&#8208;triangle, CL&#8208;(c555)3. CL&#8208;(c555)3 showed higher thermostability than (cp&#8208;c555)3 and OP&#8208;(c555)3. CL&#8208;(c555)3 structural stability was confirmed using high&#8208;speed atomic force microscopy. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of CL&#8208;(c555)3 showed a cyclic structure and a nanoporous supramolecular assembly. These results demonstrate that a nanoporous supramolecular assembly can be constructed by designing a cyclic molecule with a central hole using SML.

&lt;p&gt;CL-(&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;555&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a cyclic and symmetric regular-triangle building block protein that comprises three &lt;i&gt;Aquifex aeolicus&lt;/i&gt; cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;555&lt;/sub&gt; molecules and three &#945;-helical linkers. It was designed and constructed by covalently connecting the amino acid termini using sortase A-mediated ligation. CL-(&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;555&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was assembled into a nanoporous supramolecular structure with approximately 16 and 30 &#197;-diameter pores in the crystal.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein-based supramolecules require precise arrangement of building blocks. A regular-triangle trimer (cp-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;555&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has been constructed using an &#945;-helix-inserted-circular permutant (cp-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;555&lt;/sub&gt;) of &lt;i&gt;Aquifex aeolicus&lt;/i&gt; cytochrome (cyt) &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;555&lt;/sub&gt;, where the trimers may dissociate to monomers. In this study, we stabilized the regular-triangle structure by constructing a cyclic regular-triangle of three &#945;-helix-linked cyt &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;555&lt;/sub&gt; molecules using sortase-mediated ligation (SML). Comparing SML using sortase A for six cp-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;555&lt;/sub&gt; variant trimers, the variant with GGG at the N-terminus and LPETG at the C-terminus reacted most efficiently. OP-(&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;555&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was designed, in which two cyt &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;555&lt;/sub&gt; molecules were fused using an &#945;-helix, generating a dimer. The cyt &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;555&lt;/sub&gt; C-terminal region was attached to the N-terminus of the dimer, and the cyt &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;555&lt;/sub&gt; N-terminal region was attached to the C-terminus of the dimer using the same &#945;-helix. OP-(&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Step&#8208;by&#8208;Step Self&#8208;Assembly of a Double&#8208;Walled Knotted Cage With Increasing Topological Complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct intermediates with unique topologies were sequentially formed during the self&#8208;assembly of a double&#8208;walled knotted cage. These topological transformations, which are kinetically forbidden without the reversibility of coordination bonds, allow each intermediate to possess sufficiently long residence times for isolation and enable detailed time&#8208;resolved observation of multistep spontaneous transformations






.

Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly process of a double&#8208;walled cage formed from a semiflexible tripodal ligand and a Pd(II) 90&#8208;degree block was tracked by NMR and x&#8208;ray analysis. At least two intermediate structures with distinct topologies were observed prior to the formation of the final double&#8208;walled cage. By optimizing the self&#8208;assembly conditions (e.g., time, solvent, and concentration), these topological intermediates were successfully isolated and analyzed by x&#8208;ray crystallography. They are considered crucial metastable structures that navigate the shortest pathway to the final structure, demonstrating the critical role of molecular topology in guiding and controlling the kinetics of metal&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Nitrides as Superior Electrocatalysts: Unveiling the Role of Entropy in Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy nitrides catalyst (CoNiCuVW)N with the different elements distributionwas synthesized using a new facile and in&#8208;situ method, showing excellent ORR and Zn&#8208;air catalytic performance. The entropy effect significantly reduces the binding energy of strongly adsorbed *OH intermediates, enhancing electrochemical activity.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy nitrides (HENs) are emerging as promising electrocatalysts due to their diverse elemental composition, tunable electrochemical properties, and a wide range of active sites that enhance adsorption and oxidation reactions. However, the unclear role of entropy has limited their full potential in electrocatalysis. In this study, we introduce a novel and straightforward method for synthesizing (CoNiCuVW)N with variable entropy levels using halite as a molten salt. By exploiting the synergistic effects of multiple metal components, we achieve robust bonding between the N&#8208;doped carbon substrate and HEN nanoparticles, resulting in a homogeneous element distribution. This uniformity leads to exceptional catalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline electrolytes, with an onset potential of 0.96&#160;V and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.91&#160;V. Additionally, HEN&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air batteries exhibit impressive performance, achieving 1.55&#160;V and maintaining 60% roundtrip efficiency over approximately 400 cycles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the high&#8208;entropy, homogeneous distribution of elements enhances active site availability, modulates electronic structure, and optimizes kinetics, thereby lowering reaction barriers during the ORR. This work not only facilitates the development of structurally ordered HEN nanoparticles but also lays the foundation for further exploration in electrochemical applications.

New green routes to fused heterocycles: Choline chloride (ChCl)/urea (1/2&#160;mol/mol) deep eutectic solvent (DES) is used as both recyclable reaction medium and promoter for the base&#8208;free iodocyclization of 3&#8208;alkynylthiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamides to 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;7H&#8208;thieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyran&#8208;7&#8208;imines. Recyclable DESs ChCl/Gly (1/2&#160;mol/mol, Gly = glycerol) and Bet/Gly (1/2&#160;mol/mol, Bet = betaine) are successfully used for subsequent Sonogashira and Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings, respectively.








Abstract
A green approach to a previously unknown class of iodine&#8208;containing heterocycles, namely 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;7H&#8208;thieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyran&#8208;7&#8208;imines, by iodocyclization of readily available 3&#8208;alkynylthiophene&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamides in a deep eutectic solvent (DES) as both solvent and promoter, has been developed. We have found that, while the reaction with I2 and K2CO3 as the base in a classical volatile organic solvent proceeded to a very limited extent, the iodocyclization was successful when performed under neutral conditions in choline chloride/urea (1/2 molar ratio). Moreover, the DES could be efficiently recycled several times without a significant decrease in the product yield. The promoting effect of the DES has been studied in detail using computational methods. The possibility to further decorate the newly synthesized iodinated heterocycles in a DES solvent (choline chloride/glycerol, 1/2 molar ratio, for Sonogashira reaction, and betaine/glycerol, 1/2 molar ratio, for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling) has been successfully assessed, and the solvent&#8208;catalyst system was recycled several times without appreciable loss of activity. A computational study on the effect of the betaine/glycerol system in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling has also been carried out, while the structures of representative products have been confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

Using N1&#8208;methyladenosine, a cancer biomarker as a target, a highly selective DNA aptamer was obtained with excellent selectivity and affinity, allowing the detection with a limit of detection of 1.9&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) level in urine increases in the presence of cancer and is associated with the tumor size and stage. In the present study, we aimed to develop a method for rapid, sensitive and accurate determination of m1A in urine samples. The capture systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) method was used to isolate aptamers that could selectively bind to m1A. We successfully isolated two sequences that have high selectivity toward m1A. The affinities against m1A were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and thioflavin T (ThT) assays. The N1MA1a aptamer has a Kd of 1.9&#177;0.1&#160;&#181;m determined by the ThT assay and 0.75&#177;0.04&#160;&#181;m determined by ITC. A strand&#8208;displacement biosensor was designed by labeling the aptamer with a carboxy fluorescein (FAM) and hybridizing it with a quencher&#8208;labeled complementary DNA strand. Using this biosensing system, m1A was detected with a detection limit of 1.9&#160;&#181;m. The system shows high selectivity to m1A and high tolerance to adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, thymidine, uridine and N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) as well as urine constituents at their real levels in urine. The sensor has been applied to five different human urine samples showing quantitative recovery values, which indicates practical potential of this aptamer&#8208;based biosensor.

         <title>Influence of Polymeric Dispersants on the Dissolution Rate of Tricalcium Silicate and the Nucleation of Calcium&#8208;Silicate&#8208;Hydrate and Portlandite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comb&#8208;copolymers with anionic functional groups and poly(ethylene glycol) side chains are concrete dispersants. However, they retard the hydration of the main Portland cement phase Ca3SiO5${\rm Ca}_{3}{\rm S}{\rm iO}_{5}$. Herein, we report on their influence on the dissolution rate of Ca3SiO5${\rm Ca}_{3}{\rm S}{\rm iO}_{5}$ and their nucleation&#8208;inhibiting effect on calcium&#8208;silicate&#8208;hydrate and calcium hydroxide. For phosphate and carboxylate groups, higher charge densities lead to stronger nucleation&#160;inhibition.







Abstract
Polycarboxylate ether (PCE) and polyphosphate ether (PPE) dispersants (also known as superplasticizers) are indispensable components of modern concrete mix designs. They reduce the yield stress of cement suspensions and thereby facilitate the reduction of the water&#8208;to&#8208;cement ratio. However, PCEs and PPEs also cause retardation of the cement hydration as a secondary effect, which causes delayed concrete strength development. It is proposed that the retardation is caused by the polymer influence on the tricalcium silicate dissolution rate and the crystallization of the hydration products (e.g., calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2$_2$ and calcium&#8208;silicate&#8208;hydrate 1.7CaO&#183;SiO2&#183;4H2O$1.7\mathrm{CaO}\cdot {\mathrm{SiO}}_{2}\cdot 4{\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ or C&#8208;S&#8208;H). This study examines the effect of four different polymeric superplasticizers with carboxylate and phosphate groups on the reaction kinetics of the pure cement phase tricalcium silicate (in cement shorthand C3S${\rm C}_{3}{\rm S}$). Our results confirm the strong retarding effect of the polymers on the hydration reaction of the C3S${\rm C}_{3}{\rm S}$ paste. Based on model experiments, we studied the polymer influence on the dissolution of C3S${\rm C}_{3}{\rm S}$ and the nucleation of the hydration products. We observed no C3S${\rm C}_{3}{\rm S}$ dissolution&#8208;inhibiting effect of the polymers at the chosen concentrations and undersaturation. However, such an inhibiting effect may occur at solution conditions closer to the saturation limit. Titrimetric analyses indicate that all polymers suppress the nucleation of portlandite and C&#8208;S&#8208;H, with a higher polymer charge density leading to a more pronounced&#160;inhibition.

A biomimetic strategy was applied in the design and synthesis of mimic models for methylene&#8208;tetrahydromethanopterin (methylene&#8208;H4MPT), a key coenzyme in archaeal metabolism. We identify highly effective mimics, demonstrating considerable enzymatic efficiency in hydride transfer reactions. Our study provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;function relationship of methylene&#8208;H4MPT and offers useful mimic models for studying archaeal metabolism and synthetic one&#8208;carbon (C1) utilization systems

Abstract
Tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) is a specialized coenzyme found in methanogenic archaea and methylotrophic bacteria, essential for one&#8208;carbon (C1) transfer and redox reactions in processes like methanogenesis. However, its structural complexity and limited availability hinder its use in studying archaeal metabolism and H4MPT&#8208;dependent enzymes. Inspired by the success of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) biomimetic compounds, we employed a similar structural simplification strategy for methylene&#8208;H4MPT, designing four mimics (mimics 1&#8211;4) that retain the crucial hydride&#8208;donating imidazolidine unit while modifying the pterin structure and hydrophilic tail. Structural and crystallographic analysis of methylene&#8208;H4MPT&#8208;bound enzymes, including H4MPT&#8208;dependent formaldehyde&#8208;activating enzyme MtdA and H4MPT&#8208;dependent formaldehyde&#8208;activating enzyme Fae, highlighted the importance of the pterin group in hydrogen bonding and active site interactions. Activity evaluation of the mimics in hydride transfer assays and relay reactions with MtdA and NADPH&#8208;dependent ketoreductase CgKR1 showed that the pterin structure is critical for enzymatic activity, and improving water solubility via hydrophilic tail modification enhances performance. This biomimetic approach offers functional substitutes for methylene&#8208;H4MPT and potentially valuable tools for studying archaeal metabolism and synthetic microbial systems for C1 compound utilization.

         <title>FeOHSO4@C Cathode with Low Strain and High Pseudocapacitance for Advanced Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>

The open crystal structure of FeOHSO4@C is demonstrated to provide sufficient space, facilitating K+ ionic diffusion and it exhibits outstanding potassium storage capacity attributed to a low&#8208;strain mechanism for K+ uptake/removal, high pseudocapacitance, as well as 3D electronic conductive framework.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based polyanionic cathode materials in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have appealed to an increasing number of interest due to these advantages of low cost, environmental friendliness and excellent structural stability. However, these inherent drawbacks of inferior electronic conductivity and terrible nanostructural stability hinder its practical application. Here, we report a novel low&#8208;strain iron&#8208;based polyanion&#8208;type cathode material FeOHSO4@C for KIBs. In this work, the surface of FeOHSO4 nanoparticles is well carbon encapsulated, carbon coating layer with large surface area and excellent electrical conductivity is &#8776;2.5&#160;nm in thick, which can not only inhibit the aggregation and growth between FeOHSO4@C nanoparticles during charging and discharging, but also provide a 3D electronic conductive framework that activates electrochemical reactivity. As a result, the FeOHSO4@C cathode exhibits outstanding potassium storage capacity (capacity retention of 80.95% over 200 cycles at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1) attributed to a low&#8208;strain mechanism for K+ uptake/removal, high pseudocapacitance, as well as 3D electronic conductive framework. Operando XRD and ex situ XPS analyses revealed a single&#8208;phase reaction route of orthorhombic FeOHSO4@C during cycling.

         <title>Design and Evaluation of Bivalent K&#8208;Ras Inhibitors That Target the CAAX Binding Site and the Acidic Surface of Farnesyltransferase and Geranylgeranyltransferase I</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>

Chemical inhibition of K&#8208;Ras posttranslational prenylation represents a promising strategy against aggressive cancers. A structure&#8208;based design produces piperidine&#8208;based peptidomimetics conjugated to cationic modules, effectively inhibiting FTase and GGTase I at single&#8208;digit nanomolar concentrations. This dual&#8208;targeting approach demonstrates promise for treating K&#8208;Ras&#8208;driven cancers.








Abstract
Mutant K&#8208;Ras drives cancer through its membrane localization, which requires posttranslational modification by farnesyltransferase (FTase). FTase attaches farnesyl to the K&#8208;Ras C&#8208;terminal CVIM tetrapeptide, enabling membrane binding. However, K&#8208;Ras can also undergo compensatory geranylgeranylation by geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I), making FTase inhibition alone ineffective. Dual inhibition of FTase and GGTase I is necessary to fully block K&#8208;Ras localization and its cancer activity. We developed bivalent inhibitors targeting both FTase and GGTase I by binding to the CVIM (C = cysteine, V = valine, I = isoleucine, M = methionine) site and an adjacent acidic surface. A nonthiol CVIM peptidomimetic based on a piperidine scaffold showed potent FTase inhibition (Ki = 2.1&#160;nM) with less effect on GGTase I (Ki = 210&#160;nM). Adding cationic modules to this compound produced dual inhibitors with enhanced potency (Ki = 2&#8211;5&#160;nM), significantly improving upon previous agents. These bivalent inhibitors effectively reduced mutant K&#8208;Ras cancer cell viability and inhibited K&#8208;Ras farnesylation and geranylgeranylation in cells. This dual&#8208;targeting approach shows promise for treating K&#8208;Ras&#8208;driven cancers.

Easily accessible dichloroarsanes are suitable precursors for the synthesis of novel triazaarsoles, the arsenic analogues of tetrazoles and triazaphospholes. Our findings pave the way to access and fully investigate such aromatic arsenic heterocycles in detail.








Abstract
Easily accessible dichloroarsanes are suitable precursors for the synthesis of rarely explored triazaarsoles, the arsenic analogues of tetrazoles and triazaphospholes. Calculations on the DFT level gave insight into the electronic structure of such planar compounds, indicating a high degree of aromaticity. Our preliminary investigations pave the way for accessing and investigating a whole variety of new heterocycles that contain a low&#8208;coordinated arsenic atom.

         <title>Low&#8208;Power Piezoelectric Energy From Chiral Supramolecular Polymer of a Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Conjugated &#960;&#8208;System</title>

A donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (DAD) type conjugated &#960;&#8208;system exhibits spontaneous homochiral supramolecular polymerization in non&#8208;polar solvent and gelation. Solid film generated from preformed aggregate in solution exhibits piezoelectricity and mechanical micro energy harvesting.








Abstract
Soft piezoelectric systems have high demands in flexible, shape conformable and biocompatible low&#8208;power electronics. This paper explores chiral supramolecular polymerization of an ambipolar donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (DAD)&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;system showing emerging piezoelectric properties for harvesting micro energies. The DAD molecule is designed with two conjugated thiophene donors with a central naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) acceptor chromophore to facilitate intra&#8208;molecular charge&#8208;transfer, evident from a prominent absorption band in the visible region. This chromophore is further appended with two chiral benzamide&#8208;wedges for homochiral supramolecular polymerization. The ambipolar character of the chiral DAD chromophore is manifest from the cyclic voltammogram. Extended H&#8208;bonding among the amide groups leads to homochiral supramolecular polymerization in methyl&#8208;cyclohexane, which is retained in the solid film. The impeccable piezoelectricity in poled DAD film revealed a d33 &#8764; 7 pm/V as measured by the piezoforce microscopy. Poled piezo DAD devices under optimized periodic external impact force, frequencies and supplied electric field generate a viable output voltage and current density of 1.3&#160;V, 0.8&#160;&#181;A/cm2, and Poutput &#8764; 1.6 &#181;W/cm2, respectively. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, stacked and poled supramolecular &#960;&#8208;conjugated DAD devices are shown to viably illuminate a light emitting diode through charging a series of micro capacitors, indicating the potential utility for low power technologies.

This paper explores chiral supramolecular polymerization of an ambipolar donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (DAD)-type &#960;-system showing emerging piezoelectric properties for harvesting micro energies. The DAD molecule is designed with two conjugated thiophene donors with a central naphthalene-diimide (NDI) acceptor chromophore to facilitate intra-molecular charge-transfer, evident from a prominent absorption band in the visible region. This chromophore is further appended with two chiral benzamide-wedges for homochiral supramolecular polymerization. The ambipolar character of the chiral DAD chromophore is manifest from the cyclic voltammogram. Extended H-bonding among the amide groups leads to homochiral supramolecular polymerization in methyl-cyclohexane, which is retained in the solid film. The impeccable piezoelectricity in poled DAD film revealed a d&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; &#8764; 7 pm/V as measured by the piezoforce microscopy. Poled piezo DAD devices under optimized periodic external impact force, frequencies and supplied electric field generate a viable output voltage and current density of 1.3&#160;V, 0.8&#160;&#181;A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;output&lt;/sub&gt; &#8764; 1.6 &#181;W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, stacked and poled supramolecular &#960;-conjugated DAD devices are shown to viably illuminate a light emitting diode through charging a series of micro capacitors, indicating the potential utility for low power technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

For the first time, infrared (IR) irradiation is demonstrated as an effective energy source, able to assist the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination. The C&#8211;N coupling reactions were performed under quasi&#8208;solvent&#8208;free conditions, in nonanhydrous conditions and without the exclusion of air, using aryl iodides and bromides functionalized with both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, along with a variety of secondary and primary amines.








Abstract
We report a novel and green approach for Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination, assisted by Infrared (IR) irradiation under quasi&#8208;solvent&#8208;free conditions, in a nonanhydrous environment, and without the exclusion of air. The C&#8211;N coupling reactions, performed with a stoichiometric amount of cyclopentyl methyl ether, proceed with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good yields using aryl iodides and bromides bearing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, along with a variety of secondary and primary amines.

         <title>Synergistically Designed Carbon&#8208;Free MoS2/MoO2 Heterostructure Anodes with Interfacial Covalent Bonds for High&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The study designs a carbon&#8208;free MoS2/MoO2 heterostructure with abundant heterointerfaces and strong chemical bonding. The formed S&#9472;O bonds generate an internal built&#8208;in electric field, endowing the heterostructure with metallic conductivity and high Na+ adsorption energy. The rational structural design ensures fast reaction kinetics and a stable heterointerface, enabling superior high&#8208;rate Na+&#8208;ion storage performance.








Abstract
The development of hierarchical heterostructured materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) remains hindered by suboptimal high&#8208;rate cycling performance, primarily due to phase interface pulverization and separation during charge&#8211;discharge processes. To address these challenges, we designed a carbon&#8208;free hierarchical structure comprising few&#8208;layered MoS&#8322; nanosheets and MoO&#8322; nanocrystals through precise compositional optimization and rational structural engineering. The heterogeneous components are interconnected through robust S&#9472;O covalent bonds, which theoretical calculations and experimental results confirm generate a built&#8208;in electric field at the heterointerfaces, significantly enhancing reaction kinetics. Crucially, these covalent bonds stabilize the heterointerfaces, improving structural integrity and mitigating electrode material agglomeration and pulverization. Additionally, the MoS&#8322;/MoO&#8322; heterostructure enhances Na&#8314; adsorption energetics and reduces Na&#8314; diffusion barriers, facilitating efficient ion transport. Leveraging its abundant heterointerfaces and stable architecture, the composite delivers exceptional rate performance (432.7 mAh&#183;g&#8315;&#185; at 10 A&#183;g&#8315;&#185;) and outstanding cycling stability (nearly 100% capacity retention over 400 cycles at 5 A&#183;g&#8315;&#185;). This work provides a strategic framework for designing heterostructured materials with stable interface&#8208;rich architectures, advancing the development of high&#8208;performance conversion/alloy&#8208;type anodes for energy storage applications.

         <title>Development of Eco&#8208;Friendly Thermosetting Resins From Zein and Diglycidyl Ether of Vanillyl Alcohol. A Step Toward Sustainable Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study represents a groundbreaking achievement in material science by introducing Zein, a natural and renewable protein, as an active crosslinker in biobased DGEVA epoxy thermosetting resins. Its uniqueness lies in demonstrating how a plant&#8208;derived byproduct can be effectively integrated into synthetic polymer matrices, resulting in materials with enhanced thermal stability, improved mechanical properties, and tunable shape memory effects. Beyond its chemical innovation, the study aligns with global sustainability goals, offering a compelling alternative to petroleum&#8208;based resins and reducing environmental impact.








Abstract
Herein, bisphenol A&#8208;free, biobased, and sustainable thermosets were obtained for the first time by using two naturally derived compounds. Zein, a renewable biopolymer extracted from maize, exhibited excellent reactivity and versatility, while the diglycidyl ether of vanillyl alcohol (DGEVA), a biobased epoxy monomer derived from vanillin, served as a sustainable alternative to petrochemical epoxides. By chemically integrating Zein into DGEVA thermosetting networks, environmentally friendly resins with excellent thermomechanical properties were developed. A comprehensive analysis of seven formulations, incorporating up to 30&#160;wt.% Zein, provided critical insights into the relationship between protein content and resin properties. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis highlighted a strong interaction between Zein and DGEVA's epoxy groups, resulting in significantly higher polymerization enthalpies compared to neat DGEVA homopolymerization. This indicates the formation of robust crosslinked networks driven by Zein's multifunctional groups. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) demonstrated substantial improvements in the thermosets&#8217; glass transition (Tg), with values increasing from 52&#176;C in neat DGEVA to 73&#176;C in DGEVA/30% Zein systems, indicating enhanced stiffness and thermal performance. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed good thermal stability of the bioresins, with degradation temperatures exceeding 300&#176;C. Beyond these technical achievements, this study underscores the broader significance of incorporating Zein, a byproduct of corn agriculture, into biobased thermosets.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework: Synthesis, Characterization and Metal&#8208;Free Organocatalyst for CO2 Fixation Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>

A catechol&#8208;functionalized COF was prepared. The COF, featuring both aldimine and ketimine linkages, adopted slipped AA stacking mode. The material showed high CO2 uptake capacity and high catalytic activity for cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxide at mild conditions. The adsorption of CO2 was studied by GCMC simulations and the activation of epoxide was investigated through DFT calculations.

Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) incorporating hydrogen bond donor (HBD) moieties show great promise for heterogeneous catalyst for CO2 cycloaddition. In this work, a catechol&#8208;functionalized COF (BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF) was constructed via Schiff&#8208;base condensation under solvothermal conditions, which was characterized using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8208;IR), solid&#8208;state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR&#8208;TEM), diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF presents high crystallinity, large surface area (523 m2&#160;g&#8722;1) and remarkable chemical stability, along with abundant hydroxyl functional groups distributed on the pore wall. This framework shows a CO2 adsorption capacity up to 88&#160;mg g&#8722;1 at 273 K and 1&#160;bar. The binding locations of the adsorption of CO2 over BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF was studied by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF displays remarkable catalytic performance for the cycloaddition of CO2 with epoxides under mild conditions. Under the condition of the epichlorohydrin/tetrabutylammonium bromide/BL&#8208;TF&#8208;COF molar ratio of 10210:630:4, the system achieved 62.5% substrate conversion at 25 &#176;C under atmospheric CO2 pressure (1 bar) within 48&#160;h. Mechanistic insights into epoxide adsorption and activation processes were investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

In this work, a catechol-functionalized COF (&lt;b&gt;BL-TF-COF&lt;/b&gt;) was constructed via Schiff-base condensation under solvothermal conditions, which was characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), solid-state &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM), diffuse reflection spectroscopy (DRS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). &lt;b&gt;BL-TF-COF&lt;/b&gt; presents high crystallinity, large surface area (523 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and remarkable chemical stability, along with abundant hydroxyl functional groups distributed on the pore wall. This framework shows a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacity up to 88&#160;mg g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 273 K and 1&#160;bar. The binding locations of the adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over &lt;b&gt;BL-TF-COF&lt;/b&gt; was studied by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. &lt;b&gt;BL-TF-COF&lt;/b&gt; displays remarkable catalytic performance for the cycloaddition of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with epoxides under mild conditions. Under the condition of the epichlorohydrin/tetrabutylammonium bromide/&lt;b&gt;BL-TF-COF&lt;/b&gt; molar ratio of 10210:630:4, the system achieved 62.5% substrate conversion at 25 &#176;C under atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure (1 bar) within 48&#160;h. Mechanistic insights into epoxide adsorption and activation processes were investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective (4+1) carbospiroannulation is catalyzed by an l&#8208;tert&#8208;leucine dipeptide thiourea catalyst, which efficiently constructs chiral [4,4]nonane frameworks with exceptional stereocontrol. The reaction is effective on a wide variety of substrates, resulting in high yields. DFT studies offer critical mechanistic insights, while additional transformations demonstrate the synthetic potential of the products.








Abstract
An unprecedented thermodynamically unfavorable (4+1) deysmmetrizing spiroannulation through a thermodynamic enolate intermediate, enabling a single&#8208;step synthesis of ubiquitous scaffolds such as all&#8208;carbon chiral spirocycles, is disclosed. In this spiroannulation, we present a vinylogous organocatalytic enantioselective desymmetrizing (4+1) cycloaddition approach involving alkylidene malononitrile and cyclopent&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienone. This carbospiroannulation method produces functionally enriched spiro[4,4]nonane structures with three stereocenters, has presented good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Detailed DFT calculations reveal an intriguing reaction mechanism, which validates our observations.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sensitized Fulgimides with Selective Multiplicity&#8208;Based Three&#8208;State Photoswitching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling photoinduced reactions by the excited&#8208;state multiplicity remains a significant challenge. We present a systematic approach to unimolecular three&#8208;state photoswitching of fulgimides, utilizing the multimodal role of excited&#8208;state multiplicity. By combining direct excitation with the rationally designed triplet&#8208;exclusive sensitizer, we differentiate the reactivity of singlet and triplet excited states within the hexatriene core of fulgimides, enabling precise control of their photoisomerization.








Abstract
Precise control over excited&#8208;state multiplicity is a powerful strategy for controlling photochemical reactivity, particularly in multimodal systems where different multiplicities lead to distinct reaction products. Here, we present a multiplicity&#8208;sensitive, multimodal, fulgimide&#8208;based system capable of three&#8208;state photoswitching both in solution and in the solid state. With the aim of suppressing singlet&#8208;state sensitization, we rationally designed an intramolecularly sensitized system that enables triplet&#8208;exclusive energy transfer&#8212;a crucial feature for selective multiplicity&#8208;dependent reactivity. Our findings provide insights into the underlying principles of intramolecular triplet&#8208;exclusive sensitization and its application in controlling three&#8208;state photoswitching in unimolecular systems.

         <title>Highly Efficient Solvent&#8208;Free Cyanosilylation of Aldehydes Catalyzed by Bilayered Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kinds of two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials with bilayer structure and different metal active sites were designed and synthesized, and the corresponding nanosheets were prepared to fully expose the catalytic active sites. These two kinds of MOF nanosheets can be used as highly efficient catalysts for the cyanosilylation reaction of aldehydes under solvent&#8208;free and room temperature conditions.








Abstract
While metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising for heterogeneous catalysis and mechanistic investigations due to their well&#8208;defined active sites, high porosity, large surface area, and structural tunability, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOFs exhibit superior catalytic efficiency over three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOFs by offering higher specific surface areas and reduced diffusion limitations, thus enhancing active site exposure and substrate accessibility. In this work, two novel bilayered 2D MOFs, Mg3(TPHB)2(H2O)6&#183;(DMF)12 (Mg&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF) and Mn3(TPHB)2(H2O)6&#183;(DMF)16 (Mn&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF), were synthesized, and their efficacy as Lewis acid catalysts in the solvent&#8208;free cyanosilylation of aldehydes was investigated. Both MOFs exhibited remarkable catalytic activity, with Mg&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF achieving complete conversion of benzaldehyde within 10 min at room temperature. This catalytic performance surpasses that of many previously reported MOF catalysts for the same reaction, highlighting the potential of 2D MOFs in catalysts. To gain deeper insights into the catalytic mechanism and the superior performance of Mg&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF, computational studies were conducted to determine the free energy profiles of the reaction pathways with and without the catalyst. The results of these calculations corroborated the experimental findings, indicating a lower energy barrier for the Mg&#8208;TPHB&#8208;MOF&#8208;catalyzed reaction. Furthermore, both MOFs demonstrated good reusability over five catalytic cycles, maintaining high conversion rates and structural integrity.

         <title>Dissecting the Diverse Reactivity of &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Aluminum(I) Compound towards Azaarenes: Insight From DFT Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of NacNacAl(I) with five structurally similar azaarenes. The monocyclic azaarenes form key adducts with NacNacAl(I) and yield three different products mainly due to electronic effects of their substituents, whereas the bicyclic azaarenes form key biradicals with NacNacAl(I) and undergo C&#9472;C coupling after intermolecular coordination or N&#9472;N bond cleavage after intramolecular coordination.








Abstract
Interest in aluminum(I) complexes has surged in recent decades due to the unusual role of electropositive aluminum as donor atoms in ligands. Numerous Al(I) complexes, which were previously considered too unstable, have been isolated. Among these, &#946;&#8208;diketiminate aluminum(I) complex, NacNacAl(I), stands out for its unique reactivities including oxidative addition and &#960;&#8208;bond activation. However, the understanding of reactions involving NacNacAl(I) has not yet been fully established. This study unveils the mechanisms behind the diverse reactivity of NacNacAl(I) with five structurally similar azaarenes through DFT calculations. Interestingly, computational results indicate that some of the five reactions can proceed via radical processes. A holistic comparison of all results highlights the mechanistic differences between monocyclic and bicyclic azaarenes. In the initial step with NacNacAl(I), monocyclic azaarenes form Al(I)&#8208;azaarene adducts, whereas bicyclic azaarenes generate Al(II)&#8208;azaarene biradicals. These intermediates are critical for understanding their distinctive reactivity. For monocyclic azaarenes, electronic effects of their substituents on the azaarene adducts result in varying reaction outcomes, while for bicyclic azaarenes, subsequent intermolecular or intramolecular coordination of biradicals leads to different products. This study provides deeper mechanistic insights into reactions associated with NacNacAl(I) complexes, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of these reactions.

         <title>Crystal Structure Engineering Enables Enhanced Ionic Conductivity in LAGP Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming to optimize the ionic conductivity of LAGP solid electrolyte, the regulation of crystal framework of electrolyte was studied. By simply substituting commonly used &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 with &#947;&#8208;Al2O3, the optimized &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;derived LAGP achieves a threefold enhancement in total ion conductivity, reaching 6.04 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs) have emerged as promising energy storage systems, offering superior safety and energy density compared to conventional liquid electrolyte&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Among solid&#8208;state electrolytes, NASICON&#8208;type lithium aluminum germanium phosphate (LAGP) has attracted significant attention due to its exceptional air stability and wide electrochemical window. However, its practical ionic conductivity remains substantially below theoretical predictions. This study demonstrates a crystal structure engineering strategy using &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 instead of conventional &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 as the aluminum source. The weaker Al&#9472;O bonds and higher reactivity of &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 facilitate increased Al3&#8314; incorporation into the LAGP framework, enhancing free Li&#8314; concentration at M2 sites and boosting bulk ionic conductivity. Furthermore, &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 addition reduces AlPO4 impurities and improves morphological uniformity, thereby optimizing grain boundary conductivity. The optimized &#947;&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;derived LAGP achieves a threefold enhancement in lithium&#8208;ion conductivity, reaching 6.04 &#215; 10&#8722;4 (total) and 2.77 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 (intracrystalline), representing a significant advancement in solid electrolyte performance.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Substituted 1,3&#8208;Diazaazulenes: Synthesis, Structural Studies, Reactivity, and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High regioselection in the synthesis of brominated and amino&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;diazaazulenes enables regiocontrolled access to a series of differently substituted 4&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 8&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazaazulenes with soft&#8208;tunable optical properties. The tetra&#8208;aminosubstituted diazaazulenes are not entirely planar, as observed by crystallographic and computational studies for a series of derivatives. The structural distortion is also connected to the unusual hydrolytic reactivity of the amine substituents in acidic media.








Abstract
We report a facile method for the functionalization of the 1,3&#8208;diazaazulene core at the C4, C6, and C8 positions via regioselective bromination and subsequent substitution with amine nucleophiles. Both steps can be controlled to enable selective mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, or trisubstitution at C4, C6, or C8. Crystallographic studies revealed significant distortion from planarity in the aromatic core of the highly substituted 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetra&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazaazulenes, further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT). The tetra&#8208;aminosubstituted diazaazulenes displayed unusual hydrolytic reactivity in acidic media, a reaction that is rare with aminobenzenes and appears to be promoted in this case by structural distortion. The combinatorial functionalization of 1,3&#8208;diazaazulene resulted in soft&#8208;tunable optical properties observed in both solution and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films. Strong low&#8208;energy absorptions (&#949; = 11,800&#8211;38,500 M&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;1), arise from &#960;&#8211;&#960;* transitions, as supported by our 2nd order approximate coupled&#8208;cluster (CC2) calculations. Consequently, the fluorescence relaxation mechanism involves a &#960;*&#8211;&#960; transition mixed with charge transfer, producing emission spanning from deep blue to yellow (&#955;em_max = 428&#8211;535). We anticipate that the modular synthesis, tunable substitution patterns, and consequent modulation of both reactivity and photophysical properties renders the 1,3&#8208;diazaazulene core an intriguing molecular platform for a variety of applications.

         <title>Highly Emissive Flexible Organic Crystals with Broad Piezochromism and Optical Waveguides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic single crystals have been designed with a rigid benzothiadiazole planar core and fluorinated terminal moieties that enable both strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and halogen/hydrogen bonding. This synergistic interplay endows the flexible crystals with exceptional optomechanical responses, namely, a remarkable piezochromic range (&#916;&#955;&#160;=&#160;171 nm) andoptical waveguiding characteristics (0.286&#8211;0.529 dB mm&#8315;&#185;).








Abstract
The integration of mechanical flexibility with stimuli&#8208;responsive optical properties in organic single crystals (OSCs) remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic rigidity of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Herein, we report a rationally designed OSC, FBCF, that synergistically combines elastic deformability, broad piezochromism, and optical waveguides via a planar benzothiadiazole (BTA) core and fluoroarene termini. The molecular architecture enforces face&#8208;to&#8208;face slip&#8208;stacking via multiple noncovalent interactions (N&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H, &#960;&#8208;&#960;, and C&#8208;F&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960;), yielding centimeter&#8208;scale crystals with exceptional elastic bending and full recovery. These crystals exhibit high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency (PLQY&#160;=&#160;75.8%) and serve as optical waveguides, maintaining performance even when bent (optical loss coefficients (OLCs): 0.286&#8211;0.529&#160;dB mm&#8722;1). Crucially, FBCF exhibits broad pressure&#8208;responsive spectral shifts (&#916;&#955;&#160;=&#160;171&#160;nm), achieving a piezochromic sensitivity of 16.7&#160;nm GPa&#8722;1, exceeding that of most organic systems. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses reveal hierarchical packing: rigid lamellar layers (stabilized by strong &#960;&#8208;&#960;/dipole interactions, &#8208;118.56 to &#8209;58.45&#160;kcal/mol) interconnected via weaker interlayer C&#8208;F&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; bonds (&#8722;18.8&#160;kcal/mol). This architecture enables elastic deformation through interlayer slippage while preserving intralayer order.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Assisted &#945;&#8208;Activation of Ketones, Their Arylation and Keto&#8208;Enol Equilibrium Confined into a Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>

A series of ketones undergoes Co&#8208;assisted &#945;&#8208;arylation under confinement within a carbaporphyrin environment, altering macrocycles&#8217; chemistry and forming unique structural motifs.








Abstract
In this study, we explore the cobalt&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;activation of ketones within modified porphyrin macrocycles, focusing on the arylation processes and the influence of macrocyclic confinement on keto&#8208;enol tautomerism. The activation of ketones such as acetone, butanone, 3&#8208;pentanone, and acetophenone and their possible transfer from a cobalt center on the carbaporphyrin fragment results in the formation of new C(sp2)&#9472;C(sp3) bonds in confined macrocyclic environments of N&#8208;confused porphyrin and azuliporphyrin. Such modified ligands allow for following altered keto&#8208;enol equilibrium. They reversibly form unique structural motifs, azuleno[1,2&#8208;c]pyran and 2,4&#8208;dihydropyrano[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole modulated by acid&#8208;base conditions and macrocyclic aromaticity. The coordination of a modified macrocycle to a rhodium(I) center leads to a series of complexes with a final form with rhodium(III) in the cavity. The rhodium(III) center cleaved the C(21)&#9472;C bond and transferred the acetone fragment back to the metal ion from the azulene fragment.

The activation of ketones such as acetone, butanone, 3-pentanone, and acetophenone and their possible transfer from a cobalt center on the carbaporphyrin fragment results in the formation of new C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#9472;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds in confined macrocyclic environments of N-confused porphyrin and azuliporphyrin. Such modified ligands allow for following altered keto-enol equilibrium. They reversibly form unique structural motifs, azuleno[1,2-c]pyran and 2,4-dihydropyrano[3,4-c]pyrrole modulated by acid-base conditions and macrocyclic aromaticity. The coordination of a modified macrocycle to a rhodium(I) center leads to a series of complexes with a final form with rhodium(III) in the cavity. The rhodium(III) center cleaved the C(21)&#9472;C bond and transferred the acetone fragment back to the metal ion from the azulene fragment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Quinoid&#8208;Diradical Inter&#8208;Conversion in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates acid/base&#8208;triggered reversible quinoid&#8208;diradical interconversion in oligo&#8208;aniline (O&#8208;ANI) at the single&#8208;molecule level. Scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) measurements reveal a 6.5&#8208;fold conductance switching behavior, accompanied by exceptional environmental stability. The distinct redox&#8208;state&#8208;dependent electron transport characteristics suggest potential applications in electrically tunable molecular switches and adaptive nanoelectronic systems.








Abstract
A profound understanding of the reversible regulation mechanisms among multiple redox states of organic molecules is essential for further development of molecular switching devices. In this study, an oligo&#8208;aniline derived quinoidal molecular wire was designed and synthesized. The reversible inter&#8208;conversion processes between its initial (quinoid) and protonated (diradical) states were comprehensively investigated with optical measurements, and the EPR experiments confirmed the formation of radical species upon protonation. The single&#8208;molecule charge transport properties were then investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy break junction (STM&#8208;BJ) technique. It was found that the molecular wire O&#8208;ANI can serve as a reversible molecular switching process with &#8776; 6.5&#8208;fold conductance variation through acid/base adjustments. Additionally, theoretical analyses elucidated the mechanism of the quinoid&#8208;diradical inter&#8208;conversion. The enhanced comprehension of the reversible quinoid&#8208;diradical inter&#8208;conversion at the single&#8208;molecule level provides new strategies for advancing the molecular switching materials and devices.

         <title>Control of Chemo&#8208;Selectivity via Alcohol&#8208;Affected Kinetics in Cu&#8208;Hydroxylamine Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidation of Mesitol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an alcohol&#8208;adjustable strategy to control the oxidation of mesitol catalyzed by CuCl2/NH2OH&#183;HCl system. In tBuOH, the product aldehyde has high selectivity, while in MeOH, the ether intermediate is the main product, and its kinetics and mechanism have been studied in detail.








Abstract
Chemo&#8208;selectivity control is a critical challenge in aerobic C&#8722;H oxidations, particularly in preventing overoxidation. In this work, we present an alcohol&#8208;tunable strategy to control the oxidation degree of CuCl&#8322;/NH&#8322;OH&#183;HCl&#8208;catalyzed mesitol oxidation in alcohols. In tBuOH, the reaction efficiently yields the aldehyde product with high selectivity, whereas in MeOH, the ether intermediate turned out to be the predominant product. Further kinetic analysis and mechanistic studies revealed that the reactivity is driven by the in&#8208;situ formation of protonated alkyl nitrate ([RON(O)OH]+), highlighting the critical role of ROH solvents. The differing responses of mesitol and the ether intermediate to the reaction conditions result in distinct kinetics across different alcohols, enabling precise control over the final products. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the origins of alcohol&#8208;dependent chemo&#8208;selectivity and pave the way for advancing protocols for selectivity control.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Switchable Rings and Chains in Dynamic Covalent Imine Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of a visible&#8208;light switchable azobenzene A with aliphatic diamines X of variable chain lengths gives access to various macrocyclic isomers. While diamines with even numbers of methylene groups exclusively create Z,Z&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles, both Z,Z&#8208; and E,E&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles are accessible starting from odd&#8208;numbered diamines. This study gives a deepened overview of the accessibility of macrocyclic isomers governed by a rational even&#8211;odd alteration of simple diamines.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembliy of red&#8208;light switchable, functionalised ortho&#8208;difluoroazobenzene isomers E&#8208;/Z&#8208;A with aliphatic diamines exhibits an alternating match/mismatch behaviour depending on the diamine's chain length. While even&#8208;numbered diamines exclusively form imine macrocycles with the Z&#8208;configured azobenzene isomer, odd&#8208;numbered diamines form photoswitchable, defined macrocycles. The formation of Z,Z&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles was demonstrated with butane&#8208;1,4&#8208; (B) and hexane&#8208;1,6&#8208;diamine (H), while additionally E,E&#8208;A2X2&#8208;type macrocycles were obtained with propane&#8208;1,3&#8208; (Pr), pentane&#8208;1,5&#8208;diamine (Pe), and diethylene glycol bisamine (O), validated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures of E,E&#8208;A2Pr2 and E,E&#8208;A2O2. The observed reactivity differences arise from the preferred conformations of the flexible diamines in solution, which alternate predictably with odd and even numbers of methylene groups, investigated by 19F&#8208;DOSY NMR experiments, MALDI&#8208;MS measurements, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. These findings provide detailed insight into photoresponsive self&#8208;assembled systems and highlight the potential of azobenzenes in dynamic covalent chemistry, offering new opportunities for controlling structure and function in adaptive materials.

         <title>Tuning Surfactant Chain Length in a Metallomicellar Catalyst System to Study Organic Transformations in Water Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrated the influence of alkyl chain length, crafted in Mo&#8208;based catalysts, on the reaction rates of oxidative coupling of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene with benzyl alcohol in water where the catalytic efficiency increased with chain length. Using the best catalyst Mo&#8208;16, a variety of benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized in water under open air without the addition of any external base/additive.








Abstract
The hydrophobicity of alkyl chain plays crucial role in the aggregation behavior of metallomicelle&#8208;forming coordination complexes, in water, thereby influences the reaction rates of metallomicelle catalyzed organic reactions. Here, we have demonstrated the chain length variation for alkyl group that is covalently attached to ligand backbone of a MoO2(Ln)(OH2) type complex showing metallomicelle formation in water when the alkyl group is eight&#8208;carbon chain or beyond. The impact of alkyl chain length on reactivity of organic transformation was systematically studied for oxidative coupling of benzylic alcohol with 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene forming benzimidazole, in water, as a model reaction. The efficiency of Mo&#8208;complexes increases with chain length for the mentioned organic reaction performed in water medium under open air as sole oxidant without the involvement of base/additive, thus making the protocol attractive. This work develops a unique study to understand organic reactions in micellar medium as well as an efficient pathway for the direct synthesis of benzimidazoles from alcohols and diamines.

         <title>Fluorescent Carbazole&#8208;Derived Aza[5]Helicenes: Synthesis, Functionalization, and Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Variously substituted indolophenanthridines, indolocarbazoles, and cinnolinocarbazoles synthesized by ortho fusion from teraryl precursors show significant Stokes shifts, especially for the protonated states of indolophenanthridines and cinnolinocarbazole. These compounds combine helical and axial chirality and show prominent aggregation&#8208;induced emission, which is considerably enhanced in conjugates with tetraphenylethylene.

Abstract
5,8&#8208;Dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;c]carbazole (ICz), 9H&#8208;cinnolino[3,4&#8208;c]carbazole (CnCz), and variously alkyl&#8208;, alkenyl&#8208;, and aryl&#8208;substituted indolo[2,3&#8208;k]&#8208; and &#8208;[3,2&#8208;a]phenanthridines (IPs) were synthesized using an ortho fusion strategy with Suzuki cross couplings, intramolecular nitrene insertions, diazo couplings, and Morgan&#8211;Walls cyclizations as key reactions. The IPs were additionally transformed into organoboranes and helicene conjugates with tetraphenylethylene derivatives. The compounds fluoresce with large Stokes shifts, exhibit strong acidochromism, and show a good to excellent aggregation&#8208;induced emission. Their helical structure was elucidated by x&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and by quantum chemical calculations. HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps of 3.96&#8722;4.06&#160;eV and S1&#8208;T1 gaps were calculated, with CnCz showing a small singlet&#8208;triplet inversion. Relative pKa values of 6.65&#8722;9.55 were estimated for the different types of azahelicenes.

A copper hydride (CuH)&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroallylation of 1&#8208;trifluoromethylthioalkenes has been developed. The appropriate choice of chiral ligands successfully promotes the enantioselective C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond formation at the &#945;&#8208;position of trifluoromethylthio (SCF3) group. Detailed experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal that leaving groups of allylic electrophiles significantly influence enantioselectivity as well as chemoselectivity.

         <title>Red Emissive 1D Copper(I) Thiolates and Green Emissive 2D Copper(I) Halide Thiolates Displaying Second Harmonic Generation and Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 27, May 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of new copper thiolate and copper halide thiolate coordination polymers are presented, the first one is made of 1D chains with classical red emission, while the second one is built of 2D layer exhibiting bright green emission due to a two&#8208;photon absorption process and is coupled with a secondharmonic generation response.








Abstract
Copper(I), as a d10 metal, is a promising affordable noncritical raw material finding great interest for the development of photoluminescent materials. Halide and thiolate&#8208;based copper(I) compounds are known for their efficient emission and good stability. In order to rationalize the effect of these two anions in the structure and photoemission of Cu(I) compounds, two new families of coordination polymers have been synthesized: the copper(I)&#8208;thiolates: [Cu(p&#8208;SPhX)]n (X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br), and the copper halide thiolates: [Cu3Cl(p&#8208;SPhX)2]n (X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br). The two families display different structural dimensionalities: 1D [Cu(p&#8208;SPhX)]n versus 2D [Cu3Cl(p&#8208;SPhX)2]n and they exhibit distinct photophysical properties: [Cu(p&#8208;SPhX)]n shows usual solid&#8208;state red emission, while [Cu3Cl(p&#8208;SPhX)2]n hasintense solid&#8208;state green anti&#8208;Stokes emission, associated, for the noncentrosymmetric compounds, X&#160;=&#160;F and Br, to non&#8208;linear optical (NLO) response, pointing out the effect of the weak halogen interactions of the thiolate ligands on the symmetry and the properties.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Intermolecular O&#8208;Peptidylation Protocol Enabled by Sequential Acyl Transfer on Thiol&#8208;Incorporated Threonine Followed by Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The late&#8208;stage intermolecular O&#8208;acylation of the threonine (Thr) side chain was accomplished by reacting thiol&#8208;incorporated Thr with a peptide thioester in open air. The thioester, which contained the volatile trifluoroethanethiol, facilitated the formation of S,O&#8208;diacyl peptides. These were subsequently converted into the desired O&#8208;acyl threonine isopeptide through silver&#8208;mediated thioester selective activation followed by desulfurization.








Abstract
The thiol functionality on the methyl group of a threonine derivative [Thr(SH)] facilitates O&#8208;acylation of the Thr hydroxy group with a thioester. We previously showed that a Thr(SH)&#8208;incorporated peptide thioester can be converted to the corresponding Thr&#8208;containing cyclic depsipeptide through intramolecular thioester exchange (S&#9472;S acyl transfer) and subsequent desulfurization of the O&#8208;acyl peptide resulting from intramolecular S&#9472;O acyl transfer. Based on our success in depsipeptide synthesis, we applied the Thr(SH)&#8208;facilitated protocol to the synthesis of branched O&#8208;acyl isopeptides. Initial attempts identified two issues. First, the S&#8208;acylation step with a thioester proceeds in an entropically preferential manner in cyclic depsipeptide synthesis, but not in the case of branched isopeptides. Using a highly volatile thiol component in the thioester solved this issue. Second, the intermolecular thioester change step was accompanied by the formation of an S,O&#8208;diacyl intermediate as a major component; this issue was solved by using thioester&#8208;selective activation of the diacyl species with silver(I) salt followed by desulfurization. Ultimately, the optimized Thr(SH)&#8208;mediated protocol facilitated the late&#8208;stage O&#8208;acylation of a Thr residue in peptide sequences. We show that the protocol has wide substrate scope and demonstrate its application to ubiquitination of the Thr residue of HOIL&#8208;1 peptide.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this comprehensive review, we summarize&#160;the recent advances in the total synthesis of specific cembranoid and norcembranoid diterpenoids, including pavidolide B, scabrolide A, nominal scabrolide B, havellockate, ineleganolide, sinulochmodin C, rameswaralide, scabrolide B, sinuscalide C, horiolide, and fragilolide A. Notably, we showcase the bio&#8208;inspired transformations and highlight the latest breakthroughs in the total synthesis of these natural products.








Abstract
The C19 norcembranoid and C20 cembranoid diterpenoids represent an intriguing class of natural products found in both marine and terrestrial environments. These complexes, with a highly oxygenated state and compact polycyclic structures, have captured the synthetic interests due to their unique bioactivities. Over the past two decades, the total synthesis of these natural products has been a challenging task, driven by their intricate structural features. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances in the total synthesis of various norcembranoid and cembranoid diterpenoids, focusing on their transformations and the latest breakthroughs in this field.

We present high&#8208;frequency/high&#8208;field EPR spectroscopy studies on a series of pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidally coordinated ErIII(DAPMBH/H2DAPS)X complexes with different apical ligands (X&#160;=&#160;(H2O)Cl (1), (CH3OH)N3 (2), Cl2 (3)) to directly determine the electronic properties of the ground state and low&#8208;energy Kramers doublets, namely effective g&#8208;tensors and zero field splittings. Our findings are compared to the results of numerical studies and are used to rationalise the observed differences in magnetic relaxation behavior.

In particular, we report direct experimental determination of the effective g&#8208;values and zero field splittings of the energetically low&#8208;lying Kramers doublets. Our quantitative determination of the magnetic anisotropy highlights the relevance of an axial g&#8208;tensor for SMM behavior and suggests that fast magnetic relaxation is mainly driven by a thermally assisted quantum tunnelling process via low&#8208;lying excited states.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Dicyanation of Alkenes Enabled by Phosphorus Radical Cation Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a synergistic phosphine&#8208;photoredox catalytic strategy for the direct dicyanation of styrenes with TMSCN. This approach utilizes a phosphorus radical cation to initiate an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover with alkenes, followed by sequential nucleophilic cyanation, enabling the efficient synthesis of alkyl 1,2&#8208;dinitriles from alkenes. Further synthetic transformations of these dinitrile motifs and mechanistic insights into the reaction pathway have been demonstrated.








Abstract
While notable progress has been made in alkene cyanation for the synthesis of alkyl nitriles, catalytic strategies enabling the direct dicyanation of simple alkenes remain relatively under&#8208;explored. In this study, we introduce a synergistic phosphine&#8208;photoredox catalytic system that facilitates the direct dicyanation of styrenes using TMSCN in the presence of oxidant. This approach utilizes a phosphorus radical cation to initiate an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover with alkenes, followed by sequential nucleophilic cyanation. This protocol allows for the efficient synthesis of alkyl 1,2&#8208;dinitriles from alkenes under mild conditions. Notably, the method exhibits broad substrate scope and commendable efficiency, serving as a valuable complement to existing cyanation methodologies. The synthetic utility of the dinitrile products is further demonstrated through diverse derivatization reactions, highlighting their applicability in constructing nitrogen&#8208;rich molecular architectures. Mechanistic studies provide further insight into the reaction pathway and underscore the potential of phosphorus radical cations in alkene functionalization.

         <title>A Convergent Approach to Resorcinolic Macrolides to Expand Structural Diversity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular and enantioselective approach to resorcinolic macrolides enables targeted C15 modifications, macrocycle rigidity, and a novel cyclic peptide hybrid strategy to tune ATP&#8208;binding site selectivity. Structural alterations enhance Hsp90 paralog inhibition, introduce covalent warheads for GRP94, and reveal new inhibitors of KRasG12C, expanding ATP&#8208;mimetic chemical space for drug discovery.








Abstract
The resorcinolic macrolide (RM) family comprises over 50 natural products with diverse biological activities, including the potent natural Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol. Here, we report a modular and enantioselective synthetic strategy featuring a biomimetic macrocyclization&#8211;aromatization cascade that enables rapid access to natural and unnatural RMs. Using this route, we generated a small panel of minimal RMs, introducing covalent warheads, double bonds for macrocycle rigidification, and modifications at the C15 position, a position that has not been modified before. We also synthesized macrocyclic peptide&#8208;RM hybrids, offering a platform for rapid diversification. We evaluated all analogs for inhibitory activity against Hsp90&#945; and Hsp90&#946; and for disruption of the KRasG12C&#8211;CRAF protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI). We found that introduction of polar groups at C15 improved Hsp90 activity relative to the representative RM de&#8208;O&#8208;methyllasiodiplodin, dependent on stereochemistry, whereas introduction of larger groups at C15 or introduction of a trans double bond into the macrocycle reduced activity. Two analogs with poor Hsp90 inhibitory activity exhibited dose&#8208;dependent inhibition of the KRasG12C&#8211;CRAF PPI. This work demonstrates that strategic modifications of a minimal RM scaffold through modular chemical insight can provide foundational structure&#8211;activity relationships for the class.

         <title>Organocatalytic Switches of DNA Glycosylase OGG1 Catalyze a Highly Efficient AP&#8208;Lyase Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic switches are small molecules that combine active site affinity and a nitrogen&#8208;centered base for catalysis, effectively removing the rate&#8208;determining step of the OGG1 biochemical cascade. Here, we identify a minimal structure and modulate the active nitrogen pKa, enabling the catalysis of ultrafast AP site incisions in a range of pH environments. Importantly, improved compounds exhibit potent anti&#8208;fibrotic effects in a patient&#8208;derived model of MASH.








Abstract
8&#8208;oxoGuanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) is the first known target of organocatalytic switches (ORCAs), which rewrite the biochemical function of the enzyme through redirection of its preferred substrate from 8&#8208;oxoG to AP sites. Previously, different ORCA chemotypes were shown to enhance the operational pH window for OGG1, possibly through direct involvement in proton transfer events during DNA strand cleavage. Accordingly, compound pKa is a crucial and necessary consideration for the identification and application of future OGG1 ORCAs. Here, we identify a minimal structure of organocatalytic switches&#8211;4&#8208;anilino pyridines and 6&#8208;anilino pyrimidines&#8211;which are dimethyl&#8208;amino&#8208;pyridine (DMAP)&#8208;type Br&#248;nsted bases binding the active site of OGG1. Systematic interrogation of compound basicity through modulation of electron&#8208;withdrawing (EWG) and electron&#8208;donating (EDG) substituents reveals that a pKa less or equal to the assay pH is a viable parameter for prediction of compound activity. The lead structure (AC50 13&#160;nM, pKa 7.0) was then identified as a potent scaffold from a screen in a patient&#8208;derived 3D model of metabolic dysfunction&#8208;associated steatohepatitis (MASH), where it reduced hepatic fibrosis by 35%. Collectively, these findings deepen the knowledge of this novel modulator class, with important implications for future enzyme targets and probe development.

&lt;p&gt;Organocatalytic switches are small molecules that combine active site affinity and a nitrogen-centered base for catalysis, effectively removing the rate-determining step of the OGG1 biochemical cascade. Here, we identify a minimal structure and modulate the active nitrogen pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, enabling the catalysis of ultrafast AP site incisions in a range of pH environments. Importantly, improved compounds exhibit potent anti-fibrotic effects in a patient-derived model of MASH.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8-oxoGuanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) is the first known target of organocatalytic switches (ORCAs), which rewrite the biochemical function of the enzyme through redirection of its preferred substrate from 8-oxoG to AP sites. Previously, different ORCA chemotypes were shown to enhance the operational pH window for OGG1, possibly through direct involvement in proton transfer events during DNA strand cleavage. Accordingly, compound pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is a crucial and necessary consideration for the identification and application of future OGG1 ORCAs. Here, we identify a minimal structure of organocatalytic switches&#8211;4-anilino pyridines and 6-anilino pyrimidines&#8211;which are dimethyl-amino-pyridine (DMAP)-type Br&#248;nsted bases binding the active site of OGG1. Systematic interrogation of compound basicity through modulation of electron-withdrawing (EWG) and electron-donating (EDG) substituents reveals that a pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; less or equal to the assay pH is a viable parameter for prediction of compound activity. The lead structure (AC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 13&#160;nM, pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; 7.0) was then identified as a potent scaffold from a screen in a patient-derived 3D model of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), where it reduced hepatic fibrosis by 35%. Collectively, these findings deepen the knowledge of this novel modulator class, with important implications for future enzyme targets and probe development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfate Recognition in Water via Charge&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dicationic tetralactam macrocycle achieves selective sulfate recognition in water via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. Structural, thermodynamic, and computational studies reveal an entropy&#8208;driven mechanism enabled by electrostatic complementarity and desolvation. This work offers design principles for developing aqueous&#8208;phase receptors for sensing, separation, and catalysis.








Abstract
Achieving selective molecular recognition of hydrophilic anions in water remains a formidable challenge due to the competitive nature of water and the high hydration energies of target anions such as sulfate. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a simple dicationic tetralactam macrocycle (BPTL2&#8314;&#183;2Cl&#8315;) capable of binding highly hydrated anions in water via charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. Structural, spectroscopic, thermodynamic, and computational studies reveal that BPTL2&#8314; exhibits a strong binding affinity for sulfate (Ka&#160;=&#160;2892&#160;M&#8315;&#185;), driven primarily by entropic gain from water release and reinforced by electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT&#8208;optimized structures confirm the formation of directional [N&#9472;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O] and [C&#9472;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O] hydrogen bonds. Comparative studies with a control macrocycle (6Na+&#8226;HCTL6&#8722;) that has a charge&#8208;neutral binding cavity underscore the essential role of cationic charge in overcoming desolvation enthalpic penalties. The receptor displays anti&#8208;Hofmeister selectivity, preferentially binding more hydrophilic anions. This work provides fundamental insights into the mechanisms of anion recognition in water. It establishes charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding as a powerful strategy for developing next&#8208;generation receptors for sensing, separation, sequestration, transport, and catalysis in aqueous environments.

         <title>Formation Of Gold&#8208;Astatine Bonds in N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the search for alternatives to the traditional astatoaryl bond, Au(I)&#9472;NHC complex was successfully radiolabeled with 211At by halide exchange and showed promising stability in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Mass spectrometry experiments coupled with relativistic DFT calculations support the superiority of Au(I) over Rh(I) and Ir(I) and give insights into the role of the NHC ligand in order to access stable 211At&#8208;compounds.








Abstract
With the purpose of exploring alternatives to the poorly stable astatoaryl bond found in most 211At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the coordination between astatine and metal&#8208;NHC (NHC&#160;=&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complexes was investigated. To orient this work, relativistic DFT calculations were performed, highlighting a superiority of gold(I) over rhodium(I) and iridium(I), both regarding the strength of the metal&#8208;astatine bond and the metal's preference for astatine over other halogens. The DFT calculations also revealed a more stable metal&#8208;astatine bond with electron&#8208;withdrawing NHCs. Accordingly, two Au(I) complexes, [AuCl(IPr)] (IPr&#160;=&#160;N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[2,6&#8208;(di&#8208;isopropyl)phenyl]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and [AuCl(IAd)] (IAd&#160;=&#160;N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis[adamantyl]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were radiolabeled by halide exchange in excellent radiochemical yields with iodine&#8208;125 and astatine&#8208;211 in a water/acetonitrile mixture with a reducing agent. While the adamantyl&#8208;substituted complex was not investigated further due to its lack of solubility in aqueous or semi aqueous media, the stability of [Au211At(IPr)] in the presence of phosphate&#8208;buffered saline was evaluated and proved excellent (96% after two half&#8208;lives), encouraging further studies with relevant cancer&#8208;targeting vectors.

         <title>Hybrid pH Responsive Supramolecular Polymers Through the Combination of the Ureido&#8211;Pyrimidinone Motif with &#946;&#8208;Sheet Peptide Sequences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of the ureido&#8211;pyrimidinone motif with two different &#946;&#8208;sheet peptide sequences yielded supramolecular structures with significantly different morphologies in water. The resulting supramolecular nanostructures showed structural stability between pH = 5 and 9, while precipitation occurred at pH = 3.0 and random coil formation at pH 12. This work poses the basis for the development of novel responsive supramolecular polymers.








Abstract
Supramolecular biomaterials based on 1D supramolecular polymers in water replicate the fibrous and dynamic structures of natural architectures. Peptides, valued for their biocompatibility, are commonly employed as building blocks for supramolecular biomaterials, often in combination with large aromatic or hydrogen&#8208;bonding groups at the N&#8208;terminus to improve their structural stability. Herein, the self&#8208;assembly properties of two &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides combined with the ureido&#8211;pyrimidinone self&#8208;dimerizing motif in aqueous solution are investigated in detail. The assembly of the resulting molecules is demonstrated to be intimately dependent on the &#946;&#8208;sheet sequence, while the incorporation of a hydrophobic spacer enhances the assembly of the monomers, irrespective of the peptide sequence employed. Furthermore, the assembly of each monomer is significantly enhanced at pH = 3.0 while being stable between pH = 5.0 and 9.0. Only at pH = 12, upon enolate formation, the transition to random coil conformation is observed for all the monomers. The supramolecular polymers developed hereby point to fundamental design principle toward the development of UPy&#8208;peptide based materials with tuneable properties and potential applications in the biomedical fields of research.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Talented Bismuthinidenes: Double C(sp3)&#9472;I Bond Activation Using Single or Two Bi Centers.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study illustrating a tunable reactivity for bismuthinidene complexes toward dihalomethanes is presented. Two types of double activation of C(sp3)&#9472;I bonds of diiodomethane were observed depending on the structure of the ligand. When a Dipp group was present on the nitrogen, the first C&#9472;I bond underwent oxidative addition (OA) toward the bismuth followed by alkylation of the imine function in cooperation with the ligand, whereas a double OA of two C&#9472;I bonds toward two bismuthinidene centers was observed for the tBu analogue.








Abstract
The reaction of [2,6&#8208;(DippN = CH)2C6H3]Bi (1Dipp, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPrC6H3) with CH2I2 proceeded via double C&#9472;I bond activation yielding [2,6&#8208;(DippN = CH)2C6H3]Bi(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,N)&#9472;CH2)I2 (3). By contrast, the reaction of 1Dipp with 1,2&#8208;diiodoethane provided [2,6&#8208;(DippN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]BiI2 (1DippI2) and ethene. The tert&#8208;butyl analogue [2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi (1tBu) reacted with CH2ClX to give [2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2Cl)X (X&#9552;I (4) or Cl (5)). Further, its reactivity with CH2I2 was sensitive towards the stoichiometry since using a 1:1 ratio gave a mixture of dinuclear complex {[2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi(I)}2(&#956;&#8208;(Bi,Bi)&#9472;CH2) (6) and [2,6&#8208;(tBuN&#9552;CH)2C6H3]Bi(CH2I)I (7). The reaction could be shifted in favor of 7 using an excess of CH2I2, but with 0.45 eq. of CH2I2 compound 6, as a product of double C&#9472;I bond activation mediated by two Bi atoms was isolated as the main product.

When a Dipp group was present on the nitrogen, the first C&#9472;I bond underwent oxidative addition (OA) toward the bismuth followed by alkylation of the imine function in cooperation with the ligand, whereas a double OA of two C&#9472;I bonds toward two bismuthinidene centers was observed for the &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu analogue.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of [2,6-(DippN = CH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Bi (&lt;b&gt;1Dipp&lt;/b&gt;, Dipp = 2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;PrC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; proceeded via double C&#9472;I bond activation yielding [2,6-(DippN = CH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Bi(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;Bi,N&lt;/i&gt;)&#9472;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). By contrast, the reaction of &lt;b&gt;1Dipp&lt;/b&gt; with 1,2-diiodoethane provided [2,6-(DippN&#9552;CH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]BiI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1DippI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) and ethene. The &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl analogue [2,6-(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuN&#9552;CH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Bi (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;/b&gt;) reacted with CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ClX to give [2,6-(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuN&#9552;CH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Bi(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl)X (X&#9552;I (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) or Cl (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;)). Further, its reactivity with CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was sensitive towards the stoichiometry since using a 1:1 ratio gave a mixture of dinuclear complex {[2,6-(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuN&#9552;CH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Bi(I)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;Bi,Bi&lt;/i&gt;)&#9472;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) and [2,6-(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuN&#9552;CH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Bi(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I)I (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;). The reaction could be shifted in favor of &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; using an excess of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but with 0.45 eq. of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compound &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, as a product of double C&#9472;I bond activation mediated by two Bi atoms was isolated as the main product.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymerase Synthesis of Hypermodified DNA Displaying a Combination of Thiol, Hydroxyl, Carboxylate, and Imidazole Functional Groups in the Major Groove</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates bearing functional groups of amino acid side chains in enzyme active sites (OH, SH, COOH, and imidazole) were synthesized and used for enzymatic synthesis of hypermodified DNA displaying these substituents in the major groove mimicking peptides or proteins.








Abstract
We designed and synthesized a set of six 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates (dNTPs) bearing functional groups mimicking amino acid side chains in enzyme active sites (OH, SH, COOH, and imidazole) attached to position 5 of pyrimidines or position 7 of 7&#8208;deazapurines through different linkers. These modified dNTPs were studied as substrates in enzymatic synthesis of modified and hypermodified DNA using several DNA polymerases. In primer extension (PEX), all modified dNTPs provided DNA containing one, two, three, or, (all) four modified nucleotides each bearing a different modification, although the thiol&#8208;modified dNTPs were worse substrates compared to the others. In PCR, we observed exponential amplification for any combination of one, two, or three nonsulfur dNTPs but the thiol&#8208;modified dNTP did not work well in any combinations. Sequencing of the hypermodified DNA confirmed the good fidelity of the incorporation of all the modified nucleotides. This set of modified dNTPs extends the portfolio of building blocks for prospective use in selections of functional nucleic acids.

         <title>From Desferrioxamine B Umpolung to an Enantiopure Bifunctional Chelator for 89Zr&#8208;immunoPET</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional group transformations were performed at the pendent amine residue of desferrioxamine B (DFO), the commercial siderophore used in various medical applications, including iron decorporation, antibiotic development, and molecular imaging. Our results will broaden the scope of reactions, so far restricted to amide bond formation, for the functionalization of DFO with, for example, a chromophore, an additional ligand, a bioconjugable spacer.








Abstract
Promising results in preclinical diagnosis based on 89Zr&#8208;immunoPET have fostered the development of efficient chelators for this tetravalent metal. Leads in this area are octadentate ligands obtained by extension of the desferrioxamine B trihydroxamic acid DFO with a fourth bidentate ligand. In the approach reported here, the latter is a natural 6&#8208;membered cyclic hydroxamic acid deriving from (L)&#8208;ornithine. Its coupling to DFO via an (L)&#8208;lysine spacer required that the genuine amine function of the DFO terminus be changed to a carboxylic acid. Such a requirement prompted us to explore short sequences of chemical transformations that would challenge total syntheses leading to the same products. As a matter of fact, the target C&#8208;terminal DFO analogue was obtained in benzyl&#8208;protected form in three steps from commercially available DFO in 16% overall yield. Our short&#8208;step approach allowed us to implement other functionalities without DFO extension: &#8208;OH, &#8208;OTs, &#8208;CHO, &#8208;C(O)CH3, and &#8208;CH&#9552;CH2.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidation of Alcohols with Organic Dyes: from Homogeneous Systems to Sensitized Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxidation of alcohols retains an enormous importance in industry and in synthetic organic chemistry. The renaissance in photocatalysis is offering new routes to conduct this class of transformations under benign and sustainable conditions. In this concept article, we highlight the efforts that have been conducted in light driven oxidation of alcohols using organic photocatalysts. After an overview of relevant industrial processes, we will discuss relevant examples of organic photocatalysts employed in solution, or when integrated in photosynthetic schemes within semiconductor slides or nanoparticles. The combination of the photochemical systems with electrochemical routes or their engineering in flow will be considered. Where possible, we highlight also mechanistic aspects that reveal the key steps involved and contribute to improve the performance of the process. We finally present an outlook on the future perspectives and developments in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Decarbonylation of a Metal Phosphaketene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis of a metalated phosphastannene by reaction of the known cobalt(I) phosphaketene complex Co(DippPDI)(PCO) (DippPDI = 1,1'&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;imine) with Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2. The resulting compound, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P=Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2}, contains a localized P=Sn double bond, yet reacts like a phosphaketene transfer reagent, suggesting that, in solution, Co(DippPDI)(CO){P=Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} appears to exist in equilibrium with Co(DippPDI)(PCO) and Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2. This is facilitated by the fact that, on decarbonylation with Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2, the carbon monoxide extruded from the phosphaketene precursor Co(DippPDI)(PCO) remains in the coordination sphere of cobalt. The novel phosphaketene compounds (IDipp)Au(PCO) (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and (DippNacNac)Zn(PCO) (DippNacnac = HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) can be synthesized by reaction of Co(DippPDI)(CO){P=Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2} with Au(IDipp)Cl or (DippNacNac)ZnCl&#183;LiCl(OEt2)2, respectively. In the case of the former, the released stannylene Sn[CH(SiMe3)2]2 ultimately inserts into the Au&#8211;PCO bond affording the tin(IV) complex (IDipp)AuSn(PCO)[CH(SiMe3)2]2.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Thiol&#8208;ene Mediated Protocol for Thiolated Peptide Synthesis and On&#8208;Resin Diversification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfhydryl groups unique nucleophilic and redox properties render it highly useful as a synthetic handle for the diversification of peptide structure, including macrocyclization, ligation, and bioconjugation. Herein, we demonstrated a sequential acyl&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol for selectively installing thiol residues onto bioactive peptides on&#8208;resin. Through judicious placement of appropriate unsaturated residues, the hydrothiolation/S&#8208;deacetylation protocol offers a novel synthetic tool to investigate the structure&#8208;activity relationship of disulfide&#8208;containing peptides displaying different ring sizes. Furthermore, a new and generally applicable fluorescent labeling strategy is introduced to facilitate direct on&#8208;resin conjugation without intermediate purification steps. These new methods provide a robust and versatile platform for peptide macrocyclization and bioconjugation, with broad applications in peptide synthesis and chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridyl/Phenyl&#8208;Appended Acrylonitrile &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules: Thermally Stable Organic Crystals for Amplified Spontaneous Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly solid&#8208;state emissive molecular crystals have attracted attention as gain media for organic lasers. There is a need to develop solid&#8208;state luminescent molecules with excellent solubility and thermal stability through chemical design approaches despite the structural and functional diversity of organic molecular materials toward such media. Here, we report the synthesis and properties of the t&#8208;butyl&#8208; and pyridyl or phenyl&#8208;appended CDSBs. A solution process at room temperature could prepare each crystal of these molecules modified with pyridyl/phenyl. The crystal structure analysis results suggest that the difference in the pyridyl/phenyl group affects the crystal system. Solid&#8208;state emissions were similar due to the molecular structural differences affecting only the crystal structure. The emission spectrum of the crystal exhibited amplified spontaneous emission properties with the formation of population inversion. However, the pyridyl&#8211;pyridyl interactions contributed to the thermal stability of the crystal, which was stable even under high energy density laser irradiation. Therefore, molecular modification with the pyridyl group offers a new strategy for controlling crystal structures and rigid frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Near&#8208;infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence Activity in Fluorinated Binolate Ytterbium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral lanthanide complexes hold great potential in developing advanced circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials in the near infrared (NIR) wavelength range. While various ligands, such as &#946;&#8208;diketonates and biphenols, have been successfully used to sensitize NIR emission of lanthanide ions, little attention has been paid to regulating CPL behaviors via ligand modification. In this study, we report the synthesis, structure, luminescence and chiroptical properties of a pair of novel air&#8208;stable Shibasaki&#8208;type Yb(III) enantiomers supported by 3,3&#8217;&#8208;fluorinated binaphthol (F2BINOL). Compared to their non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts, these fluorinated complexes exhibit larger dihedral angles between the two naphthyl moieties and more distorted octahedral coordination environments around the Yb(III) ion, leading to increased overall crystal field splitting. These structural modifications result in enhanced photophysical properties: the luminescence lifetime (&#964;obs), sensitization efficiency (&#951;sens) and quantum yield (QY) improve from 2.1 &#956;s, 38% and 0.7% to 2.7 &#956;s, 63% and 1.8%, respectively. Additionally, the dissymmetry factor (glum) and CPL brightness (BCPL) at 963 nm increase by 32% and one order of magnitude, respectively. The scope of such chemical modification is broad,&#160;encompassing a variety of BINOL derivatives, offering a unique platform to further elucidate the relationship between structural and electronic properties and CPL activity in lanthanide systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Although soluble support (tag)&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase methods have found practical applications in peptide synthesis, they are still in their infancy for oligonucleotide synthesis. The development of techniques for selective tag cleavage with protective groups remaining is particularly important because such techniques are necessary to realize a convergent approach. Herein, we report an effective soluble support&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis using a novel tag that can be prepared from commercially available methyl gallate without column chromatography. Selective tag cleavages with protective groups remaining are made possible under mild reducing conditions to prepare protected fragments, which is necessary to realize a convergent approach.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cages are a robust class of molecular hosts with a myriad of applications in materials science. Despite this, there has been a paucity of explorations into the modification of their properties via external functionalization. In this work, [n]rotaxanes featuring unoccupied organic cages as stopper components and a small 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine macrocycle were constructed using the active metal template approach. By exploiting a scrambling methodology, it was possible to synthesise cages with a defined number of interlocked components (n = 2&#8208;4). The gas uptake, solubility and thermal properties of the interlocked systems were compared against those of their constituent, non&#8208;interlocked components. In this manner, we were able to demonstrate the potential of exploiting the mechanical bond for modulating the physiochemical properties of these molecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Amination of Peptides on the Solid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of amines into peptides via an on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution reaction sequence provides access to a wide variety of modifications, including amine&#8208;based metal ligands. Primary, secondary, and aromatic amines, as well as heteroaromatic N&#8208;nucleophiles, have been successfully incorporated into the reaction sequence. Particularly basic amines or ammonium chlorides can also be used successfully with acid or base additives.








Abstract
Late&#8208;stage peptide modification is a powerful tool for rapidly generating a library of peptide mimetics, for example, for drug discovery or catalyst development. While late&#8208;stage modifications exist for many types of structural features, methods for introducing amines into peptides via a late&#8208;stage approach are rare, despite their enormous potential for the development of peptide therapeutics. Here we present a protocol for introducing amines into peptides by our established on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution approach. Our method is compatible with a wide variety of amines, including primary and secondary amines, anilines, and other heteroaromatic N&#8208;nucleophiles mostly giving good to excellent yields. We introduce amines that are pharmacologically relevant as well as those that can impart catalytic or metal&#8208;binding properties into the peptide of interest. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we introduce the metal ligand tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (tren) into a tryptophan zipper scaffold using our late&#8208;stage amination approach to explore metal&#8208;induced stapling. Indeed, metal complexation via the tren ligand resulted in a thermal stabilization of more than 30&#160;K in one of our tryptophan zipper designs.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Organelle&#8208;Targeted Fluorescent Probe for Lipid Droplets and Endoplasmic Reticulum Using Bay&#8208;Region Substituted Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the complex cellular microenvironment, lipid droplets (LDs) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the complex cellular microenvironment, lipid droplets (LDs) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Their interactions are crucial for regulating processes such as lipid metabolism. Nevertheless, simultaneously monitoring these two organelles remains a challenging task. In this study, a dual-organelle-targeted perylene diimides (PDIs) based probe, LD-ER-PDI, by incorporating a 2-azetidinone substituent in the bay-region and two distinct targeting groups for LDs and ER at opposite ends of the imide positions was development, enabling discrimination between LDs and ER. Moreover, it can effectively visualize the dynamic behaviors of LDs and ER under starvation and oleic acid-treated conditions and also allows real-time monitoring of LDs formation from the ER. This work not only provides a valuable tool for studying the dynamic interactions between LDs and ER but also highlights a strategy for designing dual-organelle-targeted fluorescent probes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coupling CoOx@NC&#160;with NiFe LDH Enhances Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Rechargeable High&#8208;Efficiency Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale composite of NiFe LDH nanosheets anchored on Co&#8208;containing N&#8208;rich carbon and interconnected CNT framework ((CoOx@NC)2&#9472;NiFe), prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot pyrolysis and subsequent hydrothermal route, exhibits excellent OER and ORR performance in alkaline electrolytes, which is comparable to and even exceeds that of representative bifunctional electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Developing bifunctional catalysts with the high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities is of great significance in improving the efficiency of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries. Herein, this study adopts simple one&#8208;pot pyrolysis and subsequent hydrothermal strategies to prepare a high&#8208;performance bifunctional composite catalyst by coupling a layered hydroxide NiFe LDH with Co and N codoped carbon framework, composed of cobalt oxide and metallic Co nanoparticles distributed on interconnected porous carbon nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Benefiting from the exposure of more active sites, high conductivity, and beneficial charge transport advantages, the best catalyst (CoOx@NC)2&#9472;NiFe demonstrates excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and stability for oxygen&#8208;related electrochemical reactions, exhibiting a low potential gap of 0.757&#160;V. Additionally, the rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery assembled with the (CoOx@NC)2&#9472;NiFe catalyst performs a peak power density of 136&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, and a specific capacity of 803&#160;mAh&#160;gZn&#8722;1 at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and outstanding stability (over 200&#160;hours). This work presents a simple and low&#8208;cost approach for synthesizing bifunctional catalysts to realize efficient and durable rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular assemblies of a concaved aromatic host as electron donor (D) and a cationic heterocyclic guest as electron acceptor (A) are reported. These molecular units were noncovalently bound to afford charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes in solution and a CT co&#8208;crystal, displaying drastic color change from colorless to orange. The binding motif of the assemblies in the solution state was analyzed by NMR spectroscopic analysis and visualized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Theoretical calculations for the assemblies revealed electronic communication between the D and A fragments, proving their CT characteristics. The CT complexes were stabilized by not only CT and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions but also coulomb interaction between cationic acceptor unit and its anion supported by a hydrogen bond with a hydroxy group in the aromatic host, resulted in enhancement of orbital overlapping of the D&#8208;A fragments. Owing to the strong D&#8208;A interaction in the assemblies, the CT complexes undergo ultrafast charge recombination on a femtosecond timescale after photoexcitation of the CT transition, as confirmed by transient absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that understanding of assembly motif and its noncovalent interactions can lead to create optical materials manupulating electron transition dynamics.</dc:description>

Bifunctional Chiral ImPy&#8208;Carbene Ligands. H&#8208;Bonding Controlled Reactivity and Enantioselectivity in Au(I)&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifunctional chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands have been devised for enantioselective gold(I) catalysis. Based on a single C&#8208;stereogenic center derived from chiral pool &#945;&#8208;aminoacids and connecting an imidazopyridine core to an arylurea motif, enantioselective gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions could be achieved. High enantioselectivities were notably observed for substrates presenting a pendant propargyl alcohol on 2&#8208;naphthol and 1,6&#8208;enyne scaffolds. In the latter case, the catalyst shows a high degree of selectivity for the unprecedented 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig biscyclization of these substrates to give cyclopropyl&#8208;fused 6&#8208;ring heterocycles with a free OH functionality instead of the previously reported furan&#8208;fused products. This unusual selectivity was investigated by DFT studies, which suggested the dual role of the carbonyl group of the urea moiety: first as H&#8208;bond acceptor in the catalytic cycle to direct the enantioselectivity, second as a cooperative group in the hydrogen shift leading to deauration.</dc:description>

Based on a single C-stereogenic center derived from chiral pool &#945;-aminoacids and connecting an imidazopyridine core to an arylurea motif, enantioselective gold(I)-catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions could be achieved. High enantioselectivities were notably observed for substrates presenting a pendant propargyl alcohol on 2-naphthol and 1,6-enyne scaffolds. In the latter case, the catalyst shows a high degree of selectivity for the unprecedented 6-endo-dig biscyclization of these substrates to give cyclopropyl-fused 6-ring heterocycles with a free OH functionality instead of the previously reported furan-fused products.

         <title>Functionalization, Fragmentation and Expansion of cyclo&#8208;P4R2 Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, three isolobal complexes of the form [{LnM}(&#951;3&#8209;P4R2)]+ ({LnM}&#160;= {CpMo(CO)2} (A), {Cp'''Ni} (B), {Cp'''Co}&#8211; (C), R = Ph, iPr; Cp''' = 1,2,4&#8209;tBu3C5H2) are reacted with nucleophilic carbenes (L). While C does not show any reactivity, the cationic complexes A and B undergo addition reactions. The respective products [CpMo(CO)2(&#951;3&#8208;P4R2L)]+ (1a &#8211; d) and [Cp'''Ni(&#951;1:1&#8208;P4R2L)]+ (3a &#8211; d) show different geometries for L&#8208;P3PR2 ligands. Their reactivity towards EtO&#8211; results in either a simple addition (for 1) or a complex addition, ring&#8208;opening, rearrangement sequence (for 3). Moreover, [Cp'''Ni(&#951;2&#8208;IDippPP(OEt)PPiPr2)] (4) could be methylated by reaction with MeOTf, which affords an iso&#8208;tetraphosphine ligand, marking the first example of complete functionalization of a polyphosphorus ligand to a complexed phosphine. Mechanistic studies differentiate the influence of the isolobal {CpMo(CO)2}, {Cp'''Ni}, and {Cp'''Co}&#8211; transition metal units. Lastly, 3a&#8211;d were chosen as model substrates for further nucleophilic functionalization. In this regard, 3 reacts with [CN]&#8208; in a [3+1] fragmentation reaction affording the dimerized species [{Cp'''Ni}2(&#956;,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P4(PR2)2)] (6a: R = Ph, 6b: R&#160;=&#160;iPr) together with IDippP&#8208;CN. In contrast, the reaction with [ECO]&#8208; (E = P, As) led to an extension of the pnictogen framework yielding [Cp'''Ni(&#951;1:1&#8208;EP4Ph2IDipp)] (8a: E = P, 8b: E = As).</dc:description>

         <title>Pulsed Strategy Steers the Structural Evolution of Cu Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for CO2 Reduction to Methane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce hydrocarbon fuels, such as methane (CH4), offers a promising pathway to address the dual challenges of climate change and energy shortage. Although copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;MOFs) have proven to be promising CO2RR catalysts for hydrocarbon production, their uncontrollable structural reconstruction under operating conditions leads to elusive active sites. Herein, we demonstrate that a pulsed potential electrolysis strategy with well&#8208;designed pulse parameters can steer the dynamic reconstruction of Cu&#8208;MOFs to customize the active sites to enable CH4 formation pathway. Mechanistic studies using electron microscopic and spectroscopic methods indicated that constant&#8208;potential electrolysis caused the rapid reduction of Cu&#8208;MOF to metallic Cu nanoparticles, whereas pulsed electrolysis enabled the controlled generation of active Cu2O/CuO nanoclusters. Benefiting from this, the pulsed system delivers an exceptional Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.9% in CH4 production from the CO2RR. This selectivity markedly surpasses that of the constant&#8208;potential counterpart, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. In addition, this approach facilitates stable CH4 production for over 12 h while maintaining an FE above 60%.</dc:description>

Mechanistic studies using electron microscopic and spectroscopic methods indicated that constant-potential electrolysis caused the rapid reduction of Cu-MOF to metallic Cu nanoparticles, whereas pulsed electrolysis enabled the controlled generation of active Cu2O/CuO nanoclusters. Benefiting from this, the pulsed system delivers an exceptional Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.9% in CH4 production from the CO2RR. This selectivity markedly surpasses that of the constant-potential counterpart, representing the state-of-the-art. In addition, this approach facilitates stable CH4 production for over 12 h while maintaining an FE above 60%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Artificial Light&#8208;Driven Ion Pumps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature&#8217;s molecular machinery has long provided inspiration for the development of functional materials, with natural ion pumps exemplifying the efficient conversion of solar energy into directional ion transport. This process is crucial for cellular signaling, bioenergy conversion, and photosynthesis. Motivated by these biological systems, artificial light&#8208;driven ion pumps have emerged as transformative technologies for sustainable energy harvesting, desalination, and bioelectronic innovations. This review categorizes synthetic light&#8208;driven ion pumps into two primary mechanistic paradigms: (1) photoelectric&#8208;driven transport, which leverages photoinduced charge separation in semiconductor structures, and (2) molecular phototransduction, which utilizes light&#8208;induced isomerization or conformational changes in photoactive molecules. For each paradigm, we trace their biomimetic origins to natural ion transport mechanisms, followed by a detailed analysis of design strategies, operational principles, and material innovations. These innovations range from dynamic photoresponsive molecules and semiconductors to semiconductor heterostructures, all of which enable precise control over ion selectivity, flux, and energy conversion in a spatiotemporal manner. Finally, we discuss the emerging applications of light&#8208;driven ion pumps and the remaining challenges for their practical implementation.</dc:description>

         <title>Triflic Anhydride&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Anthraquinones and Anthrones via Unusual Intramolecular Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method to transform 3,3&#8208;diarylbenzofuranones into anthraquinones and anthrones has been developed using Tf2O as an inexpensive and readily available mediator via unusual intramolecular rearrangement. This work expands the utility of Tf2O in complex molecular transformations and offers valuable contributions to the synthesis of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Triflic anhydride (Tf2O) is a potent electrophilic activator for carbonyl groups, facilitating the formation of versatile triflate intermediates that undergo nucleophilic trapping to generate a broad array of valuable compounds. In this work, we have developed a novel method that utilizes Tf2O as a mediator for carbonyl activation and subsequent intramolecular rearrangement of 3,3&#8208;diarylbenzofuranones into anthraquinones 2 and anthrones 3. Both anthraquinones and anthrones are important molecules in the fields of natural products research, pharmaceuticals, and traditional Chinese medicines. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed involving Tf2O&#8208;mediated activation, carbocation formation, nucleophilic addition, and intramolecular cyclization, ultimately leading to the formation of anthraquinones and anthrones. The developed methodology is both operationally simple and convenient, without the need for an inert atmosphere. This study broadens the scope of Tf2O utility and extends the practical application of intriguing intramolecular rearrangement to the synthesis of biologically active compounds, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials.

         <title>The Evolution of Fluorescein into A Potential Theranostic Tool</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study successfully evolved a fluorescent imaging agent into a potent therapeutic compound. By functionalizing fluorescein, we enhanced its fluorescence and adapted it for multicomponent reactions (MCRs). We synthesized over 20 compounds across four diverse scaffolds. Compound 5e shows strong 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 inhibition, favorable properties and cell permeability, making it ideal for imaging and screening assays.








Abstract
Recent advances in drug discovery and development have been marked by the emergence of new modalities, including small molecule theranostic agents. While initial results from clinical trials have been promising, modern detectable inhibitors are still in an early stage of development. In this study, we present a strategy for chemically evolving a fluorescent imaging agent into a potent therapeutic entity, which not only retains its properties but also enhances its inhibition and detection applicability. By utilizing 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 as a model system, we leverage prior knowledge of its inhibitors to rationally functionalize fluorescein, enabling the targeted and highly efficient synthesis of over 20 derivatives across four different scaffolds. This approach ultimately led to the development of a potent, cell&#8208;permeable inhibitor that effectively engages its target in live cells and enables real&#8208;time visualization. These findings validate our new strategy for the development of small molecule diagnostic modulators, paving the way for application in other targets as well.

Three novel and multifunctional heterometallic [LnIII2CoII5] clusters have been reported. Notably, these heterometallic clusters show well magnetic behaviors and can effectively catalyze CO2 with epoxides and amines under mild conditions simultaneously.








Abstract
Three heterometallic [LnIII2CoII5] clusters with the formulas [LnIII2CoII5(L1)2(L2)2(L3)2(OAc)4(NO3)2]&#183;4CH3CN (LnIII&#160;=&#160;Gd (1), Tb (2), and Dy (3); HL1 = (E)&#8208;1&#8208;((2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;methoxybenzylidene)amino)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol, HL2&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;aminonaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol, and HL3&#160;=&#160;trimethylopropane) have been obtained via self&#8208;assembly of mixed ligands strategy. Significantly, cluster 1 displays a larger magnetocaloric effect (MCE) (&#8722;&#916;Sm&#160;=&#160;36.83&#160;J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 2.0&#160;K and 7.0 T), while cluster 3 shows slow magnetic relaxation behavior under zero dc field. Moreover, clusters 1&#8211;3 as heterogeneous catalysts can effectively convert CO2 with epoxides and benzylamine to form oxazolidinones under mild conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first reported bifunctional heterometallic heptanuclear clusters which show well magnetic behaviors and can effectively catalyze CO2 with epoxides and amines under mild conditions simultaneously.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Application of Covalent Organic Framework&#8211;Based Ionic Conductors in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reviews recent advances in COF&#8208;based ionic conductors for PEMFCs, covering their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies for enhancing proton conductivity and mechanical stability are analyzed, along with challenges in membrane durability and performance under low humidity or high&#8208;temperature conditions.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their tunable porosity and functional versatility, have demonstrated exceptional ionic conductivity in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This review summarizes recent advancements in COF&#8208;based materials for PEMFC applications, emphasizing their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies such as pore engineering, functional group modification, and hybrid designs with polymers are analyzed to highlight their influence on proton conductivity and mechanical stability. Recent developments reveal that functionalized COFs can achieve proton conductivities exceeding 0.89 S cm&#8722;1 at 90&#160;&#176;C under 100% relative humidity (RH), comparable to commercial Nafion membranes. Additionally, COF&#8208;modified ionomers applied to catalyst layers have enabled fuel cells to achieve peak power densities 1.6 times higher than those without COF incorporation. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in terms of membrane durability, scalability, and performance under low humidity or high&#8208;temperature conditions. Future research should prioritize structural optimization, interfacial compatibility, and cost&#8208;effective synthesis methods to fully realize the potential of COFs in next&#8208;generation PEMFCs.

     alt="Recent Advances in the Application of Covalent Organic Framework&#8211;Based Ionic Conductors in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells"/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article reviews recent advances in COF-based ionic conductors for PEMFCs, covering their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies for enhancing proton conductivity and mechanical stability are analyzed, along with challenges in membrane durability and performance under low humidity or high-temperature conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their tunable porosity and functional versatility, have demonstrated exceptional ionic conductivity in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This review summarizes recent advancements in COF-based materials for PEMFC applications, emphasizing their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies such as pore engineering, functional group modification, and hybrid designs with polymers are analyzed to highlight their influence on proton conductivity and mechanical stability. Recent developments reveal that functionalized COFs can achieve proton conductivities exceeding 0.89 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 90&#160;&#176;C under 100% relative humidity (RH), comparable to commercial Nafion membranes. Additionally, COF-modified ionomers applied to catalyst layers have enabled fuel cells to achieve peak power densities 1.6 times higher than those without COF incorporation. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in terms of membrane durability, scalability, and performance under low humidity or high-temperature conditions. Future research should prioritize structural optimization, interfacial compatibility, and cost-effective synthesis methods to fully realize the potential of COFs in next-generation PEMFCs. This review underscores the transformative potential of COFs in addressing the critical limitations of traditional proton-conducting materials, paving the way for innovative solutions in fuel cell technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impacts of Chalcogen Bonding on the Stability and Reactivity of 5&#8208;Iminothianthrene Platform: Toward Electrophilic Nitrogen Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;Iminothianthrene reacted with various electrophiles, such as acid chlorides, protons, and iso(thio)cyanates, to afford the corresponding adducts. Intramolecular chalcogen bonding (ChB) was identified through natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis based on their X&#8208;ray crystal structures. The potential of these adducts as electrophilic aminating reagents was demonstrated.








Abstract
The thianthrene scaffold has recently attracted significant attention in various coupling reactions. Although 5&#8208;iminothianthrene and its derivatives are expected to function as electrophilic aminating reagents, their properties and reactivity have not been fully investigated. In this work, it was found that 5&#8208;iminothianthrene reacted with various electrophiles, such as acid chlorides, protons, and isothiocyanates to give the corresponding adducts. In addition, intramolecular chalcogen bonding (ChB) was identified in those adducts, and this interaction was found to contribute to their stability and reactivity. Finally, the potential of N&#8208;acyliminothianthrenes as N&#8208;acylnitrene equivalents was demonstrated.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted N&#8208;Isopropylacrylamide Nanogel Synthesis: Exploring the Role of Reaction Parameters and Cross&#8208;linking Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis as an efficient method for preparing PNIPAM based nanogels. Using crosslinkers like EGDMA and BAC, their effects on structure, temperature responsiveness, and stability were analyzed. Microwave irradiation shows its potential in nanogel synthesis. Stability studies in biologically relevant media highlight their potential for biomedical applications.








Abstract
This study provides a detailed account of the use of microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis as a novel and efficient method for preparing monodisperse poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) nanogels. The synthesis, based on free radical precipitation copolymerization of NIPAM and crosslinkers in water, was accelerated by microwave irradiation. Crosslinkers such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and degradable bis&#8208;acryloylcystamine (BAC) were employed to study their effects on nanogel structure and properties, including their temperature&#8208;responsive behavior. HPLC analysis revealed differences in monomer and crosslinker conversion between the two agents. The growth of the nanogel particles was analyzed at various polymerization times using dynamic light scattering (DLS), &#950;&#8208;potential measurements, and cryo&#8208;TEM imaging. The data showed that microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis reduced reaction time from 6 hours to minutes. BAC produced uniformly cross&#8208;linked nanogels, whereas EGDMA formed nanogels with dense cores and loose PNIPAM shells. Stability studies during storage and in biologically relevant media indicated their potential for biomedical applications.

         <title>Conclusive Insight into the Coordination Complexes of a Flexible Bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) Ligand and Their Phase&#8208;Dependent Structure: A Multi&#8208;Technique Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes of flexible bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) ligand bdhb2&#8722; are dimeric in the crystalline state but rearrange to monomeric in organic solution. The transformation, first detected on paramagnetic VO2+ and Co2+ derivatives, is conclusively proved through the preparation of diamagnetic [Zn2(bdhb)2(py)2] and its investigation by high&#8208;resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy in THF&#8208;d8 and CD2Cl2.








Abstract
Multichelating ligands with nuclear spin&#8208;free donor atoms are of particular interest for creating stable electronic spin qubits based on paramagnetic transition metal ions. We recently focused on the coordinating ability of the bis(&#946;&#8208;diketonato) ligand bdhb2&#8722;, featuring two &#8220;acac&#8221; moieties connected through a 1,3&#8208;phenylene bridge (H2bdhb&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;dioxo&#8208;1&#8208;hexyl)benzene). The two crystalline complexes of bdhb2&#8722; so far isolated and structurally characterized, namely [(VO)2(bdhb)2] (1) and [Co2(bdhb)2(py)4] (2), are dimeric and contain bridging bdhb2&#8722; ligands; however, they become mononuclear and quasi&#8208;macrocyclic in organic solution. To investigate this unique structural isomerism by high&#8208;resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy, we have now synthesized a diamagnetic Zn2+ analogue of 1 and 2, namely [Zn2(bdhb)2(py)2] (3). Although both 2 and 3 are dimeric and contain the same ligands, 3 features only one pyridine molecule per metal ion, whose coordination geometry is square pyramidal rather than tetragonally elongated octahedral. The ESI&#8208;MS spectra of 3 in THF and CH2Cl2 contain peaks from both monomeric and dimeric species. However, molecular weight determinations by DOSY and conformational studies based on J&#8208;coupling analysis and DFT calculations conclusively prove the rearrangement of 3 into quasi&#8208;macrocyclic monomers in THF&#8208;d8 and CD2Cl2 solution at room temperature.

         <title>Ir/Ni Metallaphotoredox Catalysis for the C(sp3)&#9472;H Bond &#945;&#8208;Arylation and Alkylation of N&#8208;Alkyl N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>

         <dc:description>
Ir/Ni metallaphotoredox system enables the regioselective &#945;&#8208;arylation and alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl heterocycles via C(sp3)&#9472;H bond functionalization. This method bypasses traditional Sn2 pathways and offers complementary regioselectivity to transition metal catalysis. The approach shows good substrate scope and high yields, with mechanistic studies supporting the arylation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals generated through single&#8208;electron transfer (SET).








Abstract
In this work, we report a regioselective C(sp3)&#9472;H bond &#945;&#8208;arylation and alkylation of N&#8208;alkyl heterocycles (carbazoles, indoles and indazoles) using a Ir/Ni metallaphotoredox catalysis. This approach enables the direct functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds at the &#945;&#8208;position of nitrogen heterocycles, offering an efficient alternative to traditional Sn2 methods and providing complementary regioselectivity to transition metal catalysis, which often results in C(sp2)&#9472;H bond arylation. The reaction employs [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dtbbpy)][PF6] as the photocatalyst and NiCl2(dtbbpy) as the nickel source, facilitating single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) to promote radical generation and organometallic elementary cross&#8208;coupling steps. The methodology allows the use of diverse aryl chlorides and alkenes demonstrating broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, including radical trapping and and Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, support a photocatalytic radical pathway. This metallaphotoredox protocol presents a robust and atom&#8208;economical route to synthesizing valuable N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N&#8208;aryl heterocycles.

The reaction employs [Ir(dF(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)ppy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(dtbbpy)][PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] as the photocatalyst and NiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(dtbbpy) as the nickel source, facilitating single-electron transfer (SET) to promote radical generation and organometallic elementary cross-coupling steps. The methodology allows the use of diverse aryl chlorides and alkenes demonstrating broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, including radical trapping and and Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, support a photocatalytic radical pathway. This metallaphotoredox protocol presents a robust and atom-economical route to synthesizing valuable &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkyl-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl heterocycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation of Mixed&#8208;Valence Cage&#8208;Like Polyoxidovanadates at 37&#176;C Upon Reaction of VIVO(acetylacetonato)2 With Lysozyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At physiological temperature in NaCl solutions, the potential drug [VIVO(acetylacetonato)2] reacts with lysozyme forming mixed&#8208;valence polyoxidovanadates which covalently bind to the protein surface.








Abstract
Crystals of the model protein lysozyme were grown and soaked with the potential drug VIVO(acetylacetonato)2 at 37&#176;C. X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data collected at this temperature reveal that mixed&#8208;valence cage&#8208;like polyoxidovanadate clusters are formed and covalently bind protein residue side chains at physiological temperature.

         <title>Selective Sequestration of Palladium(II) Cations Using a Supramolecular Polymer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;based ligand is shown to selectively complex Pd(II) cations from an aqueous mixed&#8208;metal solution. Selectivity for Pd(II) is imparted in a copolymer when functionalized with the same ligand, demonstrating the potential of metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymers in metal recovery systems.








Abstract
The selective sequestration of aqueous palladium from waste is an attractive option for metal recovery. However, achieving good metal specificity remains a difficult problem. In this study, we present the synthesis of a metallo&#8208;supramolecular system based on a 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole chelating ligand group. Excellent selectivity for Pd(II) ions over Pt(II), Ni(II), Fe(II), Co(II), and Zn(II) from a mixed&#8208;metal solution was demonstrated through ESI&#8208;MS and 1H NMR spectroscopic studies of a model ligand system. Following this, a water&#8208;soluble copolymer system containing 2&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole functional groups was prepared. This polymer was shown to exhibit the same specificity for Pd(II) in a mixed&#8208;metal solution, quantitatively supported by dialysis and ICP&#8208;MS experiments. These findings demonstrate the potential of metallo&#8208;supramolecular polymers in selective metal recovery.

         <title>The Vicinal&#8208;Diiodination of the HDDA&#8208;Benzynes by N&#8208;Iodo&#8208; succinimide (NIS) Through a Radical Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery and development of radical iodine trapping reaction of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes for the construction of vicinal&#8208;diiodo arenes is reported. The N&#8208;iodosuccinimide serves as the source of iodine radicals and EPR spectral analysis of reaction mixture supports the existence of radical intermediates. Control experiments suggest that the 4&#8208;iodination (mono&#8208;) of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes is faster than the 5&#8208;iodiniation This work represents the first report on the vicinal&#8208;diiodination as well as radical diiodination of HDDA&#8208;benzynes.








Abstract
The 1,2&#8208;diradical reactivity of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes (thermal) has not been explored well in comparison to their ionic reactivity. Accordingly, the radical trapping reactions of these reactive intermediates are very scarce in literature. Herein, we report the iodine&#8208;radical trapping reaction of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes for the construction of structurally divergent vicinal&#8208;diiodo arenes. The N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) has been employed as the source of radical iodine under thermal heating conditions. The existence of the arene&#8208;radical intermediates and the radical mechanism has been supported by the EPR spectral analysis of the reaction mixture. Several fruitful control experiments suggested that the 4&#8208;iodination (mono&#8208;) of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes is faster than the 5&#8208;iodiniation. The process is general in terms of substituents on the diynes as well as the nature of the tethering units. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the vicinal&#8208;diiodination as well as radical diiodination of HDDA&#8208;benzynes.

         <title>Transition Metal/Metal Sulfide Heterostructures Boost Energy Saving Hydrogen Production Coupled with Sulfion Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a bifunctional electrode with an inner Cr layer and outer components of Co, Mo, and the Co9S8 phase (NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S) through stepwise electrodeposition and hydrothermal sulfurization. Benefiting from the hydrophilic and sulfur&#8208;repellent surface and rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures, the coupled electrolysis system demonstrates excellent performance for energy saving hydrogen production and sulfur recovery.








Abstract
Hydrogen production through the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) provides a promising pathway for sustainable and green energy. Coupling HER with the thermodynamically favorable sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) can reduce energy consumption and recycle industrial by&#8208;product S2&#8722;. However, the development and practical application are hindered by the lack of cost&#8208;effective and robust catalysts. Herein, we constructed a bifunctional electrode with rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures using NiFe foam through stepwise electrodeposition and hydrothermal sulfurization (NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S). Benefiting from the hydrophilic and sulfur&#8208;repellent surface and rich metal/metal sulfide heterostructures, it delivers outstanding SOR and HER performance. The integrated cell, utilizing the NiFe&#8208;CrCoMo&#8208;S electrode for both the cathode and anode, achieves a remarkable cell voltage of 0.75 V at a current density of 200 mA cm&#8722;2, which is 1.43 V lower than conventional water electrolysis. It demonstrates extraordinary long&#8208;term durability over 1100 hours without significant decay, achieving high Faradaic efficiencies (&#8805;99%) and low electricity consumption (1.79 kWh m&#8722;3 H2) for hydrogen production. This work paves the way for environmentally friendly strategies, combining cost&#8208;effective hydrogen production with value&#8208;added sulfur recovery, offering a reliable option for bifunctional catalyst design.

         <dc:description>Non&#8208;ionic detergents are key reagents for the characterization of membrane protein drug targets. Suitable detergents are commonly identified by trial and error, which leads to failed preparations and raising costs. Recent findings suggest that not only the chemistry of detergents but also the strategy with which detergents and proteins are brought together impact the successes of investigations. To facilitate the future development of non&#8208;ionic detergents in membrane protein research, herein, we review chemical design concepts and detergent exchange strategies for a successful integration of detergents into the analysis of challenging membrane protein complexes. Our overview reveals exciting opportunities to tackle existing challenges, including the stabilization of G&#8208;protein coupled receptors, the development of fluorinated detergents for studying protein&#8208;lipid binding, top&#8208;down design of detergents, and hybrid detergents for the identification of non&#8208;canonical lipid associations to proteins with relevance to antibiotic research. Our review will facilitate the development of chemical tools for the biophysical characterization of membrane proteins and support the discovery of biological findings in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fascinating properties introduced by the breaking of the mirror symmetry have recently motivated a rising interest in chirality in nanomaterials. In particular, transition metal dichalcogenides are a wide group of technologically relevant two&#8208;dimensional layered materials where recent efforts in the introduction of chirality have shown promising results, attracting great attention for future studies and potential applications. This review article is focused on the development of chirality in transition metal dichalcogenide nanostructures, dealing with the synthetic strategies that have been adopted to produce chiral TMDs both via solution&#8208;phase and vapor&#8208;phase syntheses along with the characterization of their chiroptical properties. A broad range of examples, including a variety of nanostructures such as 0D quantum dots, 1D nanotubes, 2D flakes and more complex 3D nanostructures as well as different origins of the chirality are considered. Critical analysis of potential pitfalls in the assessment of the materials&#8217; chirality are discussed. A broad range of exciting properties and applications associated with the materials&#8217; chirality, including: nanomedicine, enantioselective catalysis, spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis, spintronics and non&#8208;linear optics are also presented in the review.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality Effects in Peptide&#8208;Based Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naturally occurring peptides are almost exclusively composed of L&#8208;amino acids, and the incorporation of D&#8208;amino acids can profoundly alter their ability to fold and self&#8208;assemble. Here we explore the effects of chirality on the formation of disulfide dynamic combinatorial libraries generated by short cysteine&#8208;rich peptides. Our findings consistently show that heterochiral tripeptides form more diverse dynamic combinatorial libraries than their homochiral counterparts. The most complex library appears to encompass all possible cyclic species up to 19mers. Given that each of these species exists as a mixture of parallel and antiparallel isomers, we estimate this library to contain a total of 2,045 distinct compounds &#8211; a remarkable result considering that the library generated by the analogous homochiral peptide predominantly contains two dimers. In certain situations, peptide chirality also affects the relative stability of parallel and antiparallel isomers. Taken together, these results show that small changes in peptide chirality can be dramatically amplified through the formation of cyclic species.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of potent mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate derivatives as ligands for CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R using fluorescence polarization assay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cation&#8208;independent mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate/IGF2 receptor (CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R) plays a crucial role in transporting lysosomal enzymes and other ligands. In this study, we designed and synthesized novel, stable mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) derivatives to enhance their affinity for CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R. To evaluate binding potency, we employed a sensitive and cost&#8208;effective fluorescence polarization assay, enabling rapid quantification of receptor&#8208;ligand interactions in solution. The tested compounds included di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and penta&#8208;M6P peptides, alongside various M6P&#8208;derived small molecules featuring phosphate isosteres or other functional modifications. Our findings indicate that ligands bearing multiple M6P moieties exhibit significantly higher receptor affinity than monomeric compounds and that phosphonate groups may serve as a more stable and potent alternative to native M6P. Computational modeling of ligand interactions with CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R domains further elucidated the binding mechanisms, offering new directions for the development of even more effective ligands. This study advances the design of therapeutic strategies that leverage CI&#8208;M6P/IGF2R for targeted biomolecule delivery to lysosomes, opening new possibilities for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Flexible, Perfluorinated Analogue of Aluminum Fumarate Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis of Al&#8208;TFS, a novel aluminum metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based on tetrafluorosuccinic acid (H2TFS), of formula Al(OH)(TFS)&#183;1.5H2O, introducing a new member to the family of perfluorinated MOFs. The structure of the MOF, solved ab&#8208;initio from laboratory powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data, displays structural analogies with that of the commercially available Al&#8208;fumarate (Basolite A520). The structure is composed of 1D infinite OH&#8208;bridged Al octahedra chains connected by the dicarboxylic linkers, designing rhombic channels decorated by fluorine atoms. Upon water removal, the MOF undergoes a phase transition leading to a moderate expansion of the unit cell. Volumetric analysis revealed the presence of ultra&#8208;micropores with a size lower than 4 &#197;. Gas sorption measurements demonstrated for Al&#8208;TFS a slightly higher CO2 selectivity compared to N2 and CH4 than the Al&#8208;fumarate analogue, with peculiar shapes of the isotherms suggesting a dynamic response of the framework to CO2 adsorption. Using different complementary techniques (in situ infrared spectroscopy, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gas/vapor sorption), and density functional theory simulations, the flexibility of the new MOF was disclosed, highlighting the significant impact of fluorination in tailoring materials with structural flexibility and peculiar adsorption properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Epitaxial 1D and 2D growth of polyester&#8208;based materials in n&#8208;alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallisation&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) has been extensively studied for the formation of bespoke nanoparticles and provides a unique way to control the unidirectional growth of block copolymers (BCPs). Currently, oil&#8208;soluble nanoparticles represent an under&#8208;researched area in the literature, stemming from the difficulty in synthesising organic nanoparticles with higher&#8208;order morphologies using traditional techniques. These oil&#8208;soluble nanoparticles have uses as components in products as diverse as electronics and engine oils, with current research determining a strong relationship between morphology and performance, with anisotropic nanoparticles outperforming spherical counterparts. Here, we report on the facile self&#8208;assembly of polyester&#8208;based BCPs in n&#8208;octane to achieve low&#8208;dispersity 1D and 2D nanoparticles. This report focuses on using tuneable, oil&#8208;soluble polymers and aims to understand their self&#8208;assembly in n&#8208;octane through the variation of self&#8208;assembly conditions and unimer solubility to form nanoparticles of a controlled and variable size.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispidine&#8208;Based Copper(II) Coordination Polymers with Remarkable Dynamic Properties, Selective Volatile Organic Compounds Adsorption and Exchange Capabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents novel Cu(II)&#8208;based bispidine coordination polymers (CPs) with remarkable dynamic properties, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) exchange and selective adsorption capabilities. The coordination requirements of Cu(II) enable, as demonstrated by SC&#8208;XRD and P&#8208;XRD, the formation of either 1D ribbon&#8208;like (1&#8208;TCMSC and 1&#8208;H2OSC) and 2D (1&#8208;MeCNSC) extended frameworks depending on the ability of&#160;trapped solvents to interact as hydrogen bond (HB) donor with the metal&#160;counterion. Hirshfeld Surface analysis and in situ VT SC&#8208; and P&#8208;XRD experiments reveal different interchain interactions in 1D vs. 2D CPs. Solvent exchange experiments on both single crystals and microcrystalline samples, set up to evaluate differences in the CPs&#160;dynamic nature, confirm the drastic effect of CP dimensionality. Additionally, amorphous desolvated phase 1&#8208;AmorphPwd was tested for VOC adsorption displaying affinity for acetonitrile and nitromethane, with high selectivity for the latter, but also having the ability to trap aromatic VOCs, capturing up to ca. 2 mmol/g of solvent. The adsorption experiments, conducted at r.t., 1 atm and no prior activation, underscore the potential of these materials for environmental and industrial applications. This work emphasizes the unique dynamic and selective behavior of bispidine&#8208;based CPs and provides foundation for their scalability and practical implementation in VOC capture technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Matrix Isolation and Solvation of the Benzonitrile Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvated electrons, one of the strongest reducing agents, exhibit short lifetimes in the range of pico&#8208; to milliseconds when generated photochemically or by radiolysis in solution. In contrast, solvated electrons produced using sodium metal in liquid ammonia are stable for days and have long been used in synthetic chemistry. Using sodium atoms as an electron source, we were able to trap solvated electrons in low&#8208;density amorphous (LDA) water ice matrices with lifetimes of several days and use these electrons as reducing reagent. In LDA matrices doped with benzonitrile 1 these electrons react with 1 to form the benzonitrile radical anion 2. In argon matrices, in the absence of water, only small amounts of 2 were observed after deposition, and most of the sodium and 1 remained unreacted. The yield of radical anion 2 is significantly higher in amorphous water ice than in solid argon. The photoexcitation of radical anion 2 in both argon and LDA water ice matrices resulted in a reversal of the electron transfer under back formation of benzonitrile 1. Annealing of argon matrices doped with small amounts of water containing 2 resulted in the formation of 1:1 and 2:1 hydrogen&#8208;bonded complexes between water and radical anion 2.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Chromophore Construction via Through&#8208;Space Conjugation of Caprolactam and Itaconic Acid: Mechanistic Validation Enabled by 3D&#8208;Printed Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence characteristics are generally attributed to conjugated molecular structures. Substances exhibiting chromatic or fluorescent effects hold significant application value in functional coatings, biochemical detection, anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and pharmaceutical tracking due to their distinctive optical identification properties. Although numerous fluorescent materials have been developed, research on fluorescence mechanisms in low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight substances remains insufficient. This study serendipitously discovered that a simple thermal mixing reaction between caprolactam and itaconic acid can produce a fluorescent&#8208;colored metastable colloidal system. The colloid exhibits exceptional stability at ambient temperature, maintaining non&#8208;crystalline status or forming novel butterfly/leaf&#8208;like crystal structures upon cooling, with reversible colloidal characteristics through thermal cycling. Through comprehensive characterization using FT&#8208;IR, NMR, HPLC, and polarized optical microscopy, we elucidated the chromatic and fluorescent mechanisms: intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks facilitate the construction of spatial conjugation systems containing unsaturated groups, achieving photoluminescence via &#960;&#8208;electron orbital transitions. The reliability of fluorescence color generation mechanism was confirmed by 3D printing side. This material exhibits excellent solubility in common solvents and shows promising potential for developing fluorescent composites through polymer matrix incorporation.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxyltin&#8208;Functionalized Tungstobismuthate/TiO2 Photoanodes for Enhanced Energy Storage Effect in Metal Photoelectrochemical Cathodic Protection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection (PECCP), as a novel and environment&#8208;friendly metal anti&#8208;corrosion technology, its key challenge is to construct photoelectronic materials that can provide sustained protection under both illumination and dark. Herein, four cases of transition metal and carboxyltin&#8208;modified polyoxometalates (POMs) based on trivacant Keggin&#8208;type tungstobismuthate subunits, denoted as Bi&#8208;POMs, were designed and synthesized in aqueous solutions. The introduced carboxyl groups can anchor TiO2, and the export of electrons from POM clusters occurred, making these POM&#8208;based materials to be used in the PECCP field for the first time.Under illumination, the Bi&#8208;POM/TiO2 photoanodes were capable of cathodically polarizing 304 stainless steel (304SS) by 440&#8722;465 mV. In darkness, their coupled potentials of &#8722;197 to &#8722;175 mV were significantly lower than that of TiO2 (&#8722;97 mV), indicating the obviously enhanced dark cathodic protection effect. Precisely, the interdependence between Bi, POM, and TiO2ensures Bi&#8208;POMs to protect 304SS in seawater and provide stably and sustainably cathodic protection under intermittent light. The underlying mechanisms of PECCP were explored by a variety of experimental techniques including the femtosecond transient absorption measurements and density functional theory calculations. The integration of POMs into the PECCP system represents a new insight in the development of green metal protection technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>B/N&#8208;Codoped Porous Carbons as Metal&#8208;Free and Binder&#8208;Free Electrode Material for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile, cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly approach for the synthesis of B/N co&#8208;doped porous carbon materials has been developed for metal&#8208;free and binder&#8208;free supercapacitors. A set of samples, CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;5, CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;10and CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;15 have been synthesized by carbonization of a phloroglucinol&#8208;formaldehyde&#8208;dopamine (PFD) polymer and tetraethyl orthosilicate. Boric acid has been used to introduce different amounts of boron and an undoped sample, CPFD&#8208;N, has been synthesized for comparison. The CPFD materials function as binder&#8208;free electrodes and display excellent electrochemical behaviour. The optimization of boron as a heteroatom with a rational distribution of pores enables CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;10 electrode to achieve a high capacitance of 962 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. It demonstrates excellent rate capability and exceptional cycling stability, retaining over 120% of its capacitance after 5,000 cycles at a current density of 30 A/g. It has a specific energy density of 108.22 Wh/kg and a power output of 450.00 W/kg at 1 A/g, effectively bridging the gap between supercapacitors and batteries. A solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor made from the material achieves a capacitance of 622 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, Coulombic efficiency of 89% after 1,500 cycles and powers a 3 V LED bulb.</dc:description>

         <title>An Asymmetric Reductive Amination Synthesis of Ritlecitinib Using (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Methylbenzylamine as Chiral Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free synthesis of ritlecitinib employs asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary with titanium(IV) ethoxide/sodium tetrahydroborate (Ti(OEt)&#8324;/NaBH&#8324;). This one&#8208;pot process couples a ketone&#8208;amino acid with (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine (85% yield, 86:14 dr). Cyclization affords a &#948;&#8208;lactam (60%), transformed into ritlecitinib via a five&#8208;step sequence (62% overall yield), avoiding precious metals and hazardous reagents in chiral piperidine assembly.








Abstract
We present a new synthesis of ritlecitinib, employing asymmetric reductive amination via a chiral auxiliary group combined with intramolecular amide formation. This method employs a titanium(IV) ethoxide/sodium tetrahydroborate (Ti(OEt)&#8324;/NaBH&#8324;) reductive system to achieve a one&#8208;pot condensation&#8208;reduction of the ketone&#8208;amino acid derivative with (S)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine, resulting in an 85% yield of the di&#8208;amino acid derivative with a diastereomeric ratio of 86:14. The incorporation of a chiral auxiliary substantially enhances the diastereopurity. Subsequently, acetic acid&#8208;mediated cyclization then forms the &#948;&#8208;lactam in 60% yield. This lactam is converted to ritlecitinib via a five&#8208;step sequence in 62% overall yield. This approach effectively circumvents the use of precious metal catalysts or hazardous reagents for constructing the chiral piperidine moiety, which were essential components in prior synthetic route.

This solvent&#8208;free approach is environmentally friendly, energy&#8208;efficient, and time&#8208;saving, resulting in ADG&#8208;MOFs&#8208;CBQDs/D&#8208;CBQDs with physical properties comparable to those produced by traditional liquid phase encapsulation. The resulting nanocomposites were characterized using SEM, XRD, TGA, FT&#8208;IR, and 1H NMR. The results indicate that ADG was partly encapsulated within the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) pores, while another portion was bound externally to CBQD/D&#8208;CBQDs, as evidenced by distinct drug signals in each analysis. This green synthesis approach simplifies the conjugation process. It significantly enhances the drug solubility, as indicated by changes in hydrophobicity observed via 1H NMR, surpassing the improvements achieved by ADG encapsulation within MOFs alone. Additionally, in preliminary tests, the materials exhibited significant cytotoxicity against PC3 cells compared to ADG (25.05&#160;&#177;&#160;0.06&#160;&#181;g/mL) after 48&#160;hours of exposure.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Fixation of CO2 to Form N&#8208;Containing Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the research progress of various typical N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds in the past five years, detailing the catalytic performance and principles of promising catalysts. Finally, this pathway's development trends and characteristics are summarized and prospected.








Abstract
N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds are common chemical structures in drugs, bioactive compounds, and natural products. Using CO2 as a C1 source for synthesizing N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds aligns with the concepts of green chemistry and sustainability. In recent years, the synthesis of N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds has been extensively and intensively studied. However, significant challenges remain, such as thermodynamic limitations, low catalytic efficiency, and harsh reaction conditions. Catalysts play an essential role in the catalytic activation of CO2 and/or substrates, thereby facilitating CO2 conversion. This review provides an overview of several typical N&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds converted from CO2, such as oxazolidinones, quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;diones, benzimidazoles, and benzimidazolones. The most recent catalysts used in these reactions are discussed, emphasizing their mechanistic roles in the reaction process.

         <title>Synthesis of a Station&#8208;Less Molecular Daisy Chain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A daisy chain compound lacking intercomponent recognition motifs is synthesized and analyzed. As a result of the absence of intercomponent recognition motifs there was also no preferred conformation of the interlocked components observed.








Abstract
A daisy chain architecture without a preferred low energy arrangement of the mechanically linked components is presented. The molecular design combines a rigid&#8208;rod type oligophenylene ethynylene subunit with an oligoethylene glycol macrocycle that features a bipyridine coordination site. The daisy chain dimer was synthesized via kinetic trapping of the interlocked structure using a Cadiot&#8211;Chodkiewicz active metal template reaction. Comparison of the isolated interlocked dimer with its monomeric analogue indicates the presence of a variety of different geometries for the molecular daisy chain. The dynamic sliding motion in the daisy chain is studied by variable temperature UV&#8211;vis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments, which point to a highly mobile system even at low temperatures.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) have garnered significant attention due to their enhanced chemical, physical, and binding properties in comparison to natural nucleic acids. This prompted their application in antigene/antisense approach, assigning them a pivotal role in gene editing and, more recently, showing their potential as &#8220;bilingual&#8221; molecules being able &#8220;to speak&#8221; both nucleic acid and protein language. However, in order to expand the applications of PNAs in therapy, the challenge of effectively delivering PNAs to cells needs to be addressed. Among several delivery approaches employed so far, the nanotechnology&#8208;based ones showed great potential. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest in the field (2019 to present), beginning from the &#8220;old fashioned&#8221; peptide&#8208;based delivery systems, as well as cutting&#8208;edge approaches involving nanoparticles, liposomes, calixarene, showing how they have inspired the development of smarter delivery approaches to boost PNAs applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Quercetin&#183;Zirconium Metal Complexes: Insights from Femto to Millisecond Photobehavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal complexation modulates the antioxidant properties of many flavonoids, including quercetin (QRT). However, competition between the antioxidant and autoxidation processes limits their longevity. This necessitates a deeper understanding of the fate of QRT phenoxy radicals following antioxidant activity. Here, we report on the formation of QRT&#183;Zr complexes and their photobehaviors, which account for the photochemical reactivity of the generated radicals. In methanol, N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide, and water, the UV&#8208;visible absorption spectra of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes exhibit a significant bathochromic shift (50 &#8208; 100 nm) and high global binding constants (1 &#8208; 14 &#180; 109 M&#8208;2). While the formation of charge&#8208;transfer states through ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer in the ground state prevents the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer that typically occurs in QRT, it leads to the generation of excited metal&#8208;bound ligand radicals. We present details on the dynamics and further relaxation from femto to millisecond regimes of the excited complexes and generated species. The lifetimes of the formed radicals are considerably shorter than those of the free QRT radicals due to rapid back electron transfer, regenerating the neutral complexes. These findings will facilitate the design of other systems for antioxidant activity, photocatalysis, and various applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry of Ditellurides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic combinatorial chemistry enables the exploration of reversible chemical exchange reactions. Here, we report studies on the dynamic Te&#8208;Te bond exchange of chemically and structurally diverse ditellurides using 125Te NMR spectroscopy. The results revealed rapid and unbiased equilibration, forming a consistent 1:1 distribution of reactants and products across all chemical systems. Extending to multi&#8208;component mixtures, we observed robust equilibrium formation even in complex systems involving multiple ditelluride species that can be easily distinguished by 125Te NMR spectroscopy. In line with the NMR analyses showing that the Te&#8208;Te bond exchange efficiently proceeds in various solvents, at very low temperature, in the absence of visible light and in the presence of radical scavengers, quantum chemical analyses revealed that the ditelluride&#8208;ditelluride exchange likely proceeds via a non&#8208;synchronous concerted mechanism and not via an alternative radical mechanism. Integrated NMR spectroscopic and quantum chemical analyses also showed that the efficiency of the chalcogen&#8208;chalcogen exchange involving ditellurides follows the trend Te&#8208;Te &gt; Te&#8208;Se &gt; Te&#8208;S. Overall, the results indicate that ditellurides are excellent dynamic systems that may find applications across molecular sciences.</dc:description>

The results revealed rapid and unbiased equilibration, forming a consistent 1:1 distribution of reactants and products across all chemical systems. Extending to multi-component mixtures, we observed robust equilibrium formation even in complex systems involving multiple ditelluride species that can be easily distinguished by 125Te NMR spectroscopy. In line with the NMR analyses showing that the Te-Te bond exchange efficiently proceeds in various solvents, at very low temperature, in the absence of visible light and in the presence of radical scavengers, quantum chemical analyses revealed that the ditelluride-ditelluride exchange likely proceeds via a non-synchronous concerted mechanism and not via an alternative radical mechanism. Integrated NMR spectroscopic and quantum chemical analyses also showed that the efficiency of the chalcogen-chalcogen exchange involving ditellurides follows the trend Te-Te &amp;gt; Te-Se &amp;gt; Te-S. Overall, the results indicate that ditellurides are excellent dynamic systems that may find applications across molecular sciences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Singlet Oxygen Monitoring in Aqueous Media Comprising a Polymer&#8208;imbedded Eu3+ Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet dioxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role as the active agent in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for cancer treatment, as well as in the photo&#8208;inactivation of antibiotic&#8208;resistant microbes (antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, aPDT). The ability to sensitively monitor the production and behavior of &#185;O&#8322; following its photo&#8208;catalytic generation is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies. Optical sensor molecules that respond to &#185;O&#8322; through changes in absorption or, more sensitively, fluorescence, are suitable choices. While most monitors report 1O2 via altered absorption spectra, only few compounds respond by the onset of fluorescence, even fewer based on lanthanide luminescence. By embedding a novel lanthanide complex (Eu3+) into polystyrene nanoparticles (beads), we achieved close to a 500&#8208;fold emission intensity boost in the presence of 1O2, very long decay times of up to 879 &#181;s and unprecedented stability in acidic and basic media. Furthermore, the beads present a high surface charge (&gt; +30 mV), yielding stable aqueous dispersions, which we exploited in a preliminary &#8216;proof of principle&#8217; staining experiment of (negatively charged) bacterial surfaces. The straightforward synthesis circumvents intricate preparative steps and restrictive costs. The decay characteristics furthermore pave the road to time gated measurements, i.e., to the suppression of interfering autofluorescence from biological samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Nano&#8208;COF&#8208;Embedded Silica Composite for Efficient Photocatalytic NADH Regeneration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic regeneration of NADH represents an effective means of mimicking photosynthesis, but confronts the challenges of the charge separation, electron transfer, and the selectivity control in the surface reduction stage. Herein, we report a multifunctional composite material that embeds &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked nano TPTTA covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and electron mediator (rhodium complex) into a functional mesoporous silica matrix for photocatalytic NADH regeneration. This strategy enables the facilitation of the electron transfer process while maintaining the intrinsic properties of the COFs, providing flexibility in COFs design. The strategic integration of electron mediator and the shortened charge migration path due to the nanosized COFs results in a NADH regeneration yield of 75.7% and a selectivity of 89.8% for 1,4&#8208;NADH. The initial reaction rate for NADH regeneration attained 8.7 gNADH&#8226;gCat&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1, and the system showed no decrease in activity after 4 reaction cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Symmetry to Dictate Pathway&#8208;driven Self&#8208;assembly in Photoresponsive Peptide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive peptides offer interesting structural space in the realm of emergent pathway&#8208;driven supramolecular polymerization toward designing functional nanomaterials with precision structure&#8208;functional characteristics. However, the role of molecular symmetry in such peptides to govern the self&#8208;assembly pathway dynamics remains less explored. We design amyloid&#8208;inspired, azobenzene&#8208;functionalized symmetric (P1) and asymmetric (P2) peptide amphiphiles in the E form of azobenzene motif to systematically investigate the interplay of molecular symmetry, solvent composition and temperature to guide supramolecular organization. Spectroscopic and microscopic analyses reveal distinct aggregation pathways, with E&#8208;P1 exhibiting rapid nucleation&#8208;elongation toward kinetically stable nanofibers, while E&#8208;P2 assembles into a kinetic state (E&#8208;P2(KS)) that subsequently transforms into thermodynamically favored nanoribbons, E&#8208;P2(TS) via a "good and bad solvent" modulation strategy. Further, E&#8208;P1 remains structurally resilient due to stronger intermolecular interactions. Interestingly, E&#8208;P2 demonstrates reversible E&#8594;Z photoisomerization in both kinetic and thermodynamic states, facilitating supramolecular disassembly while retaining the self&#8208;organization memory. Notably, the activation energy barriers for Z&#8594;E isomerization in P2 differ between its kinetic and thermodynamic states, underscoring the role of pathway complexity and molecular symmetry in peptide assembly. These insights advance the understanding of symmetry&#8208;regulated supramolecular assembly to modulate the emergent functional properties for potential applications in nanotechnology and biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure and Catalytic Mechanism of the cis&#8208;Eunicellane Cyclase AriE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystal structure of a cis&#8208;eunicellane cyclase, AriED128A, was determined through X&#8208;ray crystallography. Structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis explored the cyclization mechanism of AriE, in which W73 is a crucial regulatory hotspot that controls product diversity through cation&#8208;&#960; interactions. Our research provides the first structural insights into eunicellane cyclases and demonstrates the potential of engineering variants for selective product formation.








Abstract
Eunicellane diterpenoids, with over 360 known examples characterized by a cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;6/10&#8208;bicyclic carbon skeleton, exhibit diverse biological activities. To date, five eunicellane cyclases (ECs) have been reported: cis&#8208;ECs (Bnd4, CpDTS2 and EcTPS1) and trans&#8208;ECs (AlbS and MicA), yet the structural basis and molecular mechanisms governing their distinct cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;cyclization modes remain unsolved. Here, we present the crystal structure of a cis&#8208;EC AriE from Amycolatopsis arida, which catalyzes geranylgeranyl diphosphate to form cis&#8208;6/10&#8208;fused bicyclic benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene (1) in aridacin biosynthesis. Through surface entropy reduction, we obtained the 1.87 &#197; resolution structure of AriED128A. Structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis identified W73 as a key regulatory hotspot controlling product diversity, with its variants generating diverse diterpene products. Y203A converted AriE into a highly specific (&#8211;)&#8208;(R)&#8208;cembrene A synthase. Our findings provide the first structural insights into this type of terpene synthase and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering EC variants for selective product formation.

         <title>Recyclable, Biobased Polycarbonates and Polyesters by Naphthoxy&#8208;Imine Zinc and Magnesium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Naphthoxy&#8208;imine pyridine zinc and magnesium complexes were synthesized and fully characterized by NMR. In the presence of an alcohol as initiator, both complexes promoted the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of L&#8208;lactide (L&#8208;LA), &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL), &#946;&#8208;butyrolactone (&#946;&#8208;BL), trimethylene carbonate (TMC) and 1&#8208;methyl trimethylene carbonate (Me&#8208;TMC), which was purposely synthesized from CO2 and the appropriate diol. The zinc complex exhibited notably high activity, particularly in the polymerization of lactide and trimethylene carbonate, and was subsequently employed in the synthesis of polytrimethylene carbonate&#8208;based diblock and random copolymers with both &#949;&#8208;caprolactone and L&#8208;lactide. Furthermore, the zinc complex demonstrated its ability to close the life cycle of the synthesized materials by successfully depolymerizing both PTMC and its copolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>&#414;6&#8208;Fluoranthene Complexes from the Reactions of Osmacyclopentadienes with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise alkyne cyclotrimerizations were demonstrated at Os metal center. Paramagnetic osmacyclopentadiene complexes were the key intermediates and novel &#951;6&#8208;fluoranthene complexes of osmium were produced.








Abstract
Osmacyclopentadiene complexes were obtained from the reactions between OsCl2(PPh3)3 and 1,8&#8208;dialkynyl naphthalene compounds. These complexes exhibited paramagnetism as they adopted triplet ground states. Reactions of osmacyclopentadienes with alkynes were investigated, which produced novel &#951;6&#8208;fluoranthene complexes, showing their potential in organometallic synthesis.

         <title>Push and Pull: The Impact of Amino and Nitro Substituents on Heteroleptic Cu(I) Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents the synthesis and characterization of four novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes incorporating nitro&#8208; and amino&#8208;substituted phenanthroline ligands. Their molecular structures, featuring a substituent at the 5&#8208;position of the phenanthroline backbone, were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations revealed distinct mesomeric (M) and inductive (I) effects of the NO&#8322; and NH&#8322; substituents on the photophysical and electrocnic properties. The electron&#8208;withdrawing NO&#8322; group (&#8208;M, &#8208;I) stabilizes the LUMO, shifts the reduction potential by +0.9 V and completely quenches emission via non&#8208;radiative deactivation processes. In contrast, the electron&#8208;donating NH&#8322; group (+M, &#8208;I) induces a moderate redshift (&#8776;25 nm) in absorption and leads to long&#8208;lived, non&#8208;emissive excited states, particularly in CunNH&#8322; (25.9 &#181;s). Photocatalytic tests revealed no hydrogen evolution, but NH&#8322;&#8208;substituted complexes efficiently generated singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) with quantum yields up to 39.8%. These findings demonstrate how small structural and electronic modifications can fundamentally alter the photophysics and reactivity of Cu(I) complexes, providing valuable design principles for next&#8208;generation photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Interesting Aromaticity of Franck&#8211;Condon Excited States of Cyclo[16]Carbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structure and aromaticity of Franck&#8211;Condon excited states of cyclo[16]carbon (C16) have been investigated. The results show that at the ground&#8208;state (S0 state) geometry, C16 exhibits aromaticity not only in triplet states (T1(in&#8594;out), T2(out&#8594;out), and T3(in&#8594;in)), but also more pronounced in the quintet&#160;state (Q1 state). Quantitatively, C16 is about three times more aromatic in the quintet&#160;state than in the triplet states.








Abstract
Inspired by the realization of cyclo[16]carbon (C16) and driven by curiosity about its properties in excited states, a comprehensive theoretical study was conducted on the aromatic characteristics in the Franck&#8211;Condon states of C16. This work demonstrates that at the ground&#8208;state (S0 state) geometry, C16 exhibits aromaticity not only in the triplet states (T1(in&#8594;out), T2(out&#8594;out), and T3(in&#8594;in)), but also more prominently in the quintet&#160;state (Q1 state), and different electronic transition modes result in different essential sources of aromaticity for each excited state. Quantitatively, C16 is about three times more aromatic in the quintet&#160;state than in the triplet states.&#160;These conclusions are supported by multiple robust indicators such as atomic force, induced current, and magnetic shielding, from qualitative, quantitative, and graphical perspectives.

         <title>Tailored Self&#8208;Assembled Biomimetic Nanofibers for Light&#8208;Driven &#946;&#8208;lactam Antibiotics Degradation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an artificial biomimetic micellar system that integrates photothermal agents and ionic copper catalytic sites with spatially controlled positioning on a fiber&#8208;like crystalline scaffold via a crystal&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly method. Tailored photothermal&#8208;assisted antibiotic degradation (PAD) nanofibers achieve efficient &#946;&#8208;lactam degradation in deionized water, offering a sustainable solution for wastewater treatment and environmental remediation.








Abstract
The overuse of antibiotics in China and the resulting rise in antibiotic resistance pose an urgent need for effective antibiotic degradation in water. Developing artificial systems that mimic the catalytic efficiency of natural photoactive enzymes for this purpose remains a critical challenge. Despite decades of research, there is a notable scarcity of precisely designed scaffolds that can replicate the structural and functional efficiency of natural enzymes for waterborne antibiotic degradation, particularly at the nano&#8208; to micrometer scale. In this study, we present a core&#8208;corona type fiber&#8208;like micellar system designed for photothermal&#8208;assisted &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotic degradation (PAD) in water. This system integrates photothermal molecular chromophores (zinc porphyrin) and ionic copper degradation catalysts in close proximity within grafted solvophilic coronal chains on the surface of fiber&#8208;like crystalline scaffold. By employing a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) strategy, we fine&#8208;tune the composition, dimensions, and antibiotic degradation performance of the PAD nanofibers. The tailored colloidal stable PAD nanofibers achieve a penicillin G degradation rate of 0.35 min&#8722;1 per micromole of copper under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM 1.5) in deionized water, offering a promising platform for sustainable environmental remediation.

         <title>Nitro&#8208;Group &#960; System Drives the Interaction of RRx&#8208;001 with Electrons in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of cluster experiments, transient absorption spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy with theory enables tracking of the chemistry induced by secondary low&#8208;energy electrons to RRx&#8208;001 in solution from the initial interaction to the final radiolysis products. The catalytic and state&#8208;selective nature of the LEE interaction is identified, with consequences for the understanding of the LEE action in radiation damage in&#160;general.








Abstract
Reactivity toward low&#8208;energy electrons (LEE) has been hypothesized as a cause of radio&#8208;modifying properties for various molecules. LEE's transient nature, however, prevents the establishment of clear links between initial processes at the sub&#8208;ps time scale and the final products of radiolysis. Here, such links are explored for the radio&#8208;modifying compound RRx&#8208;001 (1&#8208;bromoacetyl&#8208;3,3&#8208;dinitroazetidine).
Picosecond pulse radiolysis demonstrates the high scavenging capacity of the molecule for secondary quasi&#8208;free and solvated electrons forming stable parent anions confirmed by studies of microsolvated RRx&#8208;001 in clusters. The anions decay either via auto&#8208;detachment of an electron or dissociate involving hydrogen transfer from solvent, resulting in NO2 and 1&#8208;(bromoacetyl)&#8208;3&#8208;nitroazetidine. Surprisingly, no Br dissociation is observed despite its high electron affinity. We assign this behavior to the &#8220;inaccessibility&#8221; of sigma virtual states for electrons in the solvent, which can be of a general nature.

         <title>2D MOF Nanozyme&#8208;Enhanced Impedance Detector for Synergistic Biofilm Detection and Removal in Bioelectrochemical Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a dual&#8208;functional 2D Cu&#8208;BDC nanozyme&#8208;based impedance detector for simultaneous biofilm detection and elimination. The detector achieves sensitive impedance response for biofilm monitoring and enables efficient biofilm clearance via peroxidase&#8208;like activity. This approach offers a novel strategy for improving MFCs efficiency through integrated biofilm real&#8208;time detection and elimination.








Abstract
The formation of biofilm has become a significant influencing factor to microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Developing effective biofilm detection means are highly imperative for improving the efficiency of MFCs. In this study, we propose a 2D metal&#8208;organic framework (2D Cu&#8208;BDC) nanozyme&#8208;based impedance detector for the simultaneous detection and removal of bacterial biofilms. The promising induction interface features good electron transfer and biofilm attachment properties, realizing sensitive biofilm detection. The impedance response change on the functionalized 2D Cu&#8208;BDC detector was 3.5 times higher for Gram&#8208;positive bacteria biofilm and 2.7 times higher for Gram&#8208;negative bacteria biofilm compared to bare electrodes. In addition, the 2D Cu&#8208;BDC nanozyme demonstrates robust peroxidase&#8208;like activity, enabling efficient biofilm degradation&#160;at low H2O2 concentration, and further allowing for real&#8208;time monitoring of the biofilm elimination process. This study provides a novel approach to using MOF&#8208;based biosensors for the simultaneous detection and removal of biofilm in MFCs.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Enabled Pathway Complexity in Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, we report a unique pathway complexity in supramolecular hydrogels. We demonstrate that chemical reduction followed by oxidation creates a kinetically trapped state, which evolves into various network structures, morphologies, and macroscopic stiffness.








Abstract
Pathway complexity in supramolecular assemblies presents a unique opportunity for a single, relatively simple system to exhibit a wide range of properties allowing for multifunctionality. In this study, we report redox&#8208;enabled pathway complexity in amino acid&#8208;functionalized perylene diimides (PDIs) and its consequence for the macroscopic hydrogel network. We show that chemical reduction and subsequent oxidation enable a kinetically trapped state which transforms into different network morphologies in response to heat and time. Our finding that pathway complexity in supramolecular systems can alter bulk material properties suggests the potential for future development of dynamic materials that achieve multiple macroscopic functions with a single building block.

         <title>The Role of Asparagine as a Gatekeeper Residue in the Selective Binding of Rare Earth Elements by Lanthanide&#8208;Binding Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide binding tags (LBTs) have been utilized as a green extractant to selectively separate rare earth elements (REEs). We reveal up from the molecular level how the N5 asparagine residue is indispensable in imparting selective complexation between lighter and heavier lanthanides by conformationally functioning as a gate. We demonstrate that for the smaller Ln3+ cations&#160;like Lu3+ the gate remains locked by an inter&#8208;arm hydrogen bond between N5 and E14 residues, locking the binding pocket. In contrast, for larger Ln3+ cations like La3+, the gate is open, allowing water to infiltrate inside the pocket.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;binding tag (LBT) peptides selectively complex lanthanide cations (Ln3+) in their binding pockets and are promising for lanthanide separation. However, designing LBTs that selectively target specific Ln3+ cations remains a challenge due to limited molecular&#8208;level understanding and control of interactions within the lanthanide&#8208;binding pocket. In this study, we reveal that the N5 asparagine residue acts as a gatekeeper in the binding pocket, resulting in a 100&#8208;fold selectivity for smaller Lu3+ over larger La3+ cations. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations show that the N5 residue weakly binds to the larger La3+ cation, permitting H2O molecules inside the pocket. For the smaller Lu3+ cations, the N5 residue forms an inter&#8208;arm hydrogen bond with the E14 glutamic acid residue, locking the Lu3+ cation in the pocket and preventing H2O infiltration. Mutating the N5 asparagine to a D5 aspartic acid prevents such a hydrogen bond, eliminating the gatekeeping mechanism and precipitously reducing selectivity. The resulting binding affinity to Ln3+ cations is non&#8208;monotonic but generally increases with cation size. These results suggest a molecular design paradigm: the reduced affinity for larger lanthanides is due to open pocket conformations, while the selectivity of smaller Ln3+ cations over larger ones is due to the gatekeeping hydrogen bond.

         <title>Dinitrogen Splitting without Barrier or Visible Light&#8208;Driven: Reactions of Vanadium Trimers and Dimers with Dinitrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Striking differences between the reactivity of vanadium atoms, dimers, and trimer clusters were revealed by matrix isolation experiments. Vanadium atoms only form weakly bound N2 complexes, but the V3 cluster splits the NN triple bond to give a V3N2 cluster. The V2 dimer requires visible light irradiation to form two isomeric V2N2 clusters with and without V&#9472;V bond. The results demonstrate the potential of clusters for N2 conversion.








Abstract
The reaction of V atoms and small clusters with dinitrogen has been investigated by matrix isolation in solid Ne and by complementary quantum chemical calculations. The experiments disclose striking differences between the reactivity of V atoms, dimers, and trimers toward dinitrogen. Whereas V atoms react only by formation of complexes, both V2 and V3 react by cleavage of the N2 triple bond to form nitride clusters. Whereas V3 reacts immediately at the conditions of matrix deposition, the reaction of V2 requires activation by irradiation with visible light. There is evidence for two isomers of V2N2, a planar one with a 5Au electronic term and a long V&#9472;V distance, and a folded one with a 1A1 term and a short V&#9472;V distance. Furthermore, there are also complexes of V2 and V3 with N2 that contain activated N2 units.

Furthermore, there are also complexes of V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that contain activated N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue TADF Emission from Multiheteroatom&#8208;doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Embedded with Dual B&#8208;O Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have demonstrated exceptional potential in the development of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, we propose a novel strategy for constructing PAH structures with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties by incorporating boron&#8208;oxygen (B&#8208;O) covalent bonds, as opposed to doping isolated boron atoms. The newly designed multiheteroatom&#8208;doped molecule, BNB&#8208;OPTZ, was synthesized via a demethylation&#8208;directed, lithium&#8208;free methodology, achieving an impressive one&#8208;pot yield exceeding 80%. BNB&#8208;OPTZ adopts a symmetric distorted semi&#8208;planar rigid conformation. Theoretical calculations reveal its long&#8208;range charge transfer characteristics. The molecule exhibits deep blue emission with a peak wavelength of 441 nm in toluene solution, accompanied by CIE coordinates of (0.14, 0.05). Notably, the blue OLED device using BNB&#8208;OPTZ achieved a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 23.1%. These findings suggest that the incorporation of B&#8208;O covalent bonds into multiheteroatom&#8208;doped PAH frameworks offers a promising design strategy for advancing PAH&#8208;based blue&#8208;light OLED applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Access of Heterocycles Utilizing Inherent Carbodicationic Reactivity of Ynone via Lewis Acid Catalysed C&#9472;C Triple Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient silver&#8208;catalysed triple cascade reaction has been developed to afford easy access to quinazolinone, quinazoline, and benzazole utilizing the gem&#8208;carbodicationic character of ynone. This triple cascade reaction involves sequential conjugate addition followed by Grob&#8208;type fragmentation assisted by stereoelectronic effect. Complex heterocycles have been synthesised by combining this triple cascade reaction followed by a cross&#8208;coupling reaction in the same synthetic sequence.








Abstract
Divalent carbodicationic synthon has attracted significant attention due to its unique reactivity and bonding. The application of this synthon in synthetic settings is still fancy owing to its super&#8208;electrophilicity. Generation of this reactive intermediate in a catalytic fashion is challenging. For the first time, the reactivity of the chemical equivalent of divalent dication synthon has been proposed via Lewis acid&#8208;catalysed heterolytic ionisation of ynone via sequential conjugate addition to ynone followed by C&#9472;C bond cleavage to afford heteroarenes. A library of quinazolinones and 2&#8208;substituted quinazolinones has been synthesised with good to excellent yields having a wide range of functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope using 2&#8208;amino benzamides as a nucleophilic partner. Furthermore, 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes afforded the corresponding benzimidazole in synthetically good yield. The generality of this strategy has been demonstrated by the successful synthesis of 6&#8208;mono and 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;substituted quinazolinones and 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted quinazoline with very high efficiency. The mechanistic study confirmed the role of the cooperative effect and secondary orbital interaction in Grob&#8208;type fragmentation and not the involvement of any radical intermediate in the catalytic cycle.

         <title>The Role of Ion Size and &#960;&#8208;Interaction in Stabilizing Calix[4]arene Crown Ether Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study systematically investigates the influence of ion size on the structure and stability of complexes formed between the calix[4]arene crown ether 1,3&#8208;alt&#8208;25,27&#8208;bis(3,7&#8208; dimethyloctyl&#8208;1&#8208;oxy)calix[4]arenebenzocrown&#8208;6 (MAXCalix) and mono&#8208; and divalent ions from the alkali and alkaline earth metal series. NMR spectroscopy studies revealed that while MAXCalix efficiently coordinates large ions such as Cs+, it also forms complexes with smaller ions like Na+, highlighting the ligand&#8217;s versatility. The size of the ion directly influences the complex structure, with two distinct structural subtypes identified via NMR and DFT calculations. Additionally, &#960;&#8208;interactions between the cation and the cation&#8208;facing benzene rings of the calix[4]arene backbone play an important role in stabilizing the complex. Larger ions like Cs+ benefit from &#960;&#8208;interactions with both cation&#8208;facing rings, whereas smaller ions like K+ interact with only one ring, if any. These &#960;&#8208;interactions are primarily drivers of the enhanced affinity for Cs+ and the resulting higher complex stability. Competitive NMR studies further confirmed that the complex stability increases with increasing ionic radius, and ions of similar size show comparable stability of their complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient and Rapid Arylation of NH&#8322;&#8208;Unprotected Bromobisindole Ethanamines via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling: Generating New Leads against Leishmania</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease which presents significant global health challenges due to the lack of effective vaccines and the limitations of existing chemotherapeutics in view of their toxicity, resistance, and high costs. In this study, we realized a library of novel bisindole derivatives as potential anti&#8208;leishmanial agents through a rapid Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction, utilizing NH2&#8208;unprotected bromobisindoles ethanamines and boronic acids. Optimization of reaction conditions allowed for the efficient and selective arylation of these substrates, with yields up to 93%. The compounds were screened for their activity against Leishmania infantum promastigotes. Among the tested bisindole derivatives, 3af (bearing a 4&#8208;vinylphenyl moiety) demonstrated potent anti&#8208;leishmanial activity (IC50 = 1.1 &#956;M) with a higher selectivity index (21.8) compared to the reference drug miltefosine (9.8). A significant activity was also retained against intracellular amastigotes. This study establishes a robust methodology for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bisindoles, also highlighting these derivatives' potential as promising leads for antileishmanial drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Cis&#8208;Chelating Diphosphanes for Intra&#8208;Cavity Nickel(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Oligomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four cis&#8208;chelating diphosphanes derived from cyclodextrins (CDs), each with various intra&#8208;cavity environments, compel NiII or PdII metal centers to reside within &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;CD cavities. Nickel(II) complexes of these metal&#8208;confining ligands act as active catalysts in ethylene oligomerization upon activation with modified methyaluminoxane (MMAO). The size of the cavity and the position of the P2Ni fragment relative to the cavity affect both the activity and selectivity of the reaction. In all instances, 1&#8208;butene is the major product (up to 98% C4 products and 90% 1&#8208;butene within the C4 fraction). Extensive theoretical studies with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods carried out on the most selective system suggest that the CD cavity restricts isomerization pathways by limiting the mobility of the coordinated olefin in this constrained supramolecular environment, thereby enhancing &#945;&#8208;olefin formation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This article describes the synthesis, along with the full photophysical and computational characterization, of a series of push&#8208;pull boron complexes comprising a sterically&#8208;hindered donor connected to a pyrimidine&#8208;based O^N^O boron chelate. The dimethylacridan&#8208;functionalized fluorophore appears to be the most emissive in the series, both in toluene solution and in the solid state (as a powder), displaying TADF emission in degassed media due to a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. This result is in line with a previously reported pyridine analogue, which also exhibits delayed emission. Incorporation of this TADF compound into an organic light&#8208;emitting diode led to the observation of intense electroluminescence, with EQEmax values reaching 9.7%, at a 5 wt% doping concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>Linkage Engineering of Triazine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Selective Photocatalytic Oxidation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered significant attention as versatile photocatalysts due to their tunable structure and activity. In this work, linkage engineering is applied to two triazine&#8208;based COFs, yielding TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF (with C=C linkage) and TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF (with a C=N linkage), respectively. TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits better thermal stability and a higher surface area than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF. More importantly, the C=C linkage in TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF leads to better optoelectronic properties than the C=N linkage in TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF, as it promotes efficient charge separation and transfer and &#960;&#8208;delocalization, as evidenced by experiments and density functional theory calculations. Consequently, TFPT&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF demonstrates higher activities than TFPT&#8208;IM&#8208;COF for selective photocatalytic oxidation of amines. Notably, a diverse range of amines achieve high conversions to corresponding imines with high selectivities. Superoxide, generated through photoexcited electron transfer to O2, is identified as the predominant reactive oxygen species. This work underscores the pivotal role of linkage engineering in optimizing COFs for selective reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for Developing Activity&#8208;Based Luminescent Probes for Imaging and Diagnosing Inflammatory Bowel Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular probes designed to target inflammatory bowel diseases&#8208;specific biomarkers, including oxidative stress mediators and enzymatic biomarkers. By elucidating these mechanisms, this review aims to enhance researchers' understanding and facilitate the future application of molecular probes for more effective IBD diagnosis and monitoring.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have experienced a concerning global increase in incidence over recent decades. The advent of molecular imaging probes has revolutionized real&#8208;time biomarker monitoring in IBD pathophysiology, enabling visualization of critical pathological processes. These probes provide dynamic insights into oxidative stress mediators (including reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species) and enzymatic biomarkers (e.g., caspase&#8208;1, pantetheinase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, nitroreductase, elastase, myeloperoxidase, and carboxylesterase 2), which are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms. Despite significant technological advancements, there remains a lack of systematic analyses exploring the diagnostic potential and therapeutic monitoring applications of these molecular probes in IBD management. This review comprehensively analyzes the design of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular probes targeting IBD&#8208;specific biomarkers, with particular focus on their detection mechanisms and biological applicability. Through a mechanistic elucidation of detection paradigms, this review aims to guide the development of future probes for diagnosing IBD.

         <title>Peripheral Designed Indigo Bola&#8208;Amphiphiles for Supramolecular Assembled Nanoarchitectonics in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indigo as a biodegradable motif is considerable for constructing a sustainable supramolecular polymer. Considering sustainability prospects, indigo bola&#8208;amphiphiles (IBAs) are designed for which supramolecular assemble as high aspect ratio nanostructures. Instead of using uncommon scandium, bio&#8208;abundant calcium cations can assist in constructing macroscopic materials from IBAs nanostructures with structural packing characterizations.








Abstract
Indigo, an ancient natural dye, featured excellent biodegradability to advance in sustainable polymer. Indigo amphiphiles can pave a way for sustainable supramolecular polymers in aqueous media for potential biomedical functional materials. However, contemporary indigo amphiphiles supramolecular commonly assemble into low aspect ratio nanostructures, which hampers the macroscopic soft scaffolds fabrications and smart functional material applications. In this study, we report a novel peripheral designed indigo bola&#8208;amphiphiles (IBAs), which assemble into high aspect ratio supramolecular nanofibers in aqueous media. By employing a shear&#8208;flow assembly technique with bio&#8208;abundant calcium ions, IBAs assemble across multiple length scales into supramolecular macroscopic scaffolds. The structural characterizations of IBAs macroscopic soft scaffolds show different supramolecular structural packing information by scanning electron microscope and X&#8208;ray scattering/diffraction techniques. Our supramolecular nanoarchitectonic approach indicates the feasibility of using IBAs molecular design to construct supramolecular macroscopic materials with higher structural order for the future smart biofunctional materials and sustainable supramolecular polymer under more environmentally friendly conditions.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogs via a Solid&#8208;Solution Storage Mechanism for Long Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a method for synthesizing high&#8208;entropy solid&#8208;solution by incorporating multiple metallic elements into Prussian blue analogs (PBAs). The resulting solid&#8208;solution storage mechanism exhibits not only inhibited phase transitions but also preserved crystalline structure integrity, leading to enhanced electrochemical performance.








Abstract
The open&#8208;framework characteristics of Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been recognized as advantages for cathode application in Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Nevertheless, lattice distortions during charge&#8208;discharge cycles critically compromise their cyclability. Recent advancements in high&#8208;entropy design strategies have significantly improved structural stability and energy storage efficiency within functional materials. In this study, we developed the high&#8208;entropy PBAs, K1.68 Mn0.21 Cu0.20 Ni0.20 Co0.19 Fe0.20[Fe(CN)6]0.87&#9633;0.13&#183;0.66H2O, via a cost&#8208;effective aqueous co&#8208;precipitation method. Notably, this approach facilitates the concurrent incorporation of five transition metals (Mn, Cu, Ni, Co, and Fe), thereby establishing a stable crystalline framework. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the cathode achieves a specific capacity of 124.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.025 A g&#8722;1. At various current densities (0.025&#8211;1 A g&#8722;1), the cathode maintains a particular capacity retention of 62.1% during rate testing. Furthermore, the cathode exhibits exceptional cyclability preserving 78.7% capacity at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles. Operando X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms the formation of a reversible solid&#8208;solution intercalation/extraction mechanism process, which prevents phase transitions and enhances cyclability. This high&#8208;entropy material holds significant potential as a cathode for SIBs, offering high specific capacity and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability. These superior properties position it as a competitive candidate for advanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Catalytic and Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Saddle&#8208;Shaped Compounds by [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] Cycloaddition of 1,8&#8208;Naphthylene&#8208;Based 1,10&#8208;Diynes with Alkynoates</title>

         <dc:description>
1,8&#8208;naphthylene&#8208;based 1,10&#8208;diynes (anti/syn mixture) underwent Rh&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular cycloaddition with alkynoates to afford highly enantioenriched, thermodynamically stable chiral cycloadducts. This synthetic strategy could be expanded to hetero [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition with aryl cyanides, giving inherently chiral pyridine&#8208;containing saddle&#8208;shaped molecules.








Abstract
In this paper, we describe a chiral Rh&#8208;catalyzed [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of 1,8&#8208;naphthylene&#8208;based 1,10&#8208;diynes of an anti/syn mixture with alkynoates. Thermodynamically stable saddle&#8208;shaped chiral cycloadducts were obtained in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Hetero [2&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition using aryl cyanides also proceeded to give the corresponding inherently chiral pyridine&#8208;containing compounds.

&lt;p&gt;1,8-naphthylene-based 1,10-diynes (anti/syn mixture) underwent Rh-catalyzed intermolecular cycloaddition with alkynoates to afford highly enantioenriched, thermodynamically stable chiral cycloadducts.

         <title>Dihalogens Binding and Activation by Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;Chalcogenone Model Derivatives: Insight from a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;chalcogenones react with dihalogens, initially forming a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) adduct, which may evolve to the most stable T&#8208;shaped hypercoordinate (TY) species. However, in silico results show that the CT adduct is more stable than the corresponding TY species for the sulfur and iodine combination. This exception is rationalized within the framework of activation strain analysis.








Abstract
Chalcogenone donors represent a fundamental chemical class of compounds in the treatment of hyperthyroidism; particularly, imidazoline&#8208;based systems are associated with the strongest affinity for I2. Therefore, the reactivity of these types of donors with dihalogens may be insightful to understand the mechanism of action of popular drugs, such as methimazole (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione, MMI). In this work, the reactivity of 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;chalcogenone (S, Se, Te) with dihalogens X2 (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) is evaluated for any combination through a systematic computational study. Three different products are found: a linear charge transfer (CT) &#8220;spoke&#8221; adduct, a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; intermediate (TI), and a &#8220;T&#8208;shaped&#8221; hypercoordinate species (TY). The halogen and chalcogen effects are discussed separately as for the solvation effects. Furthermore, only the TY species formed from the reaction between 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;thione and I2 resulted to be disfavored with respect to the corresponding CT adduct; therefore, this peculiarity is rationalized in the framework of activation strain analysis. Lastly, a possible alternative mechanism involving the formation of a cationic intermediate species is considered.

         <title>Polyvalent Nucleic Acid Nanoprobes for Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on polyvalent nucleic acid&#8208;based nanosystems and their biomedical applications, aiming to provide theoretical guidance for the rational establish of smart polyvalent nucleic acid nanosystems with robust functionalities for facilitated tumor diagnosis and therapy applications.








Abstract
Nucleic acids, as essential biomacromolecules, have garnered considerable scientific interest in diagnosis and therapy owing to their unique molecular characteristics, including sequence&#8208;specific programmability, precise molecular recognition capabilities, and diverse biological functionalities. In recent years, with the deepening of the understanding of the physicochemical properties of nucleic acids and the development of nanotechnology, nucleic acid&#8208;based nanoprobes with sophisticated structures and functions have been gradually developed, opening up a new direction for efficient diagnosis, followed by customized therapy for diseases. Despite the progress, the affinity and stability of nucleic acids to target sites still suffer from severe challenges, especially in complex physiological environments. Polyvalent nucleic acids, integrated with different functional elements, have demonstrated enormous advantages in effectively solving the above limitations by the elaborate design and construction of multifunctional DNA nanostructures, making them promising candidates for smart&#8208;responsive nanoprobes. In this review, we commence with an exploration of nucleic acids, subsequently delineating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for the fabrication of polyvalent nucleic acid nanostructures. We then predominantly underscore the latest advancements in these nanostructures as innovative platforms for cancer theranostics. Further, we critically examine the biomedical applications of polyvalent nucleic acids, alongside addressing the prevailing challenges and future prospects in the realm of nucleic acid&#8208;facilitated diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Lactam Ylidenes: An Overlooked Class of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modular synthetic approach toward four&#8208;membered &#946;&#8208;lactam carbenes (BLCs) is presented. BLCs feature moderate &#963;&#8208;donor and strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor character, leading to a pronounced ambiphilic reactivity which includes the formation of olefinic dimers as well as unprecedented N2&#8208;bridged dimers, oxirane formation with acetone, and fragmentation to ketenimines. Experimental findings are rationalized by DFT calculations.








Abstract
In this study, the underappreciated class of &#946;&#8208;lactam carbenes (BLCs) is revisited and systematically explored. The required precursors are available in a highly modular synthetic approach from simple starting materials. Two routes may be followed for the generation of the free BLCs: thermal fragmentation of spiro&#8208;fused oxadiazoles (110&#160;&#176;C, toluene), or deprotonation of carbene HCl&#8208;adducts at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C with a strong base. TEP values (2065&#8211;2072&#160;cm&#8722;1), 77Se NMR shifts of selenium&#8208;adducts (812&#8211;995&#160;ppm), as well as DFT calculations reveal moderate &#963;&#8208;donor and strong &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of BLCs, leading to a pronounced ambiphilic reactivity. The formation of a wide variety of products under thermal conditions in the cause of oxadiazole fragmentation (110&#160;&#176;C, toluene) is rationalized by a combination of computational reaction discovery and experimental validation. Products include olefinic dimers as well as unprecedented N2&#8208;bridged dimers arising from bimolecular reactions, while sterically more demanding precursors are converted in a monomolecular fragmentation reaction via CO release to form ketenimines as intermediates, which finally form amides. With substituents providing appropriate steric protection, a persistent BLC is available via the low temperature route, characterized by its 13C NMR shift of 287&#160;ppm at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Stannylenes Bearing an Amino&#8208;Linked NHC Ligand as Efficient Catalysts for Hydroboration of Carbonyls and Imines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a series of three&#8208;coordinate stannylenes featuring an amino&#8208;linked NHC ligand. The bis(trimethylsilyl)amino derivative showed excellent catalytic efficiency in hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones, and imines under mild conditions. These findings demonstrate the promise of NHC&#8208;supported stannylenes as versatile tin(II) catalysts, for efficient and selective hydroboration using main group elements.








Abstract
We designed and synthesized a series of three&#8208;coordinated stannylenes featuring an amino&#8208;linked NHC ligand, specifically tailored for the hydroboration of carbonyl compounds and imines. To fine&#8208;tune the catalytic performance both sterically and electronically, various substituents (chloro, triflate, and bis(trimethylsilyl)amino groups) were introduced at the tin center, generating structurally diverse stannylenes. The molecular structures of these stannylenes were confirmed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The hydroboration of carbonyl compounds catalyzed by these stannylenes proceeded under mild reaction conditions, affording the corresponding boryl esters in excellent yields with high chemoselectivity. Notably, bis(trimethylsilyl)aminostannylene exhibited outstanding catalytic efficiency, enabling hydroboration with a minimal catalyst loading of 0.01 mol% for aldehydes and 0.1 mol% for ketones, and was tolerant of a wide range of substrates, including sterically hindered and electronically diverse carbonyl compounds. Furthermore, in the hydroboration of imines, the reaction proceeded efficiently with just 5 mol% catalyst, furnishing the corresponding borylamines in high yields. Based on stoichiometric experiments, we propose a plausible catalytic cycle for stannylene&#8208;mediated hydroboration.

         <title>The Energetics of Electron Transfer in Redox&#8208;DNA Layers Mimics That of Redox Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron transfer in ferrocene&#8208;labeled DNA (Fc&#8208;DNA) layers mimics that of redox proteins, featuring a low reorganization energy (&#955;). The origin of the low &#955; in Fc&#8208;DNA was unveiled by high&#8208;scan&#8208;rate cyclic voltammetry and molecular dynamics simulations, implying Fc&#8208;DNA as a versatile tool to open new avenues in understanding the ET in biological systems and optimizing the electrochemical applications in biosensing and energy conversion.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;DNA layers have recently shown unique properties, such as tunable reorganization energy of electron transfer that can be modulated by DNA length or hybridization state and completely suppressed under nanoconfinement. These discoveries, attributed to the changes in the solvation of the redox marker and/or fast chain dynamics, provide a unique opportunity to use electrochemical measurements as a tool to address open questions in ion solvation. Moreover, they offer a pathway to clarify the origin of the largely unsolved problem of establishing low activation barriers for biological electron transfer. Here, high&#8208;scan&#8208;rate, variable&#8208;temperature cyclic voltammetry analyzed using the Marcus formalism and molecular dynamics simulations, reveals that the total free energy barrier of electron transfer consists of two additive elements: the reorganization energy of the partially desolvated redox marker and the energy cost for solvation changes of the redox marker at the solid/liquid interface. These results may have profound implications for our understanding of electron transfer and solvation effects in redox proteins, providing opportunities for better design of artificial photosynthetic systems, biosensing, and energy conversion devices.

         <dc:description>
This report employs computational methods at unified levels of theory to examine the respective transmetalation mechanisms underpinning classical palladium&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8211;Csp2 and Csp2&#8211;Csp3 Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings.

Abstract
This report employs computational methods at unified levels of theory to systematically and comprehensively examine the respective transmetalation mechanisms underpinning classical palladium&#8208;catalyzed Csp2&#8211;Csp2 and Csp2&#8211;Csp3 Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. This approach enabled fundamental aspects of these transmetalation pathways to be directly juxtaposed, which allowed for subtle, but important, features underpinning the transmetalation mechanisms of archetypal arylboronic acid and B&#8208;alkyl&#8208;9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane nucleophiles to be highlighted and placed in a broader context.

         <title>Fluorescent Deferoxamine Complexes of Cu(II) and Zr(IV): Insights in the Development of Dual Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deferoxamine (DFO) is widely regarded as benchmark chelator for 89Zr(IV), a commonly used PET (Positron Emission Tomography) tracer. We have introduced a novel fluorescent coumarin derivative of DFO (DFOKC), characterized by chelating unit and fluorophore covalently linked via a lysine molecule. This design introduces a free primary amine group, which, in perspective, can be functionalized with biological vectors, potentially improving tumour tissue selectivity. Its acid&#8208;base and metal coordination properties toward Cu(II) and Zr(IV) ions were thoroughly characterized using UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence emission spectroscopy. DFOKC strongly coordinates both metal ions, forming somewhat more stable complexes than DFO, while retaining fluorescence emission, thus enabling dual&#8208;mode optical and PET imaging. Biodistribution assays conducted on NIH&#8208;3T3 fibroblasts, and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines demonstrated that the presence of primary amine groups favours Zr&#8208;DFOKC complex cell internalization via pinocytosis compared to the parent molecule DFOC, in which the fluorophore is linked to the amine group of DFO. Furthermore, crystal violet and MTT assays revealed no cytotoxic effects or mitochondrial impairment, even at concentrations higher than those typically used for radiodiagnostic applications. These results strongly support the potential of DFOKC as a versatile and promising tool for dual imaging, offering significant advantages in molecular imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Catalysis and Analysis: Accelerated Asymmetric Reaction Development with a Multitasking Reactivity Umpolung/Chiroptical Reporter Auxiliary</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;throughput asymmetric reaction development of an organocatalytic Michael addition is achieved by using a readily available isatin molecule as amine protecting group, reagent for reactivity Umpolung, and as chiroptical yield and enantioselectivity reporter. The use of UV and circular dichroism inductions allows on the fly, chromatography&#8208;free parallel screening of hundred reaction conditions to identify a catalytic procedure that converts a primary amine to either enantiomer of an alpha&#8208;branched chiral product in excellent yields and ee&#8217;s. The isatin is recyclable and can be quantitatively recovered if desirable. This case study shows how chiroptical high&#8208;throughput screening with a multitasking reagent can increase method development speed and reduce cost and waste compared to traditional reaction optimization workflows by streamlining the analysis of small&#8208;scale reaction setups and eliminating time&#8208;consuming work&#8208;up protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling New Triazoloquinoxaline&#8208;based PROTACs Designed for the Selective Degradation of the ncBAF Chromatin Remodeling Subunit BRD9</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology is an innovative and potent approach for achieving targeted protein degradation (TPD). Within bromodomain&#8208;containing proteins, various degraders targeting BET family&#8208;related targets, e.g., BRD4, were developed in the last years. On the other hand, a limited number of PROTACs acting against non&#8208;BET proteins have been reported so far. Among them, BRD9 has been recently linked to oncogenic roles in the tumorigenesis processes, especially in sarcomas and leukemias. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of a focused collection of new BRD9&#8208;targeting degraders based on the [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;a]quinoxaline heterocyclic scaffold employing two distinct E3 ubiquitin ligase ligands. Through in silico evaluation, synthesis, binding affinity determination, and in vitro analysis, we identified two new VHL&#8208;based PROTACs (2 and 9), which showed remarkable degradation of the protein of interest and antiproliferative activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Notably, compound 9 exhibited selective degradation of BRD9 over BRD7. These results enlarge and differentiate the pool of heterobifunctional molecules able to degrade BRD9 through the proteasome machinery, providing a promising reference for the discovery of new tools to further explore both the involvement of this epigenetic regulatory factor in tumor processes and to evaluate novel strategies for AML treatment.</dc:description>

Through in silico evaluation, synthesis, binding affinity determination, and in vitro analysis, we identified two new VHL-based PROTACs (2 and 9), which showed remarkable degradation of the protein of interest and antiproliferative activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Notably, compound 9 exhibited selective degradation of BRD9 over BRD7. These results enlarge and differentiate the pool of heterobifunctional molecules able to degrade BRD9 through the proteasome machinery, providing a promising reference for the discovery of new tools to further explore both the involvement of this epigenetic regulatory factor in tumor processes and to evaluate novel strategies for AML treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Glycans and Chirality: Stereoselectivity at the Core of DC&#8208;SIGN&#8217;s Recognition. A Novel View of the Optimum Minimal Ligand Epitope</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycans exhibit an unparalleled density of stereochemical information, encoded at the monosaccharide level through multiple stereogenic centers, anomeric configurations, ring tautomerism, and conformational variability. Indeed, chiral recognition is fundamental to the interaction between glycans and proteins. Despite the theoretical risk posed by mirror&#8208;image molecules, the stereochemical diversity of the &#8220;glycan code&#8221; enables similar chiral motifs to arise from both D&#8208; and L&#8208;sugars. Herein, we present an in&#8208;depth investigation of the stereochemical features governing lectin&#8211;glycan recognition, using the well&#8208;characterized human C&#8208;type lectin DC&#8208;SIGN as a model. By combining experimental (STD&#8208;NMR) and computational approaches, we identified a minimal optimal binding epitope recognized by DC&#8208;SIGN. Key binding requirements include the correct chirality of the Ca2+&#8208;coordinating oxygens, an adjacent equatorial hydroxyl group for hydrogen bonding with Glu354, and hydrophobic contacts with Val351. Known ligands L&#8208;fucose and D&#8208;mannose fulfill these criteria. Our results further demonstrate that DC&#8208;SIGN also binds &#945;/&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;galactose, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;rhamnose, and myo&#8208;inositol. Among these, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;rhamnose exhibits higher affinity than &#945;&#8208;OMe&#8208;D&#8208;mannose, while &#945;/&#946;&#8208;L&#8208;galactose binds more strongly than D&#8208;rhamnose and myo&#8208;inositol, albeit with lower affinity than &#945;&#8208;OMe&#8208;L&#8208;fucose. STD&#8208;NMR experiments confirmed that all these ligands share the same core binding epitope.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of a Deep&#8208;Red Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Active Iridium Complex for Plant Cell Wall Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plant cell wall imaging has received consistent attention in characterizing and monitoring the structure and health of plant tissues. To overcome current drawbacks of plant cell wall staining, such as source limitations, low specificity, auto&#8208;fluorescence interference, in this work we present the rational design of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active, deep&#8208;red emissive iridium complex as a specific staining agent of plant cell wall. Cell wall probe [Ir(dpyb)2(iqbtz)]+ (Ir&#8208;CW), bearing two rotatable pyridyl moieties, is designed to selective binding to pectin, one of the major components of the cell wall that carries rich carboxylic residues on its polymer chain. The AIE properties, pectin sensing behaviors, pectin binding mechanism and practical application of cell wall staining of Ir&#8208;CW are performed. Results demonstrate that Ir&#8208;CW exhibit pectin&#8208;responsive AIE properties and selective pectin binding against common interfering species including metal ions, anions, amino acids and saccharides. Notably, Ir&#8208;CW can specifically stain plant cell walls with better performance than Congo red, a commercial cell wall staining agent. This work highlights the rationales of developing novel iridium complexes for cell wall staining, and widely broadening their applications as powerful tools for botanical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenative Functionalization of Phenols via &#960;&#8208;Coordination Activation: Mechanochemical Access to N&#8208;Aryl Amides and &#945;&#8208;Aryl Carbonyls.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the vast occurrence and availability of both primary amides and phenols, the synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides via direct coupling between these starting materials would be much attractive. Herein, we report an efficient method for the mechanochemical synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides via ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed direct amidation of unprotected phenols with primary amides with water as the sole byproduct. Unexpectedly, replacing amides with methyl carboxylic acids, esters, or ketones led to the formation of &#945;&#8208;aryl carbonyl derivatives instead of the anticipated aryl carboxylates. The synthetic strategy accepts a wide scope of primary amides, alkyl carbonyls and phenolic substrates to deliver the twenty&#8208;eight expected N&#8208;aryl amides and fourteen unexpected &#945;&#8208;aryl carbonyl derivatives with good to excellent yields. The developed synthetic approach would serve as the better alternative to the classical cross&#8208;coupling reactions in context to the PASE (pot, atom, and step economy) synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Arylboronic Acid Catalyzed Reductive Alkylation of Azoarenes to N&#8208;Alkylated Hydrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrazine derivatives are generally difficult to prepare despite their appealing structural simplicity. The synthetic challenge is likely to arise from either the similar reactivity or the relatively low activity of the two nitrogen&#8217;s in a hydrazine precursor. The former would lead to severe selectivity issues while the latter would require harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we have developed a new and efficient method for constructing N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;diarylhydrazines by arylboronic acid&#8208;catalyzed an one&#8208;pot tandem reduction of azoarene to hydrazoarene followed by reductive alkylation with the aldehyde and Hantzsch ester. The use of mild reaction conditions offers to provide tri&#8208;substituted hydrazine derivatives and suppress the N&#8208;N cleaved product amines and/or imines. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates a wide variety of hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive functional groups. Method has been successfully utilized in the late&#8208;stage functionalization, diversification of pharmaceuticals. The mechanistic study demonstrates the unique behaviour of boron&#8208;based catalysts as both Lewis acids and hydrogen&#8208;bond donors. Based on the thermodynamic activation parameters, kinetic Hammett studies, and competitive reaction on the substrate, it has been postulated that iminium formation step is likely to be the rate&#8208;limiting step.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0&#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Generation by Cyclization of an Organic Structure Directing Agent for the Synthesis of High Silica Zeolite ERS&#8208;7</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic route is established to high silica zeolite ERS&#8208;7 templated by a dimethylpyrrolidinium organic structure directing agent (OSDA) in the presence of a cationic polymer, both formed in situ from organic precursors. The polymer enables the cyclization that gives the OSDA and inhibits the crystallization of the competing zeolite mordenite.








Abstract
Zeolites with high framework Si/Al ratios are of interest for industrial applications due to their hydrothermal stability. They are usually synthesized in the presence of pre&#8208;prepared organic structure directing agents (OSDAs). The high silica ERS&#8208;7 zeolite (topology type ESV) can be crystallized using N,N&#8208;dimethylpyrrolidinium (dmpyrr) that is formed in situ via cyclization of N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diaminobutane (tmdab) when a cationic polymer is also present. The in situ generation of dmpyrr is demonstrated by solid&#8208;state 13C NMR spectroscopy and supported by both chemical analyses and comparative syntheses using pre&#8208;prepared dmpyrr. The cationic polymer inhibits the crystallization of mordenite, which is otherwise observed to be the favored product. The ERS&#8208;7 prepared via in situ dmpyrr synthesis (Si/Al = 14) is characterized by PXRD and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The CO2 adsorption seen for the H&#8208; and Na&#8208;forms indicates interactions with accessible Na+ cations. The synthetic studies indicate the potential for in situ generation of OSDAs to reduce the need for extended OSDA syntheses.

         <title>Copper (II) Triflate/ Vitamin&#8208;C Promoted Modified Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman Annulation: A Facile Route to Fluorescent Cyclopentene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a copper triflate (Cu(OTf)2) promoted Intramolecular Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman(IMBH) annulation protocol is reported for the synthesis of fused cyclopentenoids which in turn act as molecular sensors for hazardous amine detection. A characteristic interconversion via 1,5&#8208;H shift between two non&#8208;separable isomeric mixtures of cyclopentene derivatives, and a solvent&#8208;free organic acid mediated version of the protocol, provide exciting dimensions to this work.








Abstract
Herein we report a rapid and efficient method for the synthesis of fused cyclopentenoids via Intramolecular Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (IMBH) annulation. In this approach, copper triflate (Cu(OTf)2) serves as the promoter, favoring cyclization and aromatization over the conventional MBH addition product. A characteristic feature among most of the cyclized product contain two non&#8208;separable isomeric mixture of cyclopentene derivatives which has been readily interconverted via 1,5&#8208;H shift. This sigmatropic shift has been proved via deuterium labelling experiment using the first synthesized 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;6&#8208;methoxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydronaphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde&#8208;d. The equilibration of two cyclopentadiene ring via sigmatropic shift has also been characterized by 2D NMR experiment. The scale&#8208;up experiment in the modified IMBH reaction also flourish our protocol significantly. Additionally, the same compounds have also been synthesized in solvent&#8208;free conditions using organic acids, which reduces the use of hazardous substances, providing an alternate pathway for the IMBH reaction avoiding conventional aqueous work&#8208;up. Moreover, this novel IMBH reaction has been thoroughly investigated and elucidated using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The construction of such fluorescent derivatives and the evaluation of their unique photophysical properties revealed acid&#8208;base interactions with active methylene groups, facilitating their use as sensors of hazardous amine derivatives via fluorescence quenching mechanism.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Based Design of Metallocene Catalysts for Controlled Olefin Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To design catalysts for ethylene/hexene copolymerization, a virtual screening scheme combining predictive models with a genetic algorithm was proposed. Chemically intuitive descriptors obtained from mechanism analysis improve the generalizability of models, effectively predicting catalysts with new core structures not included in the fitting set. This scheme is used to design new zirconocene catalysts with desired properties and diverse core structures.








Abstract
Polyolefins are versatile materials for various purposes, but their functionality should be fine&#8208;tuned for target applications including the mitigation of adverse environmental impacts. Producing such polymers with desired properties requires catalysts that can control polymerization at an atomistic level. However, complex reaction mechanisms and very limited experimental data make it difficult to design new efficient catalysts using conventional computational and data&#8208;driven approaches. Here, we present a pragmatic strategy based on data&#8208;efficient predictive models combined with a genetic algorithm to design new catalysts for controlled ethylene/hexene copolymerization. By deriving the chemically intuitive descriptors from the mechanistic analysis of the polymerization, we achieved the promising predictive models with small data applicable to various core structures and different experimental conditions, respectively. We screened catalysts through a virtual screening scheme combining a genetic algorithm and predictive models using chemically intuitive descriptors and considered their synthesizability through the manual inspections of experts. As a result, we successfully designed nine catalysts with desired comonomer ratios and diverse core structures.

         <title>The Dugganite Structure as a Host for New Colored Compounds and for Oxygen Evolution Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family compounds with the general formula A3BC3D2O14 (A = Pb, Ba, Sr; B = Te, Sb; C = Al, Ga, Fe, Zn; D = P, V, As, Si, Ge) stabilised in the dugganite structure has been prepared and characterized. The transition metal ions substituted at the tetrahedral sites in place of Zn2+ ions, gave rise to brightly colored compounds. The origin of colors in the compounds were understood based on the allowed d&#8208;d transitions and possible metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) transitions involving the different transition elements. The white compounds exhibited good near infrared ( NIR) reflectivity as well as deep UV &#8208; cut off (85&#8208;90%), which indicates possible use as UV&#8208;NLO materials. The compounds exhibited reasonable second harmonic generation (SHG) activity with values that are 3&#8211; 5 times higher than KDP. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) studies on Pb3TeCo3V2O14 and Pb3Te(Co2Fe)(VSi)O14, exhibited good OER behavior in alkaline medium with long &#8211; term stability. The change in the band gap values for the transition metal substituted compounds were understood through density functional theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanded Structural Design of Organic Ionic Plastic Crystals Based on&#160;Linear Tris&#8208;Pyrrolidinium Salt</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) materials exhibit soft solid phases within a specific temperature range, making them promising candidates for various electrochemical devices due to their intrinsic ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, a series of linear tris&#8208;pyrrolidinium salts with different alkyl side chain lengths and counter&#8208;anions were synthesized and systematically characterized in terms of their structural, thermal, and electrochemical properties. Among the synthesized compounds, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8217;&#8208;undecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (11&#8208;PF6) exhibited two solid&#8208;solid phase transitions, and a low fusion entropy (&#916;Sf) of 13 J&#8729;K&#8208;1&#8729;mol&#8208;1 at 210 &#176;C. Similarly, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8217;&#8208;dodecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (12&#8208;PF6) showed multiple phase transitions with a low &#916;Sfof 18 J&#8729;K&#8208;1&#8729;mol&#8208;1 at 206 &#176;C. The temperature&#8208;dependent soft crystalline phases of 11&#8208;PF6 were identified as plastic crystal phase using polarized optical microscopy and 1D wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS). The ionic conductivity of 11&#8208;PF6 was measured to be 2.04&#215;10&#8208;6 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1 at 70 &#176;C. Upon blending with 80 mol% LiTf2N, the ionic conductivity significantly increased to 1.16&#215;10&#8208;4 S&#8729;cm&#8208;1. Electrochemical stability was evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The composite solid electrolyte consisting of 11&#8208;PF6 and 80 mol% LiTf2N exhibited electrochemical stability up to 5.4 V (vs. Li/Li+), highlighting its potential as a high&#8208;voltage electrolyte component.</dc:description>

         <title>Constant pH Molecular Dynamics Simulation of pH Effects on Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Structure, Dynamics and Metal&#8208;Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first molecular dynamics simulations to examine the effect of pH on the structure, dynamics and metal&#8208;binding ability of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, the peptide implicated in onset of Alzheimer's disease. We show that in the pH range of 6 to 8 only histidine residues show variable protonation, that predicted pKa values are in agreement with experimental data, and that changes in pH affect size, flexibility and secondary structure of the peptide. Binding of Cu(II) or Zn(II) to the peptide induces a shift of 1 to 1.5 pKa units in unbound histidine residues, while metal binding modes associated with higher pH induce significant changes in peptide structure. We speculate on the significance of these findings on results showing pH dependence as well as on Cu(II) and Zn(II) modulation of aggregation of Amyloid&#8208;&#946;.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) Catalysts Prepared Using a Silica Helical Nanoplatform for the Enantioselective Photooxidation of Aromatic Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobaltabis(dicarbollide) ([Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8208;) named COSAN has been widely explored in a variety of fields. While COSAN have recently been investigated in catalysis, their chiral counterparts have, to our knowledge, never been investigated in asymmetric catalysis. Inspired by our previous work on the chiral induction of silica helices on achiral objects, we prepared chiral COSAN&#8208;based hybrid silica nanohelices. In these structures, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanohelices serves as a chiral platform for COSAN in enantioselective transformations. These NANOCOSAN were characterized using UV/Vis, Raman soectroscopy, TEM, EELS and NMR spectroscopy. Their optical activity was demonstrated by CD and ROA, highlighting the induction of chirality from chiral hybrid nanohelices to the achiral COSAN. To the best of our knowledge, these NANOCOSAN represent the first examples of COSAN&#8208;based chiral systems displaying chiroptical effects. They show excellent catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in the photooxidation of secondary aromatic alcohols, achieving up to 85% enantiomeric excess (ee). This catalytic experiment demonstrate the transfer of chiroptical properties from the nanohelices to the achiral COSAN, enabling supramolecular asymmetric catalysis. The catalyst was recovered and reused without any loss of catalytic activity or ee. This study reports the first example of COSAN&#8208;containing nanohelices which can promote photooxidation of organic substrates with high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>From C&#9472;H Bond Insertion to Hydrogen Atom Transfer: Tuning the Reaction Mechanisms of Methane Activation by the Oxidation of Ta2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a combined experimental and theoretical study, it is observed that the continued oxidation from Ta2+ to Ta2Ox+ (with x&#160;=&#160;1 &#8211; 6) changes the reactivity with methane from a typical metallic to a typical oxidic behavior. While the bridging motifs in Ta2O2+ enable the dehydrogenation of CH4, the spin density on oxygen atoms in Ta2O5+ facilitates a HAT reaction.








Abstract
The activation of methane under mild conditions is a challenging but rewarding goal; the underlying key parameters, however, remain elusive. In this study on isolated tantalum Ta2+ compounds exposed to methane in a ring&#8208;electrode ion trap, strong changes in the reactivity are observed depending on the compound's degree of oxidation. While the general reaction behavior is presented for species ranging from Ta2+ to Ta2O6+ based on experimental kinetic studies, we focus in more detail on the dehydrogenation reactions occurring on Ta2O2+ and the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) on Ta2O5+, for which density functional theory calculations were performed. In the first part, we elucidate the role of Ta&#8211;C&#8211;Ta bridging motifs in product structures as driving forces for the dehydrogenation of methane on Ta2O2+; in the second part, we investigate the origins of the HAT &#8211; a hitherto unknown reaction scheme for binary tantalum oxides. For the latter, we show that the reactivity originates from the spin density on oxygen atoms, which is a typical characteristic of the reaction on other metal oxides. This reflects a change in the reactivity from oxidized metallic systems to metal oxides and demonstrates that chemical modifications of tantalum compounds can achieve different methane activation schemes.

         <title>Combination of Arsines and Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane Toward Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically investigates the reactivity of arsine&#8211;borane Lewis pairs, which had not been explored previously. Using tertiary arsines with different steric and electronic properties, the formation of classical Lewis adducts, FLP&#8208;type encounter complexes, and arsonium borate adducts with B(C6F5)3 was demonstrated. Their reactivity toward small molecules and detailed structural characterization were also reported.








Abstract
Various combinations of Lewis acids and bases, particularly frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), have been investigated for their distinctive reactivities. Nevertheless, to date, no systematic study of arsine&#8211;borane Lewis pairs has been reported. In this study, tertiary arsines with different degrees of steric hindrance and electron&#8208;donating abilities were used. Depending on their steric and electronic properties, arsines form classical Lewis adducts, FLPs, or arsonium borate adducts with tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (B(C6F5)3). Experimental and computational analyzes revealed that trimesitylarsine and B(C6F5)3 form an encounter complex in solution, which is referred to as an FLP adduct. Furthermore, the arsine&#8211;borane pairs react with phenylacetylene and diphenyl disulfide to afford the corresponding arsonium borate adduct and thioarsonium thioborate salt, respectively. The structures of the products were characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Oxidative Thiolated Aromatization of Terpenes for Divergent Construction of Organosulfur Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent and divergent strategy has been developed for the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing terpenoid derivatives using various terpenes with different oxidation states. It is expected that this protocol may be of broad interest in chemistry community pursuing the transformation of terpenes and constitutes a practical alternative to the synthesis of natural products and pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Synthetic transformation of terpenoids represents a long&#8208;standing research topic in organic synthesis. Due to the presence of multiple oxidation states and isomers in naturally abundant terpenoids, their separation and efficient utilization pose challenges. Convergent transformations of various terpenes can circumvent these issues. We herein developed a convergent and divergent strategy for control of oxidation states, enabling the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing terpenoid derivatives using various terpenes. This protocol features broad substrate scope, good functional compatibility, and high redox&#8208;selectivity. Convergent synthesis strategy was implemented smoothly by using drug and plant extracts. The synthesis of sulfoxide and sulfone products was further achieved by modulating the oxidation conditions, respectively. Additionally, the products can undergo an array of elaborate transformations, which highlight the potential applications of this strategy.

         <title>QM/MM Unlocks The Catalytic Mechanism of YtfE: The Structural Reorganization of The Active Site Enables Nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM simulations reveal that the structural reorganization of the active site, particularly the alternation of the hydrogen bonding network and coordination switch of the HONO intermediate, is critical for the reductive cleavage of the N&#9472;O bond and NO formation in the nonheme diiron YtfE. This mechanistic insight advances understanding of nitrite reduction in nonheme diiron oxygenases and their biological roles.








Abstract
Escherichia coli (E. coli) repair of iron center protein (also known as YtfE) is a nonheme diiron protein that plays a pivotal role in bacterial responses to nitrosative stress, particularly in nitrite reduction and nitric oxide metabolism. Although previous studies have explored its potential as a nitrite reductase, the detailed catalytic mechanism, especially the role of its diiron center in nitrite reduction, remains poorly understood. In this study, we employed multiscale computational approaches, including quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics metadynamics (QM/MM MD), and quantum mechanics (QM) calculations, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of nitrite reduction by YtfE. Our findings reveal that structural reorganization of the active site, particularly the alternation of the hydrogen bonding network and coordination switch of the HONO intermediate, is critical for modulating the nitrite reduction mechanism. This work provides significant insights into the catalytic mechanism of YtfE, offering a theoretical foundation for understanding its role in bacterial stress responses and potential applications in synthetic biology and environmental remediation.
