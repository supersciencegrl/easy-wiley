         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced In Situ Generation of Br&#248;nsted Acid for Catalytic Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photo&#8208;induced indole 2&#8208;alkylation reaction was developed with unactivated stereo&#8208;congested alkenes used as the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reagent. The neutral, traceless and inexpensive perfluoroalkyl iodide C4F9I was used as the radical initiator in catalytic amount under irradiation by a blue LED light. Br&#248;nsted acids are in situ generated from the radical transfer reactions between the indole substrates and the perfluoroiodide catalyst. A variety of 2&#8208;branched alkylated indole molecules could be obtained from this approach in generally good efficiencies, with a broad scope of functional groups well tolerated. Mechanistic studies via both experimental and computational methods indicate that the reaction was accelerated by the protons generated from the crack of the indole&#8208;derived radical cation species.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Hinges by Fusion of Pyrrole and Dithiin: Synthesis, Structure, Redox Chemistry and Host&#8208;guest Complexation of Dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of novel hinge&#8208;like molecules, namely dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins (PDs), were prepared and fully characterized by NMR, UV/vis, cyclic voltammogram, ESR, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The lateral fusion of pyrroles with 1,4&#8208;dithiins has led to not only retained key features of a dithiin, but also enhanced redox&#8208;activity with increased susceptibility to radical cations via redox or chemical oxidation. Stabilization of their radicals are observed for the N,N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl or N,N&#8208;triphenylmethyl PD as evidenced by ESR measurements. DFT calculations and SCXRD analysis revealed PD s are extremely flexible with adaptive molecular geometries that can be mechanically regulated via crystal packing or host&#8208;guest complexation. The excellent donor nature of PD s renders inclusion complexes with the cyclophane bluebox (cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene)), featuring association constants up to 104 M&#8210;1. Additionally, a planarized transition intermediate associated with inversion dynamics of a PD has been preserved in the pseudorotaxane structure with assistances of &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and S&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. The hinged structure, excellent redox&#8208;activity, and adaptive nature of PDs could further enable accesses to exotic redox switchable host&#8208;guest chemistry and functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>BODIPY&#8208;perylene Charge Transfer Compounds: Sensitizers for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation up&#8208;conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BODIPY heterochromophores asymmetrically substituted with perylene and/or iodine at the 2 and 6 positions were prepared and investigated as sensitizers for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation up conversion (TTA&#8208;UC). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses show that the torsion angle between BODIPY and perylene units lie between 73.54 and 74.51, but they are not orthogonal.&#160; Both compounds show intense, charge transfer absorption and emission profiles, confirmed by resonance Raman spectroscopy and consistent with DFT calculations. The emission quantum yield was solvent dependent but emission profile remained characteristic of CT transition across all solvents explored. Both BODIPY derivatives were found to be effective sensitizers of TTA&#8208;UC with perylene annihilator in dioxane and DMSO.&#160; Intense anti&#8208;Stokes emission was observed, and visible by eye from these solvents. Conversely, no TTA&#8208;UC was observed from the other solvents explored, including from non&#8208;polar solvents such as toluene and hexane that yielded brightest fluorescence from the BODIPY derivatives. In dioxane, the power density plots obtained were strongly consistent with TTA&#8208;UC and the power density threshold, the Ith value ( the photon flux at which 50% of &#934;TTAUC is achieved), for B2PI was observed to be 2.5x lower than of B2P under optimal conditions, an effect ascribed to the combined influence of spin&#8211;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) and heavy metal &#160;on the triplet state formation for B2PI.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC&#8208;stabilised parent Tripentelyltrielanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A missing family of the extremely air sensitive tripentelyltrielanes was discovered. Their stabilisation was achieved by using the bulky NHC IDipp (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). The tripentelylgallanes and tripentelylalanes IDipp &#8729; Ga(PH2)3 (1a), IDipp &#8729; Ga(AsH2)3 (1b), IDipp &#8729; Al(PH2)3 (2a) and IDipp &#8729; Al(AsH2)3 (2b) were synthesised by salt metathesis of IDipp &#8729; ECl3 (E = Al, Ga, In) with alkali metal pnictogenides such as NaPH2/LiPH2 &#8729; DME and KAsH2, respectively. Moreover, the detection of the first NHC&#8208;stabilised tripentelylindiumane IDipp &#8729; In(PH2)3 (3) was possible by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. Initial investigations of the coordination ability of these compounds resulted in the successful isolation of the coordination compound [IDipp &#8729; Ga(PH2)2(&#181;3&#8208;PH2{HgC6F4}3)] (4) by reaction of 1a with (HgC6F4)3. The compounds were characterised by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Supporting computational studies highlight the electronic features of the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Coupling of Chlorosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article summarizes the progress of the reductive coupling of chlorosilanes by nickel catalysis. This method enables cheap, stable, and readily available carbon and silicon reagents to be coupled, offering a mild and high functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerance route to synthesize organosilanes.







Abstract
Organosilanes play essential roles in many important research areas. The use of readily available chlorosilanes to catalytically access these compounds is synthetically appealing but remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction has recently emerged as a promising protocol to arrive at this goal. This strategy allows the chlorosilanes to be coupled with various carbon electrophiles under mild conditions. These reactions afford organosilanes with improved molecular diversity, structural complexity, and functional group compatibility. This Concept article summarizes the recent advance on nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive C&#8722;Si couplings of chlorosilanes.

Peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene is used as a functional scaffold to engineer a molecular semiconductor, the properties of which can be tailored by editing the oxidation state of the S&#8208;atoms. Oxidation with H2O2 led to the relevant sulfoxide and sulfone congeners, whereas electrooxidation yields sulfonium&#8208;type derivatives forming crystalline mixed valence complexes.







Abstract
Peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene, an S&#8208;doped analog of peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene, is used as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) scaffold to tune the molecular semiconductor properties by editing the oxidation state of the S&#8208;atoms. Chemical oxidation of peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene with H2O2 led to the relevant sulfoxide and sulfone congeners, whereas electrooxidation gave access to sulfonium&#8208;type derivatives forming crystalline mixed valence (MV) complexes. These complexes depicted peculiar molecular and solid&#8208;state arrangements with face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking organization. Photophysical studies showed a widening of the optical bandgap upon progressive oxidation of the S&#8208;atoms, with the bis&#8208;sulfone derivative displaying the largest value (E00=2.99&#8197;eV). While peri&#8208;thiaxanthenothiaxanthene showed reversible oxidation properties, the sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives mainly showed reductive events, corroborating their n&#8208;type properties. Electric measurements of single crystals of the MV complexes exhibited a semiconducting behavior with a remarkably high conductivity at room temperature (10&#8722;1&#8211;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 10&#8722;2&#8211;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for the O and S derivatives, respectively), one of the highest reported so far. Finally, the electroluminescence properties of the complexes were tested in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), obtaining the first S&#8208;doped mid&#8208;emitting PAH&#8208;based LECs.

         <title>Clearing an ESKAPE Pathogen in a Model Organism; A Polypyridyl Ruthenium(II) Complex Theranostic that Treats a Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Infection in Galleria mellonella</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear polypyridyl RuII complex is highly active against the ESKAPE pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With a single dose it can be used to both directly monitor, and completely clear, infections caused by an AMR strain of A baumannii that proves to be highly virulent in the Galleria mellonella larva model when left untreated.







Abstract
In previous studies we have described the therapeutic action of luminescent dinuclear ruthenium(II) complexes based on the tetrapyridylphenazine, tpphz, bridging ligand on pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Herein, the antimicrobial activity of the complex against pernicious Gram&#8208;negative ESKAPE pathogenic strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB12, AB16, AB184 and AB210) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA2017, PA_ 007_ IMP and PA_ 004_ CRCN) are reported. Estimated minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the complexes revealed the complex shows potent activity against all A. baumannii strains, in both glucose defined minimal media and standard nutrient rich Mueller&#8208;Hinton&#8208;II. Although the activity was lower in P. aureginosa, a moderately high potency was observed and retained in carbapenem&#8208;resistant strains. Optical microscopy showed that the compound is rapidly internalized by A. baumannii. As previous reports had revealed the complex exhibited no toxicity in Galleria Mellonella up to concentrations of 80&#8197;mg/kg, the ability to clear pathogenic infection within this model was explored. The pathogenic concentrations to the larvae for each bacterium were determined to be&#8805;105 for AB184 and&#8805;103 CFU/mL for PA2017. It was found a single dose of the compound totally cleared a pathogenic A. baumannii infection from all treated G. mellonella within 96&#8197;h. Uniquely, in these conditions thanks to the imaging properties of the complex the clearance of the bacteria within the hemolymph of G. mellonella could be directly visualized through both optical and transmission electron microscopy.

A riot of color: We have developed eight D&#8208;D&#8208;A type carbazole derivatives capable of exhibiting full&#8208;color solid&#8208;state emission. Notably, this is the first time that a dicyano&#8208;functionalized triphenylamine&#8208;modified carbazole derivative has not only displayed noteworthy aggregation&#8208;induced near&#8208;infrared emission, but also achieved the rare red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared mechano&#8208;fluorochromism with high contrast beyond 100&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the red&#8208;emissive luminophore has potential applications in cell imaging and photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The preparation of multifunctionalized luminophores with full&#8208;color emission based on an identical core skeleton is a significative but challenging research topic. In this work, eight donor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;D&#8208;A)&#8208;type luminogens based on a central carbazole core bearing a C6 hydrocarbon chain were designed by using different kinds of donor and acceptor units on the left and right, and synthesized in good yields. These D&#8208;D&#8208;A carbazole derivatives display deep&#8208;blue, sky&#8208;blue, cyan, green, yellow&#8208;green, yellow, orange and red fluorescence in the solid state, achieving full&#8208;color emission covering the whole visible light range under UV light illumination. Notably, the dicyano&#8208;functionalized triphenylamine&#8208;containing carbazole derivative exhibits rare aggregation&#8208;induced near&#8208;infrared emission and red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared mechano&#8208;fluorochromism with high contrast beyond 100&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the red&#8208;emissive luminogen can serve as a potential candidate for cell imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). This work not only provides reference for the construction of full&#8208;color emissive systems but also opens a new avenue to the preparation of multifunctionalized luminophores capable of simultaneous application in near&#8208;Infrared mechanical&#8208;force sensors and PDT fields.

         <title>Synthesis and Single&#8208;Electron Oxidation of Bulky Bis(m&#8208;terphenyl)chalcogenides: The Quest for Kinetically Stabilized Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first kinetically stabilized diaryltelluride radical cation [(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te][B(C6F5)4] was obtained by electrochemical and chemical oxidation of the neutral parent telluride (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te.







Abstract
Sterically encumbered bis(m&#8208;terphenyl)chalcogenides, (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2E (E=S, Se, Te) were obtained by the reaction of the chalcogen tetrafluorides, EF4, with three equivalents of m&#8208;terphenyl lithium, 2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3Li. The single&#8208;electron oxidation of (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te using XeF2/K[B(C6F5)4] afforded the radical cation [(2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2Te][B(C6F5)4] that was isolated and fully characterized. The electrochemical oxidation of the lighter homologs (2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3)2E (E=S, Se) was irreversible and impaired by rapid decomposition.

On&#8208;DNA! Aspartic acid&#8208;derived Wittig ylides were generated onto DNA and have been validated for Wittig olefination with various aldehydes to develop on&#8208;DNA 
,
&#8208;unsaturated peptidomimetics. These were further converted into heterocyclic core&#8208;containing peptidomimetics through diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis (DOS).







Abstract
The DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology represents a revolutionary drug&#8208;discovery tool with unprecedented screening power originating from the association of combinatorial chemistry and DNA barcoding. The chemical diversity of DELs and its chemical space will be further expanded as new DNA&#8208;compatible reactions are introduced. This work introduces the use of DOS in the context of on&#8208;DNA peptidomimetics. Wittig olefination of aspartic acid&#8208;derived on&#8208;DNA Wittig ylide, combined with a broad substrate scope of aldehydes, led to formation of on&#8208;DNA 
,
&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The synthesis of on&#8208;DNA multi&#8208;peptidyl&#8208;ylides was performed by incorporating sequential amino acids onto a monomeric ylide. Di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrameric peptidyl&#8208;ylides were validated for Wittig olefination and led to on&#8208;DNA 
,
&#8208;unsaturated&#8208;based peptidomimetics, an important class of intermediates. One on&#8208;DNA aryl Wittig ylide was also developed and applied to Wittig olefination for synthesis of on&#8208;DNA chalcone&#8208;based molecules. Furthermore, DOS was used successfully with electron&#8208;deficient peptidomimetics and led to the development of different heterocyclic cores containing on&#8208;DNA peptidomimetics.

         <title>Heteropoly Blue/Carbon Nanotubes Nanocomposites as High&#8208;Performance Photothermal Conversion Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of heteropoly blue and carbon nanotubes (HPB/CNTs) are synthesized depending on electrostatic interactions by facile microwave sonication and freeze&#8208;drying. The doped CNTs can dramatically improve the spectral absorption performance of HPB ontology in the infrared region. The HPB/CNTs (20&#8201;%) shows promising prospects in the applications of solar desalination and wastewater treatment.







Abstract
To realize the direct and full use of the widely distributed solar energy, developing novel materials with superb photothermal conversion capability is essential. Although heteropoly blue has intrinsic outstanding solar absorption and photothermal conversion properties, its spectral absorption in the infrared region is weak. Here, composites of heteropoly blue and carbon nanotubes (HPB/CNTs) are synthesized depending on electrostatic interactions by facile microwave sonication and freeze&#8208;drying. The doped CNTs can dramatically improve the spectral absorption performance of HPB ontology in the infrared region. As a result, the light absorption of the optimized HPB/CNTs (20&#8201;%) reaches more than 95&#8201;% in the range of 200&#8211;2400&#8197;nm, showing promising prospects as high&#8208;performance photothermal conversion material in the applications of solar desalination and wastewater treatment.

         <title>Selective Separation of Hazardous Chemicals from Vapor Phase by an Easily Accessible Breathing Coordination Polymer Derived from Terpyridyl/terephthalate Mixed Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>

A Zn(II)&#8208;terpyridine based mixed ligand coordination polymer has been designed and synthesized that displayed remarkable ability to breath in response to vapours of a large variety of guests in selective manner.







Abstract
Coordination polymers are extensively studied materials because of their various potential applications. Amongst them, breathing coordination polymers that are capable of exchanging lattice occluded guest molecules with other guests via single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8211;SC) fashion are particularly intriguing. Herein, we disclose an easily accessible breathing coordination polymer namely DMF@Zn&#8208;CP capable of exchanging as many as 23 guest molecules of various kinds in SC&#8211;SC fashion when the crystals of the coordination polymer were exposed to the corresponding vapor of the guests. Selectivity experiments revealed that it was also capable of separating selectively hazardous chemicals such as dichloro&#8208;methane, benzene and fluorobenzene from the corresponding complex mixture of vapors of halomethanes, aromatic hydrocarbons and halobenzenes. The breathing coordination polymer could also be exploited as drug delivery vehicle; slow and sustained release of anti&#8208;bacterial agents (benzyl alcohol/phenethyl amine) as guests against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria was evident in zone inhibition assays. A mixed ligand strategy wherein a nitrile containing terpyridyl ligand (L) and terephthalate (TA) co&#8208;ligand were reacted with Co(II)/Ni(II)/Zn(II) nitrate salts was adopted herein. Three coordination polymers namely MeOH@Co&#8208;CP, DMF/H2O@Ni&#8208;CP and DMF@Zn&#8208;CP were isolated and characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Studies revealed that only DMF@Zn&#8208;CP possessed the ability to breath in response to the vapors of the guests as stimuli.

         <title>The Effect of Mesogenic Coronas on the Type and Anisotropy of Gold Nanoparticle Superlattices: When Can the Tail Wag the Dog?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticles coated with forked rod&#8208;like bimesogen ligands formed two close&#8208;packed 3D lattices, HCP and FCC. The former had partially oriented nematic&#8208;like mesogens. Geometric analysis of these and other superlattice structures produced rules to help design nanoparticle coronas giving rise to desired isotropic and anisotropic plasmonic superlattices.







Abstract
The correlation between the size of nanoparticles, the structure and shape of mesogenic ligands and the ensuing assembly behaviour is not really understood. Closer inspection shows very surprising features. Here, 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;nm gold nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized, and grafted with a forked ligand containing two rod&#8208;like mesogens in its branches: one cholesterol, the other with azobenzene. The 4&#8208;nm NPs also contained n&#8208;hexylthiol as co&#8208;ligand. They were found to form a FCC cubic superlattice, whereas the 2&#8208;nm NPs form hexagonal HCP with weak birefringence, hence with partially oriented ligands. The structures were compared with those of related systems containing a range of different azobenzene&#8208;to&#8208;cholesterol ratios, all giving body&#8208;centred tetragonal superlattices with various degrees of anisotropy. Geometric analysis is presented in terms of the asphericity of the NPs&#8217; surroundings, requirement for space&#8208;filling and structural anisotropy. Some general rules are derived to help design the soft corona around the NPs in order to obtain superlattices with the desired structure and anisotropy.

Per&#8208;O&#8208;acetylated unnatural sugars have been widely used in metabolic glycan labeling (MGL), but they can induce non&#8208;enzymatic S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification. Here we develop facile synthetic routes for unprotected clickable unnatural sugars and their 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylated counterparts at the ten&#8208;gram scale, the latter enables MGL with high efficiency while avoiding the non&#8208;specific S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification







Abstract
Clickable unnatural sugars have been widely used in studying glycosylation in living systems via the metabolic glycan labelling (MGL) strategy. Partial protection of unnatural sugars by 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylation increases the labelling efficiency while avoiding the non&#8208;specific S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a series of clickable unnatural sugars in both the unprotected and 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylated forms at the ten&#8208;gram scale. By evaluation of the labelling specificity, efficiency, and biocompatibility of various 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;acylated sugars for MGL in cell lines and living mice, we demonstrate that 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;propionylated unnatural sugars are optimal chemical reporters for glycan labelling. The synthetic routes developed in this work should facilitate the widespread use of MGL with no artificial S&#8208;glyco&#8208;modification for investigating the functional roles of glycans.

         <title>Concertedness and Activation Energy Control by Distal Methyl Group during Ring Contraction/Expansion in Scalarane&#8208;Type Sesterterpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations revealed that the distal methyl group controls both concertedness and energy barrier during the skeletal rearrangement reaction involved in scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoid biosynthesis. Furthermore, the unique skeletal rearrangement&#8216;s protonation process, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity were elucidated.







Abstract
Salmahyritisol A, similan A, and hippospongide A, which are scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoids, feature 6/6/5/7/5 pentacyclic skeletons. Although their biosyntheses have been previously proposed to involve a unique skeletal rearrangement reaction, the detailed reaction mechanism remains unclear as none of the corresponding biosynthetic enzymes for this reaction have been reported. Herein, this skeletal rearrangement reaction was investigated using computational techniques, which revealed the following four key features: (i) the distal 24&#8208;Me substituent controls both the concertedness and activation energy of this transformation, (ii) enzymes are not responsible for the observed regioselectivity of C12&#8722;C20 bond formation, (iii) stereoselectivity is enzyme&#8208;regulated, and (iv) protonation is a key step in this skeletal rearrangement process. These new findings provide insight into the C&#8208;ring&#8208;contraction and D&#8208;ring&#8208;expansion mechanisms in scalarane&#8208;type sesterterpenoid biosyntheses.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Binding of an NIR Emitting Osmium Polypyridyl Probe Revealed by Solution NMR and Time&#8208;Resolved Infrared Studies</title>

Luminescent enhancement of an enantiopure Os polypyridyl probe containing an extended dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine (dppz) ligand in the presence of human telomer (hTel) and cMYC guanine quadruplexes (G4&#8197;s) is reported. NMR studies indicate the role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions at the 5&#8217;&#8208;quartet end, which is supported by time&#8208;resolved infrared measurements. Importantly, the combined measurements indicate the sensitivity of luminescent enhancement to the particular orientation at the 5&#8217;&#8208;quartet binding site.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes are emerging targets in cancer research and understanding how diagnostic probes bind to DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes in solution is critical to the development of new molecular tools. In this study the binding of an enantiopure NIR emitting [Os(TAP)2(dppz)]2+ complex to different G&#8208;quadruplex structures formed by human telomer (hTel) and cMYC sequences in solution is reported. The combination of NMR and time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopic techniques reveals the sensitivity of the emission response to subtle changes in the binding environment of the complex. Similar behaviour is also observed for the related complex [Os(TAP)2(dppp2)]2+ upon quadruplex binding.

         <title>Influence of Triptycene Annulation on the Photochromism of Diphenylnaphthopyrans: Entropic Control of Thermal Reversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entropically&#8208;controlled photochromism: The proximal and distal annulation of naphthopyran with rigid triptycene leads to regioisomeric naphthopyrans, which display highly divergent photochromic behaviors. The proximate isomer is so strained that its photogenerated colored open form enjoys more freedom to resist back cyclization. This constitutes the first example of entropically&#8208;controlled photochromism for the celebrated class of naphthopyrans.







Abstract
Regioisomeric naphthopyrans annulated with triptycene, i.&#8201;e., Prox&#8208;NP and Dist&#8208;NP, display divergent photochromic behaviors. While steady&#8208;state photolysis of Dist&#8208;NP led to a very labile colored intermediate that is not observable at room temperature, Prox&#8208;NP yielded a remarkably stable species characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography as the TT isomer of o&#8208;quinonoid intermediate (Prox&#8208;NPQ) with t1/2 ca. 0.18&#8197;years at 298&#8197;K. The kinetic analysis of thermal reversion reveals that the bleaching of Prox&#8208;NPQ is entropically controlled; the steric effect due to the rigid triptycene scaffold renders Prox&#8208;NP a highly constrained system such that the photogenerated colored o&#8208;quinonoid form is more entropically relaxed. This constitutes the first instance of an entropically&#8208;controlled thermal reversion for the celebrated class of photochromic naphthopyrans. Based on the response of Prox&#8208;NP and its colored intermediate Prox&#8208;NPQ to different stimuli, namely, light, heat, and acid, the molecular system can be likened to a logic gate with the &#8216;INHIBIT&#8217; function.

The addition of Si alters the mass diffusion in the oxide scale of the Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 at 1000&#8201;&#176;C, which facilitates the diffusion of Ti, Al, as well as O atoms, thus impacting the structure of the oxide scale and its oxidation resistance.







Abstract
In this work, Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 (x=0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6) with Al/Si solid solution structure are synthesized, and the effects of Si on their oxidation behaviors at 1000&#8201;&#176;C are evaluated. The addition of Si not only contributes to the formation of Ti5Si3 impurity but also affects the composition of the oxide scale. Particularly, the incorporation of Si in the TiO2 lattice is demonstrated, which alters the formation energy of the (110) plane in TiO2, thus leading to the preferential growth of Si&#8208;doped TiO2 to dendritic congeries. Moreover, the Si addition is believed to affect mass transportation during the oxidation process, which accelerates the formation of a continuous Al2O3 layer in the oxide scale. With an optimized Si content, the oxidation of Ti3Al1&#8722;xSixC2 is restrained. However, with excess Si content, the continuity of the resulting Al2O3 layer is destroyed, thus the oxidation rate rises again.

         <title>Synthesis and Crystal Structure of a New RTH&#8208;Type Precursor and Its Interlayer Expanded Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new RTH layer zeolite L was synthesized and converted into RTH topology upon calcination. The IEZ&#8208;RTH zeolite was formed by modification with the silylation agent diethoxydimethylsilane under acidic conditions. The new zeolites have a large specific surface area of 552&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 188&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Two dimensional zeolites have drawn a lot of attention due to their structural diversity and chemical composition, which can be used to obtain 3D zeolites, for which there is no direct synthesis. Here, a new layer silicate zeolite L was synthesized using the N, N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;(2&#8208;methyl)&#8208;benzimidazolium as the organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) in the presence of fluoride. Structure determination by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the pure silica precursor with five&#8208;ring pores in the crystalline sheets is composed of the rth layer stacking along the (001) direction in an &#8230;AAAA&#8230; sequence with SDA+ cations and F&#8722; residing within the interlayer spaces. Variable temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) results showed that the new layer could transform into a 3D RTH topology structure at 350&#8201;&#176;C via 2D&#8208;3D topotactic transformation. Furthermore, a new 3D zeolite material is obtained by treating the original layer with a diethoxydimethylsilane agent under hydrochloric acid condition (HCl&#8722;DEDMS). Based on the PXRD results and the original layer structure, the new 3D zeolite structure expanding the rth layer with another Si atom is constructed, which possesses a 10&#215;8&#215;6 channel system. It displays a high BET surface area of 188&#8197;cm3/g with an external surface area of 130&#8197;cm3/g. The structure and textural properties pave a way for potential catalytic applications. The research not only provides a new layered zeolite, broadening the 2D zeolite framework types, but also allows for the discovery of a new stable 3D zeolite expanding the RTH structure with Si atom, which hasn't been reported yet.

         <title>TEMPO&#8208;Modified Polymethacrylates as Mediators in Electrosynthesis: Influence of the Molecular Weight on Redox Properties and Electrocatalytic Activity</title>

The polymeric electrosynthesis mediators: Polymediators are soluble redox&#8208;active polymers applicable as catalysts in electrosynthesis. Their difference in size relative to typical product molecules enables recovery by dialysis or membrane filtration. Using anodic alcohol oxidation as an example, the relationship between the molecular weight of TEMPO&#8208;modified polymethacrylates and their catalytic properties was elaborated using cyclic voltammetry and preparative&#8208;scale electrolysis.







Abstract
Homogeneous catalysts (&#8220;mediators&#8221;) are frequently employed in organic electrosynthesis to control selectivity. Despite their advantages, they can have a negative influence on the overall energy and mass balance if used only once or recycled inefficiently. Polymediators are soluble redox&#8208;active polymers applicable as electrocatalysts, enabling recovery by dialysis or membrane filtration. Using anodic alcohol oxidation as an example, we have demonstrated that TEMPO&#8208;modified polymethacrylates (TPMA) can act as efficient and recyclable catalysts. In the present work, the influence of the molecular size on the redox properties and the catalytic activity was carefully elaborated using a series of TPMAs with well&#8208;defined molecular weight distributions. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the polymer chain length has a pronounced impact on the key&#8208;properties. Together with preparative&#8208;scale electrolysis experiments, an optimum size range was identified for polymediator&#8208;guided sustainable reaction control.

Appending functional groups to the exterior of Zn4L4 self&#8208;assembled cages allows gated control of anion binding. The external groups act as a &#8220;doorstop&#8221;, preventing ligand rotation and slowing the guest exchange rate. Bulky groups affect both anion egress and ingress, introducing an extra layer of selectivity to the exchange. Small changes can have large effects: affinities for anions as similar as PF6&#8722; and SbF6&#8722; can vary by as much as 400&#8208;fold between identically sized cavities.







Abstract
Appending functional groups to the exterior of Zn4L4 self&#8208;assembled cages allows gated control of anion binding. While the unfunctionalized cages contain aryl groups in the ligand that can freely rotate, attaching inert functional groups creates a &#8220;doorstop&#8221;, preventing rotation and slowing the guest exchange rate, even though the interiors of the host cavities are identically structured. The effects on anion exchange are subtle and depend on multiple factors, including anion size, the nature of the leaving anion, and the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and steric bulk of the pendant groups. Multiple exchange mechanisms occur, and the nature of the external groups controls associative and dissociative exchange processes: these bulky groups affect both anion egress and ingress, introducing an extra layer of selectivity to the exchange. Small changes can have large effects: affinities for anions as similar as PF6&#8722; and SbF6&#8722; can vary by as much as 400&#8208;fold between identically sized cavities.

Square and planar, but novel and explosive: Cation&#8208;poor Ba[Au(N3)4]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8201;H2O forms transparent, dark orange crystals. The highly sensitive compound contains tetraazidoaurate(III) anions with a novel geometry and gold in square&#8208;planar coordination around nitrogen. Extensive vibrational spectroscopic investigations confirm both the anion geometry and the existence of hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Transparent, dark orange Ba[Au(N3)4]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8201;H2O was synthesized by reaction of Ba(N3)2 and AuCl3 or HAuCl4 in aqueous solution. The novel barium tetraazidoaurate(III) tetrahydrate crystallizes in the monoclinic space group&#8197;Cc (no.&#8197;9) with a=1813.68(17)&#8197;pm, b=1737.95(11)&#8197;pm, c=682.04(8)&#8197;pm and &#946;=108.849(4)&#176;. The predominant structural features of Ba[Au(N3)4]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4&#8201;H2O are two crystallographically independent discrete anions [Au(N3)4]&#8722; with gold in a tetragonal planar coordination by nitrogen. Vibrational spectra show good agreement with those of other azidoaurates(III). Upon drying, this salt was shown to be a highly explosive material.

         <title>N&#8208;Fluoroalkylated Morpholinos &#8211; a New Class of Nucleoside Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of N&#8208;fluoroalkylated morpholino nucleoside derivatives is reported. The procedures were based either on a double reductive amination&#8208;cyclisation reaction, using commercially available mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trifluoralkylated amines, or on post&#8208;cyclisation trifluoromethylation of the morpholino nitrogen, by oxidative desulfurization&#8208;fluorination with NBS and diethylaminosulfur trifluoride.







Abstract
The first concise and efficient synthesis of some fluorine&#8208;containing morpholino nucleosides has been developed. One synthetic strategy was based on the oxidative ring cleavage of the vicinal diol unit of uridine, cytidine adenosine and guanosine derivatives, followed by cyclisation of the dialdehyde intermediates by double reductive amination with fluorinated primary amines to obtain various N&#8208;fluoroalkylated morpholinos. Another approach involved cyclisation of the diformyl intermediates with ammonia source, followed by dithiocarbamate formation and desulfurization&#8208;fluorination with diethylaminosulfur trifluoride yielding the corresponding morpholine&#8208;based nucleoside analogues with a N&#8208;CF3 element in their structure.

         <title>Aromatic 1,2&#8208;Azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yls as Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Anionic Nitrogen Ligands for Main Group Elements</title>

N&#8208;protonated, N&#8208;lithiated and N&#8208;stannylated 1,2&#8208;azaborinines provide versatile platforms for the synthesis of new group 1&#8211;2 and 13&#8211;15 derivatives of the 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yl ligand. NMR&#8208;spectroscopic, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational analyses show that the aromatic 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yl ligand is a purely electron&#8208;withdrawing N&#8208;ligand lacking &#960;&#8208;donor ability.







Abstract
The 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinines 1&#8208;EMe3 and 2&#8208;EMe3 (E=Si, Sn; aryl=Ph (1), Mes (=2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl, 2)) were synthesized by ring&#8208;expansion of borole precursors with N3EMe3&#8208;derived nitrenes. Desilylative hydrolysis of 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;SiMe3 yielded the corresponding N&#8208;protonated azaborinines, which were deprotonated with nBuLi or MN(SiMe3)2 (M=Na, K) to the corresponding group 1 salts, 1&#8208;M and 2&#8208;M. While the lithium salts crystallized as monomeric Lewis base adducts, the potassium salts formed coordination polymers or oligomers via intramolecular K&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;aryl &#960; interactions. The reaction of 1&#8208;M or 2&#8208;M with CO2 yielded N&#8208;carboxylate salts, which were derivatized by salt metathesis to methyl and silyl esters. Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;M or 2&#8208;M with methyl triflate, [Cp*BeCl] (Cp*=C5Me5), BBr2Ar (Ar=Ph, Mes, 2&#8208;thienyl), ECl3 (E=B, Al, Ga) and PX3 (X=Cl, Br) afforded the respective group 2, 13 and 15 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;2&#8208;yl complexes. Salt metathesis of 1&#8208;K with BBr3 resulted not only in N&#8208;borylation but also Ph&#8208;Br exchange between the endocyclic and exocyclic boron atoms. Solution 11B&#8197;NMR data suggest that the 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;2&#8208;yl ligand is similarly electron&#8208;withdrawing to a bromide. In the solid state the endocyclic bond length alternation and the twisting of the C4BN ring increase with the sterics of the substituents at the boron and nitrogen atoms, respectively. Regression analyses revealed that the downfield shift of the endocyclic 11B&#8197;NMR resonances is linearly correlated to both the degree of twisting of the C4BN ring and the tilt angle of the N&#8208;substituent. Calculations indicate that the 1,2&#8208;azaborinin&#8208;1&#8208;yl ligand has no sizeable &#960;&#8208;donor ability and that the aromaticity of the ring can be subtly tuned by the electronics of the N&#8208;substituent.

         <title>Fluorescent Nanoassemblies in Water Exhibiting Tunable LCST Behavior and Responsive Light Harvesting Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic monomer, CSO, was synthesized which contains a hydrophobic cyanostilbene core flanked by two hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) tails. The CSO molecule can self&#8208;assemble into nanoaggregates in water with blue fluorescence and LCST behavior. These nanoassemblies also exhibit thermo&#8208;responsive fluorescence and were further used to construct a responsive light harvesting system.







Abstract
Responsive fluorescent nanomaterials have been received considerable attention in recent years. In this work, a bola&#8208;type amphiphilic molecule, CSO, was synthesized which contains a hydrophobic cyanostilbene core and hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) coils at both sides. The cyanostilbene group is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active, while the OEG coils are thermo&#8208;responsive. As a result, the CSO molecules can self&#8208;assemble into blue&#8208;fluorescent nanoassemblies with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior in aqueous media. It is noteworthy that the LCST behavior can be reversibly regulated with changes in concentration and the introduction of K+. Intriguingly, fluorescence of CSO assembly shows a blue&#8208;shift upon heating. Finally, by employing CSO as a light capturing antenna and energy donor, an artificial light harvesting system with tunable emission and thermo&#8208;responsive characteristics was fabricated. This study not only demonstrates an integrated approach to create responsive fluorescent nanomaterials, but also shows great potential for producing luminescent materials and mimicking photosynthesis in nature.

Intriguingly, fluorescence of &lt;b&gt;CSO&lt;/b&gt; assembly shows a blue-shift upon heating. Finally, by employing &lt;b&gt;CSO&lt;/b&gt; as a light capturing antenna and energy donor, an artificial light harvesting system with tunable emission and thermo-responsive characteristics was fabricated. This study not only demonstrates an integrated approach to create responsive fluorescent nanomaterials, but also shows great potential for producing luminescent materials and mimicking photosynthesis in nature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MOF&#8208;derived NiCo&#8208;LDH Nanocages on CuO Nanorod Arrays for Robust and High Energy Density Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH heterostructure has been constructed through a facile MOF&#8208;engaged strategy, and it exhibits significantly boosted electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is widely explored in supercapacitors on account of its high capacity, adjustable composition and easy synthesis process. Unfortunately, solitary LDH still has great limitations as an electrode material due to its shortcomings, such as poor conductivity and easy agglomeration. Herein, nanoflakes assembled NiCo&#8208;LDH hollow nanocages derived from a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) precursor are strung by CuO nanorods formed from etching and oxidation of copper foam (CF), forming hierarchical CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH heterostructures. The as&#8208;synthesized CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF shows a large capacitance (5607&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), superior rate performance (88.3&#8201;% retention at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and impressive cycling durability (93.1&#8201;% capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles), which is significantly superior to control CuO/CF, CuO@ZIF&#8208;67/CF, NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF and Cu(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF electrodes. Besides, an asymmetrical supercapacitor consists of CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF and activated carbon displays a maximum energy density of 47.3&#8197;Wh kg&#8722;1, and its capacitance only declines by 6.8&#8201;% after 10000 cycles, demonstrating remarkable cycling durability. The advantages of highly conductive and robust CuO nanorods, MOF&#8208;derived hollow structure and the core&#8208;shell heterostructure contribute to the outstanding electrochemical performance. This synthesis strategy can be extended to design various core&#8208;shell heterostructures adopted in versatile electrochemical energy storage applications.

         <title>Development of Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Organogelators from Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid: Effect of Stereochemistry and their Application on Visual Chiral Recognition of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low molecular weight organogelators derived from chiral cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acids were developed and the effect of their stereochemistry on gelation behavior was investigated. After characterization of the gelators and resultant xerogels, the prepared chiral gel was further applied to the visual chiral recognition of two enantiomers of amines.







Abstract
This study reports the formation of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators based on carboxylic acids derived from chiral cyclic&#946;&#8208;amino acids. The effect of their stereochemistry on the gelation of organic solvents was investigated, and their assemblies with the intermolecular interactions in the xerogels were proposed via infrared spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and crystallographic details of the related model compounds. The effect of the alkyl chain length on the gelators was studied, and they were applied to the chiral recognition of amines. Only one diastereomeric salt with amines afforded gels, whereas the others resulted in precipitates. Chiral recognition was also achieved in the gel state, and the appearance of the as&#8208;prepared gel changed upon the addition of each amine enantiomer, thus enabling the visual detection of their chirality.

         <title>Facile Formation of Stable Neutral Radicals and Cations from [22]Smaragdyrin BF2 Complexes</title>

meso&#8208;Trimesityl&#8208;substituted [20]smaragdyrin was synthesized in 63&#8201;% yield by TsOH&#8208;catalyzed reaction of 5&#8208;mesityldipyrromethane and 2,14&#8208;dibromotripyrrin. Treatment of [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and TEA gave a stable neutral radical, which was oxidized to stable [20]smaragdyrin antiaromatic cationwith AgSbF6. Reduction of the neutral radical with NaBH4 gave aromatic [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex, which was readily oxidized to the neutral radical and converted to thermodynamically stable [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex upon treatment with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and TEA. Similarly, [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex was oxidized to stable neutral radical and antiaromatic cation in a stepwise manner. As such, smaragdyrin BF2 complexes have been shown to be very intriguing, allowing for various electronic states including stable radicals and cations.







Abstract
meso&#8208;Trimesityl&#8208;substituted [20]smaragdyrin freebase was synthesized by p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid catalyzed reaction of 5&#8208;mesityldipyrromethane and 2,14&#8208;dibromodipyrrin in an improved yield of 63&#8201;%. Unexpectedly, treatment of the [20]smaragdyrin freebase with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and triethylamine (TEA) gave a stable radical species, in which the BF2 unit is coordinated at the tripyrrin site, probably by ready release of a hydrogen atom of a [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex. Similar treatment of [22]smaragdyrin free base produced another [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex, in which the BF2 unit is coordinated at the dipyrrin site. The tripyrrin site coordinated neutral radical was oxidized with AgSbF6 to give a stable antiaromatic cation; this was reduced with NaBH4 to its 22&#960; congener, which was easily oxidized back to the neutral radical in the air and rearranged to thermodynamically stable dipyrrin site coordinated [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex upon treatment with BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 and TEA. Further, the dipyrrin site coordinated [22]smaragdyrin BF2 complex was similarly oxidized to a stable neutral radical and a stable cation in a stepwise manner. This work demonstrates a rare ability of smaragdyrin BF2 complexes to exist in multiple redox states, particularly forming a stable neutral radical by facile release of a hydrogen atom.

Schematic illustration of &#945;&#8208;HER2M IgG modification in a 2&#8208;step approach using a redox&#8208;activated chemical tagging and an azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction.







Abstract
A highly effective 2&#8208;step system for site&#8208;specific antibody modification and conjugation of the monoclonal antibody Herceptin (commercially available under Trastuzumab) in a cysteine&#8208;independent manner was used to generate labelled antibodies for in vivo imaging. The first step contains redox&#8208;activated chemical tagging (ReACT) of thioethers via engineered methionine residues to introduce specific alkyne moieties, thereby offering a novel easy way to fundamentally change the process of antibody bioconjugation. The second step involves modification of the introduced alkyne via azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition &#8242;click&#8242; conjugation. The versatility of this 2&#8208;step approach is demonstrated here by the selective incorporation of a fluorescent dye but can also be applied to a wide variety of different conjugation partners depending on the desired application in a facile manner. Methionine&#8208;modified antibodies were characterised in vitro, and the diagnostic potential of the most promising variant was further analysed in an in vivo xenograft animal model using a fluorescence imaging modality. This study demonstrates how methionine&#8208;mediated antibody conjugation offers an orthogonal and versatile route to the generation of tailored antibody conjugates with in vivo applicability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly effective 2-step system for site-specific antibody modification and conjugation of the monoclonal antibody Herceptin (commercially available under Trastuzumab) in a cysteine-independent manner was used to generate labelled antibodies for in vivo imaging. The first step contains redox-activated chemical tagging (ReACT) of thioethers via engineered methionine residues to introduce specific alkyne moieties, thereby offering a novel easy way to fundamentally change the process of antibody bioconjugation. The second step involves modification of the introduced alkyne via azide-alkyne cycloaddition &#8242;click&#8242; conjugation. The versatility of this 2-step approach is demonstrated here by the selective incorporation of a fluorescent dye but can also be applied to a wide variety of different conjugation partners depending on the desired application in a facile manner. Methionine-modified antibodies were characterised in vitro, and the diagnostic potential of the most promising variant was further analysed in an in vivo xenograft animal model using a fluorescence imaging modality. This study demonstrates how methionine-mediated antibody conjugation offers an orthogonal and versatile route to the generation of tailored antibody conjugates with in vivo applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Characterization of Hypervalent Carbon Compounds Bearing 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;Ring Skeleton: Penta&#8208; versus Tetra&#8208;Coordinate Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypervalent penta&#8208;coordinate carbon compounds were characterized by gas&#8208;phase techniques, including photodissociation spectroscopy and ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry. For a compound with moderate electron&#8208;donating ligands bearing p&#8208;methylthiophenyl substituents, coexistence of penta&#8208; and tetra&#8208;coordinate forms was revealed, highlighting the significant effects of the environments on the stability of hypervalent carbons.







Abstract
In this study, we afford explicit characterizations of the electronic and geometrical structures of recently reported hypervalent penta&#8208;coordinate carbon compounds by using gas&#8208;phase characterization techniques: photodissociation spectroscopy (PDS) and ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8211;MS). In particular for a compound with moderately electron&#8208;donating ligands, bearing p&#8208;methylthiophenyl substituents, the coexistence of tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate isomers is confirmed, consistent with solution characterizations. It is in sharp contrast to the exclusive tetra&#8208;coordinate form (with normal valence of the central carbon atom) in the single crystal. This suggests that a non&#8208;polar environment makes the penta&#8208;coordinate structure thermodynamically most stable. This delicate difference between the tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate structures, which depends on the environment, is a close reflection of the lower activation barrier of the SN2 reaction found in neutral solvent or gas&#8208;phase reactions.

Gold nanoparticles are giants compared to the ligands grafted to their surfaces. The particles weigh several hundred kDa, an organic ligand just 1&#8197;kDa. Yet by designing the shape of these small ligands, particularly the length and number of their alkyl tails, they can direct the gold nanoparticles to assemble in a large variety of superlattices. In the Research Article by G.&#8197;H. Mehl, F. Liu, G. Ungar, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203673), it is shown by several examples and by detailed geometric analysis how the &#8220;tail can wag the dog&#8221;.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Hosts for Polysulfides Conversion and Lithium Plating/Stripping towards Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Full Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adopting one type of effective host with dual&#8208;functions including both inhibiting polysulfide dissolution and regulating Li plating/stripping, is recently an emerging research highlight in Li&#8722;S battery. This review focuses on such dual&#8208;functional hosts and systematically summarizes the recent research progress and application scenarios and several sound perspectives are also rationally proposed for fundamental research and practical development as guidelines.







Abstract
The practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is greatly hindered by the shuttle effect of dissolved polysulfides in the sulfur cathode and the severe dendritic growth in the lithium anode. Adopting one type of effective host with dual&#8208;functions including both inhibiting polysulfide dissolution and regulating Li plating/stripping, is recently an emerging research highlight in Li&#8722;S battery. This review focuses on such dual&#8208;functional hosts and systematically summarizes the recent research progress and application scenarios. Firstly, this review briefly describes the stubborn issues in Li&#8722;S battery operations and the sophisticated counter measurements over the challenges by dual&#8208;functional behaviors. Then, the latest advances on dual&#8208;functional hosts for both cathode and anode in Li&#8722;S full cells are catalogued as species, including metal chalcogenides, metal carbides, metal nitrides, heterostuctures, and the possible mechanisms during the process. Besides, we also outlined the theoretical calculation tools for the dual&#8208;functional host based on the first principles. Finally, several sound perspectives are also rationally proposed for fundamental research and practical development as guidelines.

         <title>Coupling Value&#8208;Added Anodic Reactions with Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 11, February 21, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling value&#8208;added anodic reactions with CO2 electroreduction is a promising strategy to enhance the full&#8208;cell energy efficiency and produce valuable chemicals. In this review, recent advances in the coupled electrolysis of CO2 and potential anodic reactions are summarized. Current challenges and future opportunities for the coupled electrolysis systems are also proposed.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction features a promising approach to realize carbon neutrality. However, its competitiveness is limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode, which consumes a large portion of energy. Coupling value&#8208;added anodic reactions with CO2 electroreduction has been emerging as a promising strategy in recent years to enhance the full&#8208;cell energy efficiency and produce valuable chemicals at both cathode and anode of the electrolyzer. This review briefly summarizes recent progresses on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, and the economic feasibility of different CO2 electrolysis systems is discussed. Then a comprehensive summary of recent advances in the coupled electrolysis of CO2 and potential value&#8208;added anodic reactions is provided, with special focus on the specific cell designs. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities for the coupled electrolysis systems are proposed, which are targeted to facilitate progress in this field and push the CO2 electrolyzers to a more practical level.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in Regioisomeric Alternating Borane&#8208;Terthiophene Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borane polymers: Using robust dithienylborane monomers, a series of alternating terthiophene&#8208;borane polymers are obtained by Stille coupling polymerization methods. Variations in the attachment point of boron on the terthiophene linker and the electronic structure of the pendent aryl (Ar) moiety give rise to luminescent materials with divergent optical and electronic properties.







Abstract
Main&#8208;chain boron&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers are attractive for organic electronic, sensing, and imaging applications. Alternating terthiophene&#8208;borane polymers were prepared and the effects of regioisomeric attachment of the conjugated linker and variations in the electronic effect of the pendent aryl groups (2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl, Mes*; 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl, FMes) examined. Pd2dba3/P(t&#8208;Bu)3&#8208;catalyzed Stille polymerization of arylbis(2&#8208;thienyl)borane and arylbis(3&#8208;thienylborane) with 2,5&#8208;bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene at 120&#8201;&#176;C gave polymers with appreciable molecular weight but MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analyses showed evidence of unusually prominent homocoupling. These defects could be suppressed by using brominated rather than iodinated monomers, more hindered 2,5&#8208;bis(tri&#8208;n&#8208;butylstannyl)thiophene as comonomer, and Pd2dba3/P(o&#8208;tol)3 as the catalyst at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Under these conditions, macrocyclic species with n=3&#8211;10 repeating units formed preferentially according to MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analyses. Photophysical studies revealed a prominent effect of the regiochemistry and the nature of the pendent aryl groups on the absorption and emission, giving rise to orange, yellow&#8208;green, blue&#8208;green, and blue emissive materials respectively. The electronic effects were rationalized through DFT calculations on bis(terthiophene) model systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Two Novel Optically Active #&#8208;Shaped Cyclic Tetramers Based on Planar Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active #&#8208;shaped cyclic tetramers, in which the p&#8208;arylene&#8208;ethynylenes were stacked at the terminal benzene units, were synthesized. They composed of bis&#8208;(para)&#8208;pseudo&#8208;ortho&#8208; and bis&#8208;(para)&#8208;pseudo&#8208;meta&#8208;tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes. Two kinds of #&#8208;shaped cyclic tetramers (parallel&#8208;type and weave&#8208;type) were formed depending on the &#960;&#8208;staked manner. The weave&#8208;typed cyclic tetramer exhibited excellent CPL behavior with high glum and BCPL values.







Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of optically active cyclic tetramers comprising four stacked &#960;&#8208;electron systems from two enantiomerically pure [2.2]paracyclophane compounds (bis&#8208;(para)&#8208;pseudo&#8208;ortho&#8208; and bis&#8208;(para)&#8208;pseudo&#8208;meta&#8208;tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophane compounds). Depending on the combination of the absolute configurations of the planar chiral pseudo&#8208;ortho&#8208; and pseudo&#8208;meta&#8208;[2.2]paracyclophane units, the cyclic tetramers formed either parallel&#8208;#&#8208; or weave&#8208;#&#8208;structures. The optical and chiroptical properties of both structures were investigated experimentally and theoretically. In particular, the weave&#8208;#&#8208;shaped cyclic tetramer exhibited good chiroptical properties and emitted circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high anisotropy factor (|glum| value of the order of 10&#8722;3) and a CPL brightness (BCPL) higher than 100.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Coupled with Organic Conversion to Selectively Synthesize High&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling CO2 reduction and organic conversion can create a win&#8208;win situation, and this can not only obtain high&#8208;value chemicals with high selectivity, but also reduce reaction overpotential and improve energy efficiency. In this review, we discuss the characteristics of different coupling systems, and propose opinions for further development of this direction.







Abstract
The electrochemical process of coupling electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and organic conversion reaction can effectively reduce the reaction overpotential and obtain value&#8208;added chemicals. Moreover, because of the diversity of substrates and the designability of coupling forms, more and more attention has been paid to this field. This review systematically summarizes the research progress of coupling electrolysis in recent years, (1) co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and organics at the cathode to obtain specific products with high selectivity, (2) replacing traditional anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with other valuable oxidation reactions to improve energy utilization efficiency and economic benefits of CO2 conversion, (3) in an electrolytic cell without membrane, the cathode and anode jointly transform CO2 and organics to redox products. We hope that the examples and insights on coupling electrolysis introduced in this review can inspire researchers to further explore and innovate in this direction.

         <title>5&#8208;(Trifluorovinyl)dibenzothiophenium Triflate: Introducing the 1,1,2&#8208;Trifluoroethylene Tether in Drug&#8208;Like Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key reagent to introduce trifluoroethylene: A protocol for the connection of alcohols and (hetero)arenes via a trifluoroethylene linker has been developed. Key for the development of this procedure has been the synthesis of a sulfonium salt bearing a trifluorovinyl substituent. This reagent suffers the addition of alcohols to the activated double bond and subsequently generates alkyl fluoride radicals by mesolytic cleavage of the S&#8722;C bond after one electron reduction.







Abstract
This manuscript reports the synthesis and structure of an unprecedented sulfonium salt, 5&#8208;(trifluorovinyl)dibenzothiophenium triflate, and its use as a versatile reagent for the introduction of the bioisosteric 1,1,2&#8208;trifluoroethylene linker in drug&#8208;like structures. The protocol developed consists of the reaction of this compound with alcohols and phenols to deliver a complete set of 1,2,2&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;(alkoxy&#8208;/aryloxy)ethyl sulfonium salts, which have been purified by column chromatography and fully characterized. Subsequent single electron reduction under mild photochemical conditions efficiently affords the corresponding fluoroalkyl radicals that are trapped either intra&#8208; or intermolecularly through their reaction with (hetero)arenes. Theoretical calculations are used to evaluate the conformational consequences derived from the presence of the CF2&#8722;CHF tether.

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;Free Engineering toward Efficient Zinc Storage: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;free engineering strategies in each assembly components are summarized to homogenize Zn2+ diffusion and electric field at the Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface toward safe, high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifespan zinc storage.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;based energy storage has lately gained popularity due to natural abundance, operational safety, high energy density. Unfortunately, dendrite growth is a common and intractable issue faced in existing zinc&#8208;ion batteries to shorten cycle lifespan/stability. This review summarizes recent progress in assembly component (e.&#8201;g., anode, electrolyte, separator) engineering for dendrite&#8208;free zinc&#8208;ion batteries. First, diversiform strategies of Zn surface modification and Zn host design are presented to shield the fundamental adverse effect aroused by uneven zinc deposition on the anode. Then, subtle deployments of electrolyte constituents are illustrated to optimize the Zn2+ solvation structure for ultimate dendrite control and Coulombic efficiency elevation in aqueous systems and beyond (e.&#8201;g., eutectic electrolytes). Furthermore, rational manipulation of advanced separators and the upgrade of zinc metal&#8208;free Zn2+&#8208;storage devices are briefly discussed to explore the dendrite&#8208;free and high&#8208;level Zn2+&#8208;storage. Finally, challenges and perspectives are proposed to offer research inspirations toward safe, high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifespan zinc storage.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Polychloromethylamination of Styrenes through C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new three&#8208;component procedure for the polychloromethylaminative synthesis of &#946;&#8208;polychloromethyl amines has been developed. With simple styrenes, polychloromethanes, and aromatic amines as substrates, saturated &#946;&#8208;dichloromethyl amines were isolated in moderate to good yields by using aryldiazonium salt as radical initiator.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling reaction has been developed allowing the rapid building of valuable complex highly functionalized &#946;&#8208;polychloromethyl amines from simple styrenes, arylamines, and dichloromethane/chloroform. Using aryldiazonium salts as a radical initiator, a series of corresponding products are obtained with moderate to good yields under a carbon dioxide or nitrogen atmosphere (50&#8197;psi). In addition, good functional group tolerance can be observed.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Materials with Imidazo&#8208;pyrazine&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile Acceptors</title>

Seeing red! Strong donor&#8208;acceptor diads based on novel imidazo&#8208;pyrazine&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (IPDC) electron acceptors exhibit blue to near infrared emission, as well as delayed emission such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP). IPDC&#8208;PTZ carrying the electron donor phenothiazine (PTZ) was found to display dual emission, which was studied in detail by photophysical experiments and computational studies.







Abstract
Three donor&#8208;acceptor compounds based on the imidazo&#8208;pyrazine&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (IPDC) acceptor were synthesized. The IPDC emitters exhibit blue to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission with up to 54&#8201;% photoluminescent quantum yield. 9,9&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (ACR), phenoxazine (POX), and phenothiazine (PTZ) served as electron donors. IPDC&#8208;POX displayed NIR emission in toluene solution, while showing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in the solid state. IPDC&#8208;ACR exhibited yellow thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Interestingly, dual&#8208;emissive behavior as well as excitation&#8208;dependent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) was found for IPDC&#8208;PTZ, arising from the two conformers of phenothiazine derivatives. Overall, this work describes a novel strong electron acceptor from the fusion of imidazole, pyrazine, and nitrile functional groups into one conjugated heterocycle for materials exhibiting NIR emission, TADF, and/or room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP).

         <title>Toward a Comprehensive Understanding of Amorphous Photocatalysts: Fundamental Hypotheses and Applications in CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helping amorphous photocatalysts to take shape: Although developing an amorphous photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction may be challenging, it can perform better than crystalline photocatalysts if specific properties are considered. These include light harvesting, charge kinetics, short&#8208;range active sites, and reaction mechanisms. EXAFS and machine learning could be powerful tools for gaining insights into amorphous photocatalysts.







Abstract
In principle, photocatalytic activity can be precisely controlled with crystalline catalysts. However, an amorphous photocatalyst could be a viable candidate for CO2 photoreduction to form value&#8208;added products. The amorphous phase is currently part of the crystalline material in several ongoing CO2 photoreduction studies. Additionally, no study indicates the amorphous material required for overall CO2 photoreduction. This perspective review article highlights fundamental assumptions that are necessary to gain insights and understand the effectiveness of amorphous photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction. We start with basic ideas and theories about these materials, including light harvesting, variable coordination number, and the interaction of CO2 molecules with the amorphous catalytic surface. To understand the prospects of the amorphous photocatalyst, we explore machine learning with EXAFS. Furthermore, we discuss product selectivity and regeneration of photocatalysts in detail. Finally, we briefly review the work in progress on amorphous materials and compare it to that on crystalline ones.

         <dc:description>The Li+ ion conductor Li27&#8722; x [P4O7+ x N9&#8722; x ]O3 (x &#8776; 1.9) has been synthesized from P3N5, Li3N and Li2O in a Ta ampoule at 800 &#176;C under Ar atmosphere. The cubic compound crystallizes in space group I [[EQUATION]] 3d with a = 12.0106(14) &#197; and Z = 4. It contains both non&#8208;condensed [PO2N2]5&#8722; and [PO3N]4&#8722; tetrahedra as well as O2&#8722; ions, surrounded by Li+ ions. Charge neutrality is achieved by partial occupancy of Li positions, which was refined with neutron powder diffraction data. Measurements of the partial ionic and electronic conductivity show a total ionic conductivity of 6.6 &#215; 10&#8722;8 S cm&#8722;1 with an activation energy of 0.46 &#177; 0.02 eV and a bulk ionic conductivity of 4 &#215; 10&#8208;6 S cm&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C, which is close to the ionic conductivity of amorphous lithium nitridophosphate. This makes Li27&#8722; x [P4O7+ x N9&#8722; x ]O3 an interesting candidate for investigation of structural factors affecting ionic conductivity in lithium oxonitridophosphates.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the crystal phase&#8208;activity relationship on NiRu alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in N&#8208;doped carbon towards efficient hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adjusting the crystal phase&#160;of metal alloy is an important method to optimize catalytic performance. However, its detailed understanding about the relationship for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still limited. In this work, the crystal phase&#8208;activity relationship of NiRu nanoparticles is studied employing the N&#8208;doped carbon shell coated NiRu nanoparticles with different phase contents. It is found that the NiRu@NC (mix)&#160;with both face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) and thermodynamically unstable hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase NiRu give the best HER performance. Further activity studies demonstrate that hcp NiRu has better HER performance, and NiRu@NC (mix) with rich (~70%) hcp phase presented outstanding performance with an overpotential of only 27 mV @ 10 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2. The high HER activity of NiRu@NC (mix) is attributed&#160;to the formation of hcp phase. This finding indicates that the regulation of crystal structure can provide a new strategy for optimizing HER activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Engineering of Red Luminogens to Realize High Emission Efficiency Through ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR, &gt; 650 nm) emissive organic luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviours have emerged as promising candidates for the applications in optoelectronic devices and biological fields. However, the molecular design philosophy for AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with narrow band gaps are rarely explored. Herein, we rationally designed two red organic luminophores, FITPA and FIMPA, by considering the enlargement of transition dipole moment in the charge&#8208;transfer state and the transformation from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) to AIE. The transition dipole moments were effectively enhanced with a &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221; molecular configuration. Meanwhile, the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation from FITPA to FIMPA was induced by a methoxy&#8208;substitution strategy. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation originated from a crystallization&#8208;induced emission (CIE) effect because of additional weak interactions in the aggregate state introduced by methoxy groups. Owing to the enhanced transition dipole moment and AIE behaviour, FIMPA presented intense luminescence covering the red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR region, with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 38% in solid state. The promising cell&#8208;imaging performance further verified the great potential of FIMPA in biological applications.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep red/near-infrared (NIR, &amp;gt; 650 nm) emissive organic luminophores with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) behaviours have emerged as promising candidates for the applications in optoelectronic devices and biological fields. However, the molecular design philosophy for AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with narrow band gaps are rarely explored. Herein, we rationally designed two red organic luminophores, FITPA and FIMPA, by considering the enlargement of transition dipole moment in the charge-transfer state and the transformation from aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) to AIE. The transition dipole moments were effectively enhanced with a &#8220;V-shaped&#8221; molecular configuration. Meanwhile, the ACQ-to-AIE transformation from FITPA to FIMPA was induced by a methoxy-substitution strategy. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that the ACQ-to-AIE transformation originated from a crystallization-induced emission (CIE) effect because of additional weak interactions in the aggregate state introduced by methoxy groups. Owing to the enhanced transition dipole moment and AIE behaviour, FIMPA presented intense luminescence covering the red-to-NIR region, with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 38% in solid state. The promising cell-imaging performance further verified the great potential of FIMPA in biological applications. These results provide a guideline for the development of red and NIR AIEgens through comprehensive consideration of both the effect of molecular structure and molecular interactions in aggregate states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly E&#8208;Selective Olefin Synthesis Catalysed by Novel Quinoxalinone Photocatalyst under Visible Light Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photo&#8208;induced olefin synthesis, the photocatalysts with high triplet energy could cause the isomerization of olefins. This study demonstrates a new quinoxalinone photocatalytic system for highly stereoselective alkenes preparation from alkenyl sulfones and alkyl boronic acids. Our photocatalyst could not convert the thermodynamically favored E&#8208;olefin to Z&#8208;olefin, guaranteeing the high E&#8208;configuration selectivity of the reaction. There is weak interaction between boronic acids and quinoxalinone according to NMR experiments, probably decreasing the oxidation potential of boronic acids. This system can be further extended to the allyl and alkynyl sulfones to give corresponding alkenes and alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing Facilitated by Mito&#8208;CPDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) plays an essential role in maintaining normal cellular activities. Its heteroplasmic mutations are known to cause various genetic diseases. Current genetic engineering strategies, such as those based on RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense technology, are difficult to genetically alter mtDNA, however, due to the inability of highly negatively charged oligonucleotides to translocate across the double&#8208;membrane mitochondria. We report herein a universal mitochondria&#8208;targeted gene&#8208;delivery approach by using cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s (CPDs). Novel CPD&#8208;based mitochondrial transporters, named Mito&#8208;CPDs, were synthesized by using triphenylphosphonium (TPP)&#8208;fused propagating monomers containing either disulfide or diselenide backbones. Upon spontaneous complex formation with an oligonucleotide (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded), the resulting nanoscale Mito&#8208;CPD@Oligo exhibited excellent properties in common biological media. While the intracellular gene&#8208;delivery efficiency of these Mito&#8208;CPDs was comparable to that of commercial transfection agents, their unique mitochondria&#8208;localized properties enabled effective release of the loaded cargo inside these organelles. Subsequent mitochondrial delivery of siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides against suitable mtDNA&#8208;encoded proteins showed successful down&#8208;regulation of target protein expression, leading to profound effects on mitochondrial functions. Mito&#8208;CPDs thus provide a useful tool for future investigations of mitochondrial biology and treatment of mitochondria&#8208;related diseases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of the monocationic cobalt(III) catecholate complex [Co(L&#8208;N4 t Bu2)(Cl2cat)]+ (L&#8208;N4 t Bu2 = N,N&#8217;&#8208;Di&#8208;tert.&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diaza[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane, Cl2cat2&#8208; = 4,5&#8208;dichlorocatecholate) are presented. The complex exhibits valence tautomeric properties in solution; but, in contrast to the usually observed conversion from a cobalt(III) catecholate to a high&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate state, valence tautomerism of [Co(L&#8208;N4 t Bu2)(Cl2cat)]+ leads to the formation of a low&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate complex upon raising the temperature. This new type of valence tautomerism for a cobalt dioxolene complex has been unambiguously established by a detailed spectroscopic investigation using variable&#8208;temperature NMR, IR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. Determination of the enthalpies and entropies characterizing the valence tautomeric equilibria in various solutions shows that the influence of the solvent is almost exclusively entropic.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperativity&#8208;driven reactivity of a dinuclear copper dimethylglyoxime complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this report, we present the dinuclear copper(II) dimethylglyoxime (H2dmg) complex [Cu2(H2dmg)(Hdmg)(dmg)]+ (1) that, in contrast to its mononuclear analogue [Cu(Hdmg)2] (2), is subject to a cooperativity&#8208;driven hydrolysis. The combined Lewis acidity of both copper centers increase the electrophilicity of the carbon atom in the bridging &#181;2&#8208;O&#8208;N=C&#8208;group of H2dmg and thus, facilitates the nucleophilic attack of H2O. This hydrolysis yields 2,3&#8208;butanedione monoxime (3) and NH2OH that depending on the solvent is then either oxidized or reduced. In ethanol, NH2OH is reduced to NH4+, yielding acetaldehyde as oxidation product. In contrast, in CH3CN, NH2OH is oxidized by CuII to form N2O and [Cu(CH3CN)4]+. Herein are presented the combined synthetic, theoretical, spectroscopic and spectrometric methods that indicate and establish the reaction pathway of this solvent&#8208;dependent reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmonic Photocatalysis for CO2 Reduction: Advances, Understanding and Possibilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmonic photocatalysis for CO  2  &#160; reduction is attracting increasing attention due to their appealing properties and great potential for real applications. In this review, the fundamentals of plasmonic photocatalysis and the most recent developments regarding its application in driving CO  2  reduction are reported. Firstly, we present the review on the mechanism of plasmonic photocatalytic CO  2  reduction, the energy transfer of plasmon, and the CO  2  reduction process on the catalyst surface.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Piezochromism from an o&#8208;Carborane Dyad: Boron Clusters Facilitating a Wide&#8208;Range Redshift and High Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spherical boron cluster. An o&#8208;carborane dyad (MTCb) with a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture was developed as a high&#8208;sensitivity piezochromic material. Compared to the carborane&#8208;free MTY, the o&#8208;carborane dyad MTCb showed a larger emission wavelength difference of 131&#8197;nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, resulting from the presence of icosahedral boron clusters.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials, which exhibit a fluorescence response with large emission spectral shifts and high sensitivity, may be useful in important applications, but there have been few reports of such organic luminophores. Herein, we report a new high&#8208;sensitivity piezochromic material based on the incorporation of an o&#8208;carborane unit, which exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. In a high&#8208;pressure experiment, compared to carborane&#8208;free MTY, which exhibits an emission spectral shift of 75&#8197;nm and a sensitivity of 19.1&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, the o&#8208;carborane dyad MTCb shows a larger emission wavelength difference of 131&#8197;nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, demonstrating a performance that ranks among the best of organic piezochromic materials reported thus far. MTCb molecules adopt a J&#8208;aggregated pattern and have relatively loose molecular packing in the crystalline state. Interestingly, nonconjugated spherical carborane can disrupt the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between adjacent molecules during compression, which results in excellent piezochromic performance.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Aliphatic C&#8722;H Methylation of Glycine Derivatives and Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise strategy relying on multifunctional iron catalysis in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide has been reported, allowing rapid and highly selective C(sp3)&#8722;H methylation of various glycine derivatives and peptides.







Abstract
Direct and selective C&#8722;H methylation is a powerful tool with which to install methyl groups into organic molecules, and is particularly useful in pharmaceutical chemistry. However, practical methods for such modification of biologically interesting targets have been rarely developed. We here report an iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H methylation reaction of glycine derivatives, peptides and drug&#8208;like molecules in an alcohol in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide. A readily available iron catalyst plays multiple roles in the transformation, which accelerates oxidation of C&#8722;N bonds to C=N double bonds, activates imine intermediates as Lewis acids by bidentate chelation, and at the same time facilitates cleavage of the peroxide to generate methyl radicals. A variety of methylated N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives and peptides were obtained in good yield and with excellent chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity. This reaction is scalable, easily managed, and can be completed within 1&#8211;2&#8197;h. It features an economic, bio&#8208;friendly catalyst, a green solvent and low toxic reagents, and will provide effective access to precise C&#8722;H modification of biomolecules and natural products.

         <title>Transition Metal Vacancy in Layered Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept focuses on the formation of transition metal (TM) vacancy, vacancy contained configurations for triggering oxygen redox, advanced characterization techniques for detecting TM vacancy and viable strategies to improve the reversibility of vacancy&#8208;induced oxygen redox for layered cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Anionic redox has been considered as a promising strategy to break the capacity limitation of cathode materials that solely relies on the intrinsic cationic redox in secondary batteries. Vacancy, as a kind of defect, can be introduced into transition metal layer to trigger oxygen redox, thus enhancing the energy density of layer&#8208;structured cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the formation process, recent progress in working mechanisms of triggering oxygen redox, as well as advanced characterization techniques for transition metal (TM) vacancy were overviewed and discussed. Strategies applied to stabilize the vacancy contained structures and harness the reversible oxygen redox were summarized. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for further understanding TM vacancy were particularly emphasized.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Release of Secondary Amine Bases for the Activation of Catalysts and Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Apart from their properties as self&#8208;healing materials, DCv ureas can be applied as starting points for triggered reaction cascades. Input such as heat and water can release free base on demand. We apply this release system for the deprotection of a latent organocatalyst to catalyse acylhydrazone formation as well as for on&#8208;demand gelation.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent (DCv) ureas have been used abundantly to design self&#8208;healing materials. We demonstrate that apart from self&#8208;healing materials, the species present in the equilibrium of DCv ureas can be employed as responsive organocatalysts. Easily controllable stimuli like heat or addition of water shift the equilibrium towards isocyanate and free base which can function as an in situ released reagent. We demonstrate this application of DCv ureas with two examples. Firstly, we use the liberated base to catalytically activate a latent organocatalyst for acylhydrazone formation. Secondly, this base can be employed in an equimolar manner to trigger the release of nitrile&#8208;N&#8208;oxides from chlorooximes, which react with acrylate&#8208;terminated polymers to form an isoxazoline polymer gel.

         <title>Investigations into Simplified Analogues of the Herbicidal Natural Product (+)&#8208;Cornexistin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of simplified analogues of the herbicidal natural product (+)&#8208;cornexistin. Guided by an X&#8208;Ray co&#8208;crystal structure of cornexistin bound to the transketolase enzyme from Zea mays, we attempted to identify the key interactions that are necessary for cornexistin to maintain its herbicidal profile. This resulted in the preparation of three novel analogues investigating the importance of substituents that are located on the nine&#8208;membered ring of cornexistin. One analogue maintained a good level of biological activity and could provide researchers insights in how to further optimize the structure of cornexistin for commercialization in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208; and Five&#8208;Membered Anionic Chains of Pnictogenylboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;membered chains of substituted anionic compounds composed of both boron and pnictogen (phosphorus and/or arsenic) atoms are synthesized from the reaction of pnictogenide salts with H2E&#8722;BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3 (E=P, As). Such compounds can be further reacted with H2E&#8722;BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3 to form unprecedented five&#8208;membered anionic group 13/15 oligomers.







Abstract
An unprecedented family of three&#8208; and five&#8208;membered substituted anionic derivatives of parent pnictogenylboranes is herein reported. Reacting various combinations of the pnictogenylboranes H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;NMe3 (E&#8242;=P, As) with pnictogen&#8208;based nucleophiles MER1R2 (E=P, As; R1=H, R2=tBu; R1=R2=Ph; M=Na, K) allows for the isolation of the unsymmetrical products [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;EHtBu] (3: E=E&#8242;=P; 4: E=E&#8242;=As; 5: E=As, E&#8242;=P) and [M(C)][H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;EPh2] (7: E=E&#8242;=P, M=Na, C=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; 8: E=E&#8242;=As; M=K, C=[2.2.2]cryptand; 9: E=P, E&#8242;=As, M=Na, C=[2.2.2]cryptand; 10: E=As, E&#8242;=P, M=K, C=[2.2.2]cryptand). [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2As&#8722;BH2&#8208;tBuPH&#8722;BH3] (6) is only accessible by a different pathway, using tBuPH2, BH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 and NaNH2 as starting materials. Additionally, the synthesis of symmetrical diphenyl&#8208;substituted compounds [M(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][Ph2E&#8722;BH2&#8722;EPh2] (11: E=P, M=Na; 12: E=As, M=K) is reported which can be regarded as isostructural inorganic, negatively charged analogs of dppm (1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and dpam (1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylarsino)methane). Furthermore, an elongation of the pnictogen boron backbone in compounds 3, 7 and 9&#8242; (similar compound to 9, stabilized however by 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6), is attainable by reacting them with the pnictogenylboranes H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;NMe3 leading to corresponding five&#8208;membered chain&#8208;like compounds [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2E&#8722;BH2&#8722;R1R2P&#8722;BH2&#8722;E&#8242;H2] (E=E&#8242;=P, R1=H, R2=tBu (13); E=E&#8242;=P, R1=R2=Ph (14); E=E&#8242;=As, R1=R2=Ph (15); E=P, E&#8242;=As, R1=R2=Ph (16)). Finally, the thermodynamics of the reaction pathways were evaluated by quantum chemical computations.

         <title>Reagent&#8208;Controlled Regioselective Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition between Vinylsilanes and Allenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unprecedented intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between allenes and silicon&#8208;bearing olefins is presented. This is also the first example of the reagent&#8208;controlled regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes. The products in this work were oil compounds. The crystal sponge method was successfully used to determine their structures.







Abstract
This paper provides the first report of the intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of vinylsilane. The [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes is a useful reaction that can synthesize cyclobutanes. However, no previous works have attempted to control the regioselectivity between the two double bonds of allenes only by changing the reaction conditions, although there have been some reports of the regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes by changing the substrate. In this study, we have succeeded in controlling intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reactions at the proximal and distal positions of allenes simply by changing the reaction conditions. We found that the atomic radius of silicon is very important for perfect control of the reaction's sites. The structures of all key compounds were determined by the crystal sponge method which could identify the structures of liquid compounds.

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Metal&#8208;Organic Cage&#8208;Crosslinked Polymer Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of homobifunctional poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminally substituted with bipyridines as ligands for Pd6L4 cages enabled crosslinking of the metal&#8208;organic cages and subsequent network formation, leading to supramolecular polymer hydrogels. The hydrogels allow for non&#8208;covalent guest uptake and release using ultrasound from aqueous solution.







Abstract
We report the formation of metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;crosslinked polymer hydrogels. To enable crosslinking of the cages and subsequent network formation, we used homodifunctionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains terminally substituted with bipyridines as ligands for the Pd6L4 corners. The encapsulation of guest molecules into supramolecular self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels, as well as ultrasound&#8208;induced disassembly of the cages with release of their cargo, is presented in addition to their characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, rheology, and comprehensive small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. The constrained geometries simulating external force (CoGEF) method and barriers using a force&#8208;modified potential energy surface (FMPES) suggest that the cage&#8208;opening mechanism starts with the dissociation of one pyridine ligand at around 0.5&#8197;nN. We show the efficient sonochemical activation of the hydrogels HG3&#8211;6, increasing the non&#8208;covalent guest&#8208;loading of completely unmodified drugs available for release by a factor of ten in comparison to non&#8208;crosslinked, star&#8208;shaped assemblies in solution.

         <title>PtSnBi Nanoplates Enable Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Highly Efficient Photothermal Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional intermetallic PtSnBi nanoplates were constructed as a novel photothermal agent with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 61&#8201;% upon 808&#8208;nm laser irradiation. The application of PtSnBi nanoplates for photothermal cancer therapy both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo was successfully carried out, suggesting that PtSnBi nanoplates have great promise in cancer theranostics.







Abstract
The development of photothermal agents (PTAs) with robust photostability and high photothermal conversion efficiency is of great importance for cancer photothermal therapy. Herein, a novel PTA was created using two&#8208;dimensional intermetallic PtSnBi nanoplates (NPs), which demonstrated excellent photostability and biocompatibility with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of &#8764;61&#8201;% after PEGylation. More importantly, PtSnBi NPs could be employed as photoacoustic imaging contrast agents for tumor visualization due to their strong absorbance in the NIR range. In addition, both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments confirmed that PtSnBi NPs had a good photothermal efficacy under NIR laser irradiation. Therefore, the remarkable therapeutic characteristics of PtSnBi NPs make them a most promising candidate for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Tetraarylethylenes Enabled by Reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dimetallation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetraarylethylenes (TAEs) have been gaining attentions from various scientific disciplines for their characteristic chemical and physical properties. From the synthetic perspective, however, efficient methods for the selective synthesis of different isomers of TAEs are still underdeveloped. Here, we report the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of TAEs by means of sodium&#8208;promoted reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimagnesiation of alkynes. Subsequent transmetallation to zinc generates trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;dizincioalkenes, which underwent the stereoselective arylation under a palladium catalysis to afford a variety of TAEs that had been difficult to prepare according to the conventional procedures. In addition, the present method accommodates not only diarylacetylenes but also alkyl aryl acetylenes and thus enables to synthesize a wide range of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability of Catalytic Centres in Light&#8208;driven Hydrogen Evolution by Oligonuclear Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A review. In the past decades, mimicking natural photosynthesis by artificial photocatalysis represented a major research direction towards the final goal of reducing the consumption of fossil fuels by efficiently harvesting solar energy. To transfer molecular photocatalysis from the lab scale to an industrially relevant process, it is important to overcome instability problems of the catalysts during light&#8208;driven operation. As it is well&#8208;known that many of the typically utilized noble metal&#8208;based catalytic centres (e.g.&#160;Pt and Pd) undergo particle formation during (photo)catalysis and thus switch the whole process from a homogeneous into a heterogeneous one, an understanding of the factors governing particle formation is crucially needed. The review therefore focuses on di&#8208; and oligonuclear photocatalysts bearing a range of different bridging ligand architectures for drawing structure&#8208;catalyst&#8208;stability relationships in light&#8208;driven intramolecular reductive catalysis. In addition, ligand effects at the catalytic centre and its consequences on the catalytic activity in intermolecular systems will be addressed, as well as yielding important insights into the future design of operationally stable catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Copper(I) and Silver(I) be Hydrogen Bond Acceptors?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(I) centers can form moderately strong (Au&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H) hydrogen bonds with tertiary ammonium groups, as has been demonstrated on 3AuCl+ (3+ = 1&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;((dimethylammonio)methyl)phenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) complex. However, similar hydrogen bonding interactions with isoelectronic silver(I) or copper(I) centers are unknown. Herein, we first explored whether the Au&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H bond originally observed in 3AuCl+ can be strengthened by replacing Cl with Br or I. Experimental gas&#8208;phase IR spectra in the ~3000 cm&#8208;1 region showed only a small effect of the halogen on the Au&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H bond. Next, we measured the spectra of 3AgCl+, which exhibited significant differences compared to its 3AuX+ counterparts. The difference has been explained by DFT calculations which indicated that the Ag&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H interaction is only marginal in this complex, and a Cl&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H hydrogen bond is formed instead. Calculations predicted the same for the 3CuCl+ complex. However, we noticed that for Ag and Cu complexes with less flexible ligands, such as dimethyl(2&#8208;(dimethylammonio)phenyl)phosphine (L&#8311;H + ), the computations predict the presence of the respective Ag&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H and Cu&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H hydrogen bonds, with a strength similar to the Au&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H bond in 3AuCl+. We, therefore, propose possible complexes where the presence of (Ag/Cu)&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H bonds could be experimentally verified to broaden our understanding of these unusual interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Shape, Electronic Factors and the Ferroelectric Nematic Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens, the (4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3.m) and the (3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3F.m), are reported in order to investigate the effect of changing the position of a lateral alkoxy chain from the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring to central phenyl ring in these two series of materials based on RM734. All members of the NT3.m series exhibited a conventional nematic phase, N, which preceded the ferroelectric nematic phase, NF, whereas all the members of the NT3F.m series exhibited direct NF&#8208;I transitions except for NT3F.1 which also exhibited a N phase. These materials cannot be described as wedge&#8208;shaped, yet their values of TNFN exceed those of the corresponding materials with the lateral alkoxy chain located on the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring. In part, this may be attributed to the effect that changing the position of the lateral alkoxy chain has on the electronic properties of these materials, specifically in the electron density associated with the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal aromatic ring. The value of TNI decreased with the addition of a fluorine atom ortho to the nitro group in NT3F.1, however, the opposite behaviour is found comparing the transition temperatures of the NF phase which are higher for the NT3F.m series, and this may reflect a change in the polarity and polarizability of those materials. This suggests that, rather than simply promoting a tapered shape, the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti&#8208;parallel associations and its effect on the electronic properties of the molecules are the key factors in driving the formation of the NF phase.</dc:description>

         <title>A cyclodextrin polymer as supramolecular matrix for scalable green photooxygenation of hydrophobic substrates in homogeneous phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the quest for new therapies targeting hypoxia, aromatic endoperoxides have intriguing potential as oxygen releasing agents (ORAs) able to free O2&#160;in tissues upon suitable trigger. Four aromatic substrates were synthesized and the formation of their corresponding endoperoxides was optimized in organic solvent upon selective irradiation of Methylene Blue, a low&#8208;cost photocatalyst, producing the reactive singlet oxygen species. Complexation of the hydrophobic substrates within a hydrophilic cyclodextrin (CyD) polymer allowed their photooxygenation in homogeneous aqueous environment using the same optimized protocol upon dissolution in water of the three readily accessible reagents. Notably, reaction rates were comparable in buffered D2O and organic solvent and, for the first time, the photooxygenation of highly hydrophobic substrates was achieved for millimolar solutions in non&#8208;deuterated water. Quantitative conversion of the substrates, straightforward isolation of the endoperoxides and recovery of the polymeric matrix were achieved. Cycloreversion of one ORA to the original aromatic substrate was observed upon thermolysis. These results hold great potential for the launch of CyD polymers both as reaction vessels for green, homogeneous photocatalysis and as carrier for the delivery of ORAs in tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>ASSESSING COMBINATIONS OF B(C6F5)3 AND N2&#8208;DERIVED MOLYBDENUM NITRIDO COMPLEXES FOR HETEROLYTIC BOND ACTIVATION</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two different dinitrogen&#8208;derived molybdenum nitrido complexes varying by their geometry, ligand spheres and oxidations states were shown to engage their N ligand in dative bonding with the strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3. The stable adducts were assessed for frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;type heterolytic E&#8211;H bond splitting of hydrosilanes (E = Si) and HB(C6F5)2. Whereas Si&#8211;H bond activation was achieved, HB(C6F5)2 was shown to substitute B(C6F5)3 in a quantitative or equilibrated fashion, depending on the nature of the nitrido complex. No B&#8211;H bond splitting was observed. Thermodynamics of these reactions, computed by DFT, are in agreement with the experimental outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Flexibility of Carbazole&#8208;based Metal&#8211;organic Frameworks by Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed highly porous Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) using carbazole&#8208;type linkers. The novel topological structure of these MOFs was revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Molecular adsorption/desorption experiments indicated that these MOFs are flexible and change their structure upon adsorption/desorption of organic solvents and gas molecules. These MOFs exhibit unprecedented properties that allow controlling their flexibility by adding a functional group onto the central benzene ring of the organic ligand. For example, the introduction of electron&#8208;donating substituents increases the robustness of the resulting MOFs. These MOFs also exhibit flexibility&#8208;dependent differences in gas&#8208;adsorption and &#8208;separation performance. Thus, this study represents the first example of controlling the flexibility of MOFs with the same topological structure via the substituent effect of functional groups introduced into the organic ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Marigold Flower&#8208;Shaped Metal Organic Framework Supported Manganese Vanadium Oxide Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reactions in an Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process in many renewable energy systems. The development of low&#8208;cost, long&#8208;lasting alternatives to precious&#8208;metal catalysts, particularly functional electrocatalysts with high activity for OER processes, is crucial for reducing the operating expense and complexity of renewable energy generating systems. This work describes a concise method for generating marigold flower&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) aided manganese vanadium oxide via a hydrothermal procedure for increased OER activity. As synthesized MOF MnV oxide has a higher surface area due to the 3D flower&#8208;like structure, which is reinvented with enhanced electrocatalytic active sites. These distinctive structural features result in remarkable catalytic activity for MOF MnV oxide microflower towards OER with a low overpotential of 310 mV at 50 mA cm&#8208;2 and a Tafel slope with only 50.1 mV dec&#8208;1 in alkaline conditions. This study provides a concise method for developing an optimized catalytic material with greater morphology and beneficial features for potential energy and environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Construction of Corrole&#8208;peptide Conjugates by Controllable Bilane Formation on Resin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Corroles have attracted increasing research interests in recent decades owing to their unique properties over porphyrins. However, the relatively inefficient and tedious synthetic procedures of corrole building blocks with functional groups for bioconjugation hindered their bioapplications. Herein, we report a highly efficient protocol to synthesize corrole&#8208;peptide conjugates with good yields (up to 63 %) without using prepared corrole building blocks. By condensing two &#8208;COOH&#8208;bearing&#8208;dipyrromethane molecules onto an aldehyde group on resin&#8208;bound peptide chains in a controllable manner, a series of desired products with long (up to 25 residues) and bioactive peptide chains were obtained with at most one chromatographic purification. The synthesized compounds exhibited potential applications as chelators for metal ions for biomedical applications, as building blocks for supramolecular materials, as well as targeted fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tyrosine&#8208;Conjugation Method for Evaluating BACE1 Activity Based on Silver Nanoparticles/Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Composites as Electrochemical Tags</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Beta&#8208;site secretase (BACE1) catalyzes the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which process ultimately lead to plaque deposition in the brain of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). Thus, accurate monitor of BACE1 activity is essential to screen inhibitors for AD treatment. This study develops a sensitive electrochemical assay for probing BACE1 activity based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and tyrosine conjugation as tags and a marking method, respectively. An APP segment is&#160;firstly immobilized on aminated microplate reactor. Cytosine (C) rich sequence&#8208;templated AgNPs/Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#160;composite is&#160;modified by phenol groups, and then the prepared tag&#160;(ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF) is&#160;captured in microplate surface by the&#160;conjugation reaction of phenolic groups between tyrosine and tag. After cleavage by BACE1, the solution containing ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF tags is&#160;transferred to the screen&#8208;printed graphene electrode&#160;(SPGE) surface for voltammetric detection of AgNP signal. This sensitive detection for BACE1 provided an excellent linear relationship between 1&#160;to 200 pM&#160;with a detection limit of 0.8 pM. Furthermore, this electrochemical assay is&#160;successfully applied for screening of BACE1 inhibitors. This strategy is&#160;also verified to be used for evaluation of BACE1 in serum samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpectedly Large Structural Variations in Benzyl&#8208;Substituted Sila[1]ferrocenophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of four planar&#8208;chiral sila[1]ferrocenophanes equipped with a benzyl group in the &#945;&#8208;position, either on one or both Cp rings, and substituted on the bridging silicon atom, either by methyl or phenyl groups, were prepared. While NMR, UV/Vis, and DSC measurements did not show anything uncommon, single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses revealed unexpectedly large variations of the dihedral angles between both Cp rings (&#945; tilt angle). While DFT calculations predicted &#945; between 19.6 and 20.8&#176;, measured values were found between 16.6(2) and 21.45(14)&#176;. However, experimentally determined conformers differ significantly from those calculated for the gas phase. For the sila[1]ferrocenophane with the largest mismatch between the experimental and predicted &#945; angle, it was shown that the orientation of benzyl groups have a significant influence on the ring&#8208;tilted structure. Packing of molecules in the crystal lattice forces benzyl groups into unusual orientations, resulting in a significantly reduced &#945; angle through steric repulsions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis of the Cloke&#9472;Wilson Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Cloke&#8722;Wilson rearrangement is an important method to construct heterocycles which was conventionally facilitated by strong Lewis acids, Br&#248;nsted acids and Lewis bases.

         <title>In Situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies on the Reduction of V2O5 and WO3 by Using Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction was used to investigate the reduction of WO3 to WO2 and V2O5 to V2O3 under hydrogen gas with regard to intermediate oxides and bronzes as well as influence of the heating and hydrogen&#8208;flow rates.







Abstract
The reduction of metal oxides with hydrogen is widely used for the production of fine chemicals and metals both on the laboratory and industry scale. In situ methods can help to elucidate reaction pathways and to gain control over such synthesis reactions. In this study, the reduction of WO3 and V2O5 with hydrogen was investigated by in situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction with regard to intermediates and the influence of heating rates and hydrogen flow rates. Mixtures of V4O9, V6O13 and VO2 in two modifications were identified as intermediates on the way to phase&#8208;pure V2O3. None of the intermediates occurs in a single phase and therefore cannot be prepared this way. In contrast, the intermediates of the WO3 reduction, H0.23WO3 and W10O29, appear consecutively and can be isolated. For both reactions, the heating and flow rates have little influence on the formation of intermediates.

         <title>Trace Explosive Detection Based on Photonic Crystal Amplified Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace TNT detection enabled by the amplification effect of photonic crystal on fluorescence signals is achieved. The photonic crystal&#8208;based sensor chips can sense trace explosive TNT in different environments, including air, environmental wastewater, and contaminated soil.







Abstract
With increasing demand for public security and environmental protection, it is highly desirable to develop strategies to identify trace explosives (e.&#8201;g., 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene (TNT)). Herein, we report novel photonic crystal (PC)&#8208;based sensor chips for trace TNT detection by using amplification effect of PCs on fluorescence (FL) signals. The sensor chips are constructed by integrating silica nanoparticles (NPs) modified with (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer (FITC) and PC substrates. The amino groups on FITC&#8208;APTES&#8208;silica NPs can specifically bind with TNT molecules to form Meisenheimer complexes and strongly quench the FL signal of neighboring fluorophores FITC through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. PCs with matched PBG can amplify the FL signal of FITC&#8208;APTES&#8208;silica NPs about 24.4&#8208;fold and significantly improve sensitivity and resolution of trace TNT detection with the limit of detection of 0.23&#8197;nM. The PC&#8208;based sensor chips are stable, sensitive, and reliable TNT sensing platforms, showing great potential in homeland safety and environmental protection.

         <title>Fast Motions Dominate Dynamics of Intrinsically Disordered Tau Protein at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reorientational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) at low temperatures are composed of multiple components such as segmental motions and local conformational fluctuations. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectral density analysis of 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation rates demonstrates that local backbone and relaxation&#8208;active segmental chain dynamics of IDPs might merge into an effectively single dynamic component at sufficiently high temperatures.







Abstract
Reorientational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) contain multiple motions often clustered around three motional modes: ultrafast librational motions of amide groups, fast local backbone conformational fluctuations and slow chain segmental motions. This dynamic picture is mainly based on 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation studies of IDPs at relatively low temperatures where the amide&#8208;water proton exchange rates are sufficiently small. Less is known, however, about the dynamics of IDPs at more physiological temperatures. Here, we investigate protein dynamics in a 441&#8208;residue long IDP, tau protein, in the temperature range from 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C, using 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation rates and spectral density analysis. While at these temperatures relaxation rates are still better described in terms of amide group librational motions, local backbone dynamics and chain segmental motions, the temperature&#8208;dependent trend of spectral densities suggests that the timescales of fast backbone conformational fluctuations and slower chain segmental motions might become inseparable at higher temperatures. Our data demonstrate the remarkable dynamic plasticity of this prototypical IDP and highlight the need for dynamic studies of IDPs at multiple temperatures.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;Hydrophenanthrenes via Ti&#8208;mediated Radical Cyclization and Total Synthesis of Kamebanin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective synthesis of the functionalized trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrenes via Ti&#8208;mediated reductive radical cyclization has been developed. This method enabled the convergent total synthesis of nebularilactone A and the first total synthesis of kamebanin via a novel formal semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement reaction and an unprecedented Thorpe&#8208;Ziegler&#8208;type D&#8208;ring formation reaction.







Abstract
Ent&#8208;kaurenes consist of an ABC&#8208;ring based on a trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrene skeleton and a D ring with an exomethylene. Highly oxygen&#8208;functionalized ent&#8208;kauren&#8208;15&#8208;ones have promising antiinflammatory pharmacological activity. In this study, we developed a novel diastereoselective synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrenes via a Ti&#8208;mediated reductive radical cyclization. We also demonstrated the applicability of this method by developing the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;kamebanin (longest linear sequence; 17&#8197;steps, overall yield; 6.5&#8201;%). Furthermore, this synthesis provided a formal semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement for the construction of the quaternary carbon at C8 and a novel Thorpe&#8208;Ziegler&#8208;type reaction for the construction of the D&#8208;ring.

         <title>Synthesis of a Bifunctionalized Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) Anchor Useful for the Study of GPI Biology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional glycosylphosphatidylinositol derivative containing photoactivable and clickable groups was synthesized by a convergent strategy.







Abstract
A new, bifunctional glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) derivative containing the highly conserved core structure of all natural GPI anchors with a photoactivable diazirine in the lipid chain and clickable alkynes in the glycan was synthesized by a convergent [3+2] glycosylation strategy with late stage protecting group manipulation and regioselective phosphorylation. The challenges of this synthesis were due to the presence of several distinctive functional groups in the synthetic target, which complicated the protection tactics, in addition to the inherent difficulties associated with GPI synthesis. This bifunctional GPI derivative can cross&#8208;react with molecules in proximity upon photoactivation and be subsequently labeled with other molecular tags via click reaction. Therefore, it should be a valuable probe for biological studies of GPIs, such as analysis of GPI&#8208;interacting membrane proteins, and gaining insights into their functional mechanisms.

The challenges of this synthesis were due to the presence of several distinctive functional groups in the synthetic target, which complicated the protection tactics, in addition to the inherent difficulties associated with GPI synthesis. This bifunctional GPI derivative can cross-react with molecules in proximity upon photoactivation and be subsequently labeled with other molecular tags via click reaction. Therefore, it should be a valuable probe for biological studies of GPIs, such as analysis of GPI-interacting membrane proteins, and gaining insights into their functional mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A clean and efficient electrochemical method for the preparation of 3&#8208;thio/selenocyanatobenzothiophenes has been developed. This method features excellent functional group compatibility, broad substrate scope and easy to scale&#8208;up in continuous flow.







Abstract
A novel and green method for the synthesis of 3&#8208;thiocyanatobenzothiophenes via electrochemical&#8208;oxidation promoted difunctionalization of active alkyne has been developed. In this protocol, inexpensive and easily available potassium thiocyanate was chosen as the thiocyanation reagent, 2&#8208;alkynylthioanisoles as the substrates, a variety of 3&#8208;thiocyanatobenzothiophenes were obtained in moderate to good yields under oxidant&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Moreover, the continuous flow system has good applicability for this transformation, the use of continuous flow system has overcome the disadvantage of low efficiency in traditional electrochemical amplification, and realized the stable and excellent yields of target products in the scale&#8208;up reactions.

         <title>Ability of Azathiacyclen Ligands To Stop Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Induced Production of Reactive Oxygen Species: [3N1S] Is the Right Donor Set</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu bound to A&#946; (heads of the meteorites) produces reactive oxygen species (tails) that attack the brain. In the presence of the azamacrocyclic ligand 3N1S (the green belt), the Cu ions are removed by the ligand (the head of the meteorite is broken) and the ROS production is abolished (the tail disappears). Hence, the brain is safe behind its shield. In absence of 3N1S, the ROS produced by Cu(A&#946;) attack the brain, which is &#8220;destroyed&#8221;. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Esmieu, C. Hureau, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203667).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nontoxic and energy&#8208;efficient COF synthesis: Covalent organic framework TpPa&#8208;1 has been successfully obtained in a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis, replacing the traditional organic&#8208;based solvent with water and reducing reaction times from several days to 30&#8197;minutes. High&#8208;temperature hydrothermal synthesis resulted in higher BET specific surface areas (compared to traditional solvothermal processes), improved material yields, and excellent textural properties.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Singlet Fission Behaviors of Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with (&#946;, &#946;) Connected Furan/Thiophene Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet fission (SF) has been proven to be an effective strategy to overcome the Shockley&#8722;Queisser limit of photovoltaics. However, the materials suitable for SF are relatively rare due to the strict requirements for the occurrence of this process. In the present study, we report the first preparation of two heteroatoms (O and S)&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) molecules with (&#946;, &#946;) connected furan/thiophene ring. The optical and physiochemical properties of both compounds are investigated by a variety of spectroscopies, including UV&#8208;vis absorption, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, their ultrafast excited state dynamics are studied by femtosecond transient absorption. Experimental data showed that the singlet fission efficiency was improved by 2 times when replacing oxygen with sulfur atom, which could provide some guidelines in designing singlet fission materials with better efficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ephrin type&#8208;A receptor 2 (EPHA2) belongs to the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases. There are several indications of an involvement of EPHA2 in the development of infectious diseases and cancer. Despite pharmacological potential, EPHA2 is an under&#8208;examined target protein. In this study, we synthesized a series of derivatives of the inhibitor NVP&#8208;BHG712 and triazine&#8208;based compounds. These compounds were evaluated to determine their potential as kinase inhibitors of EPHA2, including elucidation of their binding mode (X&#8208;ray crystallography), affinity (microscale thermophoresis), and selectivity (kinobeads assay). Eight inhibitors showed affinities in the low nanomolar regime (KD &lt; 10 nM). Testing in up to seven colon cancer cell lines that express EPHA2 reveals that several derivatives feature promising effects for control of human colon carcinoma. Thus, we have developed a set of powerful tool compounds for fundamental new research on the interplay of EPH receptors in a cellular context.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>BODIPY&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor dyads are widely used as sensors and probes in life science. Thus, their biophysical properties are well established in solution, while their photophysical properties in cellulo, i.e., in the environment, in which the dyes are designed to function, are generally understood less. To address this issue, we present a sub&#8208;ns time&#8208;resolved transient absorption study of the excited&#8208;state dynamics of a BODIPY&#8208;perylene dyad designed as a twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) probe of the local viscosity in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene C70 as Photoredox Catalyst for the Synthesis of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8209;a]isoquinolines via 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition&#8208;Aromatization Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce fullerene (C70) as an effective photoredox catalyst for the construction of a highly functionalised pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline framework via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition&#8208;aromatisation reaction sequence. The ability of C70 to efficiently harvest visible light, its long&#8208;triplet state lifetime, good photostability, and strong singlet oxygen generation potential (&#1060;&#8776;1), make it an efficient photoredox catalyst. Upon photoirradiation, C70 promotes the formation of singlet oxygen and superoxide radical via energy transfer (EnT) and single electron transfer (SET) mechanism, which acts as a potential oxidant in the formation of azomethine ylide through the oxidation&#8208;deprotonation tandem process, which further participates in [3 + 2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction protocol with alkene/alkyne to give the corresponding pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Interestingly, this protocol allows the activation of a wide range of substrates giving access to a diverse library of 48 well&#8208;decorated pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Dihaloalkenynes via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the PdII&#8208;catalyzed construction of functionalized dihaloalkenynes from haloalkynes via a self&#8208;haloalkynylation reaction, without specialized ligands or oxidizing additives, is reported. The method tolerates a diverse range of haloalkynes, including electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups, such as macrocyclic alkynols, spiro&#8208;oxy ring alkynols, and even carbazole&#8208;containing, pyrrolidine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione&#8208;containing and silyl&#8208;protected bromoalkynes. Using an opposite lithium halide (LiX) to the haloalkyne starting material, remarkably high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the haloalkynylation reaction is possible, yielding 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;chloroalkenyne or 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;chloroalkenyne products as desired.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Thioesters from Aldehydes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Catalyzed Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient reaction has been developed for thioesterification of aldehydes via radical relay by NHC catalysis. The key step is the coupling of the Breslow radical cation with the heteroatom radical (sulfur&#8208;radical). The excellent yields and broad substrate scope illustrated the efficiency of this strategy for achieving novel reactions via NHC catalysis.







Abstract
We have developed an efficient N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed thioesterification of aldehydes using N&#8208;thiosuccinimides as the thiolation reagent. This organocatalyzed transition involves the generation of sulfur radicals by single electron transfer of the Breslow enolate (generated from aldehyde and NHC catalyst) with N&#8208;thiosuccinimides. This method offers facile access to various highly functionalized thioesters and exhibits good chemical yields and functional group tolerance.

The metastable phase Ge32Co9&#8722;x has been synthesized at high&#8208;pressure and temperature. It adopts a new structure type with three&#8208;core heteroclusters and unique chemical bonding. Units of three condensed cubes interconnect by sharing vertices and edges. As a result, two congruent frameworks interpenetrate while being separated by &#8220;empty space&#8221; housing lone pairs and covalent Ge&#8722;Ge bonds.







Abstract
The compound Ge32Co9&#8722;x (x=0.54(6), a=10.9861(3)&#8197;&#197;, space group Im
m) prepared under high pressure and at high temperature is metastable under ambient conditions. It crystallizes in a new structure type, Pearson symbol cI82&#8722;1.08. The crystal structure represents a slightly distorted cubic primitive arrangement of germanium atoms with part of the Ge cubes filled by cobalt. Analysis of the chemical bonding by real&#8208;space methods revealed three&#8208;core cluster units Ge16Co3 and seemingly empty regions comprising either covalent inter&#8208;polyhedral Ge&#8722;Ge bonds or lone&#8208;pairs located at the germanium atoms. The electrical conductivity is metal&#8208;like.

         <title>Probing Peptidylprolyl Bond cis/trans Status Using Distal 19F NMR Reporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that incorporation of 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine in model peptides provides an accurate and non&#8208;biased reporter of peptidylprolyl cis&#8208;trans conformational status by 19F NMR at physiological pH, even when several residues away from proline. In simple models, the prolyl bond conformational populations are predominantly governed by the amino acids local to proline and are conserved across different model systems.







Abstract
A method for measuring peptidylprolyl bond cis&#8208;trans conformational status in peptide models is described, using 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine (4FPhe) as a distal reporter for 19F NMR. The %cis&#8208;Pro population was measured for peptides of the general structure Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe (X and Z are proteinogenic amino acids) at pH&#8197;7.4, and provided conformational populations consistent with literature values obtained by more complex methods. This approach was applied to probe the prolyl bond status in pentapeptide models of the intrinsically disordered C&#8208;terminal region of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which mirrored the preferences in the Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe models. Advantageously, the 19F reporter group does not need to be adjacent to or attached to proline to provide quantifiable signals and distal 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanines can be placed so as not to influence prolyl bond conformation. Finally, we demonstrated that the prolyl bond status is not significantly affected by pH when there are ionisable amino acid residues at the carboxyl side of proline, which makes 19F NMR an invaluable tool with which to study proline isomerism at a range of pHs and in different solvents and buffers.

         <title>Selectivity Rule of Cryptands for Anions: Molecular Rigidity and Bonding Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cryptand cages with either &#8722;NH or &#8722;CH groups were computationally studied to identify their differences and determine the factors governing the anion preference. While the electrostatic interaction plays the predominating role in the capturing of halide anions by all CH/NH receptors, computational analyses revealed that the electrostatic attraction also rules the selectivity of &#8722;NH cryptands for halide anions. In contrast, the molecular rigidity governs the anion preference of &#8722;CH cryptands.







Abstract
Cryptands utilize inside CH or NH groups as hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) donors to capture anions such as halides. In this work, the nature and selectivity of confined hydrogen bonds inside cryptands were computationally analyzed with the energy decomposition scheme based on the block&#8208;localized wavefunction method (BLW&#8208;ED), aiming at an elucidation of governing factors in the binding between cryptands and anions. It was revealed that the intrinsic strengths of inward hydrogen bonds are dominated by the electrostatic attraction, while the anion preferences (selectivity) of inner CH and NH hydrogen bonds are governed by the Pauli exchange repulsion and electrostatic interaction, respectively. Typical conformers of cages are classified into two groups, including the C3(h)&#8208;symmetrical conformers, in which all halide anions are located near the centroids of cages, and the &#8220;semi&#8208;open&#8221; conformers, which exhibit shifted bonding sites for different halide anions. Accordingly, the difference in governing factors of selectivity is attributed to either the rigidity of cages or the binding site of anions for these two groups. In details, the C3 conformers of NH cryptands can be enlarged more remarkably than the C3(h)&#8208;symmetrical conformers of CH cryptands as the size of anion (ionic radius) increases, resulting in the relaxation of the Pauli repulsion and a dramatic reduction in electrostatic attraction, which eventually rules the selectivity of NH cryptands for halide anions. By contrary, the CH cryptands are more rigid and cannot effectively reduce the Pauli repulsion, which subsequently governs the anion preference. Unlike C3 conformers whose rigidity determines the selectivity, semi&#8208;open conformers exhibit different binding sites for different anions. From F&#8722; to I&#8722;, the bonding site shifts toward the outside end of the pocket inside the semi&#8208;open NH cryptand, leading to the significant reduction of the electrostatic interaction that dominates the anion preference. Differently, binding sites are much less affected by the size of anion inside the semi&#8208;open CH cryptand, in which the Pauli exchange repulsion remains the key factor for the selectivity of inner hydrogen bonds.

     alt="Selectivity Rule of Cryptands for Anions: Molecular Rigidity and Bonding Site"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cryptand cages with either &#8722;NH or &#8722;CH groups were computationally studied to identify their differences and determine the factors governing the anion preference. While the electrostatic interaction plays the predominating role in the capturing of halide anions by all CH/NH receptors, computational analyses revealed that the electrostatic attraction also rules the selectivity of &#8722;NH cryptands for halide anions. In contrast, the molecular rigidity governs the anion preference of &#8722;CH cryptands.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptands utilize inside CH or NH groups as hydrogen bond (H-bond) donors to capture anions such as halides. In this work, the nature and selectivity of confined hydrogen bonds inside cryptands were computationally analyzed with the energy decomposition scheme based on the block-localized wavefunction method (BLW-ED), aiming at an elucidation of governing factors in the binding between cryptands and anions. It was revealed that the intrinsic strengths of inward hydrogen bonds are dominated by the electrostatic attraction, while the anion preferences (selectivity) of inner CH and NH hydrogen bonds are governed by the Pauli exchange repulsion and electrostatic interaction, respectively. Typical conformers of cages are classified into two groups, including the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3(h)&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetrical conformers, in which all halide anions are located near the centroids of cages, and the &#8220;semi-open&#8221; conformers, which exhibit shifted bonding sites for different halide anions. Accordingly, the difference in governing factors of selectivity is attributed to either the rigidity of cages or the binding site of anions for these two groups. In details, the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; conformers of NH cryptands can be enlarged more remarkably than the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3(h)&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetrical conformers of CH cryptands as the size of anion (ionic radius) increases, resulting in the relaxation of the Pauli repulsion and a dramatic reduction in electrostatic attraction, which eventually rules the selectivity of NH cryptands for halide anions. By contrary, the CH cryptands are more rigid and cannot effectively reduce the Pauli repulsion, which subsequently governs the anion preference. Unlike &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; conformers whose rigidity determines the selectivity, semi-open conformers exhibit different binding sites for different anions. From F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, the bonding site shifts toward the outside end of the pocket inside the semi-open NH cryptand, leading to the significant reduction of the electrostatic interaction that dominates the anion preference. Differently, binding sites are much less affected by the size of anion inside the semi-open CH cryptand, in which the Pauli exchange repulsion remains the key factor for the selectivity of inner hydrogen bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An isolable linear aminoborylene: A dicoordinate cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized aminoborylene isoelectronic with an allene undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;C bond activation under photolytic conditions, intramolecular aryl migration in the presence of acetonitrile, one&#8208;electron oxidation with copper(I) halides to the corresponding haloboryl radicals, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like binding of CO and reduction of N2O, sulfur and selenium, the latter yielding a terminal boraselenone.







Abstract
A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicoordinate aminoborylene is synthesized by the twofold reduction of a [(CAAC)BCl2(TMP)] (TMP=2,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl) precursor. NMR&#8208;spectroscopic, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational analyses confirm the cumulenic nature of the central C=B=N moiety. Irradiation of [(CAAC)B(TMP)] (2) resulted in an intramolecular C&#8722;C bond activation, leading to a doubly&#8208;fused C10BN heterocycle, while the reaction with acetonitrile resulted in an aryl migration from the CAAC to the acetonitrile nitrogen atom, concomitant with tautomerization of the latter to a boron&#8208;bound allylamino ligand. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 2 with CuX (X=Cl, Br) afforded the corresponding amino(halo)boryl radicals, which were characterized by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Placing 2 under an atmosphere of CO afforded the tricoordinate (CAAC,CO)&#8208;stabilized aminoborylene. Finally, the twofold oxidation of 2 with chalcogens led, in the case of N2O and sulfur, to the splitting of the B&#8722;CCAAC bond and formation of the 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;dichalcogenadiboretanes and CAAC&#8208;chalcogen adducts, whereas with selenium a monomeric boraselenone was isolated, which showed some degree of B&#8722;Se multiple bonding.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonding in the &#960; Radical HBP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiply bonded &#960; radical HBP has been generated and characterized for the first time. Bonding analysis suggest that it differs from the isovalent HNB since the unpaired electron occupies one of the doubly degenerate &#960; bonding MOs, resulting in a B&#8722;P bond order of two and half.







Abstract
The HBP radical was generated via the reaction of laser ablated boron atom with PH3 in a solid neon matrix, which is identified via IR spectroscopy with isotopic substitutions and quantum chemical calculations. The results show that HBP has a 2&#928; electronic ground state with a short B&#8722;P bond. Bonding analysis indicates that besides an electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, there are two degenerate &#960; bonding orbitals that are occupied by three electrons, resulting in a bond order of two and half between P and B. This is in sharp contrast to the bonding properties of the isovalent HNB, which was characterized to be a N&#8801;B triply bonded &#963; radical with the unpaired electron locating on the B atom.

Abstract
A series of hitherto unknown 5,14&#8208;diphenylbenzo[j]naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;def][2,7]phenanthrolines, containing a 5&#8208;azatetracene and a 2&#8208;azapyrene subunit, were prepared by combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a one&#8208;pot Povarov/cycloisomerization reaction. In the final key step four new bonds are formed in one step. The synthetic approach allows for a high degree of diversification of the heterocyclic core structure. The optical and electrochemical properties were studied experimentally and by DFT/TD&#8208;DFT and NICS calculations. Due to the presence of the 2&#8208;azapyrene subunit, the typical electronic nature and characteristics of the 5&#8208;azatetracene moiety are lost and the compounds are electronically and optically more related to 2&#8208;azapyrenes.

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Supramolecular Nanoring Composed of Bent&#8208;Shaped Cyanostilbene Derivatives and Cucurbit[8]urils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we materialized zero dimensional supramolecular organic framework with enhanced emission. We designed bent&#8208;shape guest molecule by novel backbone &#8220;cyanostilbene&#8221;. This unique bent&#8208;shape molecule only emitted enhanced fluorescence with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) as a host in water. This nano&#8208;confined emissive molecule also formed homogeneous system without bundling at the high concentration when it became complex with CB[8].







Abstract
Supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) made of organic guest molecule and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in aqueous solution have great potential for diverse applications. Herein, we designed highly fluorescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nano&#8208;ring SOF with CB[8] as a host and novel bent&#8208;shaped cyanostilbene guest. This host&#8211;guest complex successfully formed macrocyclic hexamer and showed significantly enhanced fluorescence (&#934;F=68&#8201;%) compared to non&#8208;assembled monomer (&#934;F=2&#8201;%). Unlike other SOFs, this 0D SOF could be dispersed uniformly without bundling phenomenon in water.

         <title>Ab Initio Metadynamics Simulations of Hexafluoroisopropanol Solvent Effects: Synergistic Role of Solvent H&#8208;Bonding Networks and Solvent&#8208;Solute C&#8722;H/&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab initio metadynamics simulations under explicit solvent environments were performed to investigate the promotion effect of HFIP solvent in Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and Cope rearrangement reactions. The H&#8208;bonding network and the HFIP&#8208;substrate C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction are identified as the major factors affecting reactivity.







Abstract
The solvent effects in Friedel&#8211;Crafts cycloalkylation of epoxides and Cope rearrangement of aldimines were investigated by using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Explicit molecular treatments were applied for both reactants and solvents. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated via free energy calculations based on metadynamics simulations. The results reveal that both reactions proceed in a concerted fashion. Key solvent&#8208;substrate interactions are identified from the structures of transition states with explicit solvent molecules. The remarkable promotion effect of hexafluoroisopropanol solvent is ascribed to the synergistic effect of H&#8208;bonding networks and C&#8722;H/&#960; interactions with substrates.

         <title>High&#8208;Tc 1D Phase&#8208;Transition Semiconductor Photoluminescent Material with Broadband Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite photoelectric multifunctional material: [C7H13ONCH2F] PbBr3 (1) was successfully designed and synthesised. It realized the coupling of thermo&#8208;dielectric switching characteristics, semiconductor characteristics and photoluminescence characteristics of STE broadband emission.







Abstract
One dimensional (1D) organic&#8208;inorganic halide hybrid perovskites have the advantages of excellent organic cation modifiability and diversity of inorganic framework structures, which cannot be ignored in the development of multi&#8208;functional phase&#8208;transition materials in photoelectric and photovoltaic devices. Here, we have successfully modified and synthesized an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite photoelectric multifunctional phase&#8208;transition material: [C7H13ONCH2F]&#8901;PbBr3 (1). The synergistic effect of the order double disorder transition of organic cations and the change of the degree of distortion of the inorganic framework leads to its high temperature reversible phase&#8208;transition point of Tc=374&#8197;K/346&#8197;K and its ultra&#8208;low loss high&#8208;quality dielectric switch response. Through in&#8208;depth research and calculation, compound 1 also has excellent semiconductor characteristics with a band gap of 3.06&#8197;eV and the photoluminescence characteristics of self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) broadband emission. Undoubtedly, this modification strategy provides a new choice for the research field of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite reversible phase&#8208;transition photoelectric multifunctional materials with rich coupling properties.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Induced Bathochromic Emission in Columnar Discotic Liquid Crystals Realized by Intramolecular Planarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most organic thermochromic fluorescent materials exhibit thermo&#8208;induced hypsochromic emission due to the formation of excimers in ordered molecular solids; however, it is still a challenge to endow them with bathochromic emission despite its significance in making up the field of thermochromism. Here, we report a thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission in columnar discotic liquid crystals realized by intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores. We synthesized a kind of three&#8208;armed discotic molecules of dialkylamino&#8208;tricyanotristyrylbenzenes, which preferred to twist out of the core plane to accommodate ordered molecular stacking in hexagonal columnar mesophases, giving rise to bright green monomer emission. However, intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores occurred in isotropic liquid increasing the conjugation length, and as a result led to thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission from green to yellow light. This work reports a new concept in the thermochromic field and provides a novel strategy to achieve fluorescence tuning from intramolecular actions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The operation of nanomachines is fundamentally different from that of their macroscopic counterparts. In particular, the role of solvent is critical yet rarely associated with machine functionality. Here we study a minimal model of one of the most advanced molecular machines to gain control of its operation by engineering components and the employed solvent. Operation kinetics were changed over more than four orders of magnitude and could be modulated by solvent. Leveraging solvent properties, it was possible to monitor the relaxation of the molecular machine towards equilibrium and measure the heat exchanged in the process. Our work expands the capabilities of acid&#8208;base powered molecular machines, confirming experimentally that such systems have a dominant entropy content.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Conformational Plasticity of the Protein Kinase Akt1 by Multi&#8208;Lateral Dipolar Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The serine/threonine kinase Akt1 is part of the PI3K/Akt pathway and plays a key role in the regulation of various cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Here, we analysed the elasticity between the two domains of the kinase Akt1, connected by a flexible linker, recording a wide variety of distance restraints by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We studied full length Akt1 and the influence of the cancer&#8208;associated mutation E17K. The conformational landscape in the presence of different modulators, like different types of inhibitors and membranes was presented, revealing a tuned flexibility between the two domains, dependent on the bound molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of a Diverse Range of Boron Heterocycles via Ring Expansion of a Carboranyl&#8208;Substituted 9&#8208;Borafluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct insertion of unsaturated substrates into a five&#8208;membered borole ring is a useful method to obtain valuable heterocycles containing one or more three&#8208;coordinate boron atoms. A 9&#8208;o&#8208;carboranyl&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene, in which the&#160;o&#8208;carboranyl substituent is connected via one of the cluster carbon atoms to the boron atom of the 9&#8208;borafluorene unit, was found to react with a vast array of unsaturated molecules, such as alkynes, aldehydes and various organic azides, to form larger boraheterocyclic products. The ring expansion reactions of the central borole ring proceed rapidly at room temperature, cementing the role of the&#160;o&#8208;carboranyl substituent in enhancing the insertion reactivity of 9&#8208;borafluorenes.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 for ultrasensitive detection of chloramphenicol: experimental and computational investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasensitive electrochemical detection on hazardous substances like antibiotics and pesticides is essential but still challenging in rapid test technology. Herein, we proposed the first electrode using high conductive metal organic frameworks (HCMOFs) for electrochemical detection of chloramphenicol, and demonstrated that Pd can be loaded onto HCMOFs to design the electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 with ultra&#8208;sensitivity in detection of chloramphenicol. An ultra&#8208;low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2 nM (64.6 pg/mL) was observed, which is 1&#8208;2 order of magnitude lower than those of the reported materials as well as chromatographic detection. Moreover, the proposed HCMOFs showed long&#8208;time stability over 24 h. The superior detection sensitivity can be attributed to the high conductivity of Ni3(HITP)2, and the large content of Pd loading. The experimental characterizations and computational investigation consistently point out that the Pd loading mechanism in Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 is PdCl2 adsorption on the abundant adsorption sites of Ni3(HITP)2. The proposed electrochemical sensor design using HCMOFs was demonstrated to be both effective and efficient, showing that the adoption of HCMOFs decorated with other effective electrocatalysts, combining high conductivity and large loading of electrocatalysts, can be of great advantages for ultrasensitive detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd/Co Catalyst with High Pd Atom Utilization Efficiency for Nitrobenzene Hydrogenation at Room Temperature: Experimental and DFT Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Put to good use: A Pd&#8208;doped Co (Pd/Co) catalyst with high Pd atom utilization efficiency was designed and prepared for hydrogenation of nitroarenes. Its catalytic activity was much better than commercial Pd powder (&gt;150 times) in nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction. This work might provide a simple and low&#8208;cost methodology to design and synthesize highly efficient catalysts.







Abstract
Enhancing catalytic performance as well as reducing catalyst cost are the eternal pursuit for the catalysis community. Herein, a simple and effective palladium&#8208;doped cobalt (Pd/Co) catalyst with high Pd atom utilization efficiency was synthesized via galvanic replacement reaction for the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene with H2 at room temperature, delivering &gt;99&#8201;% yield of aniline with up to 158 times higher catalytic activity than commercial palladium powder. Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that Co&#8722;Pd interaction leads to a decrease in electron density of Pd and the distance between Pd atoms that results in the enhanced catalytic performance. Further experiments indicated that the Pd/Co catalyst serves as a highly efficient, selective, and recyclable catalyst for a range of nitroarene substrates. This work might provide a green and sustainable methodology to design and synthesize highly active catalysts with high utilization efficiency of the noble metals in fundamental and applied research.

Travelling without moving: A Ferrier rearrangement/aza&#8208;Wacker cyclization on commercial glycals allows both a 3,4&#8208;cis amination at position three and a motion of the double bound restoring the glycal. Epoxidation/glycosylation of N&#8208;Ts 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxygalactal provided disaccharide with high diastereoselectivity and yield, thus defining FAWEG (Ferrier/Aza&#8208;Wacker/Epoxidation/Glycosylation) as a new sequence to access 1,2&#8208;trans 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides.







Abstract
3&#8208;Amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides constitute an essential class of nitrogen&#8208;containing sugars. Among them, many important 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides possess a 1,2&#8208;trans relationship. In view of their numerous biological applications, the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosyl donors giving rise to a 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic linkage is thus an important challenge. Even though glycals are highly polyvalent donors, the synthesis and reactivity of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycals have been little studied. In this work, we describe a new sequence, involving a Ferrier rearrangement and subsequent aza&#8208;Wacker cyclization that allows the rapid synthesis of orthogonally protected 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycals. Finally a 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxygalactal derivative was submitted for the first time to an epoxidation/glycosylation with high yield and great diastereoselectivity, highlighting FAWEG (Ferrier/Aza&#8208;Wacker/Epoxidation/Glycosylation) as a new approach to access 1,2&#8208;trans 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides.

         <title>Morphological Evolution of Calcite Grown in Bipolar&#8208;Charged Hydrogels: Charge Effects Enhanced by Gel&#8208;Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of charged biomacromolecules is widely found in biomineralization. To investigate the significance of this biological strategy for mineralization control, we examined gelatin&#8208;incorporated calcite crystals grown from gelatin hydrogels with different charge distributions along the gel networks. We found that the charged groups on gelatin networks (amino cations, &#8211;NH3+ and carboxylic anions, &#8211;COO&#8208;) play crucial roles in controlling the crystallinity and the crystal morphology. And the charge effects are greatly enhanced by the gel&#8208;incorporation because the gel networks force the charged groups to attach to crystallization fronts. In contrast, ammonium ions (NH4+) and acetate ions (Ac&#8208;) dissolve in the crystallization media do not exhibit the similar charge effects because they easily desorb from the crystallization fronts. Employing the revealed charge effects, the calcite crystal composites with different morphologies can be flexibly prepared.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognizing the Minimum Structural Units Driving the Crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34 in a Top&#8208;Down Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A top&#8208;down synthesis system was designed to study the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34. Based on characterizations on a clear precursor solution with abundant nuclei and designed synthesis experiments, it was demonstrated that the formation of small species containing Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds is crucial for driving the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34, rather than structural units with specific spatial conformation.







Abstract
Recognizing the structure and nature of the nuclei for zeolites crystallization on an atomic level is of great importance, which can provide guidance on the control of crystallization kinetics and the rational synthesis of zeolites. However, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the difficulty in characterization of amorphous precursor with limited crystal nuclei. Herein, a top&#8208;down synthesis system was designed for SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieve and well investigated. A clear precursor solution with abundant SAPO&#8208;34 crystal nuclei was obtained under a depolymerization&#8208;dominant condition. The species in the liquid precursor were identified by FT&#8208;ICR MS, solid&#8208;state MAS NMR and atomic pair distribution function analyses. In combination with various designed experiments, it is revealed that both the formation of small species containing Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds and reaching a certain concentration, is crucial for driving the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34, rather than structural units with specific spatial conformation. This work provides an important understanding on the (pre)nucleation of SAPO&#8208;34 and sheds light on the synthesis control of SAPO molecular sieves.

         <title>Enhancing the Activity of an Alcohol Dehydrogenase by Using &#8220;Aromatic Residue Scanning &#8221; at Potential Plasticity Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An alcohol dehydrogenase LkADH was successfully engineered to exhibitimproved activity and substrate tolerance for the production of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol, an important precursor of ticagrelor. Five potential hotspots were identified for enzyme mutagenesis by using natural residue abundance as an indicator to evaluate their potential plasticity. A semi&#8208;rational strategy named &#8220;aromatic residue scanning&#8221; was applied to randomly mutate these five sites simultaneously by using tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine as &#8220;exploratory residues&#8221; to introduce steric hindrance or potential &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. The best variant Lk&#8208;S96Y/L199W identified with 17.2&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency could completely reduce up to 600 g/L (3.1 M) 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethenone in 12 h with &gt;99.5% ee, giving the highest space&#8208;time yield ever reported. This study, therefore, offers a strategy for mutating alcohol dehydrogenase to reduce aromatic substrates and provides an efficient variant for the efficient synthesis of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Co2+ to Al3+ aliovalent substitution induced dual&#8208;site synergistic catalysis to Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dual&#8208;site synergistic effect in heterogeneous catalysis is quite interesting, and also complex because at least two substrate molecules are adsorbed or activated on the catalyst surface, which apparently needs two spatially separated and functionally independent active sites. It would become more difficult when the substrate molecules are large ones. The replacement of Al3+ in Al4B6O15 lattice with Co2+ leads to the formation of unsaturated Co2+ (4&#8208;fold coordination) along with oxygen vacancies (O v ). The former one behaves as a medium&#8208;strength Lewis acid site, and can adsorb and activate molecules with a nitro group (e.g., &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene). The latter one can adsorb and activate oxygen species, which further activates the indole derivatives. Next, the spatially separated dual sites on the catalyst surface can synergistically and efficiently catalyze their Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reactions under mild conditions. The high durability can be proved by the as&#8208;maintained high yields, i.e. 98%, 93%, 96%, 92% and 90% for 5 runs, respectively. The reaction kinetics obey the second&#8208;order characteristic. Annealing under hydrogen condition can further generate more surficial O v , leading to an improvement to the catalytic activity. A simple and probably routine aliovalent doping endows such a complex synergistic catalysis involving two large substrate molecules, providing an inspired perspective of developing dual&#8208;site catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a B&#8208;Antigen Hexasaccharide, a B&#8208;Lewis b Heptasaccharide and Glycoconjugates Thereof to Investigate Binding Properties of Helicobacter pylori</title>

Introduction of the Gal&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(B)&#8208;determinant into a versatile Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose precursor followed by mono&#8208; or difucosylation afforded, after deprotection, the B&#8208;Lewis b heptasaccharide and the B&#8208;hexasaccharide structures, which were conjugated to BSA to yield glycoconjugates. Initial inhibition studies investigates the dependence of the binding to H. pylori strains on loading and the presence of B (Gal) and Lewis (Fuc) determinants.







Abstract
Infecting the stomach of almost 50&#8201;% of people, Helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis, peptic ulcers and stomach cancers. Interactions between bacterial membrane&#8208;bound lectin, Blood group Antigen Binding Adhesin (BabA), and human blood group antigens are key in the initiation of infection. Herein, the synthesis of a B&#8208;antigen hexasaccharide (B6) and a B&#8208;Lewis b heptasaccharide (BLeb7) and Bovine Serum Albumin glycoconjugates thereof is reported to assess the binding properties and preferences of BabA from different strains. From a previously reported trisaccharide acceptor a versatile key Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose tetrasaccharide intermediate was synthesized, which allowed us to explore various routes to the final targets, either via initial introduction of fucosyl residues followed by introduction of the B&#8208;determinant or vice versa. The first approach proved unsuccessful, whereas the second afforded the target structures in good yields. Protein conjugation using isothiocyanate methodology allowed us to reach high glycan loadings (up to 23 per protein) to mimic multivalent displays encountered in Nature. Protein glycoconjugate inhibition binding studies were performed with H. pylori strains displaying high or low affinity for Lewis b hexasaccharide structures showing that the binding to the high affinity strain was reduced due to the presence of the B&#8208;determinant in the Bleb7&#8208;conjugates and further reduced by the absence of the Lewis fucose residue in the B6&#8208;conjugate.

Protein conjugation using isothiocyanate methodology allowed us to reach high glycan loadings (up to 23 per protein) to mimic multivalent displays encountered in Nature. Protein glycoconjugate inhibition binding studies were performed with &lt;i&gt;H. pylori&lt;/i&gt; strains displaying high or low affinity for Lewis b hexasaccharide structures showing that the binding to the high affinity strain was reduced due to the presence of the B-determinant in the Bleb7-conjugates and further reduced by the absence of the Lewis fucose residue in the B6-conjugate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effect of Mini&#8208;PEGs Modification on the Enzymatic Digestion of D&#8208;Amino Acid&#8208;Containing Peptides under the Action of PROK
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mini&#8208;PEGs modified D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides were synthesized. It was determined that the polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification promoted the enzymatic cleavage of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides under the action of serine&#8208;like proteases.







Abstract
It was previously reported that D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides exhibited the ability to resist enzymatic hydrolysis. This study investigated the influence of mini&#8208;PEGs modification on enzymatic hydrolysis ability of D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides. The results showed that PEGylation promoted enzymatic hydrolysis of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide, especially, the cleavage rate of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide 6&#8208;w with PEG3 modification at the N&#8208;ends was up to 17 times higher in the presence of proteinase K (PROK) compared to those without PEG3 modification. Moreover, analysis of the enzymatic cleavage sites demonstrated a similar cleavage pattern of the PEGylated D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide to that of the unmodified peptide. The computational simulations further showed that the enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis ability can be attributed to the strong interaction between PROK and the peptide after PEG3 modification and the resulting formation of a mature catalytic triad structure.

         <title>l&#8208;Serine is the Direct Precursor for the Pyrazine Ring Construction in the Biosynthesis of 3&#8208;Isobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;Methoxypyrazine in Bell Pepper Fruits (Capsicum annuum L.)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of 3&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazine (IBMP) was investigated in plants using in&#8197;vivo feeding experiments with stable&#8208;isotope labeled precursors. It has been demonstrated that photorespiratory derived l&#8208;serine serves as a C2&#8208;builing block and an N&#8208;donor in IBMP&#8208;biosynthesis.







Abstract
3&#8208;Isobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazine (IBMP) is an extremely potent odorant and responsible for the specific aroma of many fruits and vegetables. Especially bell pepper contains high levels of IBMP, which is the character impact compound of its typical aroma. However, since the discovery of methoxypyrazines in plants in the 1960s the biosynthesis of their pyrazine ring motif remained so far unknown. Therefore, the biosynthetic pathway to IBMP was investigated by feeding experiments with stable&#8208;isotope labeled precursors. For the first time it could be shown that l&#8208;serine plays a key role in the pyrazine ring construction of 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazines (MPs). Based on HS&#8208;SPME&#8208;GCxGC&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS analysis, it is shown that the biosynthetic pathway to IBMP is closely linked to photorespiratory derived l&#8208;serine.

         <title>Asymmetrical Platinum and Rhodium Dinuclear Complex Strongly Bound to Filled d
 Complexes by Unbridged Pt&#8722;Metal Bonds: Toward Heterometallic&#8208;Extended Metal Atom Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Line up, line up! HOMO&#8208;LUMO interactions between metal d
 orbitals were used to synthesize hetero&#8208;xtended metal atom chains (EMACs) for tuning the number of nuclei and metal species. Mixing an asymmetrical Pt&#8722;Rh dinuclear complex with a LUMO in the &#963;* orbital and a mononuclear complex with a HOMO in the d
 orbital allows two&#8208;step multinucleation, affording hetero&#8208;EMACs with three well&#8208;aligned metal species.







Abstract
Heterometallic extended metal atom chains (EMACs) aligned with three types of metal were rationally synthesized by forming unbridged metal&#8722;metal bonds based on the interactions between highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals at the d
 orbital. These chains form pentanuclear structures aligned as Rh&#8722;Pt&#8722;M&#8722;Pt&#8722;Rh with relatively large formation constants of 5.0&#215;1013&#8197;M&#8722;2 for M=Pt and 6.3&#215;1011&#8197;M&#8722;2 for M=Pd, while retaining their backbones in solution. In the case of M=Cu, the original Cu(+2) atoms were reduced to Cu(+1) during the synthetic process. Cu(+1) has an unprecedented trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. The reported synthesis based on asymmetrical dinuclear complexes provides a guideline for the synthesis of hetero&#8208;EMACs to allow several analogs through judicious combinations realized by tuning the number of metal nuclei and metal species.

A low&#8208;cost and environmentally benign iron(III) catalyst triggers a novel cascade reaction paving the way to synthesize various heterocycles and spirocycles. Appropriate design of substrates by using simple starting materials could provide access to biologically and synthetically useful products as depicted through the generation of exquisite alpana art decorated with simple flowers. The putative mechanistic cycle represented herein tries to shed some light on the inherent chemistry involved with this methodology. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.

         <title>Fabricating Robust Pt Clusters on Sn&#8208;Doped CeO2 for CO Oxidation: A Deep Insight into Support Engineering and Surface Structural Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reported on a simple Sn&#8208;doped CeO2 approach to create oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies, and investigated the impact of such vacancies on the CO oxidation performance of Pt/CSO&#8208;a catalysts. The oxygen vacancies were found to limit Pt agglomeration and promote a smaller particle size of the Pt/CSO&#8208;a catalyst. The smaller particle size led to more exposed active sites, which enhanced the ability to activate oxygen and improve the catalytic activity towards CO oxidation.







Abstract
The size effect on nanoparticles, which affects the catalysis performance in a significant way, is crucial. The tuning of oxygen vacancies on metal&#8208;oxide support can help reduce the size of the particles in active clusters of Pt, thus improving catalysis performance of the supported catalyst. Herein, Ce&#8722;Sn solid solutions (CSO) with abundant oxygen vacancies have been synthesized. Activated by simple CO reduction after loading Pt species, the catalytic CO oxidation performance of Pt/CSO was significantly better than that of Pt/CeO2. The reasons for the elevated activity were further explored regarding ionic Pt single sites being transformed into active Pt clusters after CO reduction. Due to more exposed oxygen vacancies, much smaller Pt clusters were created on CSO (ca. 1.2&#8197;nm) than on CeO2 (ca. 1.8&#8197;nm). Consequently, more exposed active Pt clusters significantly improved the ability to activate oxygen and directly translated to the higher catalytic oxidation performance of activated Pt/CSO catalysts in vehicle emission control applications.

Activated by simple CO reduction after loading Pt species, the catalytic CO oxidation performance of Pt/CSO was significantly better than that of Pt/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The reasons for the elevated activity were further explored regarding ionic Pt single sites being transformed into active Pt clusters after CO reduction. Due to more exposed oxygen vacancies, much smaller Pt clusters were created on CSO (ca. 1.2&#8197;nm) than on CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (ca. 1.8&#8197;nm). Consequently, more exposed active Pt clusters significantly improved the ability to activate oxygen and directly translated to the higher catalytic oxidation performance of activated Pt/CSO catalysts in vehicle emission control applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microporous Metal&#8208;Phosphonates with a Novel Orthogonalized Linker and Complementary Guests: Insights for Trivalent Metal Complexes from Divalent Metal Complexes</title>

Metal&#8208;organic framework or smoked meat sandwiches? A novel orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker is used to direct formation of porous open frameworks. The network structures are highly dependent on the inclusion and structure of the guest aromatic compounds.







Abstract
The reliable self&#8208;assembly of microporous metal&#8208;phosphonate materials remains a longstanding challenge. This stems from, generally, more coordination modes for the functional group allowing more dense structures, and stronger bonding driving less crystalline products. Here, a novel orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphono&#8208;2&#8217;,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethylphenyl) benzene (H6L3) has been used to direct formation of open frameworks. The peripheral aryl rings of H6L3 are orthogonalized relative to the central aromatic ring giving a tri&#8208;cleft conformation of the linker in which small aromatic molecules can readily associate. When coordinated to magnesium ions, a series of porous crystalline metal&#8208;organic, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs, HMOFs) are formed (CALF&#8208;41 (Mg), HCALF&#8208;42 (Mg), &#8208;43 (Mg)). While most metal&#8208;organic frameworks are tailored based on choice of metal and linker, here, the network structures are highly dependent on the inclusion and structure of the guest aromatic compounds. Larger guests, and a higher stoichiometry of metal, result in increased solvation of the metal ion, resulting in networks with connectivities increasingly involving hydrogen&#8208;bonds rather than direct phosphonate coordination. Upon thermal activation and aromatic template removal, the materials exhibit surface areas ranging from 400&#8211;600&#8197;m2/g. Self&#8208;assembly in the absence of aromatic guests yields mixtures of phases, frequently co&#8208;producing a dense 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure (1). Interestingly, a series of both more porous (530&#8211;900&#8197;m2/g), and more robust solids is formed by complexing with trivalent metal ions (Al, Ga, In) with aromatic guest; however, these are only attainable as microcrystalline powders. The polyprotic nature of phosphonate linkers enables structural analogy to the divalent analogues and these are identified as CALF&#8208;41 analogues. Finally, insights to the structural transformations during metal ion desolvation in this family are gained by considering a pair of structurally related Co materials, whose hydrogen&#8208;bonded (HCALF&#8208;44 (Co)) and desolvated (CALF&#8208;44 (Co)) coordination bonded networks were fully structurally characterized.

Collaborative work: The synthesis of a new monoboranyl ligand scaffold is described. This ambiphilic diphosphine allows for the cooperative coordination of organonitriles in partnership with nickel(0).







Abstract
Metal&#8208;ligand cooperation has emerged as a versatile tool for substrate activation in chemical reactivity. Herein, we provide the synthesis and characterization of a monoboranyl&#8208;containing analogue of the ubiquitous bulky diphosphine ligand, 1,2&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)ethane, whose reactivity has been examined using nickel. Together, the pairing of nickel and boron provides a platform that allows for the cooperative coordination of organonitriles, giving unusual examples of intermolecularly bound dinickelacycles.

         <title>Heterophenoquinones: Tuning Optoelectronics and Electrochromicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of 16 thiophene&#8208;based heterophenoquinones. These compounds were accessed in a convergent and modular approach, allowing for their efficient synthesis. Tuning of the optical band gap was achieved through &#960;&#8208;extension by annulation of a benzene or tropone moiety to the thiophene, oxidation, change of the heteroatom or by attachment of a donor substituent to the thiophene core. The resulting compounds display intense colors covering the entire visible spectrum. We identified structure &#8208; property relationships and their impact on the HOMO and LUMO levels. Additionally, these materials change color upon reduction and according to in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near infrared (UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, they are promising electrochromes with cathodic color changes. Seven different electrochromic devices were constructed which all displayed a change in colour upon reduction, demonstrating the potential of these new dyes in e.g. tintable glass.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Large Genomic RNA via DNAzyme&#8208;Mediated RNA Cleavage and Rolling Circle Amplification: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as a Model</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a new method for the detection of genomic RNA that combines RNA cleavage by the 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme and use of the cleavage fragments as primers to initiate rolling circle amplification (RCA). We first screened 230 different 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme variants to identify those that target accessible RNA sites within the highly structured RNA transcripts of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. A total of 28 DNAzymes were identified with &gt;20% cleavage, 5 with &gt;40% cleavage and one with &gt;60% in 10 min. The cleavage fragments from these reactions were then screened for coupling to an RCA reaction, leading to the identification of several cleavage fragments that could efficiently initiate RCA. Using a newly developed quasi&#8208;exponential RCA method with a detection limit of 500 aM of RNA, we evaluated 14 RT&#8208;PCR positive and 15 RT&#8208;PCR negative patient saliva samples for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA, achieving a clinical sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 100% for detection of the virus in &lt;2.5 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of long&#8208;chain oligosaccharides for studying xylan&#8208;modifying enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plant research is hampered in several aspects by a lack of pure oligosaccharide samples that closely represent structural features of cell wall glycans. An alternative to purely chemical synthesis to access these oligosaccharides is chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis using glycosynthases. These enzymes enable the ligation of oligosaccharide donors, when activated for example as a&#8208;glycosyl fluorides, with suitable acceptor oligosaccharides. Herein, the synthesis of xylan oligosaccharides up to dodecasaccharides is reported, with glycosynthase&#8208;mediated coupling reactions as key steps. The xylo&#8208;oligosaccharide donors were protected at the non&#8208;reducing end with a 4&#8208;O&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group to prevent polymerization. Installation of an unnatural 3&#8208;O&#8208;methylether substituent at the reducing end xylose of the oligosaccharides ensured good water solubility. Biochemical assays demonstrated enzymatic activity for the xylan acetyltransferase XOAT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, xylan arabinofuranosyl&#8208;transferase XAT3 enzymes from rice and switchgrass, and the xylan glucuronosyltransferase GUX3 from Arabidopsis thaliana. In case of the glucuronosyltransferase GUX3, MALDI&#8208;MS/MS analysis of the reaction product suggested that a single glucuronosyl substituent was installed primarily at the central xylose residues of the dodecasaccharide acceptor, demonstrating the value of long&#8208;chain acceptors for assaying biosynthetic glycosyltransferases.</dc:description>

These enzymes enable the ligation of oligosaccharide donors, when activated for example as a-glycosyl fluorides, with suitable acceptor oligosaccharides. Herein, the synthesis of xylan oligosaccharides up to dodecasaccharides is reported, with glycosynthase-mediated coupling reactions as key steps. The xylo-oligosaccharide donors were protected at the non-reducing end with a 4-O-tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group to prevent polymerization. Installation of an unnatural 3-O-methylether substituent at the reducing end xylose of the oligosaccharides ensured good water solubility. Biochemical assays demonstrated enzymatic activity for the xylan acetyltransferase XOAT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, xylan arabinofuranosyl-transferase XAT3 enzymes from rice and switchgrass, and the xylan glucuronosyltransferase GUX3 from Arabidopsis thaliana.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hemipiperazines are a recently discovered class of peptide&#8208;derived molecular photoswitches with high biocompatibility and therapeutic potential. Here, for the first time we describe photochromism of heterocyclic hemipiperazines. They demonstrate long thermal lifetimes, enlarged band separation between photoisomers. Efficient photoisomerization occurs under aqueous conditions, although with a need for organic co&#8208;solvent. Bidirectional switching with visible light is observed for an extended aromatic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomerization of DASA Molecules in the Nanopores of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: What Determines Its Reversibility?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, light responsive molecules have been incorporated in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to fabricate light&#8208;responsive intelligent devices, where reversible isomerization of the guest molecules in the nanopores is crucial. However, how to design porous environment of MOFs to achieve a reversible isomerization remains unknown until now. In this work, donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA), a new kind of visible light responsive compounds, were confined in the nanopores of different MOFs to study their isomerization upon visible light irradiation/mild heating. We found that the polarity of the pore environment is the key to control the reversibility of isomerization of such guest molecules. Under the guidance of this principle, MIL&#8208;53(Al) was screened to investigate proton conductivity and switching performance of the DASA confined MOF. The proton conductance was up to 0.013 S cm&#8208;1 at 80 &#8451; and 98% RH, and at least 30 switching cycles were achieved thanks to the Grotthuss&#8208;type mechanism and low polarity of MIL&#8208;53(Al) pore environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress of Azametallacyclopentadienes in the New Century</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the key intermediates in metal promoted/catalyzed C&#8210;C bond coupling reactions of nitriles and alkynes, azametallacyclopentadienes, M(N=CR1&#8210;CR2=CR3), are an important class of azametallacycles. Although the first authentic azametallacyclopentadienes were documented in 1986, their chemistry towards solid&#8208;state structures, intrinsic reactivity and synthetic application was rarely investigated for a long time. At the beginning of this century, seminal works about the applications of azametallacyclopentadienes in the synthesis of heterocycles, including multi&#8208;substituted pyridines, isoquinolines, furans and pyrroles were reported. Subsequently, a series of new complexes with this motif, namely the group 4, aluminum, actinide and rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes were isolated and structurally characterized. Among them, the rare&#8208;earth metallacyclopentadiene expresses high reactivity towards unsaturated molecules, such as nitriles, isocyanides and Mo(CO)6 to provide novel fused metallacycles. In this concept, we summarized the advances towards the preparation, reactivity and synthetic application of azametallacyclopentadienes in past twenty years.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective transformations from nitriles to NH2&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tertiary amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules, containing one or more amine chiral centers, are very common to see in natural products and medicines. Although a large number of methods have been developed to afford enantiopure amines, most of the known approaches are limited with various reasons. For example, many methodologies start from nitrogen protected and activated substrates, which usually need multistep operations and seriously decrease the atom economy. Here we disclose a new catalytic strategy from commercial nitriles to high enantioselective &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines in up to 90% yield and 95% enantiomeric excess. This transformation firstly undergoes an addition process of organolithium reagents to nitriles to generate the imine intermediates in situ. Subsequently, the most challenging step is by employing copper catalytic enantioselective addition of AllylBpin to the imine intermediates to form the final amines in one pot.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanopore Deciphering Single Digital Polymers Towards&#160;High&#8208;Density Data Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequence&#8208;defined polymer is one of the most promising alternative media for high&#8208;density data storage. It could be used to alleviate the problem of insufficient storage capacity of conventional silicon&#8208;based devices for the explosively increasing data. To fulfil the goal of polymer data storage, suitable methods should be developed to accurately read and decode the information&#8208;containing polymers, especially for those composed by a combination of the natural and unnatural monomers. Nanopore&#8208;based approaches have become one of the most competitive analysis and sequencing techniques, which are expected to read both natural and synthetic polymers with single&#8208;molecule precision and monomeric resolution. Herein, this work emphasizes the advances being made in nanopore reading and decoding of information stored in the man&#8208;made polymers and DNA nanostructures, and discusses the challenges and opportunities towards the development and realization of high&#8208;density data storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;Selective Modification of Peptides and Proteins via Desulfurative C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;selective, visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated bioconjugation reaction that enables direct installation of a range of desired moieties into peptide and protein scaffolds via C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation is described. The method is rapid, operationally simple, tolerant to ambient atmosphere and can be utilized to incorporate general tools for chemical biology, including effective PTM mimics, via a stable, biogenic hydrocarbon linkage.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective modification of peptides and proteins facilitates the preparation of targeted therapeutic agents and tools to interrogate biochemical pathways. Among the numerous bioconjugation techniques developed to install groups of interest, those that generate C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds are significantly underrepresented despite affording proteolytically stable, biogenic linkages. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated reaction is described that enables the site&#8208;selective modification of peptides and proteins via desulfurative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. The reaction is rapid and high yielding in peptide systems, with comparable translation to proteins. Using this chemistry, a range of moieties is installed into model systems and an effective PTM&#8208;mimic is successfully integrated into a recombinantly expressed histone.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A cysteine-selective, visible-light-mediated bioconjugation&lt;/b&gt; reaction that enables direct installation of a range of desired moieties into peptide and protein scaffolds via C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond formation is described. The method is rapid, operationally simple, tolerant to ambient atmosphere and can be utilized to incorporate general tools for chemical biology, including effective PTM mimics, via a stable, biogenic hydrocarbon linkage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site-selective modification of peptides and proteins facilitates the preparation of targeted therapeutic agents and tools to interrogate biochemical pathways. Among the numerous bioconjugation techniques developed to install groups of interest, those that generate C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bonds are significantly underrepresented despite affording proteolytically stable, biogenic linkages. Herein, a visible-light-mediated reaction is described that enables the site-selective modification of peptides and proteins via desulfurative C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) bond formation. The reaction is rapid and high yielding in peptide systems, with comparable translation to proteins. Using this chemistry, a range of moieties is installed into model systems and an effective PTM-mimic is successfully integrated into a recombinantly expressed histone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery: The diagram exhibits an integrated photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery with the typical two&#8208;electrode configuration. This minireview introduces the general photo&#8208;assisted strategies and summarizes the recent advances of various photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery systems including Li&#8722;O2 battery, Zn&#8722;O2 battery and other metal&#8208;air batteries and highlights the remaining challenges and future opportunities.







Abstract
To meet the need of high energy density, long durability, safe and cost&#8208;efficient energy conversion and storage devices, metal&#8208;air batteries like Li&#8722;O2 and Zn&#8722;O2 batteries have received enormous attention and were subject to exciting development in the past decade. Photo&#8208;assisted strategies that enable the effective combination of photo/electric energy conversion/storage render a new dimension for the conventional metal&#8208;air batteries techniques with mere electric energy utilization. Therefore, tremendous research is ongoing in search of more efficient and durable devices with photo&#8208;assisted strategies. This review provides an overview of photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8722;O2 batteries, Zn&#8722;O2 batteries, and batteries with various metal/air components. The working mechanism, the basic device architecture and practical performances of various photo&#8208;assisted systems are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, certain technical challenges and future opportunities for the photo&#8208;assisted metal air batteries are emphasized and discussed in the hope of stimulating further research.

Synthesis of overcrowded negatively curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A hexabrominated benzo&#8208;fused tris&#8208;cycloheptenylene was &#960;&#8208;extended by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling to afford PAHs consisting of two heptagons and one octagon as a consequence of a ring&#8208;expanding 1,2&#8208;rearragement. This is due to the high steric demand. The title compounds display a blue to blue&#8208;green fluorescence and increased emission intensity as well as hypsochromic shifts in the solid state.

         <title>Chromatic Selectivity of Coumarin&#8208;Caged Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of green&#8208;light activatable DCCM photo&#8208;tethers allows efficient photocaging of oligonucleotides. In addition, DCCM can be used in combination with conventional blue&#8208;light absorbing DEACM to build an &#8220;orthogonal&#8221; system. It was suggested to rather use the term &#8220;chromatic selectivity&#8221; for which the necessary equations were provided. These showed that chromatic selectivity can even be adjusted by careful choice of starting material.







Abstract
A system of two coumarin&#8208;based caging groups is presented &#8211; one absorbing in the blue (400&#8211;450&#8197;nm) and the other absorbing in the green (480&#8211;550&#8197;nm) part of the visible spectrum. Together they form a pair, which allows to selectively photoactivate the one or the other in oligonucleotides. A numerical characterization defining the term &#8220;chromatic selectivity&#8221; was proposed, and it was shown how chromatically selective uncaging can literally be titrated in a kinetic reaction scheme.

         <title>Tin Active Sites Confined in Zeolite Framework as a Promising Shape&#8208;Selective Catalyst for Ethylene Oxide Hydration</title>

         <dc:description>
Topotactic conversion of germanosilicate UTL into stannosilicates Sn&#8208;PCR with various Sn contents have been realized through post&#8208;synthesis strategy. The Sn&#8208;PCR&#8208;20 (Si/Sn molar ratio of 77) catalyst served as a shape&#8208;selective nanoreactor for eco&#8208;efficient production of glycol.







Abstract
Shape&#8208;selective stannosilicates have been post&#8208;synthesized for the hydration of epoxide to diols. A simple acid treatment has been employed to remove extensively the interlayer double four ring units, converting the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) UTL germanosilicate into a 2D layered IPC&#8208;1P intermediate. Isomorphous incorporation of tetrahedrally coordinated Sn active centers was realized via solid&#8208;liquid treatment of IPC&#8208;1P with diammonium hexachlorostannate aqueous solution, which was accompanied by the spontaneous condensation of neighboring silica&#8208;rich cfi layers upon calcination and structural construction of a 3D PCR structure. Sn&#8208;PCR stannosilicates with tunable Sn contents were thus prepared. With Sn&#8208;derived robust Lewis acidity confined in the intersecting 10&#8208; and 8&#8208;ring channels, the Sn&#8208;PCR (Si/Sn molar ratio of 77) catalyst served as a shape&#8208;selective nanoreactor for the hydration of ethylene oxide (EO) into ethylene glycol (EG), exhibiting a remarkable EO conversion (99.5&#8201;%) as well as a steady EG selectivity (&gt;98.4&#8201;%) at greatly reduced H2O/EO molar ratio and near&#8208;ambient reaction temperature.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics in Borylated Arylisoquinoline Complexes in Solution and in cellulo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Four&#8208;coordinate organoboron N,C Chelates are used as fluorescence dyes in biological environment. Their excited&#8208;state properties within human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells are characterized by time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. Two chromophores show different features in cellulo depending on the nature of the anchored PEG chains. These findings underline that our approach can extend the information from FLIM and evaluate the excited&#8208;state properties of functional fluorophores in a complex biological environment.







Abstract
Two four&#8208;coordinate organoboron N,C&#8208;chelate complexes with different functional terminals on the PEG chains are studied with respect to their photophysical properties within human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells. Their excited&#8208;state properties are characterized by time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. The excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics of the two complexes are similar when studied in DMSO. Aggregation of the complexes with the carboxylate terminal group is observed in water. When studying the light&#8208;driven excited&#8208;state dynamics of both complexes in cellulo, i.&#8201;e., after being taken up into human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells, both complexes show different features depending on the nature of the anchoring PEG chains. The lifetime of a characteristic intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer state is significantly shorter when studied in cellulo (360&#177;170&#8197;ps) as compared to in DMSO (&#8764;960&#8197;ps) at 600&#8197;nm for the complexes with an amino group. However, the kinetics of the complexes with the carboxylate group are in line with those recorded in DMSO. On the other hand, the lifetimes of the fluorescent state are almost identical for both complexes in cellulo. These findings underline the importance to evaluate the excited&#8208;state properties of fluorophores in a complex biological environment in order to fully account for intra&#8208; and intermolecular effects governing the light&#8208;induced processes in functional dyes.

Their excited-state properties within human MCF-7&#8197;cells are characterized by time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. Two chromophores show different features &lt;i&gt;in cellulo&lt;/i&gt; depending on the nature of the anchored PEG chains. These findings underline that our approach can extend the information from FLIM and evaluate the excited-state properties of functional fluorophores in a complex biological environment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two four-coordinate organoboron &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-chelate complexes with different functional terminals on the PEG chains are studied with respect to their photophysical properties within human MCF-7&#8197;cells. Their excited-state properties are characterized by time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. The excited-state relaxation dynamics of the two complexes are similar when studied in DMSO. Aggregation of the complexes with the carboxylate terminal group is observed in water. When studying the light-driven excited-state dynamics of both complexes &lt;i&gt;in cellulo&lt;/i&gt;, i.&#8201;e., after being taken up into human MCF-7&#8197;cells, both complexes show different features depending on the nature of the anchoring PEG chains. The lifetime of a characteristic intramolecular charge-transfer state is significantly shorter when studied &lt;i&gt;in cellulo&lt;/i&gt; (360&#177;170&#8197;ps) as compared to in DMSO (&#8764;960&#8197;ps) at 600&#8197;nm for the complexes with an amino group. However, the kinetics of the complexes with the carboxylate group are in line with those recorded in DMSO. On the other hand, the lifetimes of the fluorescent state are almost identical for both complexes &lt;i&gt;in cellulo&lt;/i&gt;. These findings underline the importance to evaluate the excited-state properties of fluorophores in a complex biological environment in order to fully account for intra- and intermolecular effects governing the light-induced processes in functional dyes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein, we report the design and scalable synthesis of three new Co(III) complexes, which have an unusual hydrocarbon &#951;1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligation structure, from the reactions of readily available cobalt(II) compound CoCl2(PPh3)2 and biomass material &#946;&#8208;pinene via C&#8722;C bond activation. These Co(III) complexes are air&#8208;stable, fairly volatile, and thermally stable, so they are excellent candidates as the metal precursors for the vapor deposition of cobalt&#8208;containing thin films. As a demonstration, we show that the Co(III) complex of [(3&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;&#951;,1&#8208;&#963;)&#8208;methylene(2,2,4&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl)](&#951;5&#8208;methylcyclopentadienyl)Co (i.&#8201;e. (seco&#8208;pinene)(MeCp)Co) is well suited for the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Co3O4 and CoS2 thin films, and the deposited Co3O4 and CoS2 films are able to conformally cover trench structures with a fairly high aspect ratio of 10&#8201;:&#8201;1.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various combinations of charged porphyrins with controlled electronic states were achieved by ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the HSAB theory. The transient absorption spectra of the porphyrin ion pairs revealed photoinduced electron transfer from the anion to the cation through substituent&#8208;dependent photoexcitation processes. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Kobayashi, H. Maeda, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203957).

         <title>Cumulative Effect of pH and Redox Triggers on Highly Adaptive Transient Coacervates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intricate synergism between multiple biochemical processes and physical conditions determines the formation and function of various biological self&#8208;assemblies. Thus, a complex set of variables dictate the far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium nature of these biological assemblies. Mimicking such systems synthetically is a challenging task. We report multi&#8208;stimuli responsive transient coacervation of an aldehyde&#8208;appended polymer and a short peptide. The coacervates are formed by the disulphide linkages between the peptide molecules and the imine bond between the polymer and the peptide. Imines are susceptible to pH changes and the disulphide bonds can be tuned by oxidation/reduction processes. Thus, the coacervation is operational only under the combined effect of appropriate pH and oxidative conditions. Taking advantage of these facts, the coacervates are transiently formed under a pH cycle (urea &#8211; urease /gluconolactone) and a non&#8208;equilibrium redox cycle (TCEP/H2O2). Importantly, the system showed high adaptability toward environmental changes. The transient existence of the coacervates can be generated without any apparent change in size and shape within the same system through the sequential application of the abovementioned nonequilibrium reaction cycles. Additionally, the coacervation allows for efficient encapsulation/stabilisation of proteins. Thus, the system has the potential to be used for</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Applications of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl and Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Organometallics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes in synthesis is currently experiencing a renaissance, as evidenced by the numerous reports in the last 5 years that have relied on such intermediates to undergo unique transformations or generate novel fragments. Since their discovery, these species have been demonstrated to participate in a wide range of reactions with carbon and heteroatom electrophiles, as well as metal complexes, to facilitate the rapid diversification of (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane&#8208;containing compounds. Key to this is the relative acidity of the bridgehead C&#8210;H bonds which promotes facile deprotonation and subsequent functionalization of an unsubstituted position on the carbon framework via the intermediacy of a metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane. Additionally, the late&#8208;stage incorporation of deuterium atoms in strained fragments has led to the elucidation of numerous reaction mechanisms that involve strained bicycles. The continued investigation into the inimitable reactivity of metalated bicycles will cement their importance within the field of organometallic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>ACTIVE&#8208;BAPO &#8211; A Versatile Transfer Agent for Photoactive Bis(acyl)phosphane Oxide Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide (NHS)&#8208;ester substituted bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (ACTIVE&#8208;BAPO) was prepared via phospha&#8208;Michael addition and used for an easy one&#8208;step BAPO ligation with substrates containing primary amino groups such as amino acids, proteins and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers. Thereby a range of new molecular and polymeric photoinitators was obtained. Real&#8208;time photo&#8208;rheology experiments demonstrated the outstanding efficiency of the PAMAM BAPOs as photoinitiators for free radical polymerization. Remarkably, it is found that PAMAM BAPOs also act as crosslinking agents to convert monofunctional methacrylate monomers into thermosetting networks without any further additives. Depending on the number of the attached BAPOs, thermosets with a different degree of crosslinking and swelling capability in water were obtained.</dc:description>

Remarkably, it is found that PAMAM BAPOs also act as crosslinking agents to convert monofunctional methacrylate monomers into thermosetting networks without any further additives. Depending on the number of the attached BAPOs, thermosets with a different degree of crosslinking and swelling capability in water were obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Herein we present a systematic study of the influence of different alkyl chains in malonyl ester fullerene adducts with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP]) and a tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) ester substituted [10]CPP analogue. The association constants between the nanoring hosts and the fullerene guests were determined by fluorescence quenching experiments. The trends in association were rationalized by an interplay of repulsion arising from an extended volume and London dispersion as an attractive counterpart.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Computational&#160;Screening of New Candidate Reactions with&#160;High Bioorthogonal Click Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal click chemistry has become an indispensable part of the biochemist's toolbox. Despite the wide variety of applications that have been developed in recent years, only a limited number of bioorthogonal click reactions have been discovered so far, most of them based on (substituted) azides. In this work, we present a computational workflow to discover new candidate reactions with promising kinetic and thermodynamic properties for bioorthogonal click applications. Sampling only around 0.05% of an overall search space of over 10,000,000 dipolar cycloadditions, we develop a machine learning model able to predict DFT&#8208;computed activation and reaction energies within ~2&#8208;3 kcal/mol across the entire space. Applying this model to screen the full search space through iterative rounds of learning, we identify a broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity, which can be used as a starting point or source of inspiration for future experimental development of both azide&#8208;based and non&#8208;azide&#8208;based bioorthogonal click reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodamine&#8208;Sensitized Two&#8208;Photon Activation of a Red LightAbsorbing BODIPY Photocage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;photon (2P) activatable probes are of high value in biological and medical chemistry since near infrared (NIR) light can penetrate deeply even in blood&#8208;perfused tissue and due to the intrinsic three&#8208;dimensional activation properties. Designing two&#8208;photon chromophores is challenging. However, the two&#8208;photon absorption qualities of a photocage can be improved with an intramolecular sensitizer, which transfers the absorbed light onto the cage. We herein present the synthesis and photophysical characterization of a 2P&#8208;sensitive uncaging dyad based on rhodamine 101 as donor fluorophore and a redshifted BODIPY as acceptor photocage. Liberation of p&#8208;nitroaniline (PNA) upon one&#8208;photon photolysis was confirmed by HPLC analysis. The photoreaction was found to be accompanied by a considerable change of the fluorescence properties of the chromophores. The possibility of a fluorescent readout enabled the detection of two&#8208;photon induced uncaging by confocal fluorescence microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>CoNi2S4 Electrode with High Mass&#8208;loading for High&#8208;energy&#8208;density Supercapacitor: Role of S&#8208;containing Anions Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange is recognized as an effective method to regulate the composition, electronic conductivity, and electrochemical behavior of the transition metal&#8208;based compounds. In this work, anion exchange is adopted as a rational post&#8208;treatment route to facilitate the capacitive activity of CoNi2S4 nanoparticle arrays grown on carbon cloth (CC) with high mass&#8208;loading. As soaked in saturated Na2S solution, the CoNi2S4/CC electrode showed an increased capacity from 483 C g&#8208;1 to 841 C g&#8208;1 at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 with excellent rate performance and stable cycling performance, which was superior to the CoNi2S4/CC electrode activated by NaBH4 reduction. Anion exchange was beneficial for enhancing the crystallinity, retaining the adhesion of nanoarrays, and realizing low resistance nature in a mild route. The as&#8208;assembled CoNi2S4/CC//activated CC hybrid supercapacitor delivered a high areal capacitance of 1.28 F cm&#8722;2 at 5 mA cm&#8208;2, and achieved an energy density of 0.58 mWh cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 4.5 mW cm&#8722;2 with excellent cycle stability with 90.6% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Sensitive On&#8208;Surface Ladderization by Non&#8208;Dehydrogenative Heterocyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface non&#8208;dehydrogenative cyclization leads to low&#8208;temperature formation of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;bridged ladder oligomer with an unprecedented high ratio of nitrogen and carbon of 1&#8201;:&#8201;4. The reaction barrier of the ladderization is sufficiently low as the small segment of the ladder units already appeared at 40&#8201;&#176;C. However, once the long linear oligomer as the intermediate is synthesized, the reaction barrier significantly increases since the orientation of the unit has to be rotated, which is the origin of the strain&#8208;sensitive on&#8208;surface ladderization.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation recently became an important reaction to planarize &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and oligomers. However, the high&#8208;activation barrier to cleave the C&#8722;H bond often requires high&#8208;temperature annealing, consequently restricting structures of precursor molecules and/or leading to random fusion at their edges. Here, we present a synthesis of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;bridged ladder oligomers from 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane molecules on Ag(111) with bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy. This non&#8208;dehydrogenative cyclization between pyrazine and ethynylene/cumulene groups has a low&#8208;activation barrier for forming intermediary dimeric oligomer containing dipyrazinopyrrolopyrrolopyrazine units, thus giving new insight into the strain&#8208;sensitive in ladder&#8208;oligomer formation.

         <title>Paramagnetic Liquid Crystals With Close &#960;&#8211;&#960; Packing: The Effect of Blatter Radical Planarization on Behavior of Bent&#8208;Core Mesogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diphenol containing 19&#8208;&#960; delocalized electrons was developed as a general intermediate to paramagnetic columnar and lamellar liquid crystals with close &#960;&#8211;&#960; contacts for electronic applications.







Abstract
A new, 19 &#960;&#8208;delocalized electrons planar Blatter radical building block was developed and used to obtain paramagnetic bent&#8208;core liquid crystals. The mesogens were investigated by optical, thermal, powder XRD and DFT methods in the pure form and as binary mixtures. Comparison of their properties with those of the classical Blatter radical analogues revealed that planarization of the central angular element results in a significantly higher stability of the mesophases and increased molecular organization suitable for the formation of ordered banana and columnar mesophases with tighter &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. These results indicate access to a new, potentially rich class of functional paramagnetic soft materials.

         <title>Pro&#8208;aromaticity Enabled Dealkenylative Functionalizations via Photo&#8208;excitation and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general and practical approach for diverse dealkenylative functionalization of olefin&#8208;containing substrates has been developed through the one&#8208;pot formation and utilization of pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines using tetrazine as the key cycloaddition reagent. Triggered by either excitation or oxidation, the targeted C&#8722;C bonds in the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazine intermediates could be readily cleaved to generate alkyl radicals for subsequent transformations. Diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bond forming protocols, including Giese&#8208;type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci&#8208;type alkylation, copper&#8208;catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, are achieved in a highly modular fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Chemiexcitation by a Unique Dioxetane Scaffold Gated by an OR Logic Set of Triggers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemiexcitation of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores is initiated by electron transfer from a&#160;meta&#8208;positioned phenolate ion to the peroxide&#8208;dioxetane bond. Here we report the development of a unique 1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent scaffold with chemiexcitation gated by an OR logic dual&#8208;set of triggering events. This scaffold is composed of&#160;meta&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;adamantyl molecules, equipped with&#160;acrylic acid and chlorine substituents, that&#160;chemiexcitation&#160;under physiological conditions.&#160;A dual&#8208;mode chemiluminescent probe, armed with two different triggering substrates designed for activation by the enzymes&#160;&#946;&#8208;galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, was synthesized.&#160;The probe emitted intense&#160;light signals in the response to each enzyme, demonstrating its ability to serve as a single&#8208;component chemiluminescent sensor for dual&#8208;analyte detection. We also demonstrated the ability of the probe to detect&#160;&#946;&#8208;galactosidase and of phosphatase activities in bacteria. This is the first&#160;1,2&#8208;dioxetane scaffold capable of response to two different chemiexcitation events from two different positions on the same dioxetane molecule.We anticipate that the OR&#8208;gated mode of chemiexcitation, described herein, will find utility in preparation of&#160;chemiluminescent&#160;probes with a dual&#8208;analyte detection/imaging mode.</dc:description>

         <title>LiHMDS&#8208;Mediated Deprotonative Coupling of Toluenes with Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) acts as an effective base for deprotonative coupling reactions of toluenes with ketones. Various functionalities are allowed on the toluenes. Notably, this system proved successful with low&#8208;reactive toluenes bearing a large pKa value compared to that of the conjugate acid of LiHMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, 25.8, THF), as demonstrated by 4&#8208;phenyltoluene (38.57, THF) and toluene itself (&#8764;43, DMSO).







Abstract
We demonstrate that lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) acts as an effective base for deprotonative coupling reactions of toluenes with ketones to afford stilbenes. Various functionalities (halogen, OCF3, amide, Me, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, SMe, and SPh) are allowed on the toluenes. Notably, this system proved successful with low&#8208;reactive toluenes bearing a large pKa value compared to that of the conjugate acid of LiHMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, 25.8, THF), as demonstrated by 4&#8208;phenyltoluene (38.57, THF) and toluene itself (&#8764;43, DMSO).

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Tandem Coupling Method for the Short&#8208;Step Formal Synthesis of Riccardin C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal total synthesis of riccardin C was achieved by a sequential five&#8208;steps four&#8208;component one&#8208;pot tandem coupling method. By optimizing each step, four individual units were connected by two Sonogashira coupling reactions and one Suzuki coupling reaction, followed by diimide reduction and acid deprotection.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot reactions reduce reagent amounts and circumvent process treatments, such as work&#8208;up and purifications in multi&#8208;step reactions. In this study, we achieved the formal total synthesis of riccardin C through a one&#8208;pot reaction by simultaneously linking four units through two Sonogashira coupling reactions and one Suzuki coupling reaction, followed by reduction and deprotection. Thus, this one&#8208;pot method comprised five steps and did not require the purification of intermediate reaction mixtures, which saves resources, such as reagents and solvents, and expedites the work process.

         <title>Guanidine&#8208;Functionalized Fluorescent sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Sensing and Capture of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;sensitive detection, capture, and recovery/removal of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions by guanidine&#8208;modified fluorescent sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework is reported.







Abstract
Palladium is a key element in fuel cells, electronic industries, and organic catalysis. At the same time, chromium is essential in leather, electroplating, and metallurgical industries. However, their unpremeditated leakage into aquatic systems has caused human health and environmental apprehensions. Herein, we reported the development of an sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated fluorescent covalent organic framework with a guanidine moiety (sp2c&#8208;gCOF) that showed excellent thermal and chemical stability. The sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed effective sensing, capture, and recovery/removal of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions, which could be due to the highly accessible pore walls decorated with guanidine moieties. The fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed higher selectivity for Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions, with an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.7 and 3.2&#8197;nM, respectively. The analysis of the adsorption properties with a pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model showed that sp2c&#8208;gCOF could successfully and selectively remove both Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solutions. The polymer also showed excellent capture efficacy even after seven consecutive adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. Hence, this study reveals the potential of fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF for detecting, removing, and recovering valuable metals and hazardous ions from wastewater, which would be useful for economic benefit, environmental safety, human health, and sustainability. The post&#8208;synthetic modification of sp2c&#8208;COF with suitable functionalities could also be useful for sensing and extracting other water pollutants and valuable materials from an aqueous system.
