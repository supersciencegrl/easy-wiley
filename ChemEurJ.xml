         <title>Expanding the Topological Landscape by a G&#8208;Column Flip of a Parallel G&#8208;Quadruplex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting with a parallel&#8208;stranded DNA G&#8208;quadruplex, refolding into a novel (3+1) hybrid topology with a propeller&#8208;propeller&#8208;lateral loop architecture and an all&#8208;syn 3&#8217;&#8208;terminal G&#8208;tract is reported. Although supported by additional stacking of a lateral duplex hairpin onto an outer G&#8208;tetrad, the structural rearrangement must be enforced through the specific incorporation of syn&#8208;favoring 8&#8208;bromoguanosine analogues into the terminal G&#8208;run.







Abstract
Canonical G&#8208;quadruplexes can adopt a variety of different topologies depending on the arrangement of propeller, lateral, or diagonal loops connecting the four G&#8208;columns. A novel intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex structure is derived through inversion of the last G&#8208;tract of a three&#8208;layered parallel fold, associated with the transition of a single propeller into a lateral loop. The resulting (3+1) hybrid fold features three syn&#8901;anti&#8901;anti&#8901;anti G&#8208;tetrads with a 3&#8217;&#8208;terminal all&#8208;syn G&#8208;column. Although the ability of forming a duplex stem&#8208;loop between G&#8208;tracts seems beneficial for a propeller&#8208;to&#8208;lateral loop rearrangement, unmodified G&#8208;rich sequences resist folding into the new (3+1) topology. However, refolding can be driven by the incorporation of syn&#8208;favoring guanosine analogues into positions of the fourth G&#8208;stretch. The presented hybrid&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex structure as determined by NMR spectroscopy may provide for an additional scaffold in quadruplex&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Dipyrrolyldiketone PtII Complexes: Ion&#8208;Pairing &#960;&#8208;Electronic Systems with Various Anion&#8208;Binding Modes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipyrrolyldiketone PtII complexes, as phosphorescence&#8208;emitting and anion&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;electronic systems with planar geometries, were synthesized to construct ion&#8208;pairing assemblies in the form of anion complexes. The ordered arrangements of the anion complexes and countercations, including porphyrin AuIII complexes, were formed via noncovalent interactions between oppositely and identically charged species in the solid state.







Abstract
A variety of &#960;&#8208;electronic ion&#8208;pairing assemblies can be constructed by combining anion complexes of &#960;&#8208;electronic systems and countercations. In this study, a series of anion&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;electronic molecules, dipyrrolyldiketone PtII complexes containing a phenylpyridine ligand, were synthesized. The resulting PtII complexes exhibited phosphorescence emission, with higher emission quantum yields (0.30&#8211;0.42) and microsecond&#8208;order lifetimes, and solution&#8208;state anion binding, as revealed by our spectroscopic analyses. These PtII complexes displayed solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;pairing assemblies, exhibiting various anion&#8208;binding modes, which derived from pyrrole&#8208;inverted and pyrrole&#8208;non&#8208;inverted conformations, and packing structures, with the contribution of charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge assemblies, which were dependent on the substituents in the PtII complexes and the geometries and electronic states of their countercations.

         <title>Enantioselective Protonation of Cyclic Carbonyl Ylides by Chiral Lewis Acid Assisted Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective protonation of cyclic carbonyl ylides by chiral Lewis acid assisted alcohol addition reactions featuring a dual catalytic system is reported. The unique heterobicyclic products bearing a quaternary heteroatom&#8208;substituted carbon center were obtained with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The alcohol adducts were successfully converted to optically active oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones by hydrolysis. Computational mechanistic studies indicated that a stepwise syn&#8208;addition of alcohols under the influence of a Lewis acid was favored.







Abstract
Chiral Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alcohol addition reactions to cyclic carbonyl ylides generated from N&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinones featuring a dual catalytic system are reported. Construction of a chiral quaternary heteroatom&#8208;substituted carbon center was accomplished in which the unique heterobicycles were obtained in good yields with high stereoselection. The alcohol adducts were successfully converted to optically active oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones by hydrolysis. Mechanistic studies by DFT calculations revealed that alcohols could be activated by Lewis acids, enabling enantioselective protonation of the carbonyl ylides.

         <title>Structure and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Alkynyl Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new N&#8208;heterocyclic alkynyl hypervalent iodine reagents have been synthesized. Their structures and reactivity are described and compared to already reported cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents, showing less extended &#963; holes for tosylated reagents. Good alkyne transfer properties towards strong nucleophiles were observed, but applications in radical and metal&#8208;catalyzed processes were more limited.







Abstract
Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)e (EBX) cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents have become popular reagents for the alkynylation of radicals and nucleophiles, but only offer limited possibilities for further structure and reactivity fine&#8208;tuning. Herein, the synthesis of new N&#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents with increased structural flexibility based on amide, amidine and sulfoximine scaffolds is reported. Solid&#8208;state structures of the reagents are reported and the analysis of the I&#8722;Calkyne bond lengths allowed assessing the trans&#8208;effect of the different substituents. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps of the reagents, derived from DFT computations, revealed less pronounced &#963;&#8208;hole regions for sulfonamide&#8208;based compounds. Most reagents reacted well in the alkynylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The alkynylation of thiols afforded more variable yields, with compounds with a stronger &#963;&#8208;hole reacting better. In metal&#8208;mediated transformations, the N&#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents gave inferior results when compared to the O&#8208;based EBX reagents.

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition of Ternary Indium/Tin/Aluminum Oxide Thin Films, Their Characterization and Transistor Performance under Illumination.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary metal oxide semiconducting multilayer structure of composition [In2O3//SnO2//Al2O3] is accessible by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) approach. Oxygen deficiency in these ALD derived thin films can be effectively manipulated and controlled by adding a distinct number of alumina monolayers. Besides its semiconducting behavior, the incorporation of the alumina monolayers alters the light stability of the semiconducting multilayer thin film in a thin film transistor device under illumination in the radiation range between 300&#8211;600&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Multilayered heterostructures comprising of In2O3, SnO2, and Al2O3 were studied for their application in thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT). The compositional influence of tin oxide on the properties of the thin&#8208;film, as well as on the TFT characteristics is investigated. The heterostructures are fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 200&#8201;&#176;C, employing trimethylindium (TMI), tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin (TDMASn), trimethylaluminum (TMA), and water as precursors.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The ternary metal oxide&lt;/b&gt; semiconducting multilayer structure of composition [In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;//SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;//Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] is accessible by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) approach. Oxygen deficiency in these ALD derived thin films can be effectively manipulated and controlled by adding a distinct number of alumina monolayers. Besides its semiconducting behavior, the incorporation of the alumina monolayers alters the light stability of the semiconducting multilayer thin film in a thin film transistor device under illumination in the radiation range between 300&#8211;600&#8197;nm.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multilayered heterostructures comprising of In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were studied for their application in thin-film transistors (TFT). The compositional influence of tin oxide on the properties of the thin-film, as well as on the TFT characteristics is investigated. The heterostructures are fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 200&#8201;&#176;C, employing trimethylindium (TMI), tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin (TDMASn), trimethylaluminum (TMA), and water as precursors. After post-deposition annealing at 400&#8201;&#176;C the thin-films are found to be amorphous, however, they show a discrete layer structure of the individual oxides of uniform film thickness and high optical transparency in the visible region. Incorporation of only two monolayers of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the active semiconducting layer the formation of oxygen vacancies can be effectively suppressed, resulting in an improved semiconducting and switching behavior. The heterostacks comprising of In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are incorporated into TFT devices, exhibiting a saturation field-effect mobility (&#956;&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;) of 2.0&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a threshold-voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;) of 8.6&#8197;V, a high current on/off ratio (I&lt;sub&gt;On&lt;/sub&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;Off&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, and a subthreshold swing (SS) of 485&#8197;mV&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Merging Molecular Recognition and Gold(I) Catalysis with Triphoscalix[6]arene Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New wheels for cycloisomerizations: We report the synthesis of novel trinuclear triphosphine&#8208;gold(I)&#8208;calix[6]arene complexes A and B. These multitasking supramolecular wheels, which could be employed as a platform for the synthesis of interwoven (pseudo)rotaxanes species, displayed catalytic features promoting highly selective cycloisomerizations of 1,6&#8208;enynes.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of novel triphosphine calix[6]arene ligands. These supramolecular wheels, with recognition features governed by the hydrogen&#8208;bonding domain, were employed to synthesize multitasking trinuclear gold(I) complexes as a new platform for the synthesis of interwoven (pseudo)rotaxane species. In parallel, the multivalent, metal&#8208;bonded upper rim displayed catalytic features promoting highly selective gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions of 1,6&#8208;enynes.

         <title>Accessing C2&#8208;Functionalized 1,3&#8208;(Benz)azoles through Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metals play revolutionary role in achieving regioselective and chemodivergent C&#8722;H activation attaining step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economy. Introducing synthetically manipulative functional groups to omnipresent backbone 1,3&#8208;(benz)azoles has never been easier with this diverse set of metal catalysts and tailored ligands. This review article presents a collective summary of all metal catalysts used to rapidly extend the synthetic library of azoles.







Abstract
The skeletal presence of 1,3&#8208;azoles in a variety of bioactive natural products, pharmacophores, and organic materials demands the derivatization of such heteroarenes regioselectively. Plenty of cross&#8208;coupling as well as cyclocondensation reactions have been performed to build up these skeletons but remained commercially unrealizable. A couple of severe drawbacks are faced by these traditional protocols that require a more straightforward strategy to obviate them. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged as a superior alternative in that context. 1,3&#8208;Azoles and their benzo counterparts have been extensively functionalized exploiting both noble and earth&#8208;abundant transition metals. Lately, C&#8208;2 functionalization have gained much traction due to the ease of attaining high regioselectivity and installation of synthetically manipulative functionalities. This critical review presents a bird&#8216;s eye view of all major C&#8208;2 functionalization of (benz)azoles catalyzed by a diverse set of metals performed over the past 15&#8197;years.

         <title>Steric Effects on the Thermal Processes of Hemithioindigo Based Molecular Motor Rotation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the detailed mechanism behind directional rotation of light driven molecular motors is a necessary prerequisite for the conscious design of their properties. In this work the influence of sterical hindrance on the speed of helix inversion in hemithioindigo&#8208;based molecular motors is elucidated. Unexpectedly, increasing steric hindrance at two different positions on the rotor fragment is found to have opposite effects: at the aliphatic position helix inversion is accelerated while at the aromatic position this process is slowed down.







Abstract
Tuning the thermal behavior of light driven molecular motors is fundamentally important for their future rational design. In many molecular motors thermal ratcheting steps are comprised of helicity inversions, energetically stabilizing the initial photoproducts. In this work we investigated a series of five hemithioindigo (HTI) based molecular motors to reveal the influence of steric hindrance in close proximity to the rotation axle on this process. Applying a high yielding synthetic procedure, we synthesized constitutional isomeric derivatives to distinguish between substitution effects at the aromatic and aliphatic position on the rotor fragment. The kinetics of thermal helix inversions were elucidated using low temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy and an in&#8197;situ irradiation technique. In combination with a detailed theoretical description, a comparative analysis of substituent effects on the thermal helix inversions of the rotation cycle is now possible. Such deeper understanding of the rotational cycle of HTI molecular motors is essential for speed regulation and future applications of visible light triggered nanomachines.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Oxazolomycins B and C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis confirms structures: The first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;oxazolomycin B and (+)&#8208;oxazolomycin C was achieved in a longest linear sequence of 25 steps from the amino acid serine in 3.6 and 2.7&#8201;% overall yield, respectively.

Abstract
Efforts towards the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;oxazolomycin B and (+)&#8208;oxazolomycin C from the intermediate of our previous synthesis of (+)&#8208;neoxazolomycin are reported. The syntheses were achieved in a longest linear sequence of 25 steps from the amino acid serine in 3.6 and 2.7&#8201;% overall yields, respectively. The efficiency of our approach is derived from silyl triflate&#8208;mediated reductive oxazolidine ring&#8208;opening and F&#252;rstner's Ru&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and protodesilylation reactions. The obtained spectra and optical rotations were in good agreement with those of natural products, thus confirming the structures.

Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) property is not based on solvent crystallization molecules but hydrated polyoxometalate(POM)&#8211;based Na9[Er(W5O18)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;35H2O and its dehydrated form relax differently. Experimental and theoretical investigations evidence that the stability of the edifice depends on labile water molecules. Furthermore, isotopic enrichment at ErIII site shows that the relaxation dynamics in the quantum regime depends on the nuclear spin.







Abstract
Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) property is by essence molecular, while commonly measured in solid crystalline state. Solvent crystallization molecules are usually neglected in the analysis and interpretation of solid&#8208;state properties. The solvation/desolvation process in the polyoxometalate(POM)&#8208;based Na9[Er(W5O18)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;35&#8201;H2O SMM demonstrates that the dehydrated form relaxes more than 1000 times faster than the initial state, while the rehydration process allows the quasi complete recovering of the initial magnetic behaviour. This dehydration process is monitored by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and temperature&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and rationalized by periodic quantum chemical calculations evidencing the tremendous role of the labile water molecules in the stability of the edifice. Ab&#8208;initio calculations highlight that sodium ions localization in the structure drive the magnetic responses. Isotopic enrichment with nuclear spin free (166Er, I=0) ErIII ions shows that the relaxation dynamics in the quantum regime depends on the nuclear spin.

         <title>Amorphous Calcium Phosphates: Solvent&#8208;Controlled Growth and Stabilization through the Epoxide Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) is a key nanobiomaterial where shape, size and phase purity remain as a synthetic challenge. Herein, we have adapted the Epoxide Route for the synthesis of pure and stable ACP colloids by using biocompatible solvents such as ethylene glycol and/or glycerine. The solvent mixture can be used as a new green tool to control the size (from 60 nm to &gt;500 nm) and the internal mesostructured (fractal dimension).







Abstract
Calcium phosphates stand among the most promising nanobiomaterials in key biomedical applications, such as bone repairment, signalling or drug/gene delivery. Their intrinsic properties as crystalline structure, composition, particle shape and size define their successful use. Among these compounds, metastable amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) is currently gaining particular attention due to its inherently high reactivity in solution, which is crucial in bone development mechanisms. However, the preparation of this highly desired (bio)material with control over its shape, size and phase purity remains as a synthetic challenge. In this work, the epoxide route was adapted for the synthesis of pure and stable ACP colloids. By using biocompatible solvents, such as ethylene glycol and/or glycerine, it was possible to avoid the natural tendency of ACP to maturate into more stable and crystalline apatites. Moreover, this procedure offers size control, ranging from small nanoparticles (60&#8197;nm) to micrometric spheroids (&gt;500&#8197;nm). The eventual fractalization of the internal mesostructured can be tuned, by simply adjusting the composition of the ethylene glycol:glycerine solvent mixture. These findings introduce the use of green solvents as a new tool to control crystallinity and/or particle size in the synthesis of nanomaterials, avoiding the use of capping agents and preserving the natural chemical reactivity of the pristine surface.

         <title>Functional Carbazole&#8208;Fullerene Complexes: A New Perspective of Carbazoles Acting as Nano&#8208;Octopus to Capture Globular Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of carbazolic derivatives are reported to associate with fullerenes as a novel host class. Different amounts of carbazole units and tunable bridged linker modulated the binding strength and its alternated arrangement pattern. Benefit from the continuous C60&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C60 short&#8208;contact channels, promising electron&#8208;transport and photovoltaic effects are achieved in the host&#8208;guest complex devices.







Abstract
Fullerene host&#8208;guest constructs have attracted increasing attention owing to their molecular&#8208;level hybrid arrangements. However, the usage of simple carbazolic derivatives to bind with fullerenes is rare. In this research, three novel carbazolic derivatives, containing a tunable bridging linker and carbazole units for the capturing of fullerenes, are rationally designed. Unlike the general concave&#8208;convex interactions, fullerenes could interact with the planar carbazole subunits to form 2&#8208;dimensional hexagonal/quadrilateral cocrystals with alternating stacking patterns of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometry, as well as the controllable fullerene packing modes. At the meanwhile, good electron&#8208;transporting performances and significant photovoltaic effects were realized when a continuous C60&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C60 interaction channel existed. The results indicate that the introduction of such carbazolic system into fullerene receptor would provide new insights into novel fullerene host&#8208;guest architectures for versatile applications.

         <title>Design and Application of Mini&#8208;libraries of miRNA Probes for an Efficient and Versatile miRNA&#8208;mRNA Cross&#8208;linking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a new class of miRNA probes with photo&#8208;active trioxsalen attached via oligoethylene glycol&#8208;based linkers. These cross&#8208;link to RNA targets in&#8197;vitro with efficiencies dependent on sequence and linker&#8208;length. By using controlled mixtures of probes, a general approach to efficient covalent target&#8208;capture independent of miRNAs sequence is proposed.







Abstract
MicroRNAs constitute a class of endogenous, non&#8208;coding RNAs that influence various processes within the cell. By base&#8208;pairing to partially&#8208;complementary sites located in the 3&#8217; untranslated region of target messenger RNAs, microRNAs participate in post&#8208;transcriptional regulation of the majority of human protein&#8208;coding genes. Their dysregulation has been related to many pathological processes and diseases. Thus, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the microRNA mechanisms of action is crucial. Here, we present a new concept of probe design to achieve an efficient and sequence&#8208;independent miRNA&#8208;mRNA cross&#8208;linking. The new strategy is based on the utilization of a controlled mixture of probes for a chosen miRNA, in which a trioxsalen moiety is introduced at the N4&#8208;position of a selected cytidine through short oligoethylene glycol&#8208;based linkers. In vitro photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking experiments with mini&#8208;libraries of probes for microRNAs of interest showed variable cross&#8208;linking efficiencies, demonstrating a general applicability of the presented approach.

         <title>A Showcase of Green Chemistry: Sustainable Synthetic Approach of Zirconium&#8208;Based MOF Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The production and application of Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework materials are restricted by numerous factors. By embracing green chemistry, green raw materials and green synthesis methods are the keys in sustainable synthesis of Zr&#8722;MOFs over last decade. This review summarizes the achievements and looks forward to the future industrialization and commercialization of Zr&#8722;MOFs.







Abstract
Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework materials (Zr&#8722;MOFs) have more practical usage over most conventional benchmark porous materials and even many other MOFs due to the excellent structural stability, rich coordination forms, and various active sites. However, their mass&#8208;production and application are restricted by the high&#8208;cost raw materials, complex synthesis procedures, harsh reaction conditions, and unexpected environmental impact. Based on the principles of &#8220;Green Chemistry&#8221;, considerable efforts have been done for breaking through the limitations, and significant progress has been made in the sustainable synthesis of Zr&#8722;MOFs over the past decade. In this review, the advancements of green raw materials and green synthesis methods in the synthesis of Zr&#8722;MOFs are reviewed, along with the corresponding drawbacks. The challenges and prospects are discussed and outlooked, expecting to provide guidance for the acceleration of the industrialization and commercialization of Zr&#8722;MOFs.

         <title>Diindenopyrazines: Electron&#8208;Deficient Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron poor, but rich in possibility: Electron&#8208;deficient diindenopyrazines with different aryl substituents have been synthesized and characterized. The introduction of electron&#8208;poor aryl groups reduces the electron affinity to &#8722;4&#8197;eV, thereby making the compounds attractive as n&#8208;semiconductors. Tested in an organic field&#8208;effect transistor, compound 4&#8201;e showed electron mobilities up to 0.037&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
The syntheses, properties and application of the air&#8208;stable electron acceptors, diindenopyrazines 4&#8201;a&#8211;g are reported demonstrating the introduction of functional aryl groups in the 6&#8208; and 12&#8208;positions. The targets are accessible on the hundred milligram to gram scale. The structure of the aryl groups in 4&#8201;a&#8211;g modulates their solubility, redox potentials and optical properties. The introduction of electron&#8208;poor aryl groups to the electron&#8208;poor diindenopyrazine backbone reduces the electron affinity to &#8722;4&#8197;eV, making the compounds attractive as n&#8208;semiconductors. A simple organic field&#8208;effect transistor of 4&#8201;e &#8211;without optimization&#8211; shows electron transport with a mobility of up to 0.037&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Heptacene: Synthesis and Its Hole&#8208;Transfer Property in Stable Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge carrier&#8208;bagged: Heptacene has been synthesized in nine steps in a total yield of 10&#8201;%, and its hole&#8208;transfer properties have been measured by fabricating organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) devices. The best hole mobility performance was 2.2&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in a stable thin film of heptacene. The potential use of heptacene as an effective charge carrier is reported for the first time.







Abstract
Heptacene (1) has been produced via a monoketone precursor, 2, which was prepared from 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene in nine steps in a total yield of 10&#8201;%. Compound 2 was converted to 1 quantitatively by heating at 202&#8201;&#176;C. Heptacene exhibited high thermal stability in the solid state without any observable change over two months. To investigate the potential value of 1 as a material for p&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), top&#8208;contact OFET devices were fabricated by vacuum deposition of 1 onto a hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)/SiO2/Si substrate. The best hole mobility performance was 2.2&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This is the first report of stable heptacene being used in an effective device and examined for its charge carrier properties.

         <title>Effect of Topology on Photodynamic Sterilization of Porphyrinic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guide for designing photosensitizers: The effect of the topololgy of porphyrinic zirconium metal&#8208;organic frameworks on 1O2 generation and photodynamic antibacterial performance was studied in four model MOFs. The number of porphyrin (TCPP) molecules per Zr6O8 cluster, the pore size and the distance between inter&#8208;TCPP active sites, which are caused by variations in the MOF&#8242;s topology, play important roles in 1O2 generation.Thus, this work provides guidance for designing new MOFs as photosensitizers in photodynamic sterilization and therapy.







Abstract
Porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising photosensitizers due to the lack of self&#8208;aggregation of porphyrin in aqueous solution. However, how the topology of porphyrinic MOFs affects the generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) is unclear. Here, the effect of the topology of porphyrinic MOFs on their photodynamic performance is reported. Four porphyrinic zirconium MOFs (MOF&#8208;525, MOF&#8208;545, PCN&#8208;223 and PCN&#8208;224 with different topologies: ftw, csq, shp and she, respectively) were selected to study the influence of topology on the photodynamic antibacterial performance. The 1O2 generation and the photodynamic antibacterial performance followed an decreasing order of MOF&#8208;545&gt;MOF&#8208;525&gt;PCN&#8208;224&gt;PCN&#8208;223. The results reveal that the pore size, the distance between porphyrin, and the number of porphyrin per Zr6O8 cluster in MOFs greatly affected 1O2 generation. This work provides guidance for designing new MOFs for efficient photodynamic sterilization.

         <title>What is the Catalytic Mechanism of Enzymatic Histone N&#8208;Methyl Arginine Demethylation and Can It be Influenced by an External Electric Field?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The QM/MM calculations of the demethylation of symmetrical dimethylated arginine (R3me2&#8197;s) substrate by KDM4E via C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H pathways show the preference for the former and application of external electric fields (EEFs) increases the rate of C&#8722;H activation, while inhibiting the rate of N&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
Arginine methylation is an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation. Some Fe(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent Jumonji&#8208;C (JmjC) N&#1013;&#8208;methyl lysine histone demethylases also have N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylase activity. We report combined molecular dynamic (MD) and Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical (QM/MM) studies on the mechanism of N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation by human KDM4E and compare the results with those reported for N&#8208;methyl lysine demethylation by KDM4A. At the KDM4E active site, Glu191, Asn291, and Ser197 form a conserved scaffold that restricts substrate dynamics; substrate binding is also mediated by an out of active site hydrogen&#8208;bond between the substrate Ser1 and Tyr178. The calculations imply that in either C&#8722;H or N&#8722;H potential bond cleaving pathways for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) during N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation, electron transfer occurs via a &#963;&#8208;channel; the transition state for the N&#8722;H pathway is &#8764;10&#8197;kcal/mol higher than for the C&#8722;H pathway due to the higher bond dissociation energy of the N&#8722;H bond. The results of applying external electric fields (EEFs) reveal EEFs with positive field strengths parallel to the Fe=O bond have a significant barrier&#8208;lowering effect on the C&#8722;H pathway, by contrast, such EEFs inhibit the N&#8722;H activation rate. The overall results imply that KDM4 catalyzed N&#8208;methyl arginine demethylation and N&#8208;methyl lysine demethylation occur via similar C&#8722;H abstraction and rebound mechanisms leading to methyl group hydroxylation, though there are differences in the interactions leading to productive binding of intermediates.

         <title>Theoretical Insight into the Effect of Fluorine&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Supported Palladium Single&#8208;Site Catalyst in the Ethylene Dimerization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extensive and detailed computational study of the ethylene dimerization reaction mechanism on the inorganic building unit on Pd&#8208;single site MOF heterogeneous catalysts was carried out. The origins of the catalytic performance of bis&#8208;triazolate ligand with biphenyl organic backbone and its fluorinated counterpart were elucidated. This represents the first example of using computational analysis to uncover the palladium&#8208;MOF catalyst&#8242;s reactivity and the ligand fluorine effect for ethylene dimerization reaction.







Abstract
Ethylene dimerization reaction is one of the most common mechanisms for the production of 1&#8208;butene. Recently, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have received extensive attention in this area since they combine all the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in a single compound. Here a computational mechanistic study of MOF&#8208;supported palladium single&#8208;site catalyst for ethylene dimerization reaction is reported. Catalytic systems with both biphenyl&#8208;type backbone as organic ligand and its fluorine&#8208;functionalization have been investigated to reveal the origin of ligand effects on the catalytic activity and selectivity. The calculations revealed that the nonfluorinated palladium MOF catalyst undergoes dimerization over isomerization reaction. Then the influence of the fluorine&#8208;functionalized organic ligand was compared in the dimerization catalytic cycle, which was strongly favored in terms of activity and selectivity. Catalyst&#8208;substrate interactions were analyzed by energy decomposition analysis revealing the critical role of ligand backbone functionalization on the activity. This theoretical analysis identified three chemically meaningful dominant effects on these catalysts; steric, electrostatic and charge transfer effects. The steric effects promote nonfluorinated MOF catalyst, whereas the electrostatic effects are the dominant factor that promotes its fluorinated counterpart. This theoretical study provides feedback with future experimental studies about the role of fluorine ligand functionalization in palladium MOF catalysts for ethylene dimerization reaction.

         <title>Kinetics and Mechanism of the Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination of 1,1&#8208;Dimethylallene with N&#8208;Methylaniline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic and spectroscopic analyses of the gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of 1,1&#8208;dimethylallene with N&#8208;methylaniline support a mechanism involving rapid and reversible addition of N&#8208;methylaniline to the more substituted terminus of gold &#960;&#8208;allene complex I to form gold vinyl complex II superimposed on slower addition of N&#8208;methylaniline to the less substituted terminus of I to form gold vinyl complex III. Selective formation of the linear allylic amine 3&#8201;a is attributed to the more facile protodeauration of III relative to II.







Abstract
The mechanism of the intermolecular hydroamination of 3&#8208;methylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene (1) with N&#8208;methylaniline (2) catalyzed by (IPr)AuOTf has been studied by employing a combination of kinetic analysis, deuterium labelling studies, and in&#8197;situ spectral analysis of catalytically active mixtures. The results of these and additional experiments are consistent with a mechanism for hydroamination involving reversible, endergonic displacement of N&#8208;methylaniline from [(IPr)Au(NHMePh)]+ (4) by allene to form the cationic gold &#960;&#8208;C1,C2&#8208;allene complex [(IPr)Au(&#951;2&#8208;H2C=C=CMe2)]+ (I), which is in rapid, endergonic equilibrium with the regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;C2,C3&#8208;allene complex [(IPr)Au(&#951;2&#8208;Me2C=C=CH2)]+ (I&#8242;). Rapid and reversible outer&#8208;sphere addition of 2 to the terminal allene carbon atom of I&#8242; to form gold vinyl complex (IPr)Au[C(=CH2)CMe2NMePh] (II) is superimposed on the slower addition of 2 to the terminal allene carbon atom of I to form gold vinyl complex (IPr)Au[C(=CMe2)CH2NMePh] (III). Selective protodeauration of III releases N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(3&#8208;methylbut&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)aniline (3&#8201;a) with regeneration of 4. At high conversion, gold vinyl complex II is competitively trapped by an (IPr)Au+ fragment to form the cationic bis(gold) vinyl complex {[(IPr)Au]2[C(=CH2)CMe2NMePh]}+ (6).

         <title>Enantioconvergent Substitution Reactions of Racemic Electrophiles by Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective catalysis using organocatalysts is a highly desirable process for the synthesis of organic molecules in an enantioenriched form. This minireview highlights recent achievements in the development of enantioconvergent substitution reactions of racemic electrophiles using organocatalysts. The contents are classified on the basis of the mechanistic types of enantioconvergent processes.







Abstract
Over the past decades, the development of enantioselective catalysis using organocatalysts has evolved into an active research field and a number of enantioselective transformations have been established. However, despite their being a highly desirable process for the synthesis of organic molecules in an enantioenriched form, the enantioconvergent substitution reactions of racemic electrophiles using organocatalysts still present several challenges. Although intrinsic difficulties in the catalytic stereocontrol abound due to the initial chiral information of racemic electrophiles, in recent years, mechanistically diverse enantioconvergent processes have been intensively investigated in organocatalysis. This Minireview focuses on recent achievements in the development of enantioconvergent substitution reactions of racemic electrophiles using organocatalysts. The contents are classified on the basis of the mechanistic types of enantioconvergent processes.

Hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects are engineered and prepared through a facile soft&#8208;template combined with partial reduction methods. The electrode material shows exceptional specific capacitance of 1329&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention of the D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4 is about 95.8&#8201;% along with the cycle number of 3000. Besides, the as&#8208;prepared D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4//AC exhibits an exceptional energy density (34.13&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1).







Abstract
Oxygen defects and hollow structures positively impact pseudocapacitive properties of diffusion/surface&#8208;controlled processes, a component of critical importance when building high&#8208;performance supercapacitors. Hence, we fabricated hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects (D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4) through a soft&#8208;template and partial reduction method, enhancing D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4&#8217;s electrochemical performance, yielding a specific capacitance of 1329&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, and demonstrating excellent durability with 95.8&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000&#8197;cycles. D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4 was used as the positive electrode to construct an asymmetric supercapacitor, displaying an energy density of up to 34.13&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and demonstrating good predisposition towards practical applications. This work presents an effective approach to fabricate and use hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects as pseudocapacitor material for high&#8208;performance capacitive energy storage devices.

         <title>A Novel M8L6 Cubic Cage That Binds Tetrapyridyl Porphyrins: Cage and Solvent Effects in Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
The design, synthesis, and application of a novel caged cobalt porphyrin catalyst is reported. The effects of the solvent and/or the cage on the catalytic performance in cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions were investigated for the free and confined catalyst. Encapsulation of the catalyst led to a three times more active catalyst compared to the well&#8208;established cobalt&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin and leads to a substantially increased TON.







Abstract
Confinement of a catalyst can have a significant impact on catalytic performance and can lead to otherwise difficult to achieve catalyst properties. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a novel caged catalyst system Co&#8722;G@Fe8(Zn&#8722;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1)6, which is soluble in both polar and apolar solvents without the necessity of any post&#8208;functionalization. This is a rare example of a metal&#8208;coordination cage able to bind catalytically active porphyrins that is soluble in solvents spanning a wide variety of polarity. This system was used to investigate the combined effects of the solvent and the cage on the catalytic performance in the cobalt catalyzed cyclopropanation of styrene, which involves radical intermediates. Kinetic studies show that DMF has a protective influence on the catalyst, slowing down deactivation of both [Co(TPP)] and Co&#8722;G@Fe8(Zn&#8722;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1)6, leading to higher TONs in this solvent. Moreover, DFT studies on the [Co(TPP)] catalyst show that the rate determining energy barrier of this radical&#8208;type transformation is not influenced by the coordination of DMF. As such, the increased TONs obtained experimentally stem from the stabilizing effect of DMF and are not due to an intrinsic higher activity caused by axial ligand binding to the cobalt center ([Co(TPP)(L)]). Remarkably, encapsulation of Co&#8722;G led to a three times more active catalyst than [Co(TPP)] (TOFini) and a substantially increased TON compared to both [Co(TPP)] and free Co&#8722;G. The increased local concentration of the substrates in the hydrophobic cage compared to the bulk explains the observed higher catalytic activities.

         <title>Fulvalene&#8208;Based Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Ladder&#8208;Type Structures: Synthesis and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8315-8324, June 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiredox systems: Ladder&#8208;type structures can be obtained by connecting indenofluorene units via cross&#8208;conjugated fulvalene motifs. Placing such polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons between two dithiafulvenes provides multiredox systems that undergo reversible reductions and oxidations and that can hence exist in several charge states. Synthetic protocols for such &#8220;super&#8208;extended&#8221; tetrathiafulvalenes are presented together with redox, optical, and structural properties.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have found strong interest for their electronic properties and as model systems for graphene. While PAHs have been studied intensively as single units, here PAHs were constructed in ladder&#8208;type arrangements using cross&#8208;conjugated fulvalene and dithiafulvalene motifs as connecting units and moving forward a convenient synthetic approach for dimerizing (thio)ketones into olefins by the action of Lawesson's reagent. Some of the PAHs can also be regarded as &#8220;super&#8208;extended&#8221; tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) with some of the largest cores ever explored, being multi&#8208;redox systems that exhibit both reversible oxidations and reductions. Concomitant absorption redshifts were observed when expanding the ladder&#8208;type structures from one to two to three indenofluorene units, and optical and electrochemical HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps were found to correlate linearly. Various conformations (and solid&#8208;state packing arrangements) were studied by X&#8208;ray crystallography and computations.

         <title>DNA Functionality with Photoswitchable Hydrazone Cytidine**
</title>

The synthesis of hydrazone&#8208;modified cytidine phosphoramidite and oligodeoxynucleotides containing this modification is presented. The E&#8208;Z isomerization triggered by the irradiation of a 450&#8197;nm blue light was investigated in the contexts of both nucleoside and oligodeoxynucleotide. The control of DNA synthesis in&#8197;vitro was achieved by using the blue light in the primer extension reactions in the presence of DNA polymerases.







Abstract
A new family of hydrazone modified cytidine phosphoramidite building block was synthesized and incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides to construct photoswitchable DNA strands. The E&#8208;Z isomerization triggered by the irradiation of blue light with a wavelength of 450&#8197;nm was investigated and confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and HPLC in the contexts of both nucleoside and oligodeoxynucleotide. The light activated Z form isomer of this hydrazone&#8208;cytidine with a six&#8208;member intramolecular hydrogen bond was found to inhibit DNA synthesis in the primer extension model by using Bst DNA polymerase. In addition, the hydrazone modification caused the misincorporation of dATP together with dGTP into the growing DNA strand with similar selectivity, highlighting a potential G to A mutation. This work provides a novel functional DNA building block and an additional molecular tool that has potential chemical biology and biomedicinal applications to control DNA synthesis and DNA&#8208;enzyme interactions using the cell friendly blue light irradiation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission in Aqueous Media of Responsive Luminescent Copper(I) Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8308-8314, June 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable copper(I) coordination polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) are self&#8208;assembled in water and they display solvent composition&#8208;responsive behavior that can be followed by emission of the aggregates. The dramatic differences in the emission energy and the morphology of the aggregates have been attributed to changes in the coordination sphere around the copper centers.







Abstract
Luminescent copper(I)&#8208;based compounds have recently attracted much attention since they can reach very high emission quantum yields. Interestingly, Cu(I) clusters can also be emissive, and the extension from small molecules to larger architecture could represent the first step towards novel materials that could be obtained by programming the units to undergo self&#8208;assembly. However, for Cu(I) compounds the formation of supramolecular systems is challenging due to the coordinative diversity of copper centers. This works shows that this diversity can be exploited in the construction of responsive systems. In detail, the changes in the emissive profile of different aggregates formed in water by phosphine&#8208;thioether copper(I) derivatives were followed. Our results demonstrate that the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly of Cu(I)&#8208;based coordination polymeric nanoparticles (CPNs) is sensitive to solvent composition. The solvent&#8208;induced changes are related to modifications in the coordination sphere of copper at the molecular level, which alters not only the emission profile but also the morphology of the aggregates. Our findings are expected to inspire the construction of smart supramolecular systems based on dynamic coordinative metal centers.

         <title>Solvent Induced Helix Folding of Defined Indolenine Squaraine Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8380-8389, June 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of defined indolenine squaraine dye oligomers up to the nonamer were synthesised via iterative cross coupling. Depending on the solvent either a random coil (J&#8208;type) or a loose helix (H&#8208;type) is formed. Structural and folding properties were examined via optical spectroscopy, DOSY NMR, SANS and computations.

A protecting group strategy was employed to synthesise a series of indolenine squaraine dye oligomers up to the nonamer. The longer oligomers show a distinct solvent dependence of the absorption spectra, that is, either a strong blue shift or a strong red shift of the lowest energy bands in the near infrared spectral region. This behaviour is explained by exciton coupling theory as being due to H&#8208; or J&#8208;type coupling of transition moments. The H&#8208;type coupling is a consequence of a helix folding in solvents with a small Hansen dispersity index. DOSY NMR, small angle neutron scattering (SANS), quantum chemical and force field calculations agree upon a helix structure with an unusually large pitch and open voids that are filled with solvent molecules, thereby forming a kind of clathrate. The thermodynamic parameters of the folding process were determined by temperature dependent optical absorption spectra.

&lt;p&gt;A series of defined indolenine squaraine dye oligomers up to the nonamer were synthesised via iterative cross coupling. Depending on the solvent either a random coil (J-type) or a loose helix (H-type) is formed. Structural and folding properties were examined via optical spectroscopy, DOSY NMR, SANS and computations.

         <title>Effect of Ligand Polarity on the Internal Dipoles and Ferroelectric Distortion in BaTiO3 Nanocubes</title>

Surface of BaTiO3 nanocubes covered with nonpolar oleic acid (OA) and polar tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) capping ligands, derived from atomistic modelling of neutron PDF data.







Abstract
Surface adsorbates and surrounding matrix species have been demonstrated to affect the properties of nanoscale ferroelectrics and nanoscale ferroelectric composites; potentially counteracting performance losses that can occur in small particle sizes. In this work, the effects of nonpolar oleic acid (OA) and polar tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) ligand capping on the surface of various sizes of BaTiO3 nanocubes have been investigated with combined neutron diffraction and neutron pair distribution function (PDF), density functional theory (DFT), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods. The low real space PDF region provides an unobstructed view of rhombohedral (split short and long) Ti&#8722;O distances in BaTiO3 nanocubes, mimicking the well&#8208;established order&#8208;disorder local structure found in bulk BaTiO3. Interestingly, the intermediate&#8208;range order in nanocubes is found to be orthorhombic, rather than tetragonal. It is concluded that polar ligands adsorbed at BaTiO3 surfaces stabilize the correlation length scale of local rhombohedral distortions in ferroelectric nanoparticles relative to nonpolar ligands.

         <title>Indium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;F Bond Transformation through Oxymetalation/&#946;&#8208;Fluorine Elimination to Access Fluorinated Isocoumarins</title>

An indium&#8208;catalyzed system was developed that transforms the C&#8722;F bond of 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;difluoroethenyl)benzoate derivatives via an oxymetalation process using an indium catalyst to produce various fluorinated isocoumarins. The reactions proceeded under mild conditions without transition metals.







Abstract
Fluorinated heterocycles have attracted much attention in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Many strategies have already been developed to achieve the synthesis of fluorinated heterocycles. Formidable challenges remain, however, in the synthesis of fluorinated isocoumarin derivatives that are among the most alluring structural motifs. Herein, the indium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;F bond transformation of 2&#8208;(2,2&#8208;difluorovinyl) benzoates is reported, which are readily accessible compounds, to give a diverse array of fluorinated isocoumarins. The present reaction proceeds smoothly using inexpensive reagents: a catalytic amount of indium salt in the presence of zinc salt. A theoretical calculation of potential energy profiles showed that the reaction consists of oxymetalation with the elimination of alkyl halide and the &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination.

         <title>Binding of a TlCl Entity by a Tetragold Tetramercaptothiacalixarene Metalloligand via Metallophilic Interactions</title>

p&#8208;tert&#8208;Butyltetramercaptotetrathiacalix[4]arene was used as a coordination platform to synthesize and investigate gold(I) complexes with varying nuclearity. Aiming at the corresponding tetranuclear complex through salt metathesis it was found capable of binding a neutral, molecular TlCl entity by metallophilic interactions, as shown by structural and theoretical investigations. These Interactions lead to photoluminescence at low temperatures (see figure).







Abstract
The successive auration of p&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetramercaptotetrathiacalix[4]arene, H4(MTC[4]), with gold(I) phosphine units was investigated. Through deprotonation with NaOMe, followed by salt metathesis reactions with (PR3)AuCl (R=Me, Ph) complexes with two and three [(PR3)Au]+ moieties could be prepared and isolated, namely [(Ph3PAu)2H2(MTC[4])] and [(Me3PAu)3H(MTC[4])]. In [(Me3PAu)3H(MTC[4])] two gold atoms already come close enough to undergo aurophilic interactions. To introduce a fourth [(PR3)Au]+ entity TlOEt had to be used for the deprotonation, which led to the finding that four gold atoms organised by the (MTC[4])4&#8722; coordination platform are able to bind and stabilize a TlCl entity, yielding [(Me3PAu)4TlCl(MTC[4])]. As evidenced by structural and theoretical investigations the binding occurs through strong metallophilic interactions, which lead to photoluminescence at low temperatures.

By diiodine&#8208;promoted one&#8208;electron oxidation of 10H&#8208;phenothiazine in a variety of solvents, the 10H&#8208;phenothiazinium radical cation, along with its radical coupling product, 10&#8208;(3&#8208;phenothiazinylidene)phenothiazinium, have been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, the latter for the first time. Several examples of each species are presented, supported by an array of chalcogen, halogen, and hydrogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
Utilizing facile one&#8208;electron oxidation of 10H&#8208;phenothiazine by molecular diiodine, the solid&#8208;state structure of the 10H&#8208;phenothiazinium radical cation was obtained in three cation:iodide ratios, as well as its THF and acetone solvates. Oxidation of 10H&#8208;phenothiazine with molecular diiodine in DMSO or DMF provided the structure of the radical coupling product 10&#8208;(3&#8208;phenothiazinyldene)phenothiazinium, which has not been crystallographically characterized to date. The radical cations were balanced by a mixture (I7)&#8722;, (I5)&#8722;, (I3)&#8722;, and I&#8722; anions, where a variety of chalcogen, halogen, and hydrogen bonding interactions stabilize the structures to reveal these interesting cationic species.

         <title>Racemic Tartrate/Malate Anions Combine with Racemic Complex Cations to Form Optically Active Ionic Crystals</title>

Treatment of racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;AgI3RhIII2 complex cations with racemic RR/SS&#8208;tartrate gave a single conglomerate containing a pair of enantiomers &#916;&#916;&#8208;SS and &#923;&#923;&#8208;RR on crystallization. While similar treatment using racemic R/S&#8208;malate also gave a single conglomerate, the enantiomers produced have opposite chiralities of &#923;&#923;&#8208;S and &#916;&#916;&#8208;R. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the S form of natural malate, which is opposite to the RR form of natural tartrate. The presence of S&#8208;aspartate led to preferential crystallization of one enantiomer &#916;&#916;&#8208;SS or &#923;&#923;&#8208;RR dependent on the solution pH.







Abstract
Spontaneous resolution has attracted continuing attention in various research fields since Pasteur's work on the crystallization behavior of racemic tartrate. Here, a unique example of this phenomenon is reported, involving ionic crystals generated from racemic RR/SS&#8208; tartrate or R/S&#8208;malate and racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[Ag3Rh2(2&#8208;aminoethanethiolato)6]3+ (&#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+) in water. RR&#8208; and SS&#8208;tartrate selectively recognize the &#923;&#923; and &#916;&#916; isomers of [1]3+ to produce ionic crystals of (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(RR&#8208;tartrate)3 and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(SS&#8208;tartrate)3, respectively, which can undergo spontaneous resolution. While spontaneous resolution also occurs when using R/S&#8208;malate, R&#8208; and S&#8208;malate select the opposite isomers of [1]3+ to give ionic crystals of (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;malate)3 and (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;malate)3, respectively. In the presence of S&#8208;aspartate, (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;tartrate)3 and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;tartrate)3 are preferentially crystallized from &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+ and RR/SS&#8208;tartrate at solution pH values of 6 and 10, respectively. This finding provides significant insight into the optical resolution of chemical species by spontaneous resolution and the origin of homochirality in nature.

         <title>A Cytotoxic Bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene)carbazolide Gold(III) Complex Targets DNA by Partial Intercalation</title>

Towards new AuIII anticancer agents. Herein a redox&#8208;stabilised DNA&#8208;targeting AuIII bis(carbene) pincer complex with significant cytotoxicity is reported that is likely underpinned by partial DNA intercalation. In silico studies indicate that the complex can also target unusual DNA forms such as 3&#8208;way junctions and Z&#8208;DNA. The structures of several multinuclear AgI complexes discovered en route to the target AuIII complex were also elucidated.







Abstract
The syntheses of bis(triazolium)carbazole precursors and their corresponding coinage metal (Au, Ag) complexes are reported. For alkylated triazolium salts, di&#8208; or tetranuclear complexes with bridging ligands were isolated, while the bis(aryl) analogue afforded a bis(carbene) AuI&#8208;CNC pincer complex suitable for oxidation to the redox&#8208;stable [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ cation. Although the ligand salt and the [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ complex were both notably cytotoxic toward the breast cancer cell line MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231, the AuIII complex was somewhat more selective. Electrophoresis, viscometry, UV&#8208;vis, CD and LD spectroscopy suggest the cytotoxic [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ complex behaves as a partial DNA intercalator. In silico screening indicated that the [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ complex can target DNA three&#8208;way junctions with good specificity, several other regular B&#8208;DNA forms, and Z&#8208;DNA. Multiple hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;type interactions involving T and A bases appear to be important for B&#8208;form DNA binding, while phosphate O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions evidently underpin Z&#8208;DNA binding. The CNC ligand effectively stabilizes the AuIII ion, preventing reduction in the presence of glutathione. Both the redox stability and DNA affinity of the hit compound might be key factors underpinning its cytotoxicity in&#8197;vitro.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of New Withaferin A Inspired Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitors</title>

The structural and functional properties of withaferin A suggested the design of a new candidate for Hedgehog pathway inhibitions. The enantioselective synthesis permitted the identification of two promising hits.







Abstract
Withanolides constitute a well&#8208;known family of plant&#8208;based alkaloids characterised by widespread biological properties, including the ability of interfering with Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway. Following our interest in natural products and in anticancer compounds, we report here the synthesis of a new class of Hh signalling pathway inhibitors, inspired by withaferin A, the first isolated member of withanolides. The decoration of our scaffolds was rationally supported by in silico studies, while functional evaluation revealed promising candidates, confirming once again the importance of natural products as inspiration source for the discovery of novel bioactive compounds. A stereoselective approach, based on Brown chemistry, allowed the obtainment and the functional evaluation of the enantiopure hit compounds.

Efficient synthetic pathways and purification strategies to access regioisomerically pure isomers of a perylene&#8208;perylene homodimer and a perylene&#8208;naphthalene heterodimer with 30 and 35 conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron pairs are reported. Furthermore, their optoelectronic properties were tuned via protonation and methylation of their dibenzimidazole&#8208;bridging unit.







Abstract
A modified synthetic pathway towards perylene&#8208;perylene dimers and a facile purification method to obtain the regioisomerically pure syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;isomers are reported. In addition, a novel perylene&#8208;naphthalene heterodimer with 30 conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron pairs was designed and synthesized on the basis of a previously described precursor and the resulting regioisomers were separated from each other. Thereby, the opto&#8208;electronic properties of the linearly elongated chromophores could be investigated regarding the differences in length of their aromatic system and the configuration of the isomers. Further tuning of their energy gaps was realized via protonation and methylation of the dibenzimidazole&#8208;bridging unit. Extraordinary red&#8208;shifts of the absorption maxima of 62&#8197;nm for the methylated and 92&#8197;nm for the protonated perylene&#8208;perylene anti&#8208;isomer could be achieved. Moreover, the maxima for the syn&#8208;isomer could be shifted bathochromically by 87 and 113&#8197;nm, respectively.

         <title>Frontispiece: Fischer Carbene Complexes: A Glance at Two Decades of Research on Higher&#8208;Order Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, June 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The frontispiece shows the transformation of Fischer Carbene Complexes in a wide variety of compounds through of Higher&#8208;order Cycloadditions. The flask, containing the carbene, pour on the paper the different products synthesized in the last 20&#8197;years. In the background, the blackboard draws traces of important contributions in the area, such as the orbital correlation diagrams for Higher&#8208;order Cycloadditions and the representation of molecular orbitals made by Woodward and Hoffmann, that established the bases in this research area. For more details see the Review by M.&#8197;A. V&#225;zquez et&#8197;al. on 8233&#8197;ff.

The technically relevant ligand precursor 3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbiphenol is usually obtained by oxidative coupling using mostly environmentally less benign processes. The electrochemical dehydrogenative electrochemical synthesis is an attractive and green technique to make this particular molecule. The different anodic approaches for oxidative coupling and challenges associated are surveyed by S.&#8197;R. Waldvogel et al. in the Minireview on page&#8197;8252&#8197;ff.

The formation of coordination polymer nanoparticles by a copper(I) coordination compound containing cubane&#8208;like clusters as nodes connected by hybrid thioether&#8208;phosphine ligands has been achieved in aqueous media. The formed particles display a yellow aggregation&#8208;induced emission. The change in the environment triggers a morphological transformation towards elongated aggregates due to changes in the coordination environment, opening the cubane units and causing a cyan emission. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G. Moreno&#8208;Alc&#225;ntar et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100865).

A challenging synthesis yields a bis(carbene) AuI&#8208;CNC pincer precursor complex that may be oxidized to a remarkably redox&#8208;stable [AuIII(CNC)Cl]+ cation which shows significant cytotoxicity towards a breast cancer cell line. Electrophoresis, viscometry, and spectroscopic data suggest the likely mode of interaction of the compound with DNA involves partial intercalation, enabling it to potentially target both conventional and unconventional DNA species such as three&#8208;way junctions (in silico data).

A fluorinated isocoumarin (depicted as a gladiator&#8242;s shield in the cover image) is transformed from a gem&#8208;difluoroalkene (wood shield) by virtue of the cool property of an indium catalyst (shooting star). Both fluorinated heterocycles and isocoumarins are alluring structural motifs, and we developed a comprehensive and novel strategy for the synthesis of fluorinated isocoumarins. Indium salts possess a moderate Lewis&#8208;acidity and affinity with gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and both properties accomplished the reaction system. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Nishimoto, M. Yasuda et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100672).

Abstract
The symmetric biphenol 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol is a well&#8208;known ligand building block and is used in transition&#8208;metal catalysis. In the literature, there are several synthetic routes for the preparation of this exceptional molecule. Herein, the focus is on the sustainable electrochemical synthesis of 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol. A brief overview of the developmental history of this inconspicuous molecule, which is of great interest for technical applications, but has many challenges for its synthesis, is provided. The electro&#8208;organic method is a powerful, sustainable, and efficient alternative to conventional synthesis to obtain this symmetric biphenol up to the kilogram scale. Another section of this article is devoted to different process management strategies in batch&#8208;type and flow electrolysis and their respective advantages.

         <title>Fischer Carbene Complexes: A Glance at Two Decades of Research on Higher&#8208;Order Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8233-8251, June 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the reports over the past 20&#8197;years on higher&#8208;order cycloadditions (HOC) involving Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) to obtain diverse carbocycles and heterocycles. The FCCs analyzed contain group VI metals, covering alkenyl, alkynyl and alkyl carbene complexes, which reacted with alkynes, allenes, enolates, fulvenes, heptafulvenes and other polyenic species through concerted or stepway process, some of them co&#8208;catalyzed by other metals. An analysis is made of the main aspects of the mechanisms proposed for HOC.







Abstract
The structure of Fischer carbene complexes (FCCs) is electron deficient. If bearing an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated system, it can generate a wide variety of compounds by undergoing many different transformations, including higher&#8208;order cycloadditions. The latter are described as pericyclic reactions in which more than six electrons participate. These reactions have been employed in various areas of organic synthesis, resulting in highly selective compounds with a broad range of scaffolds. The first studies on higher&#8208;order cycloadditions involving FCCs frequently yielded competing byproducts. Many groups have attempted to increase selectivity by exploring distinct reaction conditions, reagents and co&#8208;catalysts (e.&#8201;g., metal&#8208;mediated cycloadditions). The present review is the first to focus exclusively on using higher&#8208;order cycloadditions involving FCCs to synthesize carbocycles and heterocycles. Based on two decades of reports, an analysis is made of the main aspects of the mechanisms proposed for higher&#8208;order cycloadditions and the structural diversity obtained by the substituent effect.

The electrochemical hydroboration of alkynes by using B2Pin2 as the boron source is reported. This reaction manifold was applied to a broad range of alkynes, giving the hydroboration products in good to excellent yields without the need of a metal catalyst or a hydride source. In addition, the mechanism of this transformation was study.







Abstract
Herein we reported the electrochemical hydroboration of alkynes by using B2Pin2 as the boron source. This unprecedented reaction manifold was applied to a broad range of alkynes, giving the hydroboration products in good to excellent yields without the need of a metal catalyst or a hydride source. This transformation relied on the possible electrochemical oxidation of an in&#8197;situ formed borate. This anodic oxidation performed in an undivided cell allowed the formation of a putative boryl radical, which reacted on the alkyne.

         <title>Iridium Complex of N&#8208;Fused Bilatrienone: Oxidative Cleavage of N&#8208;Fused Porphyrin Induced by Iridium&#8208;Cyclooctadiene Complexation</title>

Metalation&#8208;assisted oxidative degradation: Reaction of N&#8208;fused porphyrin with iridium&#8208;cyclooctadiene under aerobic conditions yielded a unique ring&#8208;opened N&#8208;fused bilatrienone analog. The resulting species was isolated as an octahedral iridium complex with significantly modified optical and electrochemical properties.







Abstract
N&#8208;fused porphyrin (NFP) is a unique class of photostable near&#8208;infrared dyes with an 18&#960; aromatic tetrapyrrole macrocyclic skeleton containing a tri&#8208;fused pentacyclic moiety. Here, the synthesis of an iridium complex of N&#8208;fused bilatrienone is reported as the degradation product of Ir&#8208;cyclooctadiene (cod)&#8208;induced oxidative cleavage of NFP under aerobic conditions. Similar to the native bilin chromophores, the ring&#8208;opened complex featured a broken &#960;&#8208;conjugation circuit and exhibited a broad visible absorption band. In contrast, metalation of NFP using an iridium(I)(cod) complex under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of a cod&#8208;isomerized (&#954;1,&#951;3&#8208;C8H12)&#8208;Ir complex.

The resulting species was isolated as an octahedral iridium complex with significantly modified optical and electrochemical properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N-fused porphyrin (NFP) is a unique class of photostable near-infrared dyes with an 18&#960; aromatic tetrapyrrole macrocyclic skeleton containing a tri-fused pentacyclic moiety. Here, the synthesis of an iridium complex of N-fused bilatrienone is reported as the degradation product of Ir-cyclooctadiene (cod)-induced oxidative cleavage of NFP under aerobic conditions. Similar to the native bilin chromophores, the ring-opened complex featured a broken &#960;-conjugation circuit and exhibited a broad visible absorption band. In contrast, metalation of NFP using an iridium(I)(cod) complex under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of a cod-isomerized (&#954;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;)-Ir complex.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Oligomers Intermediates in Between Two New Distinct Homonuclear Uranium(IV) DOTP Complexes**
</title>

         <dc:description>
The interaction between tetravalent uranium and DOTP, a cyclen&#8208;derived tetraphosphonic ligand, was studied in aqueous solutions. It resulted in the eventual formation of two new different homo&#8208;nuclear species, [UIV(DOTPH4)] and [UIV(DOTPH6)2]. Various analytical techniques showed that a pH&#8208;dependent, reversible and irreversible oligomerization processes govern both species in&#8208;solution dynamics.







Abstract
Two new aqueous UIV complexes were synthesized by the interaction between the tetravalent uranium cation and the (1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid) (DOTP) macrocyclic ligand. Two distinct homonuclear complexes were identified; the first was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography as a unique &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;cage&#8221;, [U(DOTPH6)2] complex, in which the UIV cation is octa&#8208;coordinated to 4 phosphonic arms from each ligand in a square anti&#8208;prism geometry, with a C4 symmetry. The second is the &#8220;in&#8208;cage&#8221; [U(DOTPH4)] complex, in which the tetravalent cation is located between the macrocycle O4 and N4 planes. With the help of UV&#8208;Vis absorption, 1H/31P&#8197;NMR, ATR&#8208;IR, and MALDI&#8208;TOFMS analytical techniques, the chemical interchange between both species is presented. It is shown that the one&#8208;way transition is governed by the formation of a multiple number of soluble oligomeric species consisting of varied stoichiometric ratios of both characterized homonuclear complexes.

Polyoxazoline block copolymers offer a wide range of possibilities for application depending on their molecular structure and properties. This study introduces the huge potential of this polyoxazoline toolkit and demonstrates how tailor&#8208;made toolkit polymers can be applied in representative systems.







Abstract
Post&#8208;polymerization modification provides an elegant way to introduce chemical functionalities onto macromolecules to produce tailor&#8208;made materials with superior properties. This concept was adapted to well&#8208;defined block copolymers of the poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) family and demonstrated the large potential of these macromolecules as universal toolkit for numerous applications. Triblock copolymers with separated water&#8208;soluble, alkyne&#8208; and alkene&#8208;containing segments were synthesized and orthogonally modified with various low&#8208;molecular weight functional molecules by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and thiol&#8208;ene (TE) click reactions, respectively. Representative toolkit polymers were used for the synthesis of gold, iron oxide and silica nanoparticles.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Hydrosilylation of Ketenes with Silicon Electrophiles: Access to Fully Substituted Aldehyde&#8208;Derived Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 32, Page 8273-8276, June 4, 2021. </description>

&#946;,&#946;&#8208;Di&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;monoaryl&#8208;substituted silyl enol ethers derived from aldehydes are difficult to prepare. This rare class of compounds has been made accessible by a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free hydrosilylation of ketenes with B(C6F5)3 as catalyst and Et3SiH as stoichiometric reductant. The substrate scope is decent, and the stereoselectivity moderate to good in selected cases.







Abstract
Little&#8208;explored hydrosilylation of ketenes promoted by main&#8208;group catalysts is reported. The boron Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane accelerates the slow uncatalyzed reaction of ketenes and hydrosilanes, thereby providing a convenient access to the new class of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;di&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;monoaryl&#8208;substituted aldehyde&#8208;derived silyl enol ethers. Yields are moderate to high, and Z configuration is preferred. The corresponding silyl bis&#8208;enol ethers are also available when using dihydrosilanes. The related trityl&#8208;cation&#8208;initiated hydrosilylation involving self&#8208;regeneration of silylium ions is far less effective.

&#8220;The DFT calculation results revealed an attractive characteristic of indium atoms with fluorine atoms. These significant results show that indium salts act as a &#960;&#8208;Lewis activator of gem&#8208;difluoroalkene and smoothly abstract fluoride thanks to an affinity toward fluorine atoms. In indium chemistry, few results of C&#8722;F bond functionalization have been established. We achieved both indium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;F bond functionalization and the first synthesis of monofluorinated isocoumarin at the 3&#8208;position.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;8288&#8197;ff.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Aetokthonotoxin, the Cyanobacterial Neurotoxin Causing Vacuolar Myelinopathy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aetokthonotoxin has recently been identified as the cyanobacterial neurotoxin causing Vacuolar Myelinopathy, a fatal neurologic disease, spreading through a trophic cascade and affecting birds of prey such as the bald eagle in the USA. Here we describe the total synthesis of this specialized metabolite; this complex, highly brominated 1,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole could be synthesized via a Somei&#8208;type Michael reaction as key step. The optimised sequence yielded the natural product in five steps with an overall yield of 29%.</dc:description>

         <title>Broad Scope and High&#8208;Yield Access to Unsymmetrical Acyclic [11C]Ureas for Biomedical Imaging from [11C]Carbonyl Difluoride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid and high&#8208;yield syntheses of unsymmetrical acyclic [11C]ureas under mild conditions (room temperature and within 7&#8197;min) using no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [11C]carbonyl difluoride with aliphatic and aryl amines are described. This new methodology is compatible with a range of functional groups and with both aliphatic amines and anilines.







Abstract
Effective methods are needed for labelling acyclic ureas with carbon&#8208;11 (t1/2=20.4&#8197;min) as potential radiotracers for biomedical imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). Herein, we describe the rapid and high&#8208;yield syntheses of unsymmetrical acyclic [11C]ureas under mild conditions (room temperature and within 7&#8197;min) using no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [11C]carbonyl difluoride with aliphatic and aryl amines. This methodology is compatible with diverse functionality (e.&#8201;g., hydroxy, carboxyl, amino, amido, or pyridyl) in the substrate amines. The labelling process proceeds through putative [11C]carbamoyl fluorides and for primary amines through isolable [11C]isocyanate intermediates. Unsymmetrical [11C]ureas are produced with negligible amounts of unwanted symmetrical [11C]urea byproducts. Moreover, the overall labelling method tolerates trace water and the generally moderate to excellent yields show good reproducibility. [11C]Carbonyl difluoride shows exceptional promise for application to the synthesis of acyclic [11C]ureas as new radiotracers for biomedical imaging with PET.

         <title>Phosphetes via Transition Metal Free Ring Closure &#8211; Taking the Proper Turn at a Thermodynamic Crossing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New route: Investigation of the phosphanide addition to alkynes revealed that the ring size can be controlled during the cyclization step leading either to phospholes or phosphetes starting from the same reactants.







Abstract
A transition metal free route to phosphetes featuring an exocyclic alkene unit is presented. In this approach phosphanides are added to a variety of diynes generating phosphaallylic intermediates which depending on the reaction conditions transform either to phosphetes or the corresponding phospholes. Investigation of the reaction mechanism by combined quantum chemical and experimental means identifies phosphole formation as thermodynamically controlled reaction path, whereas kinetic control furnishes the corresponding phosphetes. Structural and luminescence properties of the rare class of phosphetes are explored, as well as for selected key intermediates.

         <title>Artificial Supramolecular Pumps Powered by Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The appropriate integration of molecular recognition and photoswitching phenomena in rotaxane&#8208;type complexes can lead to the realization of artificial supramolecular pumps driven by light. We describe the operation mechanisms of these systems, based on a flashing energy ratchet, is described, and their ability to function autonomously by dissipating light energy away from chemical equilibrium is reported.







Abstract
The development of artificial nanoscale motors that can use energy from a source to perform tasks requires systems capable of performing directionally controlled molecular movements and operating away from chemical equilibrium. Here, the design, synthesis and properties of pseudorotaxanes are described, in which a photon input triggers the unidirectional motion of a macrocyclic ring with respect to a non&#8208;symmetric molecular axle. The photoinduced energy ratcheting at the basis of the pumping mechanism is validated by measuring the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Owing to the photochemical behavior of the azobenzene moiety embedded in the axle, the pump can repeat its operation cycle autonomously under continuous illumination. NMR spectroscopy was used to observe the dissipative non&#8208;equilibrium state generated in&#8197;situ by light irradiation. We also show that fine changes in the axle structure lead to an improvement in the performance of the motor. Such results highlight the modularity and versatility of this minimalist pump design, which provides facile access to dynamic systems that operate under photoinduced non&#8208;equilibrium regimes.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208; and Fluorene&#8208;Fused Aza&#8208;BODIPYs: NIR Fluorophores with High Brightness and Photostability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Look on the bright side: Three new fluorescent aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes fused with fluorene or carbazole substituents show strong bathochromic shifts (up to 139&#8197;nm) of absorption and emission maxima compared to the parent 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyl aza&#8208;BODIPY (TPAB) and are highly photostable. Two of the dyes show excellent fluorescence brightness due to exceptionally high molar absorption coefficients (ca. 230&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and emission quantum yields (up to 0.66); the third dye was rendered pH sensitive by introducing a chlorophenol motif.







Abstract
Three new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes incorporating fused fluorene or carbazole moieties have been prepared. The dyes show significant enhancement of photophysical properties compared to the parent 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyl aza&#8208;BODIPY (TPAB): a bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum (up to 2700&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and emission maximum (up to 2270&#8197;cm&#8722;1); an almost threefold increase in molar absorption coefficients (to ca. 230&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and a significant increase in the fluorescence quantum yield to 49&#8211;66&#8201;%. Owing to the combination of these properties, the new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes belong to the brightest NIR dyes reported. The dyes also show excellent photostability. Due to their outstanding properties, the new dyes represent a promising platform for further exploration in biomedical research. A pH indicator containing only one fused carbazole unit was also prepared and shows absorption and emission spectra that are bathochromically shifted by about 110 and 100&#8197;nm, respectively, compared to the indicator dye based on the TPAB chromophore.

The dyes show significant enhancement of photophysical properties compared to the parent 1,3,5,7-tetraphenyl aza-BODIPY (TPAB): a bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum (up to 2700&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and emission maximum (up to 2270&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;); an almost threefold increase in molar absorption coefficients (to ca. 230&#8201;000&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a significant increase in the fluorescence quantum yield to 49&#8211;66&#8201;%. Owing to the combination of these properties, the new aza-BODIPY dyes belong to the brightest NIR dyes reported. The dyes also show excellent photostability. Due to their outstanding properties, the new dyes represent a promising platform for further exploration in biomedical research. A pH indicator containing only one fused carbazole unit was also prepared and shows absorption and emission spectra that are bathochromically shifted by about 110 and 100&#8197;nm, respectively, compared to the indicator dye based on the TPAB chromophore.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Pd/Cu Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Highly Functional All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters from Vinyl Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual nature nurtures yield: Compounds with highly functional quaternary stereocenters can be prepared through a Pd/Cu dual&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of vinyl cyclic carbonates. These elusive products are produced in good yields of up to 84&#8201;% and er values of up to 90&#8201;:&#8201;10. Mechanistic control reactions underline the crucial role of various additives and a Lewis acid co&#8208;catalyst that, in concert, mediate the stabilization and coupling of a dienolate intermediate to an electrophilic allyl species.







Abstract
The challenging metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of highly functional quaternary carbon centers using decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation reactions is reported. The key substrate, a vinyl cyclic carbonate, is activated to provide concomitantly both the requisite nucleophile (by formal umpolung) and electrophile reaction partner preceding the asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling process. A wide screening of reaction conditions, additives and catalyst precursors afforded a protocol that gave access to a series of compounds featuring densely functionalized, elusive quaternary carbon stereocenters in appreciable yield and with enantiomeric ratios (er's) of up to 90&#8201;:&#8201;10.

         <title>The Deuterated &#8220;Magic Methyl&#8220; Group &#8208; A Guide for Site&#8208;selective Trideuteromethyl Incorporation and Labeling using CD3&#8208;reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of medicinal chemistry the precise installation of a trideuteromethyl group is gaining ever&#8208;increasing attention. Site&#8208;selective incorporation of the deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group can provide profound pharmacological benefits and can be considered as an important tool for drug optimization and development. This review provides a structured overview, according to the trideuteromethylation reagent, of currently established methods for site&#8208;selective trideuteromethylations of carbon atoms. Selective introduction of CD2H and CDH2 groups, in addition to CD3, is also considered. For all methods, the corresponding mechanism and scope are discussed whenever reported. As such, this review can be a starting point for synthetic chemists to further advance trideuteromethylation methodologies. At the same time, this review aims to be a guide for medicinal chemists, offering them the available C&#8208;CD3 formation strategies for the preparation of new or modified drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing a &#8220;Ring Size&#8208;Divergent&#8221; Synthetic Strategy: Synthesis, Structural Revision, and Absolute Configuration of Feroniellins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Feroniellin analogs isolated from  Feroniella lucida  possess a furanocoumarin skeleton connected with monoterpenic five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered ethereal rings by an ether linkage and exhibit a broad spectrum of biological activities. In this contribution, we intended to establish a &#8220;ring size&#8208;divergent&#8221; synthetic strategy for the monoterpenic five&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered ethereal rings through the chemical sythesis of feroniellins. Herein, we report the short and comprehensive synthesis of feroniellins has been achieved in only 2 steps from easily available bergamottin based on the &#8220;ring size&#8208;divergent&#8221; strategy. In addition, these syntheses resulted in revision of the proposed structures for feroniellins A and B and the determination of all the absolute configurations of feroniellins, and further their preliminary anti&#8208;inflammatory activities were investigated as well.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing the Mechanism of Peroxyformate Decomposition: Computational Insights to Understand Solvent Influence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heterolytic decomposition of tert&#8208;butyl peroxyformate to tert&#8208;butanol and carbon dioxide, catalyzed by pyridine, is a long&#8208;known example of a reaction whose kinetics are strongly affected by solvent polarity. Through DFT and ab initio methods together with the SMD implicit solvation model, we propose an extension on the formerly accepted mechanism. Our novel proposal involves the formation of a carbonic acid ester intermediate and its further decomposition, through an unreported pyridine&#8208;mediated stepwise route. Computed barriers for this mechanism at the DLPNO/CCSD(T)&#8208;def2&#8208;TZVP are in excellent agreement with experimental kinetic data across different solvents. Furthermore, the strong relationships between activation energies, geometric parameters in the transition state and the characteristics of the different solvents are also analyzed in depth.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress in Multifunctional Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks/Polymer Hybrid Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greater than the sum of their parts: MOF/polymer hybrid materials and membranes can not only inherit the individual component's properties but also lead to some collaboratively enforced functions. This Minireview outlines some design strategies of MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid membranes and their structure&#8208;function relationship, and highlights some significant recent advances in MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid membrane, particularly on their application in separation, conduction, and sensing.







Abstract
The fabrication of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes with customized functions and high efficiency is of great significance, but presents challenges. Emerging metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)/polymer hybrid membranes have provided bright promise as an innovative platform to target multifunctional hybrid materials and devices; this is thanks to their unique properties, which come from three components that are collaboratively enforced. This minireview provides a brief overview of recent progress in the construction of such hybrid membranes, and highlights some of their very important applications in separation, conduction, and sensing.

         <title>Lighting Up the Plasma Membrane: Development and Applications of Fluorescent Ligands for Transmembrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we overview progress made during the last two decades in small&#8208;molecule fluorescent ligand design and their applications as tools using different fluorescence microscopy techniques. After a brief introduction on their drawbacks and advantages, we particularly focus on their use as versatile tools to study transmembrane proteins including the superfamilies of G&#160;protein&#8208;coupled receptor, ligand&#8208; and voltage&#8208;gated ion channels.







Abstract
Despite the fact that transmembrane proteins represent the main therapeutic targets for decades, complete and in&#8208;depth knowledge about their biochemical and pharmacological profiling is not fully available. In this regard, target&#8208;tailored small&#8208;molecule fluorescent ligands are a viable approach to fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle. Such tools, coupled with the ability of high&#8208;precision optical techniques to image with an unprecedented resolution at a single&#8208;molecule level, helped unraveling many of the conundrums related to plasma proteins&#8217; life&#8208;cycle and druggability. Herein, we review the recent progress made during the last two decades in fluorescent ligand design and potential applications in fluorescence microscopy of voltage&#8208;gated ion channels, ligand&#8208;gated ion channels and G&#8208;coupled protein receptors.

         <title>Electrostatic Perturbations from the Protein Affect C&#8722;H Bond Strengths of the Substrate and Enable Negative Catalysis in the TmpA Biosynthesis Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory studies on large active site cluster models of the nonheme iron dioxygenase TmpA elucidated the origin of its chemoselectivity and identify it as negative catalysis, where an otherwise favorable channel is blocked. The enzyme succeeds in this thanks to charged residues in the substrate binding pocket, which produce a local electric dipole moment (&#956;D) and electric field and these electrostatic perturbations guide the reaction to a selective reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The nonheme iron dioxygenase 2&#8208;(trimethylammonio)&#8208;ethylphosphonate dioxygenase (TmpA) is an enzyme involved in the regio&#8208; and chemoselective hydroxylation at the C1&#8208;position of the substrate as part of the biosynthesis of glycine betaine in bacteria and carnitine in humans. To understand how the enzyme avoids breaking the weak C2&#8722;H bond in favor of C1&#8208;hydroxylation, we set up a cluster model of 242 atoms representing the first and second coordination sphere of the metal center and substrate binding pocket, and investigated possible reaction mechanisms of substrate activation by an iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species by density functional theory methods. In agreement with experimental product distributions, the calculations predict a favorable C1&#8208;hydroxylation pathway. The calculations show that the selectivity is guided through electrostatic perturbations inside the protein from charged residues, external electric fields and electric dipole moments. In particular, charged residues influence and perturb the homolytic bond strength of the C1&#8722;H and C2&#8722;H bonds of the substrate, and strongly strengthens the C2&#8722;H bond in the substrate&#8208;bound orientation.

         <title>Structural, Magnetic and Catalytic Properties of a New Vacancy Ordered Perovskite Type Barium Cobaltate BaCoO2.67</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new charge ordered oxygen deficient perovskite in barium cobaltate system is reported with bifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution comparable to that to that benchmark perovskite catalyst BSCF.







Abstract
A new vacancy ordered, anion deficient perovskite modification with composition of BaCoO2.67 (Ba3Co3O8&#9633;1) has been prepared via a two&#8208;step heating process. Combined Rietveld analysis of neutron and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data shows a novel ordering of oxygen vacancies not known before for barium cobaltates. A combination of neutron powder diffraction, magnetic measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirms G&#8208;type antiferromagnetic ordering. From impedance measurements, the electronic conductivity of the order of 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is determined. Remarkably, the bifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is found to be comparable to that of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3&#8211;y, confirming that charge&#8208;ordered anion deficient non&#8208;cubic perovskites can be highly efficient catalysts.

         <title>[10]CPP&#8208;Based Inclusion Complexes of Charged Fulleropyrrolidines. Effect of the Charge Location on the Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Positive charge on fullerene unit stabilizes the charge separated excited states of [10]CPP&#8208;fulleropyrrolidine inclusion complexes. The electron transfer occurs from [10]CPP to fullerene moiety on a nanosecond to picosecond time scale. The CT band of the charged complexes demonstrates the hypsochromic (or blue) shift with increasing solvent polarity.







Abstract
A number of non&#8208;covalently bound donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, consisting of C60 as the electron acceptor and cycloparaphenylene (CPP) as the electron donor, have been reported. A hypsochromic shift of the charge transfer (CT) band in polar medium has been found in [10]CPP&#8835;Li+@C60. To explore this anomalous effect, we study inclusion complexes [10]CPP&#8835;Li+@C60&#8208;MP, [10]CPP&#8835;C60&#8208;MPH+, and [10]CPP&#8835;C60&#8208;PPyMe+ formed by fulleropyrrolidine derivatives and [10]CPP using the DFT/TDDFT approach. We show that the introduction of a positively charged fragment into fullerene stabilizes CT states that become the lowest&#8208;lying excited states. These charge&#8208;separated states can be generated by the decay of locally excited states on a nanosecond to picosecond time scale. The distance of the charged fragment to the center of the fullerenic cage and its accessibility to the solvent determine the strength of the hypsochromic shift.

&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;[10]CPP&#8835;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-PPyMe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; formed by fulleropyrrolidine derivatives and &lt;b&gt;[10]CPP&lt;/b&gt; using the DFT/TDDFT approach. We show that the introduction of a positively charged fragment into fullerene stabilizes CT states that become the lowest-lying excited states. These charge-separated states can be generated by the decay of locally excited states on a nanosecond to picosecond time scale. The distance of the charged fragment to the center of the fullerenic cage and its accessibility to the solvent determine the strength of the hypsochromic shift.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mixed Cu2Se Hexagonal Nanosheets@Co3Se4 Nanospheres for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2Se hexagonal nanosheets@Co3Se4 nanospheres mixed structures have been obtained via a facile two&#8208;step hydrothermal method. The asymmetric supercapacitor with Cu2Se@Co3Se4 as anode and graphene as cathode can provide wide work potential of 1.6&#8197;V, and delivers high energy density of 30.9&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 0.74&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a desirable lifespan (85.8&#8201;% after 10&#8201;000&#8197;charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
Rational designing and constructing multiphase hybrid electrode materials is an effective method to compensate for the performance defects of the single component. Based on this strategy, Cu2Se hexagonal nanosheets@Co3Se4 nanospheres mixed structures have been fabricated by a facile two&#8208;step hydrothermal method. Under the synergistic effect of the high ionic conductivity of Cu2Se and the remarkable cycling stability of Co3Se4, Cu2Se@Co3Se4 can exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance as a novel electrode material. The as&#8208;prepared Cu2Se@Co3Se4 electrode displays high specific capacitance of 1005&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 with enhanced rate capability (56&#8201;% capacitance retention at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and ultralong lifespan (94.2&#8201;% after 10&#8201;000 cycles at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). An asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled applying the Cu2Se@Co3Se4 as anode and graphene as cathode, which delivers a wide work potential window of 1.6&#8197;V, high energy density (30.9&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 0.74&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1), high power density (21.0&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 7.50&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1), and excellent cycling stability (85.8&#8201;% after 10&#8201;000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Enantiopure Polyradical Tetrahedral Pd12L6 Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyradical captured in a cage: Chiral polyradical PdII tetrahedral cages supported by tris(imido)phosphate trianions and diradical dhbq..2&#8722; linkers were synthesized. DFT calculations show that these cages exhibit integer spin states and ferromagnetic exchange between the adjacent radical bridges via the PdII atoms. This work provides insights into the design and synthesis of stable cage frameworks with potential in the areas of spin&#8208;electronic devices and catalysis.







Abstract
The synthesis of cages with a polyradical framework remains a challenging task. Herein is reported an enantiomeric pair of quinoid&#8208;bridged polyradical tetrahedral palladium(II) cages that are stabilized by an unusual dianionic diradical form (dhbq..2&#8722;). These cages have been characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy, squid magnetometry and mass spectrometry. Single&#8208;crystal&#8208;derived X&#8208;ray investigations of the iso&#8208;structural cages built on fluoranilate linkers confirm the tetrahedral structure of the obtained radical cages. Theoretical calculations showed that the diradical state of the dhbq anions is more stable than the usual monoradical state. A weak ferromagnetic exchange between adjacent radical centers was observed in DFT studies.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Induced N&#8722;H Bond Splitting of Ammonia and Primary Amine of CuI&#8722;MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a porous three&#8208;dimensional anionic tetrazolium based CuI&#8722;MOF, which is capable of cleaving the N&#8722;H bond of ammonia and primary amine, as well as the O&#8722;H bond of H2O along with spontaneous H2 evolution through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) structural transformations. The CuI&#8722;MOF material could be reused through simple reduction with ascorbic acid. The results showed that the CuI&#8722;MOF based on polytetrazolium ligand could be applied to activate ammonia and amine vapor in gas&#8208;solid phase.







Abstract
We report a porous three&#8208;dimensional anionic tetrazolium based CuI&#8722;MOF 1, which is capable of cleaving the N&#8722;H bond of ammonia and primary amine, as well as the O&#8722;H bond of H2O along with spontaneous H2 evolution. In the gas&#8208;solid phase reaction of 1 with ammonia and water vapor, CuI&#8722;MOF 1 was gradually oxidized to NH2&#8722;CuII&#8722;MOF and OH&#8722;CuII&#8722;MOF, through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) structural transformations, which was confirmed by XPS, PXRD and X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that CuI&#8722;MOF could lower N&#8722;H bond dissociation free energy of ammonia through coordination&#8208;induced bond weakening and promote H2 evolution by the reduction potential of 1. To our knowledge, this is the first example of MOFs that activate ammonia and amine in gas&#8208;solid manner.

         <title>Rational Enzyme Design without Structural Knowledge: A Sequence&#8208;Based Approach for Efficient Generation of Transglycosylases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although glycosylation is common in Nature, it remains a challenge for organic chemistry. Herein, a method to obtain transglycosylases from retaining glycoside hydrolases is described. The approach pinpoints 6&#8211;12 single&#8208;point mutants to assay. Invariably across six GH families, this generates enzyme variants that display increased transglycosylation yields, an improvement that is mostly due to a relative decrease in hydrolysis compared to transglycosylation. The method only requires sequence information, is fast and applicable to a broad range of glycosides.







Abstract
Glycobiology is dogged by the relative scarcity of synthetic, defined oligosaccharides. Enzyme&#8208;catalysed glycosylation using glycoside hydrolases is feasible but is hampered by the innate hydrolytic activity of these enzymes. Protein engineering is useful to remedy this, but it usually requires prior structural knowledge of the target enzyme, and/or relies on extensive, time&#8208;consuming screening and analysis. Here, a straightforward strategy that involves rational rapid in silico analysis of protein sequences is described. The method pinpoints 6&#8211;12 single&#8208;mutant candidates to improve transglycosylation yields. Requiring very little prior knowledge of the target enzyme other than its sequence, the method is generic and procures catalysts for the formation of glycosidic bonds involving various d/l&#8208;, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;pyranosides or furanosides, and exo or endo action. Moreover, mutations validated in one enzyme can be transposed to others, even distantly related enzymes.

Protein engineering is useful to remedy this, but it usually requires prior structural knowledge of the target enzyme, and/or relies on extensive, time-consuming screening and analysis. Here, a straightforward strategy that involves rational rapid &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of protein sequences is described. The method pinpoints 6&#8211;12 single-mutant candidates to improve transglycosylation yields. Requiring very little prior knowledge of the target enzyme other than its sequence, the method is generic and procures catalysts for the formation of glycosidic bonds involving various &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-, &#945;/&#946;-pyranosides or furanosides, and &lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; action. Moreover, mutations validated in one enzyme can be transposed to others, even distantly related enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Versatile Coordination of AgI and CuI Ions towards cyclo&#8208;As5 Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first homoleptic AgI and CuI coordination compounds of the cyclo&#8208;As5 complex [(Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (B) are obtained from its reaction with the M[FAl{OC6F10(C6F5)}3] (M(FAl); M=Ag, Cu) salts. Varying the ratio of the starting materials is reflected in a diversity of the isolated supramolecular assemblies (1, 3, 4) as products. The coordination mode of the cyclo&#8208;As5 units in each of 1, 3 and 4 is different revealing the pronounced adaptive coordination of B towards AgI ions.







Abstract
The reactions of the cyclo&#8208;As5 complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (B) with the AgI and CuI salts of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) [FAl{OC6F10(C6F5)}3]&#8722; ([FAl]&#8722;) are studied. These reactions allow the synthesis of the mononuclear complexes [M(&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;B)2][FAl] (M=Ag (1), Cu (2)) when a ratio of B/M(FAl) 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 is used. Compound 1 shows an unusual disorder of the central AgI cation between two &#960;&#8208;coordinating cyclo&#8208;As5 ligands, which is absent in 2 pointing to a weak interaction of the Ag center towards the cyclo&#8208;As5 ligands in B. When the ratio of B/Ag(FAl) is changed to 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, the respective coordination compounds [Ag(&#951;2&#8208;B)3][FAl] (3) and [Ag2(&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;B)2][FAl]2 (4) are accessible. The coordination modes of the cyclo&#8208;As5 units in 1, 3 and 4 are all different, reflecting the adaptive coordination behavior of B towards AgI ions. The optimized geometries in the gas phase of 1&#8211;4 are determined by DFT calculations to support the bonding situation observed in their solid&#8208;state structures.

         <title>Radicals and Anions of Siloles and Germoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Persistent silolyl and germolyl radicals were synthesized by reduction of sterically congested halide precursors. The radicals are pyramidalized and show only little spin delocalization.







Abstract
The synthesis of persistent sila&#8208; and germacyclopentadienyl (silolyl&#8208; and germolyl&#8208;) radicals by careful stoichiometric reduction of the corresponding halides with potassium is reported. The radicals were characterized by EPR spectroscopy and trapping reactions. The reduction of tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl&#8208;substituted halides was successful while smaller substituents (i.&#8201;e., t&#8208;Butyl, Ph) gave the corresponding dimers. The EPR spectroscopic parameter of the synthesized tetrolyl radicals indicate only small spin delocalization to the butadiene unit due to cross&#8208;hyperconjugation. Silolyl&#8208; and germolyl anions are unavoidable byproducts and are isolated in the form of their potassium salts and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The comparison of the molecular structures of two closely related potassium silolides provided an example for different coordination of the potassium cation to the silolyl anion (&#951;1 vs. &#951;5 coordination) that triggers the switch between delocalized and localized states.

         <title>Environmentally Friendly, Photochemical Access to [
]AuIII Pincer Complexes By Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first selective general procedure for the rarely investigated [
]AuIII complex class was developed. In a photochemical step, different gold(III) complexes can be easily synthesized, offering a fast entry to highly valued scaffolds for OLEDs, gas&#8208;sensors or anticancer drugs, respectively. Both (DMS)gold chloride complexes or (DMS)gold organometallic compounds can be used as starting materials introducing the gold center (DMS=dimethylsulfide), which further expands the synthetic possibilities.







Abstract
Starting from commercially available DMSAuCl and diazonium salts, cationic [
]AuIII complexes were synthesized in a selective, photosensitizer&#8208;free, photochemical reaction by irradiation with blue LED light. This new protocol represents the first easy synthesis of these types of pincer complexes in moderate to excellent yield starting from a readily available gold(I) precursor with nitrogen as the only by&#8208;product. Owing to the disadvantages of known protocols, especially the toxicity in the case of a transmetalation with mercury or the necessity for a mostly twofold excess of a gold precursor, this method offers an attractive alternative towards this kind of gold(III) complexes. In addition, the first arylated [
]Au(III) pincer complex was synthesized by using this technology.

         <title>Probing the Catalytically Active Species in POM&#8208;Catalysed DNA&#8208;Model Hydrolysis**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic effect of the [Mo7O24]6&#8722; polyoxometalate for the hydrolysis of the phosphoester bond is produced by means of decomposition of [Mo7O24]6&#8722; into [Mo2O8H4], [Mo3O8]2+ and [Mo5O15] species. Since [Mo2O8H4] is neutral after protonation in the acidic pH, its in&#8197;situ generation would explain why highly negatively charged species as polyoxometalates are able to approximate to the negatively charged environment of the phosphoester bond and produce the catalysis.







Abstract
Phosphoester hydrolysis is an important chemical step in DNA repair. One archetypal molecular model of phosphoesters is para&#8208;nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP). It has been shown previously that the presence of molecular metal oxide [Mo7O24]6&#8722; may catalyse the hydrolysis of pNPP through the partial decomposition of polyoxomolybdate framework resulting in a [(PO4)2Mo5O15]6&#8722; product. Real&#8208;time monitoring of the catalytic system using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) provided a glance into the species present in the reaction mixture and identification of potential catalytic candidates. Following up on the obtained spectrometric data, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to characterise the hypothetical intermediate [Mo5O15(pNPP)2(H2O)6]6&#8722; that would be required to form under the hypothesised transformation. Surprisingly, our results point to the dimeric [Mo2O8]4&#8722; anion resulting from the decomposition of [Mo7O24]6&#8722; as the active catalytic species involved in the hydrolysis of pNPP rather than the originally assumed {Mo5O15} species. A similar study was carried out involving the same species but substituting Mo by W. The mechanism involving W species showed a higher barrier and less stable products in agreement with the non&#8208;catalytic effect found in experimental results.

Since [Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] is neutral after protonation in the acidic pH, its in&#8197;situ generation would explain why highly negatively charged species as polyoxometalates are able to approximate to the negatively charged environment of the phosphoester bond and produce the catalysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphoester hydrolysis is an important chemical step in DNA repair. One archetypal molecular model of phosphoesters is para-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP). It has been shown previously that the presence of molecular metal oxide [Mo&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; may catalyse the hydrolysis of pNPP through the partial decomposition of polyoxomolybdate framework resulting in a [(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; product. Real-time monitoring of the catalytic system using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) provided a glance into the species present in the reaction mixture and identification of potential catalytic candidates. Following up on the obtained spectrometric data, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to characterise the hypothetical intermediate [Mo&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;(pNPP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; that would be required to form under the hypothesised transformation. Surprisingly, our results point to the dimeric [Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion resulting from the decomposition of [Mo&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as the active catalytic species involved in the hydrolysis of pNPP rather than the originally assumed {Mo&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;} species. A similar study was carried out involving the same species but substituting Mo by W. The mechanism involving W species showed a higher barrier and less stable products in agreement with the non-catalytic effect found in experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Disaccharides in Water: Preorganized Macrocyclic or Adaptive Acyclic?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adaptive to be selective: Comparison of the binding properties of two structurally related biomimetic receptors toward disaccharides sheds light on the differences between a rigid macrocyclic architecture and a flexible tweezer&#8208;shaped structure showing, counterintuitively, that the adaptive structure can be advantageous in terms of selectivity. NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling calculations were used to provide a 3D description of the receptor&#8208;disaccharide complexes in solution and explaining the origin of the observed selectivity.







Abstract
When facing the dilemma of following a preorganized or adaptive design approach in conceiving the architecture of new biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates, shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic structures were most often chosen to achieve effective recognition of neutral saccharides in water. In contrast, acyclic architectures have seldom been explored, even though potentially simpler and more easily accessible. In this work, comparison of the binding properties of two structurally related diaminocarbazolic receptors, featuring a macrocyclic and an acyclic tweezer&#8208;shaped architecture, highlighted the advantages provided by the acyclic receptor in terms of selectivity in the recognition of 1,4&#8208;disaccharides of biological interest. Selective recognition of GlcNAc2, the core fragment of N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses, stands as an emblematic example. NMR spectroscopic data and molecular modeling calculations were used to ascertain the differences in binding mode and to shed light on the origin of recognition efficacy and selectivity.

         <title>Porous Tungsten Oxide: Recent Advances in Design, Synthesis, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Top hole! This minireview summarizes the design and synthesis challenges of porous WO3 including how the different synthesis methods affect its properties, morphology and application in different fields, such as supercapacitors, catalysts, sensors, and therapeutics. The porous tungsten oxide with thorough porous channels provides abundant active sites for surface reactions.







Abstract
Tungsten oxide (WO3) has received ever more attention and has been highly researched over the last decade due to its being a low&#8208;cost transition metal semiconductor with tunable, yet widely stable, band gaps. This minireview briefly highlights the challenges in the design and synthesis of porous WO3 including methods, precursors, solvent effects, crystal phases, and surface activities of the porous WO3 base material. These topics are explored while also drawing a connection of how the morphology and crystal phase affect the band gap. The shifts in band gap not only impact the optical properties of tungsten but also allow tuning to operate on different energy levels, which makes WO3 highly desirable in many applications such as supercapacitors, batteries, solar cells, catalysts, sensors, smart windows, and bioapplications.

         <title>Confinement inside a Crystalline Sponge Induces Pyrrole To Form N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; Bonded Tetramers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An external driving force from the confined space of a crystalline sponge resulted in a reorientation of the N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction among pyrrole molecules. Such a confinement effect led to the formation of pyrrole dimers and also unprecedented clusters of cyclic tetramers. These results were verified by both single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and computational methods.







Abstract
Based on the DFT&#8208;level&#8208;calculated molecular volume (Vmol) of pyrrole and its liquid density, pyrrole manifests the highest liquid density coefficient LDc (defined as [Vmol&#215;density &#215;0.6023]/FW) value of 0.7. Normal liquids have LDc &lt;0.63. This very high LDc is due to the strong N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in solution, and hence pyrrole can be considered to be a pseudo&#8208;crystalline liquid. When trapped inside the confined space of a crystalline sponge, a reorientation of the N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction is observed leading to specific cyclic N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; tetramers and N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; dimers, as verified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational methods. These tetramers are of the same size as four pyrrole molecules in the solid&#8208;state of pyrrole, yet the cyclic N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; intermolecular interactions are circularly oriented instead of being in the linear zigzag structure found in the X&#8208;ray structure of a solid pyrrole. The confinement thus acts as an external driving force for tetramer formation.

         <title>Multivalent Tryptophan&#8208; and Tyrosine&#8208;Containing [60]Fullerene Hexa&#8208;Adducts as Dual HIV and Enterovirus A71 Entry Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexa&#8208;adducts of [60]fullerene with twelve tryptophan (Trp)/tyrosine (Tyr) residues in their periphery have been synthesized. They are much potent against HIV and equally active against EV71 than the prototype AL&#8208;385, with the same number of Trp moieties but a smaller and flexible pentaerythritol scaffold. This finding showed the relevance of the globular presentation of the peripheral groups for inhibiting viral replication, particularly HIV.







Abstract
Unprecedented 3D hexa&#8208;adducts of [60]fullerene peripherally decorated with twelve tryptophan (Trp) or tyrosine (Tyr) residues have been synthesized. Studies on the antiviral activity of these novel compounds against HIV and EV71 reveal that they are much more potent against HIV and equally active against EV71 than the previously described dendrimer prototypes AL&#8208;385 and AL&#8208;463, which possess the same number of Trp/Tyr residues on the periphery but attached to a smaller and more flexible pentaerythritol core. These results demonstrate the relevance of the globular 3D presentation of the peripheral groups (Trp/Tyr) as well as the length of the spacer connecting them to the central core to interact with the viral envelopes, particularly in the case of HIV, and support the hypothesis that [60]fullerene can be an alternative and attractive biocompatible carbon&#8208;based scaffold for this type of highly symmetrical dendrimers. In addition, the functionalized fullerenes here described, which display twelve peripheral negatively charged indole moieties on their globular surface, define a new and versatile class of compounds with a promising potential in biomedical applications.

         <title>Fundamental Characterization, Photophysics and Photocatalysis of a Base Metal Iron(II)&#8208;Cobalt(III) Dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keeping it simple: A new dyad that is active in photocatalytic proton reduction employing only base metals has been achieved. It connects a tetra&#8208;NHC&#8208;FeII photosensitizer with a CoIII cobaloxime catalyst. The photocatalytic activity is explained by comparison to the equivalent two&#8208;component system and thorough ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state characterization.







Abstract
A new base metal iron&#8208;cobalt dyad has been obtained by connection between a heteroleptic tetra&#8208;NHC iron(II) photosensitizer combining a 2,6&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]pyridine with 2,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand, and a cobaloxime catalyst. This novel iron(II)&#8208;cobalt(III) assembly has been extensively characterized by ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state methods like X&#8208;ray crystallography, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, (spectro&#8208;)electrochemistry, and steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved optical absorption spectroscopy, with a particular focus on the stability of the molecular assembly in solution and determination of the excited&#8208;state landscape. NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy reveal dissociation of the dyad in acetonitrile at concentrations below 1&#8197;mM and high photostability. Transient absorption spectroscopy after excitation into the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer absorption band suggests a relaxation cascade originating from hot singlet and triplet MLCT states, leading to the population of the 3MLCT state that exhibits the longest lifetime. Finally, decay into the ground state involves a 3MC state. Attachment of cobaloxime to the iron photosensitizer increases the 3MLCT lifetime at the iron centre. Together with the directing effect of the linker, this potentially makes the dyad more active in photocatalytic proton reduction experiments than the analogous two&#8208;component system, consisting of the iron photosensitizer and Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl. This work thus sheds new light on the functionality of base metal dyads, which are important for more efficient and sustainable future proton reduction systems.

&lt;p&gt;A new base metal iron-cobalt dyad has been obtained by connection between a heteroleptic tetra-NHC iron(II) photosensitizer combining a 2,6-bis[3-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene]pyridine with 2,6-bis(3-methyl-imidazol-2-ylidene)-4,4&#8242;-bipyridine ligand, and a cobaloxime catalyst. This novel iron(II)-cobalt(III) assembly has been extensively characterized by ground- and excited-state methods like X-ray crystallography, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, (spectro-)electrochemistry, and steady-state and time-resolved optical absorption spectroscopy, with a particular focus on the stability of the molecular assembly in solution and determination of the excited-state landscape.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Transfer Dynamics of Photoacidic Merocyanines in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient absorption studies of protonated pyridine&#8208; and nitro&#8208;merocyanines reveal a pH&#8208;gated photoacidic behaviour. The O&#8208;protic site shows an ultrafast excited state super&#8208;photoacid reactivity at low pH values that is even capable of proton transfer to alcoholic solvents. Remarkably, the pyridine compound exhibits an additional N&#8208;protic site which functions as photoacid generator at pH&#8197;5.5 due to its lowered ground state pKa value after photoisomerization to the ring&#8208;closed spiropyran structure.







Abstract
Photoacids attract increasing scientific attention, as they are valuable tools to spatiotemporally control proton&#8208;release reactions and pH values of solutions. We present the first time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic study of the excited state and proton&#8208;release dynamics of prominent merocyanine representatives. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements of a pyridine merocyanine with two distinct protonation sites revealed dissimilar proton&#8208;release mechanisms: one site acts as a photoacid generator as its pKa value is modulated in the ground state after photoisomerization, while the other functions as an excited state photoacid which releases its proton within 1.1&#8197;ps. With a pKa drop of 8.7&#8197;units to &#8722;5.5 upon excitation, the latter phenolic site is regarded a super&#8208;photoacid. The 6&#8208;nitro derivative exhibits only a phenolic site with similar, yet slightly less photoacidic characteristics and both compounds transfer their proton to methanol and ethanol. In contrast, for the related 6,8&#8208;dinitro compound an intramolecular proton transfer to the ortho&#8208;nitro group is suggested that is involved in a rapid relaxation into the ground state.

         <title>In Situ Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies of the Mechanochemical Synthesis of ZnS from its Elements.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemistry, as a synthesis tool for inorganic materials, became an ever&#8208;growing field in material chemistry. The direct energy transfer by collision of the educts with the milling media gives the possibility to design environmental&#8208;friendly reactions. Nevertheless, the underlying process of energy transfer and hence the kinetics of mechanosynthesis remain unclear. Herein, we present  in situ  synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies coupled with pressure measurements performed during the formation of ZnS and the subsequent phase transition (PT) from the hexagonal to the cubic modification. Milling Zn and S  8  results in the sublimation of S  8  , observed by a sudden pressure increase. Simultaneously, the hexagonal metastable ZnS&#8208;modification (wurtzite) forms. Via detection of the pressure maximum, the exact start of the wurtzite formation can be determined. Immediately after the formation of wurtzite, the structural PT to the thermodynamic stable cubic modification sphalerite takes place. This PT can be described by the Prout&#8208;Tompkins equation for autocatalytic reactions, similar to thermally induced PT in sulfur vapor at high temperatures (T&gt;1133 K). The increase in the reactivity of the wurtzite formation is explained by the reaction in sulfur vapor and the induction of defect structures by the collisions with the milling media.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore is a versatile platform for the construction of photoresponsive dyes with unique properties. Specifically, its covalent connection to a photocleavable group can be exploited to engineer compounds with photoswitchable fluorescence. The resulting photoactivatable fluorophores can increase their emission intensity or shift their emission wavelengths in response to switching. Such changes permit the spatiotemporal control of fluorescence with optical stimulations and the implementation of imaging strategies that would be impossible to replicate with conventional fluorophores. Indeed, BODIPYs with photoactivatable fluorescence enable the selective highlighting of intracellular targets, the nanoscaled visualization of sub&#8208;cellular components, the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic events and the photochemical writing of optical barcodes.</dc:description>

         <title>PorphyStruct &#8211; A Digital Tool for the Quantitative Assignment of Non&#8208;Planar Distortion Modes in Four&#8208;Membered Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PorphyStruct  , a new digital tool for the analysis of non&#8208;planar distortion modes of different porphyrinoids, and its application to corrole structures is reported. The program makes use of the normal&#8208;coordinate structure decomposition technique (NSD) and employs sets of normal modes equivalent to those established for porphyrins in order to describe the  out&#8208;of&#8208;plane  dislocation pattern of perimeter atoms from corroles, norcorroles, porphycenes and other porphyrinoids quantitatively and in analogy to the established terminology. A comparative study of 17 porphyrin structures shows very similar results to the original NSD analysis and no systematic error. Application to corroles is successful and reveals the necessity to implement an extended basis of normal modes for a large share of experimental structures. The results frequently show the concomitant occurence of several modes but remain interpretable. For group XI metal corroles the phenomenon of supersaddling was unravelled, allowing for more in&#8208;depths discussions of structure&#8208;function correlations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While alkyl substituted siloxanes are widely known, virtually nothing is known about perfluoroalkyl siloxanes and their congener species, the silanols and silanolates.

         <title>Through Bridge Spin Coupling in Homo&#8208; and Hetero&#8208;bimetallic Porphyrin Dimers upon Stepwise Oxidations: A Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have described Cu(II)&#8208;Fe(III) and Cu(II)&#8208;Mn(III) heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers and compared with their homo&#8208;bimetallic analogs. UV&#8208;visible spectra are very distinct while electrochemical studies demonstrate that these species, as compared to the homobimetallic analog, are much easier to oxidize. Combined M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, NMR, magnetic, UV&#8208;vis and DFT studies show only ring&#8208;centered oxidation after 2e&#8208;oxidations. The HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps are linearly dependent with the low&#8208;energy NIR band of 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes. Strong electronic communication between two rings through the bridge facilitates coupling between various unpaired spins while the coupling model depends on the nature of metal ions used. Unpaired spins of Fe(III) and porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical are strongly anti&#8208;ferromagnetically coupled, while such coupling is rather weak between Mn(III) and porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical. Moreover, the coupling between two &#960;&#8208;cation radicals are much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes of Mn2(III) and Cu(II)&#8208;Mn(III) complexes as compared to their Fe2(III) and Cu(II)&#8208;Fe(III) analogs. Furthermore, coupling between the unpaired spins of &#960;&#8208;cation radical and Cu(II) ion is much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complex of Cu(II)&#8208;Fe(III) complex as compared to its Cu(II)&#8208;Mn(III) analog. The Mulliken spin density distributions in 2e&#8208;oxidized homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;bimetallic complexes show symmetric and asymmetric spread between the two macrocycles, respectively, however, the Cu(II) center acts as a charge donor in the heterobimetallic complexes while Fe(III)/Mn(III) center as a charge acceptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Triangular Rhodamine Triads and Their Intrinsic Photophysics Revealed from Gas&#8208;phase Ion Fluorescence Experiments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When ionic dyes are close together, the internal Coulomb interaction may affect their photophysics and the energy&#8208;transfer efficiency. To explore this, we have prepared triangular architectures of three rhodamines connected to a central triethynylbenzene unit (1,3,5&#8208;tris(buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene) based on acetylenic coupling reactions and measured fluorescence spectra of the isolated, triply charged ions  in vacuo  . We find from comparisons with previously reported monomer and dimer spectra that while polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system causes redshifted emission, the separation between the rhodamines is too large for a Stark shift. This picture is supported by electrostatic calculations on model systems composed of three linear and polarizable ionic dyes in  D  3h  configuration: The electric field that each dye experiences from the other two is too small to induce a dipole moment, both in the ground and the excited state. In the case of heterotrimers that contain either two rhodamine 575 (R575) and one R640 or one R575 and two R640, emission is almost purely from R640 although the polarization of the &#960;&#8208;system expectedly diminishes the dipole&#8208;dipole interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes with Di&#8208;Tertiary&#8208;Butyl Sulfide as Precursors with Ultra&#8208;Low Decomposition Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here synthesis of [Cu2(TFA)4(t  Bu2S)2] (1), [Ag4(TFA)4(t  Bu2S)4] (2) and [AuCl(t  Bu2S)] (3) (TFA = trifluoroacetate), which decompose in solution medium at ultra&#8208;low temperature (e.g., in boiling toluene) to afford phase&#8208;pure and highly crystalline Cu9S5  , Ag2S and metallic Au nanoparticles, respectively. The low decomposition temperature of these precursors is attributed to the facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand. These results are a significant step in the direction of establishing a general low&#8208;temperature strategy spanning a range of systems including thermodynamically metastable materials and incorporate them in technologies that are sensitive to the harsh conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional (3D) (Di)azatricyclododecene Scaffold and its Application to Peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel sp  3  carbon&#8208;rich tricyclic 3D scaffold&#8208;based peptide mimetic compound library was constructed to target protein&#8208;protein interactions. T ricyclic framework  6  was synthesized from 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3,3,1]nonan&#8208;3&#8208;one  9  via a gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed Conia&#8208;ene reaction. The electron&#8208;donating group on the pendant alkyne of cyclization precursor  11b&#8208;e  was the key to forming 6&#8208;  endo  &#8208;  dig  cyclized product  6  with complete regioselectivity. Using the synthetic strategy for regioselective construction of bridged tricyclic framework  6  , a diazatricyclododecene 3D&#8208;scaffold  7a  , which enables the introduction of substituents into the scaffold to mimic amino acid side chains, was designed and synthesized. The peptide mimetics  20a&#8208;h  were synthesized via step&#8208;by&#8208;step installation of three substituents on diazatricyclododecene scaffold  7a  . C o mpounds  20a&#8208;h  were synthesized as &#945;&#8208;helix peptide mimics of hydrophobic ZZxxZ and ZxxZZ sequences (Z = Leu or Phe) and subjected to cell&#8208;based assays: antiproliferative activity, HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity which is considered to affect cancer malignancy , and antiviral activity against rabies virus. Compound  20a  showed the strongest inhibitory activity of HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity (IC  50  = 4.1 &#177; 0.8 &#956;M), whereas compounds  20a&#8208;g  showed antiviral activity with IC  50  values of 4.2&#8208;12.4 &#956;M, suggesting that the 3D&#8208;scaffold  7a  has potential as a versatile peptide mimic skeleton.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Regulation of Catalytic Activity for an Amphiphilic Pyrene&#8208;Ruthenium Complex in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A switchable catalytic system is designed and constructed with host&#8208;guest interactions between cucurbituril (CB) and an amphiphilic metal complex Pyrene&#8208;Ruthenium (Py&#8208;Ru). Py&#8208;Ru can self&#8208;assemble into positively charged nanoparticles in water, and exhibit an enhanced catalytic efficiency in the transfer hydrogenation of NAD  +  to NADH. After forming inclusion complex with CB, Py&#8208;Ru aggregates are broke, leading to a decrease of catalytic efficiency, which can be recovered via competitive replacement of amantadine (AD). This supramolecular strategy provides an efficient and flexible method for constructing reversible catalytic system, which also extends the application scope of the host&#8208;guest interaction.</dc:description>

NHPI engaged MOFs: Two UiO metal&#8208;organic frameworks covalently merged with N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide organocatalytic sites have been synthesized. Comprehensive studies on the MOF characteristics and optimal reaction condition and mechanism, show an unprecedented three&#8208;phase heterogeneous system has been established for catalytic oxidation of a wide scope of primary and secondary alcohols, and benzyl compounds. The catalytic oxidation manifests high efficiency, excellent selectivity, requires mild conditions, and is environmentally friendly with molecular O2 as terminal oxidant.







Abstract
Two highly efficient metal&#8208;organic framework catalysts TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NHPI and TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NDHPI have been successfully synthesized through solvothermal reactions of which the frameworks are merged with N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) units, resulting in the decoration of pore surfaces with highly active nitroxyl catalytic sites. When t&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN) is used as co&#8208;catalyst, the as&#8208;synthesized MOFs are demonstrated to be highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for a novel three&#8208;phase heterogeneous oxidation of activated C&#8722;H bond of primary and secondary alcohols, and benzyl compounds under mild conditions. Based on the high efficiency and selectivity, an environmentally benign system with good sustainability, mild conditions, simple work&#8208;up procedure has been established for practical oxidation of a wide range of substrates.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Organic Polysulfides from Disulfides by Sulfur Insertion from S8 and an Unexpected Solvent Effect on the Product Distribution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrifying Sulfur! The electrolysis of organic disulfides in dichloromethane led to the formation of organic polysulfides with a high incorporation of additional sulfur atoms. HPLC/HRMS analysis of the reaction mixture could identify products up to undecasulfides. When CS2 was used as co&#8208;solvent the distribution of the organic polysulfide mixture was altered in favor of the lower polysulfides, such as tri&#8208; and tetrasulfides.







Abstract
An electrochemical synthesis of organic polysulfides through sulfur insertion from elemental sulfur to disulfides or thiols is introduced. The highly economic, low&#8208;sensitive and low&#8208;priced reaction gives a mixture of polysulfides, whose distribution can be influenced by the addition of different amounts of carbon disulfide as co&#8208;solvent. To describe the variable distribution function of the polysulfides, a novel parameter, the &#8220;absorbance average sulfur amount in polysulfides&#8221; (SAP) was introduced and defined on the basis of the &#8220;number average molar mass&#8221; used in polymer chemistry. Various organic polysulfides were synthesized with variable volume fractions of carbon disulfide, and the yield of each polysulfide was determined by quantitative 13C NMR. Moreover, by using two symmetrical disulfides or a disulfide and a thiol as starting materials, a mixture of symmetrical and asymmetrical polysulfides could be obtained.

         <title>E4 Transfer (E=P, As) to Ni Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accessing the inaccessible: The use of the polypnictogen zirconium complexes [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E=P, As) at ambient temperatures as phosphorus or arsenic sources to transfer E4&#8197;units to CpRNi fragments was examined. This avoids the difficulty of handling and toxicity of white phosphorus and yellow arsenic. The transfer reactions gave access to a variety of polypnictogen transition metal complexes, among them unprecedented triple&#8208;decker&#8208;like compounds composed of cage entities as end&#8208;decks.







Abstract
The use of [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (1&#8201;a), As (1&#8201;b), Cp&#8242;&#8242;=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) as phosphorus or arsenic source, respectively, gives access to novel stable polypnictogen transition metal complexes at ambient temperatures. The reaction of 1&#8201;a/1&#8201;b with [CpRNiBr]2 (CpR=CpBn (1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentabenzyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl), Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242; (1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)) was studied, to yield novel complexes depending on steric effects and stoichiometric ratios. Besides the transfer of the complete En unit, a degradation as well as aggregation can be observed. Thus, the prismane derivatives [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3:3&#8208;E4)] (2&#8201;a (E=P); 2&#8201;b (E=As)) or the arsenic containing cubane [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni)3(&#956;3&#8208;As)(As4)] (5) are formed. Furthermore, the bromine bridged cubanes of the type [(CpRNi)3{Ni(&#956;&#8208;Br)}(&#956;3&#8208;E)4]2 (CpR=Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;: 6&#8201;a (E=P), 6&#8201;b (E=As), CpR=CpBn: 8&#8201;a (E=P), 8&#8201;b (E=As)) can be isolated. Here, a stepwise transfer of En units is possible, with a cyclo&#8208;E42&#8722; ligand being introduced and unprecedented triple&#8208;decker compounds of the type [{(CpRNi)3Ni(&#956;3&#8208;E)4}2(&#956;,&#951;4:4&#8208;E&#8242;4)] (CpR=CpBn, Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;; E/E&#8242;=P, As) are obtained.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Phosphorescence Quenching in Iminophosphonamide Copper and Zinc Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To glow or not to glow: Chiral iminophosphonamide copper and zinc complexes are presented. Some steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (PL) features studied at low temperatures can be described within the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) scheme. However, unusually, the fluorescence is nearly absent in two complexes and the low&#8208;lying triplet state quenches PL. Some excited states were further investigated by time&#8208;resolved FTIR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of copper and zinc complexes of four variably substituted iminophosphonamide ligands is presented. While the copper complexes form ligand&#8208;bridged dimers, the zinc compounds are monomeric. Due to different steric demand of the ligand the arrangement of the ligands within the dimeric complexes varies. Similar to the structurally related iminophosphonamide complexes of alkali metals and calcium, the steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (PL) of four of the seven compounds studied here as solids in a temperature range of 5&#8211;295&#8197;K can be described within the scheme of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Accordingly, they exhibit bright blue&#8208;green phosphorescence at low temperatures (&lt;100&#8197;K), which turns into delayed fluorescence by increasing the temperature. However, unusually, the fluorescence is practically absent in two copper complexes which otherwise still conform to the TADF scheme. In these cases, the excited singlet states decay essentially non&#8208;radiatively and their thermal population from the corresponding low&#8208;lying triplet states efficiently quenches PL (phosphorescence). Three other copper and zinc complexes only exhibit prompt fluorescence, evidencing a wide variation of photophysical properties in this class of compounds. The excited states of the copper complex with especially pronounced phosphorescence quenching were also investigated by low&#8208;temperature time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of spongy bone, we synthesized 3D sponge&#8208;like porous carbons (SPCs) from CO2 in a home&#8208;made electrolytic cell equipped with low&#8208;temperature molten carbonate electrolyte. SPC4&#8208;0.5 shows excellent electrochemical capacitance performance due to its large&#8208;area meso&#8208;microporous structure, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity. Our research presents a simple, eco&#8208;friendly and low&#8208;cost way towards production of functional carbon materials.







Abstract
Inspired by the spongy bone structures, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sponge&#8208;like carbons with meso&#8208;microporous structures are synthesized through one&#8208;step electro&#8208;reduction of CO2 in molten carbonate Li2CO3&#8722;Na2CO3&#8722;K2CO3 at 580&#8201;&#176;C. SPC4&#8208;0.5 (spongy porous carbon obtained by electrolysis of CO2 at 4&#8197;A for 0.5&#8197;h) is synthesized with the current efficiency of 96.9&#8201;%. SPC4&#8208;0.5 possesses large electrolyte ion accessible surface area, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity, ensuring the fast and effective mass and charge transfer, which make it an advcanced supercapacitor electrode material. SPC4&#8208;0.5 exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 373.7&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, excellent cycling stability (retaining 95.9&#8201;% of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), as well as high energy density. The applications of SPC4&#8208;0.5 in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state flexible devices for energy storage and wearable piezoelectric sensor are investigated. Both devices show considerable capacitive performances. This work not only presents a controllable and facile synthetic route for the porous carbons but also provides a promising way for effective carbon reduction and green energy production.

         <title>Modulation of Src Kinase Activity by Selective Substrate Recognition with Pseudopeptidic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to spare Tyr: The selective recognition of tyrosine residues by pseudopeptidic cages protects the substrates from Src kinase&#8208;promoted phosphorylation. The Tyr kinase&#8208;inhibiting activity of the cages can be satisfactorily explained by the formation of host&#8208;guest complexes. This supramolecular approach represents an appealing alternative to modulating Tyr kinase activity by substrate recognition.







Abstract
The selective recognition of tyrosine residues in peptides is an appealing approach to inhibiting their tyrosine kinase (TK)&#8208;mediated phosphorylation. Herein, we describe pseudopeptidic cages that efficiently protect substrates from the action of the Src TK enzyme, precluding the corresponding Tyr phosphorylation. Fluorescence emission titrations show that the most efficient cage inhibitors strongly bind the peptide substrates with a very good correlation between the binding constant and the inhibitory potency. Structural insights and additional control experiments further support the proposed mechanism of selective supramolecular protection of the substrates. Moreover, the approach also works in a completely different kinase&#8208;substrate system. These results illustrate the potential of supramolecular complexes for the efficient and selective modulation of TK signaling.

         <title>Charge Transfer Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Containing Redox&#8208;Active TTF/NDI Units for Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heat is on: A charge&#8208;transfer MOF based on redox&#8208;active TTF/NDI units has been prepared and structurally characterized. Due to the efficient charge&#8208;transfer absorption in the NIR region, the MOF shows excellent photothermal conversion performance. Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS composite films have been studied and could be new candidates for stable and processable materials in photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of new inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid crystal materials, could have important applications in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion. Herein, a new charge&#8208;transfer MOF (Co&#8208;MOF) with mixed ligands of H4TTFTB and bpmNDI incorporating redox&#8208;active tetrathiafulvalene/naphthalene diimide (TTF/NDI) units into one system is reported. Due to the presence of TTF/NDI oxidative and reductive couples, stable radicals can be observed in the MOF. In addition, charge transfer from the electron donor (TTF) to the acceptor (NDI) results in a broad absorption in the NIR region. The Co&#8208;MOF exhibited an efficient photothermal effect induced by irradiation with a NIR laser. Under the 808&#8197;nm laser (0.7&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) illumination, the temperature of the Co&#8208;MOF increased from room temperature to 201&#8201;&#176;C in only 10&#8197;s. Furthermore, a series of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films doped with trace amounts of Co&#8208;MOF showed efficient NIR photothermal conversion. When a Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS (0.6&#8197;wt&#8201;%) film is irradiated by 808&#8197;nm laser with power of 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, it&#8242;s temperature can reach a plateau at 62&#8201;&#176;C from 20&#8201;&#176;C within 100&#8197;s. Our experimental results from the Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS film demonstrate that the effectiveness and feasibility of the material is promising for photothermal applications.

         <title>Synergistic DNA&#8208; and Protein&#8208;Based Recognition Promote an RNA&#8208;Templated Bio&#8208;orthogonal Reaction</title>

DNA, Protein, RNA: The structure&#8208;based design of biomolecular conjugates composed of protein and DNA fragments that synergistically bind RNA via Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing and peptide&#8208;mediated major groove recognition is reported. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics were designed whereby two conjugates can simultaneously assemble on a single RNA scaffold. Through ternary complex formation, the peptide elements of each conjugate are drawn into close proximity, and this feature was exploited to enable an RNA&#8208;templated, double click reaction.







Abstract
Biomolecular assemblies composed of proteins and oligonucleotides play a central role in biological processes. While in nature, oligonucleotides and proteins usually assemble via non&#8208;covalent interactions, synthetic conjugates have been developed which covalently link both modalities. The resulting peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates have facilitated novel biological applications as well as the design of functional supramolecular systems and materials. However, despite the importance of concerted protein/oligonucleotide recognition in nature, conjugation approaches have barely utilized the synergistic recognition abilities of such complexes. Herein, the structure&#8208;based design of peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates that bind RNA through Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing combined with peptide&#8208;mediated major groove recognition is reported. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics have been designed to adjacently bind a particular RNA sequence. In the resulting ternary complex, their peptide elements are located in proximity, a feature that was used to enable an RNA&#8208;templated click reaction. The introduced structure&#8208;based design approach opens the door to novel functional biomolecular assemblies.

         <title>Applying Unconventional Spectroscopies to the Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets, Co(PPh3)2X2 (X=Cl, Br, I): Unveiling Magnetic Transitions and Spin&#8208;Phonon Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct determination of magnetic excited levels and spin&#8208;phonon couplings in the compounds in three SMMs, leading to magnetic relaxation, has been achieved by the combined use of inelastic neutron scattering (INS), far&#8208;IR magnetic spectroscopy (FIRMS), high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR, frequency&#8208;domain FT terahertz EPR, ligand&#8208;field theory (LFT) analysis, and DFT calculations of phonons (i.&#8201;e., both molecular and lattice vibrations). Calculated spin densities on Co(II) ions correlate with magnetic separations in the compounds.







Abstract
Large separation of magnetic levels and slow relaxation in metal complexes are desirable properties of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Spin&#8208;phonon coupling (interactions of magnetic levels with phonons) is ubiquitous, leading to magnetic relaxation and loss of memory in SMMs and quantum coherence in qubits. Direct observation of magnetic transitions and spin&#8208;phonon coupling in molecules is challenging. We have found that far&#8208;IR magnetic spectra (FIRMS) of Co(PPh3)2X2 (Co&#8208;X; X=Cl, Br, I) reveal rarely observed spin&#8208;phonon coupling as avoided crossings between magnetic and u&#8208;symmetry phonon transitions. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) gives phonon spectra. Calculations using VASP and phonopy programs gave phonon symmetries and movies. Magnetic transitions among zero&#8208;field split (ZFS) levels of the S=3/2 electronic ground state were probed by INS, high&#8208;frequency and &#8208;field EPR (HFEPR), FIRMS, and frequency&#8208;domain FT terahertz EPR (FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR), giving magnetic excitation spectra and determining ZFS parameters (D, E) and g values. Ligand&#8208;field theory (LFT) was used to analyze earlier electronic absorption spectra and give calculated ZFS parameters matching those from the experiments. DFT calculations also gave spin densities in Co&#8208;X, showing that the larger Co(II) spin density in a molecule, the larger its ZFS magnitude. The current work reveals dynamics of magnetic and phonon excitations in SMMs. Studies of such couplings in the future would help to understand how spin&#8208;phonon coupling may lead to magnetic relaxation and develop guidance to control such coupling.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct determination&lt;/b&gt; of magnetic excited levels and spin-phonon couplings in the compounds in three SMMs, leading to magnetic relaxation, has been achieved by the combined use of inelastic neutron scattering (INS), far-IR magnetic spectroscopy (FIRMS), high-frequency and -field EPR, frequency-domain FT terahertz EPR, ligand-field theory (LFT) analysis, and DFT calculations of phonons (i.&#8201;e., both molecular and lattice vibrations). Calculated spin densities on Co(II) ions correlate with magnetic separations in the compounds.

         <title>Alkali&#8208;induced Transformation of Ni&#8208;MOF into Ni(OH)2 Nanostructured Flowers for Efficient Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple ex situ wet chemical transformation method of alkali treatment was proposed to prepare Ni(OH)2 nanostructured flowers with large specific surface areas from Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74. The relationship between concentration of alkali and the structure properties of corresponding Ni(OH)2 was uncovered. As the results, the catalyst of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25 performed remarkably catalytic properties with lower potential, higher current density and excellent durability towards MOR among various samples.







Abstract
Post treatment of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is widely employed to develop efficient electrocatalysts with better catalytic properties. But the complex processes of post treatment generally led to the collapse of the original structures of MOFs, making the preservation of their pristine hierarchical porous structure a great challenge. Herein, we propose the strategy of alkali treatment of Ni&#8208;MOF to transform it into Ni(OH)2 with similar morphology and enhanced electrocatalytic properties for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The structure and electrocatalytic properties of as&#8208;obtained Ni(OH)2 nanostructured flowers were seriously depended on the alkali concentrations. As the result, Ni(OH)2 obtained from Ni&#8208;MOF treated by 0.25&#8197;M NaOH (noted as Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25) performs 1.5 and 2.5 times larger current density than those of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.025 and Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.5 for MOR. Moreover, the electrocatalytic process and mechanism of MOR on the catalyst of Ni(OH)2&#8208;0.25 are also revealed. Hence, this ex situ conversion strategy of alkali treatment for Ni&#8208;MOF uncovered the transformation of MOFs in alkaline solution and develops robust electrocatalyst for practical application of methanol fuel cells.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 11C&#8208;Labelled Primary Benzamides via Intermediate [11C]Aroyl Dimethylaminopyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and efficient method for radiolabeling of primary amides with the positron emitting radionuclide carbon&#8208;11 was developed. The method relies on intermediate electrophilic 11C&#8208;labelled aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium salts, prepared via carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with [11C]carbon monoxide.







Abstract
Electrophilic 11C&#8208;labelled aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium salts, obtained by carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with [11C]carbon monoxide, were prepared for the first time and shown to be valuable intermediates in the synthesis of primary [11C]benzamides. The methodology furnished a set of benzamide model compounds, including the two poly (ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors niraparib and veliparib, in moderate to excellent radiochemical yields. In addition to providing a convenient and practical route to primary [11C]benzamides, the current method paves the way for future application of [11C]aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium halide salts in positron emission tomography (PET) tracer synthesis.

         <title>Monitoring the Structure Evolution of Titanium Oxide Photocatalysts: From the Molecular Form via the Amorphous State to the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amorphous TixOy  with high surface area has attracted significant interest as photocatalyst with higher activity in ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced water splitting applications compared to commercial nanocrystalline TiO2. Under photocatalytic operation conditions, the structure of the molecular titanium alkoxide precursor rearranges upon hydrolysis and leads to higher connectivity of the structure&#8208;building units. Structurally ordered domains with sizes smaller than 7 &#197; form larger aggregates. The experimental scattering data can be explained best with a structure model consisting of an anatase&#8208;like core and a distorted shell. Upon exposure with UV light, the white TixOy  suspension turns dark corresponding to the reduction of Ti  4+  to Ti  3+  as confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Heat&#8208;induced crystallisation was followed by  in situ  temperature&#8208;dependent total scattering experiments. First, ordering in the Ti&#8208;O environment takes place upon to 350 &#176;C. Above this temperature, the distorted anatase core starts to grow but the structure obtained at 400 &#176;C is still not fully ordered.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Gold Chemistry: From Simple Salts to Complexes for Regioselective C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The focusof this review is to highlight the advances in catalysis by gold complexes and salts on C&#8722;H bond activation chemistry. In particular, it covers the gold&#8208;catalyzed regioselective as well as site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization with emphasis on structural features, mechanisms and contributing factors of the relevant reactions. Depending on the nature of substrate, this review was categorized into six sections along with discussing applications in natural product synthesis.







Abstract
Gold coordinated to neutral phosphines (R3P), N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) or anionic ligands is catalytically active in functionalizing various C&#8722;H bonds with high selectivity. The sterics/electronic nature of the studied C&#8722;H bond, oxidation state of gold and stereoelectronic capacity of the coordinated auxiliary ligand are some of the associated selectivity factors in gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond functionalization reactions. Hence, in this review a comprehensive update about the action of different types of gold catalysts, from simple to sophisticated ones, on C&#8722;H bond reactions and their regiochemical outcome is disclosed. This review also highlights the catalytic applications of Au(I)&#8208; and Au(III)&#8208;species in creating new opportunities for the regio&#8208; and site&#8208;selective activation of challenging C&#8722;H bonds. Finally, it also intends to stress the potential applications in selective C&#8722;H bond activation associated with a variety of heterocycles recently described in the literature.

         <title>Rediscovering Sulfinylamines as Reagents for Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent applications of N&#8208;sulfinylamines: In this Minireview, the use of N&#8208;sulfinylamines (R&#8722;N=S=O) in sulfoximine and sulfonimidamide synthesis, heterocycle formation and catalytic enantioselective oxidation of alkenes is covered. Brief discussions of their preparation, stability, properties and potential future applications are also included.







Abstract
Sulfinylamines (R&#8722;N=S=O), monoaza analogues of sulfur dioxide, have been known for well over a century, and their reactivity as sulfur electrophiles and in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions is well&#8208;established. However, they have only rarely been used in organic synthesis in recent decades despite the increasing prominence of compounds containing N=S=O functionality, such as sulfoximines and sulfonimidamides. This Minireview aims to bring wider visibility to the unique chemistry enabled by this class of compounds. We focus on advances from the last 10 years, including the first examples of their use in the one&#8208;pot syntheses of sulfoximines and sulfonimidamides. Also covered are the reactions of sulfinylamines with carbon&#8208;centred radicals, their use for formation of heterocycles through cycloadditions, and catalytic enantioselective allylic oxidation of alkenes via a hetero&#8208;ene reaction. These examples highlight the different reactivity modes of sulfinylamines and their underappreciated potential for forming molecules which contain high&#8208; or low&#8208;valent sulfur, or even no sulfur at all.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Mediated Stoichiometric Synthesis of Mono&#8208;, Bi&#8208;, and Bis&#8208;1,2&#8208;Azaborinines: 1&#8208;Rhoda&#8208;3,2&#8208;azaboroles as Reactive Precursors</title>

         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;nitrogen analogs of metallacyclopentadienes in the form of 1&#8208;rhoda&#8208;3,2&#8208;azaboroles (see Figure) are shown to be suitable precursors for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines. Comparisons with 1,2&#8208;azaborete rhodium complexes demonstrate their superior reactivity towards alkynes, allowing to expand the range of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines. A series of multiply substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines, including a phenylene&#8208;bridged derivative and rare bicyclic derivatives composed of two 1,2&#8208;azaborinine rings linked by a single bond, are reported.







Abstract
A series of highly substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines, including a phenylene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine, was synthesized from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;azaborete rhodium complexes with variously substituted alkynes. 1&#8208;Rhoda&#8208;3,2&#8208;azaborole complexes, which are accessible by phosphine addition to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;azaborete complexes, were also found to be suitable precursors for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines and readily reacted with alkynyl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines to generate new regioisomers of bi&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinines, which feature directly connected aromatic rings. Their molecular structures, which can be viewed as boron&#8208;nitrogen isosteres of biphenyls, show nearly perpendicular 1,2&#8208;azaborinine rings. The new method using rhodacycles instead of 1,2&#8208;azaborete complexes as precursors is shown to be more effective, allowing the synthesis of a wider range of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines.

         <title>Structure Elucidation and Spectroscopic Analysis of Chromophores Produced by Oxidative Psilocin Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Psilocin (  1  ) is the dephosphorylated and psychotropic metabolite of the mushroom natural product psilocybin (  2  ). Oxidation of the phenolic hydroxy group at the C&#8208;4 position of  1  results in formation of oligomeric indoloquinoid chromophores responsible for the iconic blueing of bruised  2  &#8208;producing mushrooms. Based on previous NMR experiments, the hypothesis included that the 5,5&#8217;&#8208; coupled quinone dimer of  1  was the primary product responsible for the blue color. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized ring&#8208;methylated  1  derivatives to provide stable analogs of  1  dimers able to be completely characterized. The chemically oxidized derivatives were spectroscopically analyzed and compared to computationally&#8208;derived absorbance spectra. Experimental evidence did not support the original hypothesis. Rather, the blue color was shown to stem from the quinoid 7,7&#8217;&#8208;coupled dimer of  1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Immolative Linkers for Tunable Double Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative (SI) linkers offer a wide range of applications, such as smart materials and drug delivery systems. Phosphorus SI linkers are ideal candidates for double cargo delivery platforms because they have a higher valency than carbon. Accordingly, we designed a series of substituted phosphate linkers for releasing two phenolic cargos through SI followed by chemical hydrolysis. Suitable modifications of the lactate spacer increased the cargo release rate significantly, from 1 day to 2 hours or 5 minutes, as shown for linkers containing  p  &#8208;fluoro phenol. In turn, double cargo linkers bearing  p  &#8208;methyl phenol released their cargo more slowly (4 days, 4 hours, and 15 minutes, respectively) than their  p  &#8208;fluoro analogues. The  &#945;  &#8208;hydroxyisobutyrate linker released both cargos in 25 minutes. Our study expands the current portfolio of SI constructs by providing a double cargo delivery option, which is crucial to develop universal SI platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Resolved Live Cell Membrane Tracking through&#160;Photo&#8208;click Reactions Enriched in Lipid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of photo&#8208;switchable monopeptides derived from  cis  &#8208;&#946;&#8208;dibenzodiazocine&#8208;  l  &#8208;alanine (  cis  &#8208;DBDAA) have been designed and synthesized, which are capable of photo&#8208;click reacting with diaryltetrazoles or diarylsydnones in a hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer environment. The DBDAA monopeptides include both a hydrophobic tail on  C  &#8208;terminal, providing high affinity toward lipid membrane, and a modularized functional moiety on N&#8208;terminal, enabling rapid optimization of the self&#8208;assembly strength to form multifunctional supramolecules. With the  cis  &#8208;DBDAA monopeptides photo&#8208;switched into  trans  &#8208;configuration, we were able to disrupt the supramolecular assembly through an efficient photo&#8208;click reaction across the lipid bilayer of liposomes. We reveal that the performance of the photo&#8208;click reactions between the monopeptides and photo&#8208;generated nitrile imine intermediates is significantly enhanced by enrichment of both reactants in the hydrophobic membrane lamel of liposomes. Enrichment of the DBDAA monopeptide in lipid phase serves as a convenient method to introduce bioorthogonal chemical handles on live cell membranes, which enables fluorescence labelling of single cell's membrane with high spatiotemporal resolution to facilitate the studies on cell membrane dynamics.</dc:description>

         <title>Taking advantage of ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution to design nine&#8208;membered P,O,Si&#8208;heterocycles</title>

         <dc:description>A family of cyclic phosphine&#8208;disiloxane featuring peri&#8208;substituted naphthyl(Nap)/acenaphthyl(Ace) scaffolds have been prepared and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray structure, which enables a detailed structural analysis. This straightforward synthesis takes advantage of both ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution of Nap/Ace&#8208;substituted phosphine oxides. The synthetic method allows diversifying the polycyclic aromatic platform (Nap and Ace) as well as the Si substituents (Me and Ph). Despite a strong steric congestion, the P&#8208;atom remains reactive toward oxidation or coordination. In particular, Au(I) complex could be prepared. All the compounds display absorption/luminescence in the UV&#8208;Vis range. Surprisingly, the P&#8208;trivalent derivatives display unexpected luminescence in the green in solid&#8208;state.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Binding Dynamics in High&#8208;Affinity Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Dithienylethene Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic studies on host&#8208;guest systems based on cucurbit[8]uril and dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches shows that the more tightly bound closed DTE isomers are kinetically more stable that their open counterparts. This allows for the modulation of their binding dynamics with light stimulus constituting an attractive tool for the development of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium supramolecular systems.







Abstract
The use of external stimuli to control the binding kinetics in supramolecular systems is of critical importance for the development of advanced molecular machines and devices. In this work, a study focused on the kinetics of a water&#8208;soluble host&#8208;guest system based on cucurbit[8]uril and two dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches is reported. It is shown that for the DTE guest comprising two anionic sulfonate side arms appended to pyridinium moieties, the formation/dissociation of the pseudorotaxane structures is slowed down by more than 100000&#8208;fold with respect to its bipyridinium analogue. The decrease in ingression rate leads to the emergence of a competitive metastable product with the open DTE isomer that has an important influence in the overall binding kinetics. Moreover, the host&#8208;guest dissociation kinetics is demonstrated to be approximately 100&#8208;fold slower for the closed DTE isomer (t1/2=107&#8197;h vs. t1/2=1.2&#8197;h for the open isomer) allowing control over the dissociation rate with light.

         <title>Spotlight on the Effect of Electrolyte Composition on the Potential of Maximum Entropy. Supporting Electrolytes are not Always Inert</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the influence of the electrolyte pH, presence of alkali metal cations (Na+, K+), and O2 on the interfacial water structure of polycrystalline Au electrodes have been experimentally studied in detail. The potential of maximum entropy (PME) was determined by the laser&#8208;induced current transient (LICT) technique. Our results demonstrate that increasing the electrolyte pH and introducing O2 shift the PME to more positive potentials. Interestingly, the PME exhibits a higher sensitivity to the pH change in the presence of K+ than Na+. Altering the pH of K2SO4 solution from 4 to 6 can cause a drastic shift of the PME. These findings reveal that e.g. K2SO4 and Na2SO4 cannot be considered as equal supporting electrolytes: it is not a viable assumption. This can likely be extrapolated to other common &#8220;inert&#8221; supporting electrolytes. Beyond that, the knowledge about the near&#8208;ideal electrolyte composition can be used to optimize electrochemical devices such as electrolyzers, fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Fe(II) metallohelices stabilize DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes and down&#8208;regulate expression of G&#8208;quadruplex regulated oncogenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) were identified within the promoter regions of many proto&#8208;oncogenes. Thus, G4s represent attractive targets for cancer therapy and the design and development of new drugs as G4 binders is a very active field of medicinal chemistry. Here, we employed methods of molecular biophysics and biology to investigate the interaction of chiral metallohelices with a series of four DNA G4s (  hTelo  ,  c&#8208;myc  ,  c&#8208;kit1  ,  c&#8208;kit2  ) that are formed by the human telomeric sequence (  hTelo  ) and in the promoter regions of  c&#8208;MYC  and  c&#8208;KIT  proto&#8208;oncogenes. We show that the investigated water&#8208;compatible optically pure metallohelices made by self&#8208;assembly of simple nonpeptidic organic components around Fe(II) ions, which exhibit bioactivity emulating the natural systems, bind with high affinity to G4 DNA and much lower affinity towards duplex DNA. Notably, both enantiomers of metallohelix containing  m  &#8208;xylenyl bridge (  5b  ) were found to be effective inhibitors of primer elongation catalyzed by  Taq  DNA polymerase by stabilizing G4 structures formed in the template strands containing  c&#8208;myc  and  c&#8208;kit2  G4&#8208;forming sequences. Moreover, both enantiomers of  5b  down&#8208;regulated the expression of  c&#8208;MYC  and  c&#8208;KIT  oncogenes in human embryonic kidney cells at mRNA and protein levels. As metallohelices also bind alternative nucleic acid structures, they hold promise as potential multi&#8208;targeted drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Construction of DNA Logic Gates Restricted in Live Cells Based on Structure Programmability and Aptamer&#8208;cell Affinity of G&#8208;quadruplex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA computation is considered as one fascinating alternative to silicon&#8208;based computers, which has evoked substantial attention and gained rapid advancements. Besides realizing versatile functions, implementing spatiotemporal control of logic operations, especially in cellular level, is also of great significance to the development of DNA computation. However, developing simple and efficient methods to restrict DNA logic gates performing in live cells is still a challenge. In this work, we designed a series of DNA logic gates by taking full advantage of the diversity and programmability of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structure. More importantly, by further utilizing the high affinity and specific endocytosis of cells to aptamer G4, we have achieved in realizing an  INHIBIT  logic gate whose operational site is precisely restricted in specific live cells. The design strategy may have great potential in the field of molecular computation and smart bio&#8208;applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in the Biphenyl Crystal: Is the Planar Conformer a Transition State?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined experimental and theoretical study of the biphenyl (BP) crystal is presented. The X&#8208;ray diffraction data collected at 100 K were subject to Hirshfeld atom and multipole refinements of the electron density, &#961;(r). A theoretical exploration of the potential energy surface (PES) of the crystal was also carried out. This investigation challenges the common assumption that the planar structure of BP in the phase I crystal is an average from two twisted configurations in a double&#8208;well potential. The theoretical computations provide compelling evidence that this structure corresponds to a minimum on the PES hence to a stable molecular arrangement. Consistently, the experiment showed no evidence of positional or dynamic disorder. The intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bonds detected are not repulsive. The topological analysis of the experimental and theoretical &#961;(r) reveals that both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H and the C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; contacts stabilize the BP crystal.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule White Light&#8208;Emitting Starburst Donor&#8208;Acceptor Triphenylamine Derivatives and its Application as Ratiometric Luminescent Molecular Thermometer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The work reports&#160;single&#8208;molecule WLE both in solution and thin&#8208;film state by judiciously controlled &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization between the triarylamine sub&#8208;chromophoric units. Triphenylamine (TPA) form the central core, and the phenyl rings are substituted with the electron&#8208;deficient acceptor, 3&#8208;ethylrhodanine (Rh) and electron&#8208;rich donor, triphenylamine or carbazole. The enforced biphenyl configuration amongst the TPA core and the other donors renders the poor &#960;&#8208;conjugation in the entire chromophore, thereby the individual sub&#8208;chromophoric units still retain their individual emission characteristics which cover all the three primary color emissions. TPA&#8208;Rh units exhibit broad fluorescence in the green&#8208;red region originated from the local excited (LE) state and intramolecular charge transfer state (ICT), strongly influenced by the solvent, water, and temperature. Different fluorescence parameters, including spectral maxima, ratiometric changes in ICT emission at the expense of blue emission from terminal donor units, and changes in a lifetime, exerts linear relationship against temperature between 180 &#8211; 330 K, thereby functioning as a multiparameter luminescent molecular thermometer. A temperature coefficient of 0.19 K&#8208;1 in ratiometric fluorescence changes along with the spectral shift of 0.3 nm K&#8722;1 and its workability over the wide temperature makes these molecules promising materials for potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Reusable Supramolecular Assembly&#8208;Induced Emission System for&#160;Selective Detectionand Efficient Removal of&#160;Mercury(II)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient strategy for simultaneously detecting and removing Hg2+&#160;from water is vital to address mercury pollution.&#160;Herein a supramolecular assembly&#160;G&#8834;H&#160;with photoluminescent properties&#160;is facilely constructed through the self&#8208;assembly of a functional pillar[5]arene bearing two N,N&#8208;dimethyldithiocarbamoyl binding sites (H) and an AIE&#8208;active tetraphenylethene derivative (G).&#160;Remarkably, the fluorescence of&#160;G&#8834;H&#160;can be exclusively quenched by Hg2+&#160;among the 30 cations due to the formation of non&#8208;luminous ground state complex and only L&#8208;cysteine can restore fluorescence in the common 20 amino acids.&#160;Meanwhile, the probe&#160;G&#8834;H&#160;has a considerable thermal and pH stability, a good anti&#8208;interference property from various cations, and a satisfactory sensitivity. More importantly,&#160;G&#8834;H&#160;exhibits a prominent capability of Hg2+&#160;removal with rapid capture rate (within 1 h) and excellent adsorption efficiency (98%), as well as a highly efficient recyclability without losing any adsorption activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Saddle&#8208;shaped Building Blocks: A New Concept for Designing Fully Conjugated 3D Organic Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, most organic semiconducting materials (OSMs) are &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures in one or two dimension (2D), where the lack of layer&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;conjugation connection greatly blocks their electron delocalization and transport. The 3D fully conjugated materials could solve this issue because they can provide efficient charge&#8208;transport pathways throughout the whole 3D skeleton, in which the suitable 3D building block is the key to the development of fully conjugated 3D OSMs. Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and its derivatives are good candidates due to their &#960;&#8208;conjugation with 3D saddle&#8208;shaped architecture. In this Concept, we discuss the key features of saddle&#8208;shaped COT&#8208;based derivatives and present the current development of using the COT derivatives as building blocks to construct the 3D fully conjugated organic small compound&#8208; and polymer&#8208;based OSMs. The properties and perspectives of these OSMs in photovoltaics, electro&#8208;catalysis and electrical conductivities are also discussed. These recent advances in the developing 3D fully conjugated materials could potentially open up a new frontier in the design of OSM.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The chiral self&#8208;assembly of trispentahelicene propellers on a gold surface has been investigated in ultrahigh vacuum by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The trispentahelicene propellers aggregate into mirror domains with an enantiomeric ratio of 2:1. Thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation leads to planarization into nanographenes, which self&#8208;assemble into closed&#8208;packed layers with two different azimuths. Further treatment induces in part dimerization and trimerization by intermolecular cyclodehydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Disrotatory &#8208; thermally allowed &#8208; 2p&#8208;electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reactions require high temperatures to proceed. Herein, we report the first anion&#8208;accelerated 2p&#8208;electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening of 6,6&#8208;dihalobicyclo[3.1.0]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones at low temperature, to give their corresponding  meta  &#8208;halophenols in good to high yields (18 examples, 29&#8208;92% yield, average 65%). Many of the phenols hold unconventional substitution patterns and are reported here for the first time. Furthermore, the strength of the methodology was featured by the total synthesis of the densely functionalized phenolic natural product caramboxin (isolated as the lactam dehydrate). The reaction mechanism underlying the anion&#8208;acceleration was investigated by an ab initio study, which concluded that base mediated proton abstraction anti to the concurrently departing endo&#8208;bromine was the initiating step in an overall concerted reaction mechanism leading directly to the  meta  &#8208;halophenol.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Evaluation of Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives for Non&#8208;aqueous Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) employing non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes could potentially operate at much higher cell voltages, and therefore afford higher energy and power densities, in comparison to RFBs employing aqueous electrolytes. The development of such high voltage non&#8208;aqueous RFBs requires anolytes that are electrochemically stable, especially in the presence of trace oxygen and/or moisture. The inherent atmospheric reactivity of anolytes, mandates judicious molecular design with high electron affinity and electrochemical stability. In this study, we propose diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 as a stable redox&#8208;active molecule for anolytes in non&#8208;aqueous organic RFB. We demonstrate organic RFBs utilizing TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 as anolyte with unisol blue (UB) (1,4&#8208;bis(isopropylamino) anthraquinone and 1,4&#8208;Di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis (2&#8208;methoxyethoxy) benzene (DBBB) as catholytes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements with scans repeated over 200 cycles were performed to establish the electrochemical stability of redox pairs. Symmetric flow cell studies show that TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 exhibits stable capacity up to 700 cycles. Redox flow cells employing TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 / UB and TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN 4 / DBBB as redox pairs demonstrate that DPP derivatives are propitious materials for anolytes in all organic non&#8208;aqueous RFBs</dc:description>

         <title>Decoding directing groups and their pivotal role in C&#8211;H activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic organic chemistry has witnessed a plethora of functionalization and defunctionalization strategies. In this regard, C&#8211;H functionalization has been at the forefront due to the multifarious applications in the development of simple to complex molecular architectures and holds a brilliant prospect in drug development and discovery. Despite been explored tremendously by chemists, this functionalization strategy still enjoys the employment of novel metal catalysts as well metal&#8208;free organic ligands. Moreover, the switch to photo and electrochemistry has widened our understanding of the alternative pathways  via  which a reaction can proceed and these strategies have garnered prominence when applied to C&#8211;H activation.&#160;Synthetic chemists have been foraging for new directing groups and templates for the selective activation of C&#8211;H bonds from a myriad of carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds in aromatic as well as aliphatic systems. As a matter of fact, by varying the templates and directing groups, scientists found the answer to the challenge of distal C&#8211;H bond activation which remained an obstacle for a very long time. Moreover, green chemistry and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions have seen light in the past few decades due to the rising concern about environmental issues.&#160;Also, research groups across the world are developing rational strategies for directing group free or non&#8208;directed protocols that are just guided by ligands. This review encapsulates the research works pertinent to C&#8211;H bond activation and discusses the science devoted to it at the fundamental level.&#160;A detailed picture of this field and its progress with time has been portrayed in lucid scientific language with a motive to inculcate and educate scientific minds about this beautiful strategy with an overview of the most relevant and significant works of this era. The unique trait of this review is the detailed description and classification of various directing groups and their utility over a wide substrate scope.</dc:description>

         <title>Aurophilic Interactions in Multi&#8208;Radical Species: Electronic&#8208;Spin and Redox Properties of Bis&#8208; and Tris&#8208;[(Nitronyl Nitroxide)&#8208;Gold(I)] Complexes with Phosphine&#8208;Ligand Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized multinuclear&#8208;Au(I) complexes with two or three nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide radical anion and phosphine&#8208;ligand scaffolds, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1o, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1m, and (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1p, to investigate the influence of Au(I)&#8208;Au(I) (aurophilic) interactions on the properties of multi&#8208;spin molecular systems. The desired complexes were successfully prepared in moderate yields using a one&#8208;pot synthetic method from the corresponding phosphine ligand, Au(I) source, and parent NN, and sodium hydroxide. Among these prepared complexes, compound (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1o, where an aurophilic interaction was clearly observed by crystal structure analysis, showed characteristic spin&#8208;spin interactions, electrochemical properties, and solvatochromic behavior. Results from theoretical calculations also suggested that the differences in their properties between complex (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1o and the other complexes are due to intramolecular aurophilic interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Photo&#8208;Ion Probing of the Ring&#8208;Opening Process in Trans&#8208;Stilbene Oxide.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We study the ultrafast photo&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening process of the oxirane derivative trans&#8208;stilbene oxide through the use of ultrafast UV/UV pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy utilizing photoion detection. We identify the single&#8208; and multiphoton probe paths and final states through comparisons between UV power studies and synchrotron&#8208;based vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) single&#8208;photon ionization studies.&#160; We observe three major time&#8208;dependent features of the parent ion (sub&#8208;450 fs decay, (1.5 &#177; 0.2) ps, and &gt; 100 ps). We discuss these decays in conjunction to the primary ring&#8208;opening mechanism of stilbene oxide that occurs  via  C&#8211;C dissociation in the oxirane ring. We also investigate the appearance of fragments relating to the masses of dehydrogenated diphenylmethane (167 amu) and dehydrogenated methylbenzene (90 amu). The appearance of the 167 amu fragment may suggest an alternative ultrafast ring&#8208;opening pathway  via  the dissociation of one of the C&#8211;O bonds within the oxirane ring</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Synthetic Routes to Carbene&#8208;M&#8208;Amido (M = Cu, Ag, Au) Complexes for Luminescence and Photocatalysis Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel and operationally simple synthetic routes to Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amido (CMA) complexes of copper, silver and gold relevant for photonic applications are reported. A mild base and sustainable solvents allow all operations to be conducted in air and at room temperature, leading to high yields of the targeted compounds even on multigram scales. The effect of various mild bases on the N&#8208;H metallation was studied in silico and experimentally, while a mechanochemical, solvent&#8208;free synthetic approach was also developed. Our photophysical studies on [M(NHC)(Cbz)] indicate that the occurrence of fluorescent or phosphorescent states is determined primarily by the metal, providing control over the excited state properties. Consequently, we demonstrate the potential of the new CMAs beyond luminescence applications by employing a selected CMA as a photocatalyst. The exemplified synthetic ease is expected to accelerate the applications of CMAs in photocatalysis and materials chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed Dimensional Nanostructure (UiO66 decorated MWCNT) as Nanofiller in MMMs for Enhanced CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with combination of two distinct dimensional nanofillers (such as 1D&#8208;3D, 2D&#8208;3D, or 3D&#8208;3D, etc.) have drawn special attention for gas separation applications due to their concerted effects on gas permeation and mechanical properties. Amine functionalized 1D multiwalled carbon nanotube (NH  2  &#8208;MWCNT) holding exceptional mechanical strength and rapid gas transport was cross&#8208;linked with amine functionalized 3D MOF (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  ) with high CO  2  affinity through Schiff base&#160;reaction. The resultant cross&#8208;linked mixed dimensional nanostructure was used as nanofiller into polysulfone (PSf) polymer matrix to explore the underlying synergy between 1D and 3D nanostructures on gas separation performances of MMMs. Cross&#8208;sectional scanning electron microscopy and mapping micrographs revealed the homogenous dispersion of UiO66@MWCNT into the polymer matrix. The MMM containing 5.0 wt.% UiO&#8208;66@MWCNT demonstrated a superior permeability 8.3 Barrer as compared to 4.2 Barrer of pristine PSf membrane for pure CO  2  . Moreover, the selectivity (CO  2  /CH  4  ) of the same MMM was enhanced to 39.5 from 28.0 observed for pristine PSf&#160;under similar conditions of pressure and temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;containing Superbases: Recent Progress in the Chemistry of Electron&#8208;abundant Phosphines and Phosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The renaissance of Br&#248;nsted superbases is primarily based on their pronounced capability for a large variety of chemical transformations under mild reaction conditions. Four major set screws are available for the selective tuning of the basicity: the nature of the basic center (N, P, &#8230;), the degree of electron donation by substituents to the central atom, the possibility of charge delocalization, and the energy gain by hydrogen bonding. Within the past decades, a plethora of neutral electron&#8208;rich phosphine and phosphazene bases appeared in the literature. Their outstanding properties and advantages over inorganic or charged bases have made them now indispensable as auxiliary bases in deprotonation processes. Also, their utilization in catalysis or as ligands in coordination chemistry is highlighted due to broad&#8208;spread interest. Here we give an update of the chemistry of basic phosphines and phosphazenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Bicontinuous Cubic Phase and its Two&#8208;sided Nature Produced by Use of Siloxane Tails and Introduction of Molecular Nonsymmetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A recent intriguing finding that a helical network arrangement forms the bicontinuous cubic phase is attracting great attention for its possibility for new routes to asymmetric synthesis by achiral molecules. However, the design of the molecular structure for the cubic phase is still unrevealed. Herein, we show that a nonsymmetric core molecule with larger naphthalene and smaller benzene moieties at each side of the central linkage and the same disiloxanyldecyloxy terminal at both terminals is the first example for forming both single&#8208;layered and double&#8208;layered core assembly modes in the  Ia  3  d  phase as a single molecule system. The molecule forms the former mode at high temperatures as a thermodynamically stable phase, similarly to the symmetric naphthalene core system, whereas, on cooling below a temperature (&#8764;350 K), a metastable  Ia  3  d  phase forms a double&#8208;layered core state down to room temperature, which is common to the benzene core system. As another effect of the nonsymmetric core, the cubic phase is maintained at room temperature for more than 100 days with slight distortion. Infrared spectral studies and quantum chemical calculations suggested the easy transformation between the two core assembly modes. The core nonsymmetry can be a versatile fine&#8208;tuning of the core assembly mode and phase stability for the cubic phase molecules.</dc:description>

Herein, we show that a nonsymmetric core molecule with larger naphthalene and smaller benzene moieties at each side of the central linkage and the same disiloxanyldecyloxy terminal at both terminals is the first example for forming both single-layered and double-layered core assembly modes in the  Ia  3  d  phase as a single molecule system. The molecule forms the former mode at high temperatures as a thermodynamically stable phase, similarly to the symmetric naphthalene core system, whereas, on cooling below a temperature (&#8764;350 K), a metastable  Ia  3  d  phase forms a double-layered core state down to room temperature, which is common to the benzene core system. As another effect of the nonsymmetric core, the cubic phase is maintained at room temperature for more than 100 days with slight distortion. Infrared spectral studies and quantum chemical calculations suggested the easy transformation between the two core assembly modes. The core nonsymmetry can be a versatile fine-tuning of the core assembly mode and phase stability for the cubic phase molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Mapping of Geodiamolide H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of the actin&#8208;stabilizing marine natural product geodiamolide H was achieved. Solid&#8208;phase based peptide assembly paired with scalable stereoselective syntheses of polyketide building blocks and an optimized esterification set the stage for investigating the key ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Geodiamolide H and synthetic analogs were characterized for their toxicity and for antiproliferative effects in cellulo, by characterising actin polymerization induction in vitro, and by docking on the F&#8208;actin target and property computation in silico, for a better understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR). A non&#8208;natural analog of geodiamolide H was discovered to be most potent in the series, suggesting significant potential for tool compound design.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrasubstituted Peropyrenes Formed by Reductive Aromatization: Synthesis, Functionalization and Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chromophore class of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrasubstituted peropyrenes was effectively synthesized from peropyrenequinone via a Zn&#8208;mediated reductive aromatization approach. In one step, a symmetric functionalization of the peropyrene backbone introducing silylethers (  2  ,  3  ), pivaloyl (  4  ), triflyl (  5  ) and also phosphinite (  6  ) groups was established. Furthermore, the potential of using  4  and  5  in transition metal catalyzed cross couplings was explored leading to 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetraaryl (  8  &#8208;  11  ) and tetraalkynyl (  7  ) peropyrenes. The influence of various substituents on the optoelectronic properties of these &#960;&#8208;system extended peropyrenes was investigated in solid state by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, in solution by means of UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and by their redox properties studied via cyclic voltammetry. By comparison with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, it could be elucidated that introduction of a broad variety of substituents in such versatile one or two step procedures leads to peropyrenes with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies ranging in a gap window of 0.8 eV. The frontier molecular orbital energies identify the target molecules as promising candidates for hole transporting semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heptazine&#8208;based microporous polymeric network, HMP&#8208;TAPA was synthesized via direct coupling of trichloroheptazine and tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine (TAPA). The high surface area of 424 m  2  /g was achieved which is the highest surface area among heptazine&#8208;based polymeric networks (HMPs). The tailored electron&#8208;donor and acceptor units in HMP&#8208;TAPA render the broad visible light absorption. HMP&#8208;TAPA was employed as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for oxidative coupling of amines to imines under visible light irradiation with 98% selectivity. Furthermore, the surface basicity of HMP&#8208;TAPA was utilized to achieve metal&#8208;free heterogeneous base catalysis for Knoevenagel condensation under base&#8208;free conditions with &gt;99 % conversion. Furthermore, HMP&#8208;TAPA showed extreme robustness over a wide pH range (1&#8208;14). The versatility and flexibility in the current material design is beneficial for understanding the offered photo&#8208;activity and surface basicity to design dual active (photo) catalyst materials for specific applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free, mild and chemodivergent transformation involving nitroalkanes was developed. Under optimized reaction conditions, in the presence of trichlorosilane and a tertiary amine, aliphatic nitroalkanes have been selectively converted into amines or nitriles.

         <dc:description>In recent years, applications of low&#8208;valent main group compounds in the field of catalysis is gaining momentum. NHC&#8208;stabilized phosphinidenes owing to the access of two lone pairs of electrons have been found as excellent Lewis bases, however, they are yet to be&#160; used as catalysts.&#160; Herein, we report an NHC stabilized phosphinidene 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylphosphanylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole (  1  ) for&#160; the activation of CO  2  . A closer inspection on the CO  2  activation process by DFT calculations along with intrinsic bond orbital analysis unravel that phosphinidene associates with phenylsilane through a non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between two phenyl rings which activates the Si&#8208;H facilitating its transfer to the CO  2  molecule. Detailed DFT studies along with spectroscopic experiments were combined to understand the mechanism of CO  2  activation and its catalytic reductive functionalization leading to the formylation of a range of chemically inert primary amides under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Aqueous Synthesis of Large&#8208;size and Edge/Defect&#8208;rich Porous Pd and Pd&#8208;alloyed Nanomesh for Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we utilized a facile aqueous synthesis strategy (finished in 5 min at room temperature) to produce large&#8208;size Pd, PdCu, and PdPtCu nanomesh without additional organic ligands or solvent and the volume restriction of reaction solution. The obtained metallic nanomesh possess graphene&#8208;like morphology and a large size of dozens of microns. Abundant edges (coordinatively unsaturated sites, steps, and corners), defects (twins), and mesopores exhibited in the metallic ultrathin structures. The formation mechanism for porous Pd nanomesh disclosed that they undergo the oriented attachment growth along &lt;111&gt; direction. Owing to the structural and compositional advantages, PdCu porous nanomesh with certain elemental ratio (e.g., Pd  87  Cu  13  ) presented enhanced electrocatalytic performance (larger mass activity, better CO tolerance and stability) toward ethanol oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processing of Topochemically Converted Layered WO3 for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution processing of nanomaterials is a promising technique to utilize in various applications owing to its simplicity and scalability. However, the studies on liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of tungsten oxide (WO3) are limited, unlike others due to lack of commercial availability of bulk WO3 with layered structures. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step topochemical synthesis approach to obtain bulk layered WO3 from commercially available layered tungsten disulfide (WS2) by optimizing various parameters like reaction time and temperature. Detailed microscopic and spectroscopic techniques have confirmed the conversion process. Further, LPE has been carried out on topochemically converted bulk layered WO3 in twenty&#8208;two different solvents, and among studied solvents isopropyl alcohol&#8208;water (1:1) co&#8208;solvent system appears to be the best. This indicates that the possible values of surface tension and Hansen solubility parameters for bulk WO3 could be close to that of co&#8208;solvent system. The obtained WO3 dispersions in a low boiling point solvent enable to fabricate thin films with varying thickness using spray deposition method. The obtained thin films are used as active materials in supercapacitors without any conductive additives/binders and exhibited an areal capacitance of 31.7 mF cm&#8208;2 at 5 mV s&#8208;1. The photoelectrochemical measurements reveal that these thin films can also be used as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A library of gold(I) chloride complexes with phosphine ligands incorporating pendant (thio)urea and squaramide H&#8208;bond donors was prepared with the aim of promoting chloride abstraction from Au(I) via H&#8208;bonding. In the absence of silver additives, complexes bearing squaramides and trifluoromethylated aromatic ureas displayed good catalytic activity in the cyclization of N&#8208;propargyl benzamides, as well as in a 1,6&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization, a tandem cyclization&#8208;indole addition reaction and the hydrohydrazination of phenylacetylene. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the energetic span of the reaction is accounted by both the chloride abstraction step, facilitated by the bidentate H&#8208;bond donor via an associative mechanism, and the subsequent cyclization step.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Homometallic titanium oxo clusters are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters, with more than 300 examples characterized by X&#8208;ray structure analyses. Most of them are uncharged and are obtained by partial hydrolysis and condensation of titanium alkoxo derivatives. The cluster cores, ranging from 3 to &gt;50 titanium atoms, are stabilized by organic ligands. Apart from residual OR groups, carboxylato and phosphonato ligands are most frequent. The article critically reviews and categorizes the known structures and works out basic construction principles by comparing the different cluster types.</dc:description>

         <title>The Stronger the Better: Donor Substituents Push Catalytic Activity of Molecular Chromium Olefin Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The donor strength of bifunctional pyridine&#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligands was altered systematically by the introduction of donating groups in the  para  &#8208;position of the pyridine. In the resulting chromium complexes an almost linear correlation between donor strength and the nitrogen&#8208;chromium distance as well as the electronic absorption maximum is experimentally observed. The connection of electron&#8208;donating groups in the ligand backbone leads to an efficient transfer of the electronic influences to the catalytically active metal center without restricting it through steric effects. Therefore, catalytic olefin polymerization activity, which is already very high for the previously studied catalysts, increase considerably by attaching para&#8208;amino groups to the chelating pyridine or quinoline, respectively. Combining electron rich indenyl ligands with para&#8208;amino substituted pyridines lead to the highest catalytic activities observed so far for this class of organo chromium olefin polymerisation catalysts. The resulting polymers are of ultra high molecular weight and the ability of the catalysts to incorporate co&#8208;monomer is also very high.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chlorination of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;tellurazole&#8208;2&#8208;oxide yielded the&#160;&#955;4 Te&#160;dichloro derivative. Its crystal structure demonstrates that the heterocycle retains its ability to autoassociate by chalcogen bonding (ChB) forming macrocyclic tetramers. The corresponding Te&#8230;O ChB distances are 2.062&#160;&#197;, the shortest observed to date in aggregates of this type. DFT&#8208;D3 calculations indicate that while the halogenated molecule is stronger as a ChB donor it also is a weaker ChB acceptor; the overall effect is that the ChBs in the chlorinated homotetramer are not significantly stronger. However, partial halogenation or scrambling selectively yield the 2:2 heterotetramer with alternating&#160;&#955;4 Te and&#160;&#955;2 Te centers, which calculations identified as the thermodynamically preferred arrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Plasmonic Au&#8211;Cu2&#8211;xS Nanocomposites: Design Strategies and Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupling two different materials to create a hybrid nanostructured system is a powerful strategy for achieving synergistically enhanced properties and advanced functionalities. In the case of Au and Cu  2&#8211;  x  S, their combination at the nanoscale results in dual plasmonic Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S nanocomposites that exhibit intense photon absorption in both the visible and the near&#8208;infrared spectral range. Their strong light&#8208;absorbing property translates to superior photothermal transduction efficiency, rendering them attractive in photothermal&#8208;based applications. There are several nanostructure configurations that are possible for the Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S system, and the successful fabrication of a particular architecture often requires a carefully planned synthetic strategy. In this Minireview, we present the different synthetic approaches that can be employed to produce rationally designed Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S nanocomposites, with focus on the experimental protocols that can lead to heterodimer, core&#8722;shell, reverse core&#8722;shell, and yolk&#8722;shell configurations. We also discuss the photothermal behavior of these materials and provide a glimpse of their potential use as photothermally active agents in therapeutic and theranostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Resorcin[4]arene&#8208;Based Inorganic&#8722;Organic Complexes: Metal Ion Effects on the Electrochemical Performance of Lithium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8722;organic complexes are a kind of potential multifunctional materials for their adjustable structures and diverse functions. They have potentials applications for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Additionally, the relationship between different coordinated metal ions and electrochemical performance was also rarely investigated. Herein, three functionalized POM&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8722;organic materials, [Co2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;2EtOH&#183;4.5H2O (1), [Ni2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;4EtOH&#183;13H2O (2) and [Zn2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;2EtOH&#183;2H2O (3), have been synthesized. Further, to enhance the conductivities of these compounds, 1&#8208;3 were doped with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to gain composites 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO, respectively. As anode materials for LIBs, 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO can deliver very high discharge capacities (1445.9, 1285.0 and 1095.3 mAh g&#8722;1, respectively) in the initial run, and show the discharge capacities of 898, 665 and 651 mAh g&#8722;1 at the current density of 0.1 A g&#8722;1 over 100 runs, respectively. More importantly, the discharge capacities of 319, 283 and 329 mAh g&#8722;1 were still maintained for 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO even after 400 cycles at the large current density (1 A g&#8722;1).</dc:description>
