         <title>&#8220;Covalent&#8208;Disassembly&#8221;&#8208;Based Approaches For Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept outlines the &#8220;Covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8220; approach for analyte detection with metal&#8208;complexes in&#8197;vitro, foodstuff and living cells. Design principles for developing new probes for challenging targets as well as for improving current systems are summarized.







Abstract
The detection of analytes with small molecular probes is crucial for the analysis and understanding of chemical, medicinal, environmental and biological situations as well as processes. Classic detection approaches rely on the concept of molecular recognition and bond formation reactions. Bond breakage reactions have been less explored in similar contexts. This concept article introduces metal&#8208;salen and metal&#8208;imine complexes as &#8220;covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8221;&#8208;based (DB)&#8208;probes for detecting polyoxophosphates, thiols, amino acids, HCN and changes in pH. It discusses the roles, importance and combinations of structurally functionalized molecular building blocks in the construction of DB&#8208;probes. Applications of optimized DB&#8208;probes for analyte detection in live cells and foodstuff are also discussed. Furthermore, the mechanism of the disassembly of a Fe(III)&#8208;salen probe upon pyrophosphate binding is presented. Extraordinary selectivity for this analyte was achieved by a multistep disassembly sequence including an unprecedented structural change of the metal complex (i.&#8201;e. &#8220;induced&#8208;fit&#8221; principle). Design principles of probes for sensing applications following the &#8220;covalent&#8208;disassembly&#8221; approach are summarized, which will help improving current systems, but will also facilitate the development of new DB&#8208;probes for challenging analytic targets.

         <title>Enhancing the Catalytic Efficiency of D&#8208;lactonohydrolase through the Synergy of Tunnel Engineering, Evolutionary Analysis, and Force&#8208;Field Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic approach combining tunnel engineering, evolutionary analysis, and force field calculations was used to enhance D&#8208;Lac activity, which revealed that distal residues on the critical loop at the entrance of the substrate tunnel may become a new modification hotspot capable of reshaping energy patterns and thereby affecting enzymatic activity.







Abstract
Computational design advances enzyme evolution and their use in biocatalysis in a faster and more efficient manner. In this study, a synergistic approach integrating tunnel engineering, evolutionary analysis, and force&#8208;field calculations has been employed to enhance the catalytic activity of D&#8208;lactonohydrolase (D&#8208;Lac), which is a pivotal enzyme involved in the resolution of racemic pantolactone during the production of vitamin B5. The best mutant, N96S/A271E/F274Y/F308G (M3), was obtained and its catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) was nearly 23&#8208;fold higher than that of the wild&#8208;type. The M3 whole&#8208;cell converted 20&#8201;% of DL&#8208;pantolactone into D&#8208;pantoic acid (D&#8208;PA, &gt;99&#8201;%&#8197;e.e.) with a conversion rate of 47&#8201;% and space&#8208;time yield of 107.1&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, demonstrating its great potential for industrial&#8208;scale D&#8208;pantothenic acid production. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the reduction in the steric hindrance within the substrate tunnel and conformational reconstruction of the distal loop resulted in a more favourable&#8220;catalytic&#8221; conformation, making it easier for the substrate and enzyme to enter their pre&#8208;reaction state. This study illustrates the potential of the distal residue on the pivotal loop at the entrance of the D&#8208;Lac substrate tunnel as a novel modification hotspot capable of reshaping energy patterns and consequently influencing the enzymatic activity.

         <title>Synthesis of Interlocked and Non&#8208;Interlocked Deca(para&#8208;phenylene) Derivatives by Ni&#8208;mediated Biaryl Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[2]Rotaxane with deca(para&#8208;phenylene) structure was synthesized in high yield under mild conditions by biaryl coupling mediated by a macrocyclic nickel complex. Deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane was readily soluble, and the optical properties of the compounds were examined in solution.







Abstract
Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) (PPn) is a compound composed of directly connected 1,4&#8208;phenylene moieties. The synthesis of PPn composed of six or more phenylene moieties with no substituent at the internal phenylene moiety has been challenging because of its low solubility. Herein we synthesized oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxanes, including a deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane, with a defined number of phenylene moieties. Biaryl coupling of iodoarenes mediated by macrocyclic dibenzodihydrophenanthroline&#8208;Ni complex was utilized for the first time to synthesize the [2]rotaxanes. Compared to the non&#8208;interlocked deca(para&#8208;phenylene), the deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane showed higher solubility. The properties of the oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxanes and non&#8208;interlocked oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)s were analyzed by spectroscopic methods.

         <title>Characterization by Gel Permeation Chromatography of the Molecular Weight of Supramolecular Polymers Generated by Forming Polyrotaxanes through the Introduction of External Stoppers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of large stoppers to supramolecular polymers, followed by the spontaneous generation of dynamic covalent bonds leads to the transformation of supramolecular polymers into polyrotaxanes. Determining the molecular weight of the polyrotaxanes by gel permeation chromatography allows the molecular weight of the corresponding supramolecular polymers to be obtained.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers find wide applications across diverse domains, and the molecular weight exerts a critical influence on their applicability. Consequently, the measurement of molecular weight for supramolecular polymers assumes paramount significance. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) requiring low&#8208;concentration condition is a common characterization employed for molecular weight determination, which is not suitable for supramolecular polymers possessing concentration&#8208;independence property. Here, to break this threshold, we synthesized M1 embodying dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) moiety as well as dibenzylammonium salt (DBA) group, which was capable of self&#8208;assembling into supramolecular polymers terminated with aldehyde groups at its end. Upon the addition of (4&#8208; (1,2,2&#8208;Triphenylvinyl) phenyl) methylamine (TPE&#8208;NH2), supramolecular polymers underwent a transition into polyrotaxanes, for which it was led by the generation of imine bonds. By virtue of GPC, the molecular weight of polyrotaxanes was obtained, then it was available to gain the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers with the help of transformation efficiency.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TOC sentence: A rational design strategy for 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;based fluorophores with bright emission at long wavelengths is proposed. An intramolecular charge transfer&#8208;based 2&#8208;pyridone fluorophore with large molar absorptivity (&#1013;=20,100&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), longer emission wavelength (&#955;em=539&#8197;nm), high emission quantum yield (&#981;F=74&#8201;%), and large Stokes shift (&#916;v=5720&#8197;cm&#8722;1) is developed by the strategy.

The recent discovery of blue fluorophores with high quantum yields based on pyridone structures inspired the development of new low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluorophores with bright emissions at tunable wavelengths, which are highly attractive for various applications. In this study, we propose a rational design strategy for 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;based fluorophores with bright emissions at long wavelengths. With a detailed understanding of the positional substitution effects on each carbon atom of the 2&#8208;pyridone core, we developed a bright blue fluorophore (&#955;abs=377&#8197;nm; &#955;em=433&#8197;nm; &#1013;=13,200&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1; &#981;F=88&#8201;%) through C3&#8208;aryl and C4&#8208;ester substitutions followed by cyclization. Furthermore, by applying the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) principle, we invented a bright green fluorophore through C3&#8208; and C4&#8208;diester and C6&#8208;aryl substitutions. The ICT fluorophore based on the pyridone structure shows large molar absorptivity (&#1013;=20,100&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1), longer emission wavelength (&#955;em=539&#8197;nm), high emission quantum yield (&#981;F=74&#8201;%), and large Stokes shift (&#916;v=5720&#8197;cm&#8722;1), which are comparable to those of practical fluorescent probes.

         <title>Elevating Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Battery Durability through Samarium Oxide/Ketjen Black Modified Separator</title>

Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have garnered significant attention as a promising next&#8208;generation battery technology due to their potential for high energy density. However, their practical application is hampered by slow reaction kinetics and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfide intermediates. In this context, the authors introduce a pioneering solution in the form of a novel porous carbon nanostructure modified with samarium oxide, denoted as Sm2O3/KB. The material has a highly polar surface, allowing lithium polysulfide to be chemisorbed efficiently. The unsaturated sites provided by the oxygen vacancies of Sm2O3 promote Li2S nucleation, lowering the reaction energy barrier and accelerating Li2S dissolution. The porous structure of Ketjen Black provides a highly conductive channel for electron transport and effectively traps polysulfides. Meanwhile, the batteries with Sm2O3/KB/PP spacers exhibited remarkable electrochemical performances, including a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of only 0.046&#8201;% for 1000 cycles at 2&#8197;C and an excellent multiplicative performance of 624&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3&#8197;C. This work opens up a new avenue for the potential use of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based materials in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Boosting hydrogen production of a MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalyst with clean interface via facile one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;pot synthesis represents an attractive strategy for interface engineering to facilitate the charge transfer and separation. This work provides the formation details of MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalysts via facile one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis, which results in clean and direct interfaces that contribute to the efficient hydrogen production to meet the sustainable energy requirement.







Abstract
Hydrogen production from photocatalysis via the usage of multicomponent photocatalysts represents a promising pathway for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, owing to their structural advantages in dealing with the three crucial processes in photocatalysis, namely, light harvesting, charge transfer, and surface redox reactions. We demonstrate the fabrication of a MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalyst, denoted as semiconductor/MOF/cocatalyst, by a one&#8208;pot electrochemical synthetic route. The as&#8208;fabricated multicomponent photocatalyst has a clean interface among the components, leading to close connections that contribute to high&#8208;quality heterojunction and facilitate photogenerated charge transfer and separation, thereby the efficient hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen production rate of the resultant ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/Pt is 1327&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is much higher than that of ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF (15&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and pure Zr&#8208;MOF (10.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1), as well as the photodeposited&#8208;Pt products ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (287&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) and Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (192&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) obtained by the step&#8208;wise synthetic approach. The work gives a good inspiration for the rational design and construction of MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalysts through the one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis.

         <dc:description>
Development of high energy density and high safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIB) to meet the growing energy demand is needed. Niobium&#8208;based oxides have proven to be both safe and effective alternative to commercial graphite anode materials. This review summarizes the recent development of niobium&#8208;based oxides as anode materials for LIBs, including developments in Nb2O5 materials, ternary niobium&#8208;based oxides, composites with carbon&#8208;based materials, as well as future directions and challenges of niobium&#8208;based oxide anode materials.







Abstract
Recently, it has become imperative to develop high energy density as well as high safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBS) to meet the growing energy demand. Among the anode materials used in LIBs, the currently used commercial graphite has low capacity and is a safety hazard due to the formation of lithium dendrites during the reaction. Among the transition metal oxide (TMO) anode materials, TMO based on the intercalation reaction mechanism has a more stable structure and is less prone to volume expansion than TMO based on the conversion reaction mechanism, especially the niobium&#8208;based oxide in it has attracted much attention. Niobium&#8208;based oxides have a high operating potential to inhibit the formation of lithium dendrites and lithium deposits to ensure safety, and have stable and fast lithium ion transport channels with excellent multiplicative performance. This review summarizes the recent developments of niobium&#8208;based oxides as anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, discusses the special structure and electrochemical reaction mechanism of the materials, the synthesis methods and morphology of nanostructures, deficiencies and improvement strategies, and looks into the future developments and challenges of niobium&#8208;based oxide anode materials.

The regio&#8208; and stereoselective opening of pyranosyl epoxides has been taken advantage of to obtain a family of very challenging thiooligosaccharide antigens related to Campylobacter jejuni HS:4 with unprecedented efficiency.







Abstract
The enzyme&#8208;resistant thioglycosides are highly valuable immunogens because of their enhanced metabolic stability. We report the first synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides related to the capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4 for potential use in conjugate vaccines. The native CPS structures of the pathogen consist of a challenging repeating disaccharide formed with &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine; the rare 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl backbone and &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration of the former monosaccharide makes the synthesis of this family of antigens very challenging. So far, no synthesis of the thioanalogs of the CPS antigens have been reported. The unprecedented synthesis presented in this work is built on an elegant approach by using &#946;&#8208;glycosylthiolate as a glycosyl donor to open the 2,3&#8208;epoxide functionality of pre&#8208;designed 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;talo&#8208;heptopyranosides. Our results illustrated that this key trans&#8208;thioglycosylation can be designed in a modular and regio and stereo&#8208;selective manner. Built on the success of this novel approach, we succeeded the synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides including a thiohexasaccharide which is considered to be the desired antigen length and complexity for immunizations. We also report the first direct conversion of base&#8208;stable but acid&#8208;labile 2&#8208;trimethylsilylethyl glycosides to glycosyl&#8208;1&#8208;thioacetates in a one&#8208;pot manner.

         <title>CBe2H5&#8722;: Unprecedented 2&#963;/2&#960; Double Aromaticity and Dynamic Structural Fluxionality in a Planar Tetracoordinate Carbon Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 14&#8208;electron ternary anionic CBe2H5&#8722; cluster with a planar tetracoordinate carbon center is reported. Unprecedentedly, two ligand hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon rotate alternately, leading to it exhibiting interesting dynamic fluxionality that can be regarded as a molecular rotor.







Abstract
A 14&#8208;electron ternary anionic CBe2H5&#8722; cluster containing a planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) atom is designed herein. Remarkably, it can be stabilized by only two beryllium atoms with both &#960;&#8208;acceptor/&#963;&#8208;donor properties and two hydrogen atoms, which means that the conversion from planar methane (transition state) to ptC species (global minimum) requires the substitution of only two hydrogen atoms. Moreover, two ligand H atoms exhibit alternate rotation, giving rise to interesting dynamic fluxionality in this cluster. The electronic structure analysis reveals the flexible bonding positions of ligand H atoms due to C&#8722;H localized bonds, highlighting the rotational fluxionality in the cluster, and two CBe2 3c&#8211;2e delocalized bonds endow its rare 2&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Unprecedentedly, the fluxional process exhibits a conversion in the type of bonding (&#963; bond&#8596;&#960; bond), which is an uncommon fluxional mechanism. The cluster can be seen as an attempt to apply planar hypercoordinate carbon species to molecular motors.

         <title>Fe and Cu Intercalations Enhance SERS of MoO3 through Different Mechanistic Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalations of molybdenum trioxide using Fe and Cu lead to outstanding SERS activities through different mechanistic pathways. The Fe intercalation of molybdenum trioxide facilitates the charge transfer pathways for chemical mechanism, while the Cu intercalation enhances surface plasmon resonance by increasing charge carrier density, leading to electromagnetic mechanism.







Abstract
Surface Enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a molecular&#8208;specific analytical technique with various applications. Although electromagnetic (EM) and chemical (CM) mechanisms have been proposed to be the main origins of SERS, exploring highly sensitive SERS substrates with well&#8208;defined mechanistic pathways remains challenging. Since surface and electronic structures of substrates were crucial for SERS activity, zero&#8208;valent transition metals (Fe and Cu) were intercalated into MoO3 to modulate its surface and electronic structures, leading to unexceptional high enhancement factors (1.0&#215;108 and 1.1&#215;1010 for Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3, respectively) with decent reproducibility and stability. Interestingly, different mechanistic pathways (CM and EM) were proposed for Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3 according to mechanistic investigations. The different mechanisms of Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3 were rationalized by the electronic structures of the intercalated Fe(0) and Cu(0), which modulates the surface and electronic structures of Fe&#8208;MoO3 and Cu&#8208;MoO3 to differentiate their SERS mechanisms.

         <title>Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane D3h&#8208;(RSiO1.5)14</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The systematic synthesis and solid state structure of the elusive D3h isomer of the T14 silsesquioxane scaffold as phenyl&#8208;substituted T14Ph14 derivative is reported. Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) catalysis enables the condensation of two incompletely condensed T7Ph7(OH)3 silsesquioxanes.







Abstract
While smaller polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes TnRn (POSS) are readily accessible or even commercially available, unambiguously authenticated larger systems (n&gt;12) have barely been reported. Synthesis and isolation procedures are lengthy, and yields are often very low. Herein, we present the surprisingly straightforward and high&#8208;yielding access to the phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative of a so far only postulated second D3h&#8208;symmetric T14 isomer and with that the largest crystallographically characterized POSS cage with organic substituents. Treatment of the commercially available incompletely condensed T7Ph7(OH)3 silsesquioxane with catalytic amounts of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid results in high yields of the T14Ph14 framework, which is isolated in crystalline form by a simple work&#8208;up. D3h&#8208;T14Ph14 was analyzed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and thermal analysis. The relative energies of all four theoretically possible T14Ph14 isomers were determined by optimization of the corresponding structure using DFT methods.

         <title>Organic Polar Crystals, Second Harmonic Generation, and Piezoelectric Effects from Heteroadamantanes in the Space Group R3m</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
7&#8208;halo&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazaadamantanes with halo=chloro, bromo form polar crystals from solution, exhibiting non&#8208;linear optical and piezoelectric effects. The chloro compound and the bromo compound form substitutional solid solutions.







Abstract
Polar crystalline materials, a subset of the non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials, are highly sought after. Their symmetry properties make them pyroelectric and also piezoelectric and capable of second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). For SHG and piezoelectric applications, metal oxides are commonly used. The advantages of oxides are durability and hardness &#8211; downsides are the need for high&#8208;temperature synthesis/processing and often the need to include toxic metals. Organic polar crystals, on the other hand, can avoid toxic metals and can be amenable to solution&#8208;state processing. While the vast majority of polar organic molecules crystallize in non&#8208;polar space groups, we found that both 7&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazaadamantane, for short Cl&#8208;TAA, and also the related Br&#8208;TAA (but not I&#8208;TAA) form polar crystals in the space group R3m, easily obtained from dichloromethane solution. Measurements confirm piezoelectric and SHG properties for Cl&#8208;TAA and Br&#8208;TAA. When the two species are crystallized together, solid solutions form, suggesting that properties of future materials can be tuned continuously.

While the vast majority of polar organic molecules crystallize in non-polar space groups, we found that both 7-chloro-1,3,5-triazaadamantane, for short Cl-TAA, and also the related Br-TAA (but not I-TAA) form polar crystals in the space group R3m, easily obtained from dichloromethane solution. Measurements confirm piezoelectric and SHG properties for Cl-TAA and Br-TAA. When the two species are crystallized together, solid solutions form, suggesting that properties of future materials can be tuned continuously.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;immolation Assisted Morphology Transformation of Prebiotic Lipidated&#8208;cationic Amino Acids: Electro&#8208;droplet Mediated C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction to Synthesize Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prebiotic synthesis of cationic amino acid&#8208;based amphiphiles and their self&#8208;assembly to form microcompartments. Micellar compartments were transformed into droplet&#8208;like structures via self&#8208;immolation of amphiphiles at high pH. Cationic droplets encapsulated prebiotic molecules and assisted electron transfer reaction to synthesize prebiotic macromolecules (isoprenoid derivatives) at primitive Earth conditions.







Abstract
Compartmentalization protected biomolecules from the fluctuating environments of early Earth. Although contemporary cells mostly use phospholipid&#8208;based bilayer membranes, the utility of non&#8208;bilayer compartments was not ruled out during the prebiotic and modern eras. In the present study, we demonstrated the prebiotic synthesis of lipidated cationic amino acid&#8208;based amphiphiles [lauryl ester of lysine (LysL); ornithine (OrnL); and 2,4&#8208;diamino butyric acid (DabL)] using model dry&#8208;down reaction. These amphiphiles self&#8208;assemble into micellar membranes. However, the OrnL and DabL&#8208;based micelles undergo pH&#8208;responsive transformation to lipid droplet&#8208;like morphologies, a modelcompartment in the prebiotic Earth. These cationic droplets encapsulated prebiotic molecules (isoprene) and assisted electron transfer reaction to synthesize isoprenoid derivatives at primitive Earth conditions. The self&#8208;assembly of prebiotic amphiphiles, their transformation to droplet compartments, and droplet&#8208;assisted C&#8722;C bond formation reaction might have helped the evolution to synthesize various biomolecules required for the origin of life.

         <title>Design of multi&#8208;luminescent silica&#8208;based nanoparticles for the detection of liquid organic compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for detection of liquid organic compounds was demonstrated using SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with a EuIII:EDTA complex and the organic dye BODIPY. The ratiometric photoluminescence detection technique was proved using toluene and 1&#8208;octanol as model compounds of crude oil. The optimal synthesis conditions gave NPs with a diameter of ~100&#8197;nm, which is suitable for transport through porous oil reservoir structures.







Abstract
Tracer testing in reservoir formations is utilised to determine residual oil saturation as part of optimum hydrocarbon production. Here, we present a novel detection method of liquid organic compounds by monodisperse SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) containing two luminophores, a EuIII:EDTA complex and a newly synthesised fluorophore based on the organic boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;moiety. The particles exhibited stable EuIII PL emission intensity with a long lifetime in aqueous dispersion. The fluorescence of the BODIPY was also preserved in the aqueous environment. The ratiometric PL detection technique was demonstrated by using toluene and 1&#8208;octanol as model compounds of crude oil. The optimal synthesis conditions were found to give NPs with a diameter of ~100&#8197;nm, which is suitable for transport through porous oil reservoir structures. The cytotoxicity of the NPs was confirmed to be very low for human lung cell and fish cell lines. These findings demonstrate the potential of the NPs to replace the hazardous chemicals used to estimate the residual oil saturation. Moreover, the ratiometric PL detection technique is anticipated to be of benefit in other fields, such as biotechnology, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring, where a reliable and safe detection of a liquid organic phase is needed.

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Catalytic Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Ketones for the Synthesis of &#946;, &#947;&#8208;Disubstituted &#946;, &#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of methyl ketones with cyclic ketones to &#946;&#8208;branched &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones are reported. This catalytic route gives a unique opportunity to integrate the chemistry of synthetic challenge cross&#8208;coupling reaction of ketones and alkene migration reaction into a reaction pot. Mechanistic and DFT studies complement the synthetic work.







Abstract
C&#8722;C bond forming reaction of ketone with aldehyde is well&#8208;studied for the synthesis of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, however, the reaction with two different ketones to unsaturated carbonyl compound has not yet been systematically studied. Probably due to the relatively low reactivity of ketones as electrophiles (aldol acceptors), its propensity for retro&#8208;aldol reaction. The reactions often suffer from unsatisfactory chemoselectivity (self&#8208; vs. crossed aldol products) and regioselectivity (thermodynamic vs. kinetic enolate). In this quest, we report here for the first time selective cross&#8208;coupling reaction of ketones to &#946;&#8208;branched &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones by using ruthenium catalysis. Interestingly, single crossed aldol condensation products are formed even in reactions where a mixture of products is possible. Reaction is highly chemoselective, regioselective and produces H2O as the only byproducts making the protocol environmentally benign. Method is compatible with a wide variety of sensitive functional group and applicable for even problematic aliphatic ketones as substrates. Notably, acetone was found as a three&#8208;carbon feedstock for the syntheses of simple &#946;, &#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketone compounds. The process can further be extended to the gram&#8208;scale reaction and late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products. With the help of DFT calculations, several control experiments, and deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments, the mechanistic finding demonstrated that initial aldol&#8208;condensation of ketones to a &#946;, &#946;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone, which further isomerizes to a &#946;, &#947;&#8208; unsaturated ketone via &#951;3&#8208;allyl ruthenium complex.

         <title>Modification of a Common &#946;&#8208;diketiminate NacNac Framework via Sequential Lithiation and Small Molecule Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Though non&#8208;innocence of the popular NacNac (BDI) ligand derived from 2,6 diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketimine has been observed in a few studies, rarely has this non&#8208;innocence been deliberately exploited to generate novel derivatives. Here, we show that tripodal modifications are accessible by a three&#8208;step lithiation&#8208;small molecule insertion&#8208;hydrolysis protocol involving insertion of isocyanates, isothiocyanates, or a carbodiimide.







Abstract
A widely utilised class of ligands in synthesis and catalysis, &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) or NacNac compounds were initially considered innocent in the sense that they remained intact in all their applications. That changed when the &#947;&#8208;C&#8722;H unit of their NCCCN backbone was found to engage in reactions with electrophiles. Here, we show that this special reactivity can be used advantageously to prepare tripodal modifications of the common NacNac ligand derived from 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketimine [NacNacH (Me, Dipp)]. Lithiation to give NacNacLi, followed by reactions with isocyanates, isothiocyanates and a carbodiimide, have afforded a series of tripodal NacNac variants having N,N,N,O; N,N,N,S; or N,N,N,N potential dentation sites, many of which have been crystallographically characterised. Distinct ligating modes of these new ligands have been elucidated through the crystal structures of their lithiated derivatives.

         <title>Synthesis of Superelastic, Highly Conductive Graphene Aerogel/Liquid Metal Foam and its Piezoresistive Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Graphene aerogel (GA) has important application potential as piezoresistive sensors due to its low density, high conductivity, high porosity, and good mechanical properties. However, the fabrication of GA&#8208;based sensors with good mechanical properties and excellent sensing performance is still challenging. Herein, liquid&#8208; metal&#8208;modified GAs (GA/LM) are proposed for the development of an excellent GA&#8208;based sensor. GA/LM with three&#8208;dimensional interconnected layered structure exhibits excellent compressive stress of 41 KPa and fast response time (&lt;20 ms). While generally flexible GA composites cannot be compressed beyond 80% strain without plastic deformation,GA/LM demonstrates a high compressive strength of 60 kPa under a strain of 90%. A real&#8208;time pressure sensor was fabricated based on GA/LM&#8208;2 to monitor swallowing, pulse beating, finger, wrist and knee bending, and even plantar pressure during walking. These excellent features enable potential applications in health detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometry&#8208;induced Oligomerization of Fluorine&#8208;substituted Phenylazothiazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitches are molecules that can absorb light of specific wavelengths and undergo a reversible transformation between their trans and cis isomeric forms. In phenylazo photoswitches, it is common for the less stable cis (Z) isomer to convert back to the more stable trans (E) isomer either through photochemical or thermal means. In this research, we designed new derivatives of phenylazothiazole (PAT) photoswitches, PAT&#8208;Fn, which feature fluorine substituents on their phenyl component. These derivatives can reversibly isomerize under visible light exposure with the enrichment of E and Z isomers at photostationary state (PSS). Surprisingly, we observed an unconventional phenomenon when these PAT&#8208;Fn (n &#8807;&#160;2) photoswitches were in their cis isomeric state in the absence of light. Instead of the anticipated transformation from cis to trans isomer, these compounds converted to an oligomeric compound. Our detailed experimental investigation and theoretical calculations, indicated the crucial role of fluorine substituents and the distinctive geometric arrangement of the cis isomer in driving the unexpected oligomerization process originating from the cis isomeric state.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural insights into the semiquinone form of human Cytochrome P450 reductase by DEER distance measurements between a native flavin and a spin labelled non&#8208;canonical amino acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The flavoprotein Cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is the unique electron pathway from NADPH to Cytochrome P450 (CYPs). The conformational dynamics of human CPR in solution, which involves transitions from a "locked/closed" to an "unlocked/open" state, is crucial for electron transfer. To date, however, the factors guiding these changes remain unknown. By Site&#8208;Directed Spin Labelling coupled to Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy, we have incorporated a non&#8208;canonical amino acid onto the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) domains of soluble human CPR, and labelled it with a specific nitroxide spin probe. Taking advantage of the endogenous FMN cofactor, we successfully measured for the first time, the distance distribution by DEER between the semiquinone state FMNH&#183; and the nitroxide. The DEER data revealed a salt concentration&#8208;dependent distance distribution, evidence of an "open" CPR conformation at high salt concentrations exceeding previous reports. We also conducted molecular dynamics simulations which unveiled a diverse ensemble of conformations for the &#8220;open&#8221; semiquinone state of the CPR at high salt concentration. This study unravels the conformational landscape of the one electron reduced state of CPR, which had never been studied before.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Synthesis of a Macrocyclic Sulfite of Polyethylene Glycol by Cascaded Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many macrocyclic compounds are attractive drug&#8208;like molecules or intermediates due to their special properties. However, the bulk synthesis of such compounds are hindered by the necessity of using diluted solutions, in order to prevent intermolecular reactions that yields oligomer impurities, thereby resulting in a low production efficiency. Such challenge can be adequately addressed by using continuous reactors, allowing improved efficiency with smaller space footprints. In this work, we proposed a novel continuous process for the synthesis of a macrocyclic sulfite of tetraethylene glycol (PEG4&#8208;MCSi), which is a precursor to a very useful building block, PEG4&#8208;macrocyclic sulfate (PEG4&#8208;MCS). The basic reaction parameters, including stoichiometry and temperature, were first confirmed with small batch reactions, and the effectiveness of coiled reactors and continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) were compared. Cascaded CSTRs were proven to be suitable, and the reaction parameters were subject to further optimization to give a robust continuous process. The process was then tested with 4 parallel runs for up to 64 h. Finally, the merits and demerits of batch and continuous reactions were also compared, demonstrating the suitability of latter in the bulk production of macrocyclic PEG&#8208;MCSi compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tetrahydropyran and tetrahydropyran&#8208;fused poly&#8208;ethers scaffolds are found in many classes of natural products and medicinally relevant small molecules. Here we describe a catalytic system for 6&#8208;endo selective ring&#8208;opening of epoxides by Au(I) or Au(III) catalyst that provides rapid access to various tetrahydropyran&#8208;derived motifs. It also could efficiently construct the subunits of marine ladder&#8208;like poly&#8208;ethers through emulating the Nakanishi&#8217;s hypothesis on the biosynthesis of these toxins. The synthetic utility of this method is also demonstrated in the preparation of the tricyclic core of tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolide natural products lituarines A&#8211;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Restrain and Release of the Dynamic Valence Isomerization in a Shape&#8208;shifting Bullvalene by Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In search for structural features that enable the control of the valence isomerization of the fluxional bullvalene, a bullvalene&#8208;bis(harmane) conjugate is identified that acts as chelating ligand in complexes with metal ions. Spectrometric titrations show that this ligand forms 1:1 complexes with Ag+, Cu+, Cu2+, and Zn2+. Importantly, detailed NMR&#8208;spectroscopic analysis at different temperatures reveals that the complexation with Ag+ strongly affects the dynamic isomerization of the bullvalene unit of the ligand such that only one predominant valence isomer is formed, even at 5 &#176;C. Detailed 1H&#8208;NMR&#8208;spectroscopic studies disclose an increased barrier (~11 kJmol&#8211;1) of the Cope rearrangement. Furthermore, the addition of hexacyclene displaces the Ag+ from the complex, so that the valence isomerization is accelerated and an equilibrium with two predominant isomers is formed. In turn, repeated addition of Ag+ regains the complex with the restrained isomerization of the bullvalene unit. This method to control the valence isomerism by straightforward chemical stimuli may be used to simplify structural analysis at elevated temperatures, i.e. a feature not available so far with bullvalenes, and it may be employed as functional element in dynamic supramolecular assemblies.</dc:description>

Detailed 1H-NMR-spectroscopic studies disclose an increased barrier (~11 kJmol&#8211;1) of the Cope rearrangement. Furthermore, the addition of hexacyclene displaces the Ag+ from the complex, so that the valence isomerization is accelerated and an equilibrium with two predominant isomers is formed. In turn, repeated addition of Ag+ regains the complex with the restrained isomerization of the bullvalene unit. This method to control the valence isomerism by straightforward chemical stimuli may be used to simplify structural analysis at elevated temperatures, i.e. a feature not available so far with bullvalenes, and it may be employed as functional element in dynamic supramolecular assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing the Isolobal Relation between Cp'''NiP3 and White Phosphorus by Experimental Charge Density Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An in&#8208;depth analysis of the description of bonding within Cp'''Ni&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P3 (Cp'''&#160;=&#160;1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcyclopentadienyl, [Ni]P3) employing X&#8208;ray diffraction based multipolar modeling, density functional theory (DFT) as well as an &#8220;experimental wavefunction&#8221; obtained from X&#8208;ray restrained wavefunction (XRW) fitting is presented. The results are compared to DFT calculations on white phosphorus &#8211; an isolobal analogue to [Ni]P3. A complementary bonding analysis shows insights into the reactivity of [Ni]P3. The isolobal principle is reflected in every aspect of our analysis and the employed methods seamlessly predict the differences in reactivity of [Ni]P3 and P4. Crystallographic modeling, solid&#8208;state NMR, and DFT calculations describe the dynamic behavior of the cyclo&#8208;P3 unit in the title molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Epoxidation of Cyclooctene on Surface Modified Ni Foam Using Water as Oxygen Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical epoxidation of olefins using water as an oxygen atom source is emerging as an alternative approach for an atom economic and sustainable method towards a highly selective synthesis of epoxides. We report an electrochemical procedure for epoxidation of cyclooctene using water as the sole oxygen atom source over a sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) modified nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)2 catalyst directly grown on Ni foam. The SDS modification facilitates the mass transfer of cyclooctene towards the anode, thus achieving a 2.5&#8208;fold higher conversion with more than 90% selectivity towards the corresponding epoxide compared with pure Ni(OH)2 catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Morphogen (&#8210;)&#8208;Thallusin and Mediated Uptake of Fe(III) into the Green Seaweed Ulva</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fully enantioselective, catalytic synthesis of the algal morphogen (&#8211;)&#8208;thallusin using polyene cyclization chemistry is reported. The synthesis features dedicated precursor design, introduction of a TMS&#8208;substituted arene as a regioselective terminator, very high enantiomer excess (ee), on gram scale, and productive scaffold functionalization. Furthermore, an ee determination methodology of thallusin samples was developed, and the ee of biosynthesized thallusin was determined. Fe(III)&#8208;uptake studies demonstrated that the cellular uptake of iron facilitated by thallusin derivatives was independent of their morphogenic activity, suggesting their active import via siderophore transporters as a shuttle system.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;F Bond Insertion: An Emerging Strategy for Constructing Fluorinated Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;F Insertion reactions, where an organic fragment formally inserts into a carbon&#8208;fluorine bond in a substrate, are highly attractive, yet largely unexplored, methods to prepare valuable fluorinated molecules. The inherent strength of C&#8208;F bonds and the resulting need for a large thermodynamic driving force to initiate C&#8208;F cleavage often leads to sequestering of the released fluoride in an unreactive by&#8208;product. Recently, however, several groups have succeeded in overcoming this challenge, opening up the study of C&#8208;F insertion as an efficient and highly atom&#8208;economical approach to prepare fluorinated compounds. In this article, the recent breakthroughs are discussed focusing on the key conceptual advances that allowed for both C&#8208;F bond cleavage and subsequent incorporation of the released fluoride into the product.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical nanographenes have garnered substantial attention owing to their finely adjustable optical and semiconducting properties. The strategic integration of both helicity and heteroatoms into the nanographene structure, facilitated by a boron&#8208;oxygen&#8208;based multiple resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), elevates its photophysical and chiroptical features. This signifies the introduction of an elegant category of helical nanographene that combines optical (TADF) and chiroptical (CPL) features. In this direction, we report the synthesis, optical, and chiroptical properties of boron, oxygen&#8208;doped &#7464;&#8208;extended helical nanographene. The &#960;&#8208;extension induces distortion in the DOBNA&#8208;incorporated nanographene, endowing a pair of helicenes, (P)&#8208;B2NG, and (M)&#8208;B2NG exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence with glum of &#8208;2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and +2.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. B2NG exhibited MR&#8208;TADF with a lifetime below 5 &#956;s, and a reasonably high fluorescence quantum yield (50%). Our molecular design enriches the optical and chiroptical properties of nanographenes and opens up new opportunities in multidisciplinary fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Mimicking the Shape and Function of the ClC Chloride Channel Selective Pore by Combining a Molecular Hourglass Shape with Anion&#8211;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ClC is the main family of natural chloride channel proteins that transport Cl&#8722; across the cell membrane with high selectivity. The chloride transport and selectivity are determined by the hourglass&#8208;shaped pore and the filter located in the central and narrow region of the pore. Artificial unimolecular channel that mimics both the shape and function of the ClC selective pore is attractive, because it could provide simple molecular model to probe the intriguing mechanism and structure&#8208;function relevance of ClC. Here we elaborated upon the concept of molecular hourglass plus anion&#8211;&#960; interactions for this purpose. The concept was validated by experimental results of molecular hourglasses using shape&#8208;persistent 1,3&#8208;alternate tetraoxacalix[2]arene[2]triazine as the central macrocyclic skeleton to control the conductance and selectivity, and anion&#8211;&#960; interactions as the driving force to facilitate the chloride dehydration and movement along the channel.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomass&#8208;derived carbon materials for electrochemical energy storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The environmental impact from the waste disposal has been widely concerned around the world. The conversion of wastes to useful resources is important for the sustainable society. As a typical family of wastes, biomass materials basically composed of collagen, protein&#160;and lignin, are considered as useful resources for recycle and reuse. In recent years, the development of carbon material derived from biomasses, such as plants, crops, animals and their application in electrochemical energy storage have attracted extensive attention. Through the selection of the appropriate biomass, the optimization of the activation method and the control of the pyrolysis temperatures, carbon materials with desired features, such as high&#8208;specific surface area, variable porous framework, and controllable heteroatom&#8208;doping have been fabricated. Herein, this review summarized the preparation methods, morphologies, heteroatoms doping in the plant/animal&#8208;derived carbonaceous materials, and their application as electrode materials for secondary batteries and supercapacitors, and as electrode support for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

The conversion of wastes to useful resources is important for the sustainable society. As a typical family of wastes, biomass materials basically composed of collagen, protein&#160;and lignin, are considered as useful resources for recycle and reuse. In recent years, the development of carbon material derived from biomasses, such as plants, crops, animals and their application in electrochemical energy storage have attracted extensive attention. Through the selection of the appropriate biomass, the optimization of the activation method and the control of the pyrolysis temperatures, carbon materials with desired features, such as high-specific surface area, variable porous framework, and controllable heteroatom-doping have been fabricated. Herein, this review summarized the preparation methods, morphologies, heteroatoms doping in the plant/animal-derived carbonaceous materials, and their application as electrode materials for secondary batteries and supercapacitors, and as electrode support for lithium-sulfur batteries. The challenges and prospects for the controllable synthesis and large-scale application of biomass-derived carbonaceous materials have also been outlooked.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Cell 19F NMR of Proteins: Recent Progress and Future Opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In vitro, 19F NMR methodology is preferably selected as a complementary and straightforward method for unveiling the conformations, dynamics, and interactions of biological molecules. Its effectiveness in vivo has seen continuous improvement, addressing challenges faced by conventional heteronuclear NMR experiments on structured proteins, such as severe line broadening, low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and background signals. Herein,  we summarize the distinctive advantages of 19F NMR, along with recent progress in sample preparation and applications within the realm of in&#8208;cell NMR. Additionally, we offer insights into the future directions and prospects of this methodology based on our understanding.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 1,1'&#8208;Bicarbazoles by Iron(III)&#8208; and Palladium(II)Catalyzed Oxidative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of diarylamines to 2,2&#697;&#8208;bis(arylamino)&#8208;1,1&#697;&#8208;biaryls and subsequent twofold palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization provide a convergent synthetic route to 1,1&#697;&#8208;bicarbazoles. Screening a range of different palladium(II) salts led to palladium(II) acetate, pivalate, and hexafluoroacetylacetonate as the most efficient catalysts. Remarkably, the twofold palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization can also be performed under argon. The mechanism for the oxidative cyclization under an inert gas presumably involves regeneration of the catalytically active palladium(II) species by oxidative addition of pivalic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Identification of decarbamoyloxySaxitoxins in Toxic Microalgae and their Reactions with the Oxygenase, SxtT, Reveal Saxitoxin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Saxitoxin (STX,&#160;1) is a representative compound of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) that are produced by marine dinoflagellates and freshwater cyanobacteria. Although several pathways have been proposed for the biosynthesis of STX, the order of ring and side chain hydroxylation, and formation of the tricyclic skeleton have not been well established. In this study, 12,12&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;decarbamoyloxySTX (dd&#8208;doSTX,&#160;2), the most reduced STX analogue having the tricyclic skeleton, and its analogues, 12&#946;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (12&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX,&#160;3), 12&#945;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;doSTX (12&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX,&#160;4), and doSTX (5), were synthesized, and these compounds were screened in the toxic microalgae using high&#8208;resolution LCMSMS. dd&#8208;doSTX (2) and 12&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;doSTX (3) were identified in the PSTs&#8208;producing dinoflagellates (Alexandrium catenella,&#160;A. pacificum, and/or&#160;Gymnodinium catenatum) and in the cyanobacterium&#160;Dolichospermum circinale&#160;(TA04). doSTX (5), previously isolated from the dinoflagellate&#160;G. catenatum, was also identified in&#160;D. circinale&#160;(TA04). Furthermore, the conversion of&#160;2&#160;to&#160;3, and&#160;4&#160;to&#160;5, by SxtT with VanB, a reported Rieske oxygenase and its redox partner in STX biosynthesis,&#160;was confirmed. These results support that&#160;2&#160;is a possible biosynthetic precursor of STX, and that ring and side&#8208;chain hydroxylations proceed after cyclization.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blue afterglow constitutes of one of the primary afterglow colors and can convert into other afterglow colors through energy transfer. The reported studies show the fabrication of blue afterglow emitters, but most of them are formed by room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence mechanism and require UVB lights as excitation source (these high&#8208;energy lights may damage organic systems). Here we report visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable blue TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials via delicate control of excited states in difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2bdk) systems. Tiny change of the substituents in BF2bdk system has been found to pose significant influence on excited state energy levels and consequently narrow the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy of the system. As a result, both forward and reverse intersystem crossing have been accelerated, leading to the emergence of BF2bdk&#8217;s TADF&#8208;type organic afterglow in rigid crystalline matrices. The resultant TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials exhibit emission lifetimes of several hundred milliseconds, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24.7%, and display temperature responsive and functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalized Polyamine Synthesis with Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyamines, such as putrescine and spermidine, are pivotal in various biological processes across living organisms. Despite their significance, structurally modified polyamines offer a less&#8208;explored avenue for discovering bioactive compounds. The limitation is attributed to the synthetic difficulty of accessing functionalized polyamines. In this study, we accomplished photoredox&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of polyamines to diversify their structure. The rapid functionalization allows attaching fluorophores to the target polyamine, facilitating the development of molecular probes for advancing chemical biology studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization and In Vitro Behavior of PEO Coated Mg Modified with Antibacterial Ag(I) and Cu(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of Mg&#8208;based biomaterials with a number of their advantageous properties are overshadowed by uncontrollable metal corrosion. Moreover, the use of implants goes alongside with the threat of pathogens&#8208;associated complications. In this study, PEO coated Mg biomaterial loaded with antibacterial Ag(I) and Cu(II) complexes is produced and tested to meet both appropriate protective characteristics as well as sufficient level of antibacterial activity. To achieve a suitable level of anticorrosion protection phosphate and fluoride&#8208;phosphate electrolytes are used in the PEO process. Investigation of the surface thickness and morphology done by means of cross&#8208;section analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) assay show precedence of the fluoride containing PEO coating and make it the material of choice for further modification with Ag(I) and Cu(II) complexes. The presence of the complexes on the PEO surface is confirmed by energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX). X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) are used to estimate the complexes&#8217; chemical state and depth of penetration in the coating surface. Based on the results of antibacterial assay, the modified coatings are found to be active against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.</dc:description>

Sharing bonds: This article reports a rare bis&#8208;silylene, [LSi)2&#8722;SiPh2, L=(PhC(NtBu)2] (1), in which a SiIV atom bridges two silylene atoms. Compound 1 contains an unusual SiII&#8722;SiIV&#8722;SiII bonding arrangement with SiII&#8722;SiIV bond lengths of 2.4212(8) and 2.4157(7)&#8197;&#197;. Treatment of 1 with Fe(CO)5 afforded a dinuclear Fe0 complex 2 with two unusually long Si&#8722;Si bonds (2.4515(8) and 2.4488(10)&#8197;&#197;). NBO and EDA&#8208;NOCV analyses reveal that the Si&#8722;Si bonds in 1 and 2 are of an electron&#8208;sharing nature.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a rare bis&#8208;silylene, 1, in which two SiIIatoms are bridged by a SiIV atom. Compound 1 contains an unusual SiII&#8722;SiIV&#8722;SiII bonding arrangement with SiII&#8722;SiIV bond distances of 2.4212(8) and 2.4157(7)&#8197;&#197;. Treatment of 1 with Fe(CO)5 afforded a dinuclear Fe0 complex 2 with two unusually long Si&#8722;Si bonds (2.4515(8) and 2.4488(10)&#8197;&#197;). We have also carried out a detailed computational study to understand the nature of the Si&#8722;Si bonds in these compounds. Natural bond orbital (NBO) and energy decomposition analysis&#8211;natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analyses reveal that the Si&#8722;Si bonds in 1 and 2 are of an electron&#8208;sharing nature.

         <title>Conformational Preferences at the Glycosidic Linkage of Saccharides in Solution as Deduced from NMR Experiments and MD Simulations: Comparison to Crystal Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of solvation on the preferred conformation of saccharides in solution and in crystals is unraveled by solution&#8208;state NMR and computational MD studies of solvated disaccharides. Crystal structures containing solvated glycan structures have glycosidic linkage conformations similar to those of the carbohydrate molecules in solution.







Abstract
Glycans are central to information content and regulation in biological systems. These carbohydrate molecules are active either as oligo&#8208; or polysaccharides, often in the form of glycoconjugates. The monosaccharide entities are joined by glycosidic linkages and stereochemical arrangements are of utmost importance in determining conformation and flexibility of saccharides. The conformational preferences and population distributions at the glycosidic torsion angles &#966; and &#968; have been investigated for O&#8208;methyl glycosides of three disaccharides where the substitution takes place at a secondary alcohol, viz., in &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;Fucp&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glcp&#8208;OMe, &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;Fucp&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Galp&#8208;OMe and &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Glcp&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Galp&#8208;OMe, corresponding to disaccharide structural elements present in bacterial polysaccharides. Stereochemical differences at or adjacent to the glycosidic linkage were explored by solution state NMR spectroscopy using one&#8208;dimensional 1H,1H&#8208;NOESY NMR experiments to obtain transglycosidic proton&#8208;proton distances and one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments to obtain 3JCH transglycosidic coupling constants related to torsion angles &#966; and &#968;. Computed effective proton&#8208;proton distances from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed excellent agreement to experimentally derived distances for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;linked disaccharides and revealed that for the bimodal distribution at the &#968; torsion angle for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked disaccharide experiment and simulation were at variance with each other, calling for further force field developments. The MD simulations disclosed a highly intricate inter&#8208;residue hydrogen bonding pattern for the &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked disaccharide, including a nonconventional hydrogen bond between H5&#8242; in the glucosyl residue and O3 in the galactosyl residue, supported by a large downfield 1H NMR chemical shift displacement compared to &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Glcp&#8208;OMe. Comparison of population distributions of the glycosidic torsion angles &#966; and &#968; in the disaccharide entities to those of corresponding crystal structures highlighted the potential importance of solvation on the preferred conformation.

         <title>Hexakispyrazolylethane: New Strategy for Stabilization of Hexaarylethane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane was synthesized by the oxidative dimerization of tris(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane as a stable analog of hexaphenylethane. Introduction of pyrazole groups allowed additional bridging between the two triarylmethyl moieties through three N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N bonds.







Abstract
Hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane was synthesized by the oxidative dimerization of tris(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis of hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane showed that the ethane C&#8722;C bond (1.623(4)&#8197;&#197;) is shorter than that in hexaphenylethane (1.67(3)&#8197;&#197;). In solution, hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane existed as a single species, contrastive that conventional hexaphenylethanes can keep the central C&#8722;C bond only by the aid of additional bridges between the two triarylmethyl units. Theoretical calculations indicated that the tris(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl radical, which is anticipated to be under equilibrium with hexakis(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane, is less stable than trityl radicals due to lack of delocalization of the radicals. Furthermore, introduction of pyrazole groups allowed additional bridging between the two triarylmethyl moieties through metal coordination to the adjacent N atoms: hexakis(4&#8208;trimethylsilylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethane exhibited unique coordination to three Ag atoms affording a hexaarylethane analog bearing three N&#8722;Ag&#8722;N bridges.

         <title>Carboranylphosphines: B9&#8208;Substituted Derivatives with Enhanced Reactivity for the Anchoring to Dendrimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several ortho&#8208;carboranes functionalized in the B9 position were prepared and grafted to phosphorus dendritic compounds. 1&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;phosphanyl&#8208;substituted carboranes were also synthesized for eventual applications in catalysis or the medicinal sector.







Abstract
Several ortho&#8208;carboranes bearing a phenoxy or a phenylamino group in the B9 position were prepared employing various protection and deprotection strategies. Following established protocols, dendritic compounds were synthesized from a hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene or thiophosphoryl chloride core, and possible anchoring options for the B9&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;carboranes were investigated experimentally and theoretically (DFT). Furthermore, 1&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;phosphanyl&#8208;substituted carborane derivatives were obtained. The resulting diethyl&#8208;, diisopropyl&#8208;, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;, diphenyl&#8208; or diethoxyphosphines bearing a tunable ortho&#8208;carborane moiety are intriguing ligands for future applications in homogeneous catalysis or the medicinal sector.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative Skeletal Editing of Indazoles by Donor Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient silver&#8208;catalyzed single&#8208;atomic skeletal editing technique that utilizing donor&#8208;type carbenes for efficient insertion into the N&#8722;N bond of indazoles is described. This method effectively simplifies the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinazoline by introducing monoaryl, diaryl, aryl or alkenyl groups onto this heterocyclic skeleton.







Abstract
Given the prevalence of heterocyclic scaffolds in drug&#8208;related molecules, converting these highly modular heterocyclic scaffolds into structural diversified and dearomatized analogs is an ideal strategy for improving their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we described an efficient method for silver carbene&#8208;mediated dearomative N&#8722;N bond cleavage leading to skeletal hopping between indazole and 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinazoline via a highly selective single&#8208;carbon insertion procedure. Using this methodology, a series of dihydroquinazoline analogues with diarylmethylene&#8208;substituted quaternary carbon centers were constructed with excellent yields and good functional group compatibility, which was further illustrated by the late&#8208;stage diversification of important pharmaceutically active ingredients. DFT calculations indicated that the silver catalyst not only induces the formation of the silver carbene, but also activates the diazahexatriene intermediate, which plays a crucial role in the formation of the C&#8722;N bond.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Protein Conjugation by a Multicomponent Ugi Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thorough methodology work on the Ugi multicomponent reaction applied to the conjugation of native proteins highlighted key reaction conditions and reagents for the development of a highly site&#8208;selective procedure.







Abstract
The chemical bioconjugation of proteins has seen tremendous applications in the past decades, with the booming of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates and their use in oncology. While genetic engineering has permitted to produce bespoke proteins featuring key (un&#8722;)natural amino acid residues poised for site&#8208;selective modifications, the conjugation of native proteins is riddled with selectivity issues. Chemoselective strategies are plentiful and enable the precise modification of virtually any residue with a reactive side&#8208;chain; site&#8208;selective methods are less common and usually most effective on small and medium&#8208;sized proteins. In this context, we studied the application of the Ugi multicomponent reaction for the site&#8208;selective conjugation of amine and carboxylate groups on proteins, and antibodies in particular. Through an in&#8208;depth mechanistic methodology work supported by peptide mapping studies, we managed to develop a set of conditions allowing the highly selective modification of antibodies bearing N&#8208;terminal glutamate and aspartate residues. We demonstrated that this strategy did not alter their affinity toward their target antigen and produced an antibody&#8208;drug conjugate with subnanomolar potency. Excitingly, we showed that the high site selectivity of our strategy was maintained on other protein formats, especially on anticalins, for which directed mutagenesis helped to highlight the key importance of a single lysine residue.

         <title>Gold&#8208;promoted biocompatible selenium arylation of small molecules, peptides and proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organometallic gold(III) compounds are introduced here as a valuable addition to the toolkit of metal&#8208;based systems apt at facilitating selenium arylation, with applications spanning from synthetic chemistry to selenoprotein modification. By combining multinuclear NMR, LC&#8211;MS and DFT we show that the compound [Au(bnpy)Cl2] enables the arylation of diselenides and selenols present in small molecules, peptides, and proteins via a redox&#8208;based mechanism.







Abstract
A low pKa (5.2), high polarizable volume (3.8&#8197;&#197;), and proneness to oxidation under ambient conditions make selenocysteine (Sec, U) a unique, natural reactive handle present in most organisms across all domains of life. Sec modification still has untapped potential for site&#8208;selective protein modification and probing. Herein we demonstrate the use of a cyclometalated gold(III) compound, [Au(bnpy)Cl2], in the arylation of diselenides of biological significance, with a scope covering small molecule models, peptides, and proteins using a combination of multinuclear NMR (including 77Se&#8201;NMR), and LC&#8211;MS. Diphenyl diselenide (Ph&#8722;Se)2 and selenocystine, (Sec)2, were used for reaction optimization. This approach allowed us to demonstrate that an excess of diselenide (Au/Se&#8722;Se) and an increasing water percentage in the reaction media enhance both the conversion and kinetics of the C&#8722;Se coupling reaction, a combination that makes the reaction biocompatible. The C&#8722;Se coupling reaction was also shown to happen for the diselenide analogue of the cyclic peptide vasopressin ((Se&#8722;Se)&#8208;AVP), and the Bos taurus glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) enzyme in ammonium acetate (2&#8197;mM, pH=7.0). The reaction mechanism, studied by DFT revealed a redox&#8208;based mechanism where the C&#8722;Se coupling is enabled by the reductive elimination of the cyclometalated Au(III) species into Au(I).

Diphenyl diselenide (Ph&#8722;Se)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and selenocystine, (Sec)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, were used for reaction optimization. This approach allowed us to demonstrate that an excess of diselenide (Au/Se&#8722;Se) and an increasing water percentage in the reaction media enhance both the conversion and kinetics of the C&#8722;Se coupling reaction, a combination that makes the reaction biocompatible. The C&#8722;Se coupling reaction was also shown to happen for the diselenide analogue of the cyclic peptide vasopressin ((Se&#8722;Se)-AVP), and the &lt;i&gt;Bos taurus&lt;/i&gt; glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) enzyme in ammonium acetate (2&#8197;mM, pH=7.0). The reaction mechanism, studied by DFT revealed a redox-based mechanism where the C&#8722;Se coupling is enabled by the reductive elimination of the cyclometalated Au(III) species into Au(I).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Triflate's bigger brother: The unprecedented tribrate anion, [Br3CSO3]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tribromomethansulfonate anion (&#8220;tribrate&#8221;), [Br3CSO3]&#8722;, has been prepared for the first time. The anion is, up to now, the biggest brother of the well&#8208;known triflate anion. Key step of the synthesis is the bromination of phenyl&#8208;methanesulfonate by KOBr. The new anion could be investigated in the solid state for the example of K[Br3CSO3](H2O).







Abstract
The synthesis of the unprecedented [Br3CSO3]&#8722; anion starts with the bromination of phenylmethanesulfonate, C6H5OSO2CH3, with KOBr leading to C6H5OSO2CBr3. The formation of the [CBr3] moiety has been proved, also by an X&#8208;ray structure determination of the compound (triclinic, P&#8208;1, a=685.9(2), b=698.1(2), c=1190.2(3)&#8197;pm, &#945;=93.99(1)&#176;, &#946;=97.42(1)&#176;, &#947;=94.45(1)&#176;). The ester C6H5OSO2CBr3 can be split under basic conditions. The resulting acid provides access to the yet unknown tribromomethanesulfates (&#8220;tribrates&#8221;). K[Br3CSO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, the first tribrate known so far has been characterized comprehensively, including an X&#8208;ray structure determination (monoclinic, C2/c, a=2267.1(2), b=1282.25(8), c=2618.2(2)&#8197;pm, &#946;=111.266(2)&#176;), vibrational spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Moreover, the thermal analysis shows that, after loss of the crystal water, the tribrate decomposes between 530 and 630&#8197;K.

         <title>Fluorogenic Rhodamine Probes with Pyrrole Substitution Enables STED and Lifetime Imaging of Lysosomes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrole substitution produced fluorogenic rhodamine probes with high brightness, large Stokes shift, red&#8208;shifted fluorescence emission and enhanced environmental sensitivity. Good cell permeability, low toxicity and favorable turn on fluorescence response to low polarity, high viscosity as well as acidity facilitate wash&#8208;free high contrast STED and lifetime imaging of lysosomes in live cells.







Abstract
Fluorogenic dyes with high brightness, large turn&#8208;on ratios, excellent photostability, favorable specificity, low cytotoxicity, and high membrane permeability are essential for high&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging in live cells. In this study, we endowed these desirable properties to a rhodamine derivative by simply replacing the N, N&#8208;diethyl group with a pyrrole substituent. The resulting dye, Rh&#8208;NH, exhibited doubled Stokes shifts (54&#8197;nm) and a red&#8208;shift of more than 50&#8197;nm in fluorescence spectra compared to Rhodamine B. Rh&#8208;NH preferentially exists in a non&#8208;emissive but highly permeable spirolactone form. Upon binding to lysosomes, the collective effects of low pH, low polarity, and high viscosity endow Rh&#8208;NH with significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on, making it a suitable candidate for wash&#8208;free, high&#8208;contrast lysosome tracking. Consequently, Rh&#8208;NH enabled us to successfully explore stimulated emission depletion (STED) super&#8208;resolution imaging of lysosome dynamics, as well as fluorescence lifetime imaging of lysosomes in live cells.

A versatile method for the automated synthesis of composites containing DNA&#8208;oligonucleotides and boron cluster scaffolds and their assembly into functional nanoparticles is described. The torus&#8208;like nanostructures carry antisense oligonucleotides that target two different oncogenes and act as dual&#8208;action agents silencing two oncogenes EGFR and c&#8208;Myc simultaneously. The system can be readily adapted to target other biological components.







Abstract
A versatile method for the automated synthesis of composites containing DNA&#8208;oligonucleotides and boron cluster scaffolds and their assembly into functional nanoparticles is described. The obtained, torus&#8208;like nanoparticles carry antisense oligonucleotides that target two different oncogenes simultaneously. The nanoparticles exhibited notable silencing efficiency in&#8197;vitro in a pancreatic carcinoma cell line PANC&#8208;1 toward EGFR and c&#8208;Myc genes at the mRNA level, and a significant efficiency at the protein level. The proposed approach may be an attractive alternative to methods currently used, including one therapeutic nucleic acid, one genetic target, or the use of cocktails of therapeutic nucleic acids.

         <title>Enhancing the Potential of Fused Heterocycle&#8208;Based Triarylhydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of triarylhydrazone photoswitches has been designed, following an idea to control the strength of a hydrogen bond connecting the photo&#8208;active hydrazone part with a heteroaryl substituent. Introducing a benzothiazole moiety results in high thermal stability, absorption above 365&#8197;nm, and satisfactory photoconversion rates. High&#8208;quality calculations and advanced ultrafast spectroscopy allowed the nature of the electronic transitions to be resolved and the photoisomerization mechanism to be elucidated. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;M. Grabarz, M. Cig&#225;&#328; and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303509).

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Study to Develop Peptide Amphiphiles as Species&#8208;Specific Antimicrobials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial peptide amphiphiles nanostructures were studied regarding the supramolecular structure&#8208;activity and the key structure contributors for activity. For Staphylococcus aureus the zeta potential was more important while Gram&#8208;negative bacteria were more influenced by LogP. Mechanism of action and an in&#8197;vivo study was also performed. We showed these nanostructures can be an intriguing platform for the development of novel nanoantibacterials.







Abstract
Antimicrobial peptide amphiphiles (PAs) are a promising class of molecules that can disrupt the bacterial membrane or act as drug nanocarriers. In this study, we prepared 33&#8197;PAs to establish supramolecular structure&#8208;activity relationships. We studied the morphology and activity of the nanostructures against different Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains (such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii). Next, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the key contributors to activity. We found that for S. aureus, the zeta potential was the major contributor to the activity while Gram&#8208;negative bacteria were more influenced by the partition coefficient (LogP) with the following order P. aeruginosa&gt;E. coli&gt;A. baumannii. We also performed a study of the mechanism of action of selected PAs on the bacterial membrane assessing the membrane permeability and depolarization, changes in zeta potential and overall integrity. We studied the toxicity of the nanostructures against mammalian cells. Finally, we performed an in&#8197;vivo study using the wax moth larvae to determine the therapeutic efficacy of the active PAs. This study shows cationic PA nanostructures can be an intriguing platform for the development of nanoantibacterials.

&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial peptide amphiphiles nanostructures were studied regarding the supramolecular structure-activity and the key structure contributors for activity. For &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; the zeta potential was more important while Gram-negative bacteria were more influenced by LogP. Mechanism of action and an &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; study was also performed. We showed these nanostructures can be an intriguing platform for the development of novel nanoantibacterials.

         <title>Plasma Technology for Advanced Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this perspective paper, we discuss the working principle of plasma and its applied research on battery materials based on plasma conversion, deposition, etching, doping, etc. Furthermore, the new application directions of multiphase plasma associated with solid, liquid and gas sources are proposed and their application examples for batteries are given. Finally, the current challenges and future development trends of plasma technology are briefly summarized to provide guidance for the next generation of energy technologies.







Abstract
&#8220;Carbon Peak and Carbon Neutrality&#8221; is an important strategic goal for the sustainable development of human society. Typically, a key means to achieve these goals is through electrochemical energy storage technologies and materials. In this context, the rational synthesis and modification of battery materials through new technologies play critical roles. Plasma technology, based on the principles of free radical chemistry, is considered a promising alternative for the construction of advanced battery materials due to its inherent advantages such as superior versatility, high reactivity, excellent conformal properties, low consumption and environmental friendliness. In this perspective paper, we discuss the working principle of plasma and its applied research on battery materials based on plasma conversion, deposition, etching, doping, etc. Furthermore, the new application directions of multiphase plasma associated with solid, liquid and gas sources are proposed and their application examples for batteries (e.&#8201;g. lithium&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, zinc&#8208;air batteries) are given. Finally, the current challenges and future development trends of plasma technology are briefly summarized to provide guidance for the next generation of energy technologies.

         <title>A Torquoselective Thermal 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization Approach to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexadienes via Solvent&#8208;Aided Proton Transfer: Experimental and Theoretical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,4&#8208;Cyclohexadienes can be directly synthesized by heating (2E,4E,6E)&#8208;hexatrienes in a mixture of toluene/MeOH or EtOH (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) solvents at 90&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C. This is done through a torquoselective disrotatory 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring closure followed by a polar protic solvent&#8208;assisted proton&#8208;transfer process.







Abstract
The thermal 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of hexatriene typically delivers 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,3&#8208;CHD). However, there is only limited success in directly synthesizing 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,4&#8208;CHD) using such an approach, probably due to the difficulty in realizing thermally&#8208;forbidden 1,3&#8208;hydride shift after electrocyclic ring closure. The present study shows that by heating (2E,4E,6E)&#8208;hexatrienes bearing ester or ketone substituents at the C1&#8208;position in a mixture of toluene/MeOH or EtOH (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) solvents at 90&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C, 1,4&#8208;CHDs can be selectively synthesized. This is achieved through a torquoselective disrotatory 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring closure followed by a proton&#8208;transfer process. The success of this method depends on the polar protic solvent&#8208;assisted intramolecular proton transfer from 1,3&#8208;CHD to 1,4&#8208;CHD, which has been confirmed by deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments. There are no reports to date for such a solvent&#8208;assisted isomerization. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have suggested that forming 1,3&#8208;CHD and subsequent isomerization is a thermodynamically feasible process, regardless of the functional groups involved. Two possible successive polar solvent&#8208;assisted proton&#8208;transfer pathways have been identified for isomerization.

         <title>Impact of Endcap Molecules on Temperature&#8208;Responsive Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Oligomers in Structural Color Stability and Hypsochromic Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers are an interesting class of temperature responsive structurally, colored materials. However, the role of endcap molecules in these oligomers is rather unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate the role of endcap molecules on structural color stability and hypsochromic shift in temperature&#8208;responsive cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. First, new liquid crystal monoacrylate endcap molecules are synthesized, which are then used to synthesize various cholesteric liquid crystal oligomers. In addition, cholesteric oligomers using commercial monoacrylate endcap molecules are also prepared. It is found that the molecular weight and the polydispersity of the oligomers can be tuned by the endcapping molecules. The oligomers are used to produce reflective, structurally colored coatings. It was found that the coatings using the commercial monoacrylate their color and crystallize over time, most likely due to the presence of crystalline dimers. The coatings containing the newly synthesized monoacrylate endcap molecules did not exhibit this crystallization, resulting in structurally colored coatings that remained stable over time. These latter coatings exhibited temperature responsive hypochromic behavior, which makes them interesting for advanced optical applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical action plots are a powerful tool for mapping photochemical reaction outcomes wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength. Typically, they map either the depletion of a reactant or the formation of a specific product as a function of wavelength. Herein, we exploit action plots to simultaneously map the formation of several photochemical products from a single chromophore. We demonstrate that the wavelength&#8208;resolved mapping of two reaction products formed during the irradiation of a chalcone species not only shows wavelength dependence &#8211; exhibiting the typical strong red&#8208;shift of the photochemical reactivity compared to the absorbance spectrum of the chromophore &#8211; but also a strong wavelength selectivity with remarkably different product distributions resulting from different irradiation wavelengths.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and functionalities of FeSn12&#160;superatom prepared by single atom introduction with a dendrimer template</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superatoms are promising as new building block materials that can be designed by precise controlling of the constituent atoms. Stannaspherene (Sn122&#8211;) is a rigid cage&#8208;like cluster with icosahedral symmetry, for which one&#8208;atom encapsulation was theoretically expected and detected in the gas phase. Here, a single&#8208;atom introduction method into stannaspherene using a dendrimer template with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) protection is demonstrated. This advanced solution&#8208;phase synthesis allows not only the selective doping of one atom into the cluster cage, but also enable further detail characterization of optical and magnetic properties that were not possible in the gas&#8208;phase synthesis. In other words, this liquid&#8208;phase synthesis method has enabled the adaptation of detailed analytical methods. In this study, FeSn12 was synthesized and characterized, revealing that a single Fe atom introduction in the Sn122&#8211; cage result in the appearance of near&#8208;infrared emission and enhancement in the magnetism.</dc:description>

         <title>Transport Properties with Multiple Functions of Fe@C60&#8208;GNR Single Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Encouraged by the successful fabrication of C60&#8208;GNR (GNR = graphene nanoribbon) single&#8208;molecule transistors in experiments, four Fe&#8208;containing derived double&#8208;layered devices of Fe@C60&#8208;GNR&#160;are designed by employing different electrode linkages and their transport properties are investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) and nonequilibrium Green&#8217;s function (NEGF) methods. Regardless of electrode connection, all devices give rise to a smaller negative differential resistance (NDR) peak at V=0.2 and a higher peak at 1.2 V, suggesting their stable maneuverability as molecular devices and good candidates for developing on(off)&#8208;off(on)&#8208;on(off) current switches. The macroscopic NDR performance depends on the delocalization character and crossing mechanism of the frontier orbitals. The peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios (Rmax) range from 454 to 2737, determined by the electrode linkage. Such a large Rmax&#8208;value is necessary for developing dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM) cells. Encapsulating the Fe atom inside C60 not improves the conductivity but&#160;introduces spin&#8208;polarized transport property. The spin&#8208;filtering efficiency (SFE) of almost all devices oscillates up and down in response to the bias voltage, indicating the possibility of designing on(off)&#8208;off(on)&#8208;on(off) spin switches and up&#8208;down spin switches. All these fascinating properties provide an important clue for designing similar molecular devices with multiple functions by trapping magnetic transition metal atoms inside fullerenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress of the Cathode Material Design for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic compounds with the advantages of renewable resources, environmental friendliness, and diverse structures have attracted tremendous interests on aqueous energy storage field. This review focuses on the energy storage mechanism of the aqueous Zn&#8208;organic battery and the recent advances of various organic cathodes including small&#8208;molecule compounds and polymers. Especially novel organic polymer materials, including conjugated polymers (CPs), conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are reviewed in detail. In addition, we also discuss the remaining challenges and future development of the organic cathode in aqueous ZOBs.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have emerged as the most promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their inherent safety, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Simultaneously, the utilization of organic electrode materials with renewable resources, environmental compatibility, and diverse structures has sparked a surge in research and development of aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries (ZOBs). A comprehensive review is warranted to systematically present recent advancements in design principles, synthesis techniques, energy storage mechanisms, and zinc&#8208;ion storage performance of organic cathodes. In this review article, we comprehensively summarize the energy storage mechanisms employed by aqueous ZOBs. Subsequently, we categorize organic cathode materials into small&#8208;molecule compounds and high&#8208;molecular polymers respectively. Novel polymer materials such as conjugated polymers (CPs), conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are highlighted with an overview of molecular design strategies and structural optimization based on organic cathode materials aimed at enhancing the performance of aqueous ZOBs. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by aqueous ZOBs along with future prospects to offer insights into their practical applications.

         <title>Unmasking the Electrochemical Stability of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Monolayers on Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monolayers reveals that NHCs are a stable architecture for electrode modification from &#8722;1&#8197;V to 0.5&#8197;V and for over 40&#8197;hours of continuous voltammetric cycling. However, the NHCs undergo degradation at extreme voltages and after extensive cycling, which raises critical questions about their viability in electrochemical applications.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monolayers are transforming electrocatalysis and biosensor design via their increased performance and stability. Despite their increasing use in electrochemical systems, the integrity of the NHC monolayer during voltage perturbations remains largely unknown. Herein, we deploy surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to measure the stability of two model NHCs on gold in ambient conditions as a function of applied potential and under continuous voltammetric interrogation. Our results illustrate that NHC monolayers exhibit electrochemical stability over a wide voltage window (&#8722;1&#8197;V to 0.5&#8197;V vs Ag|AgCl), but they are found to degrade at strongly reducing (&lt; &#8722;1&#8197;V) or oxidizing (&gt;0.5&#8197;V) potentials. We also address NHC monolayer stability under continuous voltammetric interrogation between 0.2&#8197;V and &#8722;0.5&#8197;V, a commonly used voltage window for sensing, showing they are stable for up to 43&#8197;hours. However, we additionally find that modifications of the backbone NHC structure can lead to significantly shorter operational lifetimes. While these results highlight the potential of NHC architectures for electrode functionalization, they also reveal potential pitfalls that have not been fully appreciated in electrochemical applications of NHCs.

         <title>Atroposelective Chan&#8211;Evans&#8211;Lam Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first and long elusive atroposelective Chan&#8211;Evans&#8211;Lam C&#8722;N coupling is herein described. This strategy should find important applications for the enantioselective synthesis of bioactive compounds containing hindered carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds.







Abstract
The synthetic control of atropoisomerism along C&#8722;N bonds is a major challenge, and methods that allow C&#8722;N atroposelective bond formation are rare. This is a problem because each atropoisomer can feature starkly differentiated biological properties. Yet, among the three most practical and applicable classical amination methods available: 1) the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8211;Goldberg reaction, 2) the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig reaction, and 3) the Cu&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8211;Evans&#8211;Lam reaction, none has truly been rendered atroposelective at the newly formed C&#8722;N bond. The first ever Chan&#8211;Evans&#8211;Lam atroposelective amination is herein described with a simple copper catalyst and newly designed PyrOx chiral ligand. This method should find important applications in asymmetric synthesis, in particular for medicinal chemistry.

         <title>An Interface&#8208;cascading Silicon Photoanode with Strengthened Built&#8208;in Electric Field and Enriched Surface Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With oxygen vacancy enriched NiFeOOH overlayer introduced, thermodynamically reducing the energy barrier for OER, the obtained n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode exhibits large band bending at the introduced cascading interfaces for promoted charge transfer. This study paves an alternative way to design multilayer structured n&#8208;Si based photoanodes by engineering interfacial band structures and surface defects for efficient PEC water splitting.







Abstract
To promote interfacial charge transfer process and accelerate surface water oxidation reaction kinetics for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting over n&#8208;type Silicon (n&#8208;Si) based photoanodes, herein, starting with surface stabilized n&#8208;Si/CoOx, a NiOx/NiFeOOH composite overlayer was coated by atomic layer deposition and spray coating to fabricate the multilayer structured n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode. Encouragingly, the obtained n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode exhibits much increased PEC activity for water splitting, with onset potential cathodically shifted to ~0.96&#8197;V vs. RHE and photocurrent density increased to 22.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V vs. RHE for OER, as compared to n&#8208;Si/CoOx, even significantly surpassing the counterpart n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/FeOOH and n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiOOH photoanodes. Photophysical and electrochemical characterizations evidence that the deposited CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH composite overlayer would create large band bending and strong built&#8208;in electric field at the introduced cascading interfaces, thereby producing a large photovoltage of 650&#8197;mV to efficiently accelerate charge transfer from the n&#8208;Si substrate to the electrolyte for water oxidation. Furthermore, the surface oxygen vacancy enriched NiFeOOH overlayer could effectively catalyze the water oxidation reaction by thermodynamically reducing the energy barrier of rate determining step for OER.

         <title>Photoinduced Dual C&#8722;F Bond Activation of Hexafluorobenzene Mediated by Boron Atom</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;ablated boron atom reaction with hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) has been performed in neon and argon matrices. Besides the single C&#8722;F bond activation species fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical, a 2&#8208;difluoroboryl&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl radical is also generated via dual C&#8722;F bond activation of hexafluorobenzene on subsequent irradiation.







Abstract
The reaction of laser&#8208;ablated boron atoms with hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) was investigated in neon and argon matrices, and the products are identified by matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The reaction is triggered by a boron atom insertion into one C&#8722;F bond of hexafluorobenzene on annealing, forming a fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical (A). UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation of fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical causes generation of a 2&#8208;difluoroboryl&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl radical (B) via a second C&#8722;F bond activation. A perfluoroborepinyl radical (C) is also observed upon deposition and under UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation. This finding reveals the new example of a dual C&#8722;F bond activation of hexafluorobenzene mediated by a nonmetal and provides a possible route for synthesis of new perfluorinated organo&#8208;boron compounds.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ervaoffine J and K</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unified total syntheses of ervaoffine J and ervaoffine K were achieved from a common intermediate. The synthesis of ervaoffine J featured an aerobic, Winterfeldt oxidation and proceeded in 8&#8197;steps and 14&#8201;% overall yield. A von Braun&#8208;like C&#8722;N bond cleavage enabled access to ervaoffine K in 10&#8197;steps and 10&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the total synthesis of ervaoffine J &amp; K from a central intermediate. Ervaoffine J was synthesized in eight steps in 14&#8201;% yield. Our strategy features an aerobic Winterfeldt oxidation to introduce the 4&#8208;quinolone moiety. Ervaoffine K was produced in ten steps and 10&#8201;% yield. The synthesis leveraged (bromodifluoromethyl)&#8208;trimethylsilane to induce a regioselective von Braun&#8208;type C&#8722;N bond fragmentation. This C&#8722;N bond cleavage unveiled the tetrasubstituted all&#8208;syn cyclohexane core of ervaoffine K and enabled the completion of its synthesis.

         <title>Osme Bond: Geometric and Energetic Features in the Adducts between OsO4 and Lewis Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adducts between OsO4 and Lewis bases exert a role in important oxidation processes such as epoxidation and dihydroxylation. It has been shown that the attractive interaction driving the formation of these adducts is a &#160;&#963;&#8208;hole bond involving the metal as the electrophilic species; the term Osme Bond (OmB) was proposed for designating it. Here some new adducts between OsO4 and various bases have been characterized through single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and computational studies (density functional theory, DFT), confirming the existence of a robust correlation between &#963;&#8208;hole interaction energy and deformation of the tetrahedral geometry of OsO4. Also some adducts formed by RuO4 with nucleophiles were investigated computationally.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Geometry Regulated J&#8208; and H&#8208;Type Aggregates of Photoswitchable Organogelator: Phase&#8208;Selective Thixotropic Gelation and Oil Spill Recovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate supramolecular polymerization and formation of 1D nanofiber of azobenzene based organogelator (AZO&#8208;4) in cyclic hydrocarbon solvents (toluene and methylcyclohexane). The AZO&#8208;4 exhibits J&#8208; and H&#8208;type aggregates in toluene: MCH (9:1) and MCH: toluene (9:1) respectively. The type of aggregate was governed by the geometry of the solvents used in the self&#8208;assembly process. The J&#8208;type aggregates with high thermal stability in toluene is due to the enhanced interaction of AZO&#8208;4 &#960;&#8208; surface with the toluene &#960;&#8208;surface, whereas H&#8208;aggregate with moderate thermal stability in MCH was due to the interruption of the cyclic hydrocarbon in van der Waals interactions of peripheral chains of AZO&#8208;4 molecule. The light induced reversible photoisomerization is observed for both J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates. The macroscopic property revealed spontaneous and strong gelation in toluene preferably due to the strong interactions of the AZO&#8208;4 nanofibers with the toluene solvent molecules compared to the MCH. The rheological measurements revealed thixotropic nature of the gels by step&#8208;strain experiments at room temperature. The thermodynamic parameter of gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition was determined for all the gels to get more insight into the gelation property. Furthermore, the phase selective gelation property was extended to the oil spill recovery application using diesel/water and petrol/water mixture.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanoplatform Based on Pillar[5]arene Nanovalves for Combined Drug Delivery and Enhanced Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modern nanodrug delivery technologies offer new approaches in the fight against cancer. However, due to the heterogeneity of tumors and side effects of anticancer drugs, monotherapies are less effective. Herein, we report a novel pH and light dual&#8208;responsive nanodrug delivery platform. The platform was formed by sulfonate&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles loaded with the anticancer drugs doxorubicin (DOX) and glucose oxidase (GOx) and then covered by water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene as nanovalves. The nanovalve formed by the host&#8208;guest interaction between pillar[5]arene and the sulfonic acid groups grafted onto the gold nanoparticles increased the drug loading capacity of the nanoplatform and enabled sustained release of the drug in a simulated weakly acidic tumor environment. The released GOx can consume intracellular glucose, namely, starvation therapy, while the generated hydrogen peroxide can further kill tumor cells, complementing DOX chemotherapy. Gold nanoparticles have good photothermal conversion ability and can enhance the drugs release rate under specific wavelengths of light irradiation. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that this novel nanodrug delivery platform has good biocompatibility and better therapeutic efficacy relative to monotherapy. This study successfully developed a combined chemo/starvation therapy strategy with good tumor suppression, providing a new approach for cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Activation at NiII&#8208;CO22&#8211; Moieties through Lewis Acid Interactions in the Second Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel complexes with a two&#8208;electron reduced CO2 ligand (CO22&#8211;, &#8220;carbonite&#8221;) are investigated with regard to the influence alkali metal (AM) ions have as Lewis acids on the activation of the CO2 entity. For this purpose complexes with NiII(CO2)AM (AM = Li, Na, K) moieties were accessed via deprotonation of nickel&#8208;formate compounds with (AM)N(iPr)2. It was found that not only the nature of the AM ions in vicinity to CO2 affect the activation, but also the number and the ligation of a given AM. To this end the effects of added (AM)N(R)2, THF, open and closed polyethers as well as cryptands were systematically studied. In 14 cases the products were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction and correlations with the situation in solution were made. The more the AM ions get detached from the carbonite ligand, the lower is the degree of aggregation. At the same time the extent of CO2 activation is decreased as indicated by the structural and spectroscopic analysis and reactivity studies. Accompanying DFT studies showed that the coordinating AM Lewis acidic fragment withdraws only a small amount of charge from the carbonite moiety, but it also affects the internal charge equilibration between the LtBuNi and carbonite moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>BACTERIA AT WORK &#8208; EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL STUDIES REVEAL THE CATALYTIC MECHANISM OF ECTOINE SYNTHASE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ectoine synthase (EctC) catalyses the ultimate step of ectoine biosynthesis, a kosmotropic compound produced as compatible solute by many bacteria and some archaea or eukaryotes. EctC is an Fe2+&#8208;dependent homodimeric cytoplasmic protein. Using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations and QM/MM calculations, we determined the most likely coordination number and geometry of the Fe2+ ion and proposed a mechanism of the EctC&#8208;catalysed reaction. Most notably, we show that apart from the three amino acids binding to the iron ion (Glu&#8208;57, Tyr&#8208;84 and His&#8208;92), one water molecule and one hydroxide ion are required as additional ligands for the reaction to occur. They fill the first coordination sphere of the Fe2+&#8208;cofactor and act as critical proton donors and acceptors during the cyclization reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A convergent synthesis of the dodecasaccharide scaffold of axinelloside A was achieved through Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed [6+6] glycosylation. The initially devised [3+1+2] assembly of the nonreducing hexasaccharide fragment was low&#8208;yielding, whereas a convergent [3+3] glycosylation under Au(I) catalysis was proven feasible, allowing for a semi&#8208;gram scale preparation of the wanted hexasaccharide.&#160;The requisite 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic bonds were forged in a highly stereoselective fashion by virtue of remote acetyl group participation, and judicious manipulation of protecting groups. The synthetic dodecasaccharide has been properly protected for the downstream elaboration toward its natural form.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;quality inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ISE) is essential for achieving both high energy density and enhanced safety in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). A well&#8208;functioning ISE/Li interface plays a pivotal role in attaining high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs. Poor interface contact and stability can lead to the deterioration of ASSLMB performance. Hence, various interface modification methods are employed to enhance the ISE/Li interface.







Abstract
The increasing demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and high&#8208;safety energy storage devices has sparked a growing interest in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). A high&#8208;quality inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte (ISE) is a fundamental requirement for ASSLMBs, and an effective ISE/Li interface is a key factor in attaining high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs. In this Concept, we initially summarize the challenges encountered by ISE/Li interfaces and delineate four commonly employed strategies for modifying the ISE/Li interface. Then, we explore the merits and drawbacks of coatings utilized as ISE/Li interfacial phases. We also delve into the commonly employed thermal bonding and innovative cold bonding methods utilized for in&#8197;situ interface preparation. Lastly, we spotlight future directions for enhancing the functionality of ISE/Li interfaces and achieving high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs.

         <title>Unexpected Reduction of a Coordinated Diazapyridinophane Ligand Bound to Chromium(III) Ion Leading to Delocalization of the Unpaired Electron across Two Isolated Pyridine Units</title>

Pyridine moieties, which are electronically isolated from each other by saturated atom chains, can be potentially redox&#8208;active in complexes. Thus, structural and spectroscopic methods in combination with theoretical calculations provide unequivocal evidence that the coordinated tetraazamacrocyclic ligand L&#8208;N4Me2 in the stable neutral bis(acetato)chromium complex indeed contains anionic pyridine radical units coordinated to a chromium(III) ion.







Abstract
In the tetraazamacrocyclic ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diaza&#8208;[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane (L&#8208;N4Me2), the two pyridine units are separated from each other by sp3&#8208;hybridized triatomic bridges. Such electronically isolated pyridine moieties are considerably less prone to reductions than di&#8208; or triimines. A detailed structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic investigation of the complexes [Cr(L&#8208;N4Me2)(OAc)2] and [Cr(L&#8208;N4Me2)(OAc)2](PF6), in combination with theoretical calculations, reveals that the reduced complex must be described as a chromium(III) ion coordinated to the anionic radical ligand (L&#8208;N4Me2)&#8901;&#8722; rather than a low&#8208;spin chromium(II) ion bound to closed&#8208;shell ligands. Thus, it is, to the best of our knowledge, only the second example of a stable and structurally characterized metal complex containing a reduced isolated pyridine unit. The stability is attributed to the delocalization of the unpaired electron across the two pyridine units, mediated by their interaction to the metal ion.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Highly Crystalline 1T&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;LixMoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline LixMoS2 (x=1, 1.333) was synthesized through a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis. With this crystalline product, it was possible for the first time to elucidate the crystal structure of LiMoS2 by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The arrangement of Mo atoms in the b&#8208;c plane confirms a predicted Peierls distortion.







Abstract
LixMoS2 is not only a lithium battery material, but is also an important precursor for the synthesis of MoS2 nanomaterials. Current syntheses of MoS2, such as in n&#8208;butyllithium/LiBH4 or electrochemically, are not satisfying in terms of defined stoichiometry and crystallinity, so an accurate experimental crystal structure determination of this important and widely used material has been long awaited. A high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis yielded highly crystalline 1T&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;LixMoS2 (x=1, 1.333). 1T&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;LiMoS2 crystallizes in the space group P
 with a=6.2482(3)&#8197;&#197;, b=6.6336(3)&#8197;&#197;, c=6.7480(3)&#8197;&#197;, &#945;=119.321(2)&#176;, &#946;=90.010(2)&#176; and &#947;=90.077(2)&#176;. The arrangement of Mo atoms within the b&#8208;c&#8208;plane confirmed a predicted Peierls distortion. A similar atom distribution pattern to that of Mo is also observed for the lithium atoms. Calculation of bond valence site energies gave an activation barrier of 1.244&#8197;eV for 2D lithium&#8208;ion migration. For x=1.333, a phase&#8208;pure synthesis was achieved.

         <title>Enhanced Hydroxyl Adsorption in Ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 In&#8208;Plane Heterostructures for Efficient Alkaline Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple topotactic transformation strategy is presented to construct ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures as a desired platform for tailoring the d band centers and further electrocatalytic performance of catalysts. Both the theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterointerface is more active toward alkaline methanol oxidation, which may hold great promise in the field of electrocatalysis.







Abstract
The exploration of advanced nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) holds immense promise for value&#8208;added organic products coupled with hydrogen production, but still remain challenging. Herein, we construct ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures to promote the alkaline MOR process. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures enable a favorable upshift of the d&#8208;band center and enhanced adsorption of hydroxyl species, leading to accelerated generation of active NiO(OH)ads species. Furthermore, ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures endow the catalyst with good charge transfer ability and adsorption behavior of methanol molecules onto catalytic sites, contributing to the improvement of alkaline MOR kinetics. As a result, ultrathin NiO/Cr2O3 in&#8208;plane heterostructures exhibit a remarkable MOR activity with a high current density of 221&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.6&#8197;V vs Ag/AgCl, which is 7.1&#8208;fold larger than that of pure NiO nanosheets and comparable with other highly active catalysts reported so far. This work provides an effectual strategy to optimize the activity of nickel&#8208;based catalysts and highlights the dominate efficacy of ultrathin in&#8208;plane heterostructures in alkaline MOR.

Extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) with fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;i]anthracene cores were prepared and their redox and optical properties studied in comparison to the known extended TTF with an indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene core. The dications of these compounds were found to be singlet states that may correspond to closed shell quinoid structures or open shell singlet diradical structures &#8208; for the diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;i]anthracene core, these structures are isoenergetic. The various charge states were differentiated by unique UV/Vis/NIR absorptions.







Abstract
In one&#8208;dimensional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings fused together, one key question is whether the structures possess a quinoidal or aromatic diradical character. Here, we generate such PAHs by reversible oxidation of PAH&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs). Extended TTFs were thus prepared and studied for their geometrical properties (crystallography), redox properties, and UV/Vis/NIR/EPR characteristics as a function of charge state. The EPR measurements of radical cations showed unique features for each PAH&#8208;TTF. The dications, formally composed of fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;i]anthracene cores, were experimentally found to exhibit singlet ground states. For the latter, calculations reveal the closed shell, quinoid singlet state to be isoenergetic with the open shell singlet diradical. Each charge state exhibited unique optical properties with radical cations absorbing strongly in the NIR region with signatures from &#960;&#8208;dimers for the large core. The experimental results were paralleled and supported by detailed computations, including spin density distribution calculations, EPR simulations, and nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) xy scans.

The dications, formally composed of fluoreno[3,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]fluorene and diindeno[1,2-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;:1&#8242;,2&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;]anthracene cores, were experimentally found to exhibit singlet ground states. For the latter, calculations reveal the closed shell, quinoid singlet state to be isoenergetic with the open shell singlet diradical. Each charge state exhibited unique optical properties with radical cations absorbing strongly in the NIR region with signatures from &#960;-dimers for the large core. The experimental results were paralleled and supported by detailed computations, including spin density distribution calculations, EPR simulations, and nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) &lt;i&gt;xy&lt;/i&gt; scans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silicon Chalcogenide Cage Compounds: New Structures Derived from the Bicyclic Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New silicon chalcogenide cage compounds with amino substituents have been derived from reactions of the bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with the chalcogen transfer agents Me3NO and propylenesulfide and with the chalcogens red selenium and tellurium in one step. This resulted into the first T4 silsesquioxane, defect&#8208;heterocubane&#8208;type clusters with three Si&#8722;Si bonds and a ditelluro&#8722;tetrasila&#8722;tricyclohexane.







Abstract
The bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 (2) was used as starting material in reactions with chalcogens and chalcogen transfer agents at low temperatures. This resulted in the selective formation of new cage compounds. With Me3NO, a silicon oxide with adamantane&#8208;type cage 3 was isolated that represents the first isolated T4 silsesquioxane. Reactions with propylenesulfide and red selenium gave direct access to defect heterocubane&#8208;type cages 4 and 5 with three Si&#8722;Si bonds wherein the silicon atoms adopt different low oxidation states of +I and +III. A reaction with elemental tellurium even occurs below room temperature to provide ditelluro&#8722;tetrasila&#8722;tricyclohexane 6.

         <title>Tunable Metal&#8208;Free Imidazole&#8208;Benzimidazole Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>

Selectivity of electrocatalytic oxygen reduction in aqueous media is tuned by varying pH; redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;free imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole (ImBenz) catalyst with a NO2 substituent at pH&#8197;7 favors H2O production, and ImBenz without substituent at pH&#8197;13 favors H2O2 production.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8208;free imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole catalysts (ImBenz&#8208;H, ImBenz&#8208;NO2, ImBenz&#8208;OCH3) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were prepared. We demonstrate that the electrocatalytic O2 reduction by ImBenz&#8208;NO2 with the electron&#8208;withdrawing group showed high selectivity toward H2O with the number of electrons transferred (n=3.7) in a neutral aqueous solution. The highest ORR selectivity toward H2O2 was achieved using ImBenz&#8208;H (n=2.4) in an alkaline solution. Electrochemical studies of reaction kinetics disclosed that the highest turnover frequencies were obtained from ImBenz&#8208;H in both neutral and alkaline aqueous solutions. The results prove that the ORR selectivity is tunable by modulating the substituent of the ImBenz catalysts. Furthermore, DFT calculations suggested that the ORR mechanism of ImBenz&#8208;H involves the electron transfer from imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole to O2 resulting in the formation of H2O2 which supports the redox active properties of the catalysts ImBenz.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Isomeric I&#8208;branched Polylactosamines Using Traceless Blocking Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy for the regioselective I&#8208;branching of polylactosamines is described. Enzyme promiscuity is exploited to generate oligosaccharides functionalized with traceless blocking groups. Multiple oligosaccharides are synthesized to demonstrate that the blocking group selectively directs enzymatic I&#8208;branch regioselectivity. This methodology allows the synthesis of polylactosamines of various topologies.







Abstract
Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl lactosamines (polyLacNAc) are common structural motifs of N&#8208; and O&#8208;linked glycan, glycosphingolipids and human milk oligosaccharides. They can be branched by the addition of &#946;1,6&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties to internal galactoside (Gal) residues by the I&#8208;branching enzyme beta&#8208;1,6&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (GCNT2). I&#8208;branching has been implicated in many biological processes and is also associated with various diseases such as cancer progression. Currently, there is a lack of methods that can install, in a regioselective manner, I&#8208;branches and allows the preparation of isomeric poly&#8208;LacNAc derivatives. Here, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy that addresses this deficiency and is based on the enzymatic assembly of an oligo&#8208;LacNAc chain that at specific positions is modified by a GlcNTFA moiety. Replacement of the trifluoroacetyl (TFA) moiety by tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) gives compounds in which the galactoside at the proximal site is blocked from modification by GCNT2. After elaboration of the antennae, the Boc group can be removed, and the resulting amine acetylated to give natural I&#8208;branched structures. It is also shown that fucosides can function as a traceless blocking group that can provide complementary I&#8208;branched structures from a single precursor. The methodology made it possible to synthesize a library of polyLacNAc chains having various topologies.

         <dc:description>
We report the oxidative dimerization reaction of siloxydienes derived from simple enones that creates a new gamma&#8208;gamma (&#947;&#8208;&#947;) C&#8722;C bond using catalytic iron and benzoyl peroxide as the terminal oxidant in acetonitrile solvent at ambient temperature. The reaction shows a broad substrate scope including cyclic and acyclic siloxydienes derived from ketones, aldehydes, and esters, which are converted to 1,8&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds under mild catalytic reaction conditions in 19&#8211;89&#8201;% yield across 30 examples. The method is suitable for the coupling of sterically demanding carbon centers, including the formation of vicinal quaternary centers. Conceptually, the dienol ether serves as a precursor to a conjugated radical cation, which undergoes highly site selective &#947;&#8208;dimerization reactions. The &#947;&#8208;&#947; dimerization strategy is applied to the synthesis of a bioactive analogue of honokiol.

&lt;p&gt;We report the oxidative dimerization reaction of siloxydienes derived from simple enones that creates a new gamma-gamma (&#947;-&#947;) C&#8722;C bond using catalytic iron and benzoyl peroxide as the terminal oxidant in acetonitrile solvent at ambient temperature. The reaction shows a broad substrate scope including cyclic and acyclic siloxydienes derived from ketones, aldehydes, and esters, which are converted to 1,8-dicarbonyl compounds under mild catalytic reaction conditions in 19&#8211;89&#8201;% yield across 30 examples. The method is suitable for the coupling of sterically demanding carbon centers, including the formation of vicinal quaternary centers. Conceptually, the dienol ether serves as a precursor to a conjugated radical cation, which undergoes highly site selective &#947;-dimerization reactions. The &#947;-&#947; dimerization strategy is applied to the synthesis of a bioactive analogue of honokiol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NDI based C2&#8208;symmetric Chiral Supramolecular Hydrogels Towards Enhanced Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The goal of the development of C2&#8208;symmetrical conductive supramolecular hydrogels was to attain uniformity and structural stability. The co&#8208;assembly with bipyridine functional group isomers line up within the gel&#8216;s framework and make channels for electron transmission, and improves their conductivity. By combining the advantages of the two design approaches, this synergistic method produces hydrogels with improved mechanical and conductive properties for possible use in a variety of bio&#8208;electronic devices in personalized healthcare and other bio&#8208;engineering areas.







Abstract
To comprehend the significance of improved conductive properties in C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogels, it is vital to investigate how non&#8208;gelating achiral functional group isomers influence the conductivity of such supramolecular hydrogels, whereas understanding the major driving forces behind this regulatory process is first and foremost. Herein, we report a hydrogel system containing tryptophan&#8208;conjugated NDI as the backbone (L/D&#8208;NTrp), enabling effective supramolecular assembly with the bipyridyl functional group isomers. This co&#8208;assembly behavior results in materials with exceptional mechanical properties and high conductivities, surpassing most previously reported C2&#8208;symmetrical hydrogels, as well as the ability to form controlled morphologies. Notably, the co&#8208;hydrogels displayed an eight&#8208;fold increase in mechanical strength, making them more robust and resistant to deformation compared to the original gel. Additionally, all hydrogels exhibited favorable electrical conductivity, with the co&#8208;assembled hydrogels showcasing notable performance, making them a promising candidate for use in electronic devices and sensors. This report lays the foundation for further investigation into the properties and potential applications of L/D&#8208;NTrp compound in the range of fields, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and electronics.

         <title>Fluorescent Phenotyping of Blood Cells Using a Differential Sensing Strategy: Differentiating Physiological Aging Stages and Neuro&#8208;Degenerative Disease Drugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>

A differential sensing approach is demonstrated to distinguish distinct aging status of mouse using TCF probes. Despite there is no reliable CD markers selective for aging progress, cross&#8208;reactivity of TCF probes generates unique fingerprint of aging by blood cell analysis.







Abstract
Blood continually contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis of the body and contains information regarding the health state of an individual. However, current hematological analyses predominantly rely on a limited number of CD markers and morphological analysis. In this work, differentially sensitive fluorescent compounds based on TCF scaffolds are introduced that are designed for fluorescent phenotyping of blood. Depending on their structures, TCF compounds displayed varied responses to reactive oxygen species, biothiols, redox&#8208;related biomolecules, and hemoglobin, which are the primary influential factors within blood. Contrary to conventional CD marker&#8208;based analysis, this unbiased fluorescent phenotyping method produces diverse fingerprints of the health state. Precise discrimination of blood samples from 37&#8197;mice was demonstrated based on their developmental stages, ranging from 10 to 19&#8197;weeks of age. Additionally, this fluorescent phenotyping method enabled the differentiation between drugs with distinct targets, serving as a simple yet potent tool for pharmacological analysis to understand the mode of action of various drugs.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Mediated Dehydrogenation of Hydroboranes and Group 14 Compounds: Base&#8208;Stabilized Silylene and Germylene Complexes vs. Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>

Dehydrogenation of primary and secondary silanes and germanes via a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative process affords base&#8208;stabilized silylene and germylene complexes that can serve as synthons of free &#8220;:ER2&#8221; (E=Si, Ge).







Abstract
Monocarbonyl rhodium complex LRh(CO), 1, which is stabilized by a pyrrole&#8208;based bis(phosphinimine) pincer ligand (L=&#954;3&#8208;NNN&#8217;=2,5&#8208;[iPr2P=N(4&#8208;iPrC6H4)]2&#8208;N&#8217;(C4H2)&#8722;), serves as a versatile platform for the dehydrogenation of group 14 substrates. Reaction with primary and secondary silanes and germanes (MesSiH3, Et2SiH2, Ph2GeH2, tBuGeH3; Mes=mesityl) liberates H2 and yields base&#8208;stabilized tetrylene compounds of the form &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2) (E=Si: R=Mes, H, 2; R=Et, 5; E=Ge: R=Ph, 6; R=tBu, H, 8). The &#8220;:ER2&#8221; fragment in these species bridges between the rhodium center and a phosphinimine donor. Preliminary reactions between pinacol (Pin) and &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2), E=Si, Ge, indicate that such complexes can serve as silylene and germylene synthons, releasing :ER2 and catalytically generating PinER2. In contrast, combination of complex 1 and MesGeH3 does not yield the anticipated dehydrogenation product, but rather, transmetalation similar to that observed upon reaction between 1 and 3,5&#8208;dimethylphenylborane prevails.

         <title>Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Chiral Aza/Boracyclophanes with a meta and para Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral aza/boracyclophanes that show unique dependence of the racemization energy barriers on macrocyclic conformations with distinct substitution patterns, and the ring constraints also impact as compared with the open&#8208;chain structures.







Abstract
We herein describe the synthesis of a new class of axially chiral aza/boracyclophanes (BDN1, BXN1, BDB1 and BXB1) using binaphthyls as chiral building blocks and the main&#8208;group (B/N) chemistry with tunable electronic effects. All macrocycles substituted with triarylamine donors or triarylborane acceptors are strongly luminescent. These macrocycles showed two distinct meta and para &#960;&#8208;conjugation pathways, leading to the formation of quasi figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight and square&#8208;shaped conformations. Interestingly, comparison of such structural models revealed that the former type of macrocycles BXN1 and BXB1 gave higher racemization barriers relative to the other ones. The results reported here may provide a new approach to engineer the optical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles by controlling &#960;&#8208;substitution patterns. The ring constraints induced by macrocyclization were also demonstrated to contribute to the configurational persistence as compared with the open&#8208;chain analogues p&#8208;BTT and m&#8208;BTT.

         <title>Control of Relative Positions of Electron&#8208;Donor and Electron&#8208;Acceptor Molecules in Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes for Luminescent Property Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relative&#8208;position control of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules in charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complexes without changing their molecular structures has been demonstrated. Different relative positions enabled the CT complexes to exhibit different emission wavelengths and different luminescence processes derived from CT interaction in the ground state, an exciplex, and CT interaction with the electron&#8208;acceptor dimer.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer complexes can exhibit various physical properties that depend on the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules. Several studies have investigated the relationship between the relative positions of electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules and their luminescence properties. However, elucidating the correlation between the relative positions and detailed luminescence processes without changing the molecular structures has not been explored. Herein, we report control of the relative position based on charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds between sulfo and amino groups and on alkylamines&#8217; steric factors, and report concomitant modulation of the luminescent properties. Six charge&#8208;transfer complexes were prepared from anthracene&#8208;2,6&#8208;disulfonic acid and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene as electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules, and various alkylamines. Different alkylamines&#8242; steric factors drastically and precisely changed the relative positions of the electron&#8208;donor and electron&#8208;acceptor molecules without changing their molecular structures. Consequently, the six crystals exhibited maximum emission wavelengths from 543 to 624&#8197;nm and different luminescence processes.

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Sarpagine and Macroline Alkaloid&#8208;Inspired Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compound collection inspired by both biology&#8208;oriented synthesis and pseudo&#8208;natural product design concepts was rapidly accessed by divergent synthesis. Biological evaluation revealed compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles.







Abstract
Design strategies that can access natural&#8208;product&#8208;like chemical space in an efficient manner may facilitate the discovery of biologically relevant compounds. We have employed a divergent intermediate strategy to construct an indole alkaloid&#8208;inspired compound collection derived from two different molecular design principles, i.e. biology&#8208;oriented synthesis and pseudo&#8208;natural products. The divergent intermediate was subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed or newly discovered Sn&#8208;mediated conditions to selectively promote intramolecular C&#8208; or N&#8208;acylation, respectively. After further derivatization, a collection totalling 84&#8197;compounds representing four classes was obtained. Morphological profiling via the cell painting assay coupled with a subprofile analysis showed that compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles. The subprofile analysis suggested that a pseudo&#8208;natural product class is enriched in modulators of tubulin, and subsequent assays led to the identification of compounds that suppress in&#8197;vitro tubulin polymerization and mitotic progression.

         <title>Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Oxidation with Ketone Selectivity by a Cobalt(IV)&#8208;Oxo Embedded in a &#946;&#8208;Barrel Protein</title>

Artificial metalloenzymes based on a cobalt cofactor show higher activity than the free cobalt complex for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous medium. The cobalt cofactor is presumably stabilized by the hydrophobic cleft provided by the protein NB4.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes have emerged as biohybrid catalysts that allow to combine the reactivity of a metal catalyst with the flexibility of protein scaffolds. This work reports the artificial metalloenzymes based on the &#946;&#8208;barrel protein nitrobindin NB4, in which a cofactor [CoIIX(Me3TACD&#8208;Mal)]+X&#8722; (X=Cl, Br; Me3TACD=N,N',N''&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane, Mal=CH2CH2CH2NC4H2O2) was covalently anchored via a Michael addition reaction. These biohybrid catalysts showed higher efficiency than the free cobalt complexes for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in aqueous media. Using commercially available oxone (2KHSO5&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;KHSO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K2SO4) as oxidant, a total turnover number of up to 220 and 97&#8201;% ketone selectivity were achieved for tetralin. As catalytically active intermediate, a mononuclear terminal cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo species [Co(IV)=O]2+ was generated by reacting the cobalt(II) cofactor with oxone in aqueous solution and characterized by ESI&#8208;TOF MS.

Herein, we present an efficient enantioselective amination of 3&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;benzofuranones utilizing non&#8208;covalent N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. The process is applicable to various functionalized substrates and it is found to be scalable. Mechanistic investigations based on control experimental and DFT studies suggest that the reaction operates via non&#8208;covalent substrate/NHC interactions.







Abstract
Herein, an efficient method for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;amination of 2&#8208;benzofuranones with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis is reported. The process is based on non&#8208;covalent interaction of NHC with substrate, facilitating the formation of a chiral ion&#8208;pair that encompasses enolate and azolium salt. The activated enolate adds to an electrophilic amine source with sufficient facial control to furnish an enantioenriched product having an amine substituted quaternary stereocenter. The process displays a broad substrate scope. A preparative scale synthesis has been achieved. Preliminary mechanistic investigations based on experimental and DFT studies suggest a reaction pathway that involves non&#8208;covalent substrate/NHC interactions and essentially implicate the role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction in diastereomeric transition states for stereo&#8208;chemical discrimination.

The &#945;&#8208;layered hydroxide (LH) phase with Ni vacancies is the most electroactive catalyst among LH structures containing exclusively Ni(II).







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;based layered hydroxides (LHs) are a family of efficient electrocatalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, fundamental aspects such as the influence of the crystalline structure and the role of lattice distortion of the catalytic sites remain poorly understood and typically muddled. Herein, we carried out a comprehensive investigation on &#593;&#8208;LH, &#946;&#8208;LH and layered double hydroxide (LDH) phases by means of structural, spectroscopical, in&#8208;silico and electrochemical studies, which suggest the key aspect exerted by Ni&#8208;vacancies in the &#593;&#8208;LH structure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirm that the presence of Ni&#8208;vacancies produces acute distortions of the electroactive Ni sites (reflected as the shortening of the Ni&#8722;O distances and changes in the O&#8722;Ni&#8722;O angles), triggering the appearance of Ni localised electronic states on the Fermi level, reducing the Egap, and consequently, increasing the reactivity of the electroactive sites in the &#593;&#8208;LH structure. Furthermore, post&#8208;mortem Raman and XAS measurements unveil its transformation into a highly reactive oxyhydroxide&#8208;like phase that remains stable under ambient conditions. Hence, this work pinpoints the critical role of the crystalline structure as well as the electronic properties of LH structures on their inherent electrochemical reactivity towards OER catalysis. We envision Ni&#8208;based &#593;&#8208;LH as a perfect platform for hosting trivalent cations, closing the gap toward the next generation of benchmark efficient earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts.

A direct allylic sulfonylation reaction: Allyl sulfones are an essential pharmacophore in many bioactive compounds. We report a practical, straightforward organophotocatalyzed methodology for accessing miscellaneously functionalized allyl sulfone derivatives using inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable sodium sulfinate salts under mild conditions to combat their synthetic barrier.







Abstract
Allyl sulfones are an essential pharmacophore in many bioactive compounds. To combat their synthetic barrier, we report a practical, straightforward organophotocatalyzed methodology for accessing miscellaneously functionalized allyl sulfone derivatives using inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable sodium sulfinate salts under mild conditions. This photo&#8208;catalyzed radical sulfonylation provides access to a variety of allyl sulfones in good to excellent yields with high E&#8201;:&#8201;Z selectivity. A wide range of vinyl cyclopropanes, as well as aryl/hetero and alkyl sodium sulfinates, were tolerated and reliable in gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Later on, further functionalization of allyl sulfones was demonstrated. A plausible mechanism for radical sulfonylation is proposed from the control experiments.

         <title>Luminescent Chiral Furanol&#8208;PAHs via Straightforward Ni&#8208;Catalysed Csp2&#8722;F Functionalization: Mechanistic Insights into the Scholl Reaction</title>

One step Ni&#8208;catalysed Csp2&#8722;F functionalization afforded aromatic homologation compounds as valid precursors for nanographene and PAH synthesis through the Scholl reaction. By using low acid/oxidant ratios, an unprecedented furanol&#8208;bearing PAHs are obtained and fully characterized, which sheds light into the intricate mechanism of Scholl reaction. Enantiomeric separation of a racemic curved furanol&#8208;PAH is performed.







Abstract
Here we report the stepwise synthesis of new nanographenes (NGs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) obtained via Scholl ring fusion applied at aromatic homologation compounds, which are obtained through one&#8208;step Ni&#8208;catalysed Csp2&#8722;F functionalization. The latter are rapidly accessed valid precursors for the Scholl reaction, and screening of experimental conditions allowed us to describe for the first time furanol&#8208;bearing PAHs. Mechanistic insights are obtained by DFT to rationalize the formation of the furanol PAHs under moderately acidic conditions. All PAHs and NGs synthesized show moderate/weak fluorescent properties, and all PAHs crystallized show some degree of curvature and are obtained as racemic mixtures. Enantiomeric separation by chiral HPLC of one furanol&#8208;bearing PAH allowed the study of their chiroptical CD properties.

         <title>Classical Gold Carbonyl Complexes in Tetrahedral and Trigonal&#8208;Planar Settings</title>

Pyridyl&#8208;borate scorpionates decorated with anionic and fluoro&#8208;alkyl groups serve as ideal ligands to capture gold(I)&#8208;carbon monoxide fragments in trigonal planar and tetrahedral environments that display remarkably low C&#8722;O stretching frequencies, and have significant Au&#8722;CO &#960;&#8208;bond character.







Abstract
A unique four&#8208;coordinate, classical gold(I)&#8208;carbonyl complex with substantial backdonation from gold has been isolated by using a B&#8208;methylated and fluorinated tris(pyridyl)borate chelator. Its lighter silver(I) and copper(I) analogs enabled a study of trends in the coinage&#8208;metal family. The B&#8208;arylated ligand version also afforded a gold&#8211;carbon monoxide complex that displays a notably low C&#8722;O stretch value, but with trigonal planar geometry at the gold. A computational analysis shows that the AuI&#8722;CO bonds of these tris(pyridyl)borate ligand&#8208;supported molecules consist of electrostatic attraction, OC&#8594;Au &#963;&#8208;donation, and very significant Au&#8594;CO &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;bonding components. The latter is responsible for the observed C&#8722;O stretching frequencies, which are lower than in free CO.

         <title>Electronic Effects in Phosphino&#8208;Iminophosphorane PdII Complexes upon Varying the N Substituent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The consequences of varying the substituent of the N atom in bidentate (P,PN) ligand was studied experimentally and theoretically within 3 series of palladium(II) complexes featuring also chlorides and/or isocyanides. The alkyl substituted complexes exhibit the higher stability while the H and trimethylsilyl containing counterparts were the most sensitive. For the latter, charge differences within the complexes were shown.







Abstract
Three series of palladium(II) complexes supported by a phosphine&#8208;iminophosphorane ligand built upon an ortho&#8208;phenylene core were investigated to study the influence of the iminophosphorane N substituent. Cis&#8208;dichloride palladium(II) complexes&#8197;1 in which the N atom bears an isopropyl (iPr, 1&#8201;a), a phenyl (Ph, 1&#8201;b), a trimethylsilyl (TMS, 1&#8201;c) group or an H atom (1&#8201;d) were synthesized in high yield. They were characterized by NMR, IR spectroscopy, HR&#8208;mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A substantial bond length difference between the Pd&#8722;Cl bonds was observed in 1. Complexes 1&#8201;a&#8211;d were converted into [Pd(LR)Cl(CNtBu)](OTf)] 2&#8201;a&#8211;d whose isocyanide is located trans to the iminophosphorane. The corresponding dicationic complexes [Pd(LR)(CNtBu)2](OTf)2 3&#8201;a&#8211;d were also synthesized, however they exhibited lower stability in solution than 2, the isopropyl derivative 3&#8201;a being the most stable of the series. Molecular modeling was performed to rationalize the regioselectivity of the substitution of the single chloride by isocyanide (from 1 to 2) and to study the electronic distribution in the complexes. In particular differences between the TMS and H containing complexes vs. the iPr and Ph ones were found. This suggests that the nature of the N substituent is far from innocent and can help tune the reactivity of iminophosphorane complexes.

Complexes &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt; were converted into [Pd(L&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;)Cl(CN&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu)](OTf)] &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt; whose isocyanide is located &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; to the iminophosphorane. The corresponding dicationic complexes [Pd(L&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;)(CN&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt; were also synthesized, however they exhibited lower stability in solution than &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, the isopropyl derivative &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; being the most stable of the series. Molecular modeling was performed to rationalize the regioselectivity of the substitution of the single chloride by isocyanide (from &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and to study the electronic distribution in the complexes. In particular differences between the TMS and H containing complexes vs. the iPr and Ph ones were found. This suggests that the nature of the N substituent is far from innocent and can help tune the reactivity of iminophosphorane complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discotic Star Mesogen with Thymine Nucleobases Exhibiting a Rare Gyroid Cubic Mesophase with 3D Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flipping disc networks: A discotic star shaped mesogen decorated with three DNA bases thymine reversibly switches between a columnar and an extraordinary bicontinuous cubic network. The double nanosegregated bicontinuous structure is stabilized by self&#8208;association of hydrogen bonding thymines and realize a 3D charge transport. A phase flipping is also discerned by the addition of adenine as complementary base.







Abstract
A unique gyroid cubic phase has been discovered for a discotic star mesogen with three covalently attached DNA bases. In this cubic 
 phase, the conjugated core of the mesogens and the thymine pseudo guests self&#8208;assemble in mirror image continuous networks, representing a semiconducting material with three&#8208;dimensional transport pathways. The hole carrier mobilities are found to be in the typical range of poly(phenylenevinylene) scaffolds. This structure is stabilized by a weak hydrogen bonding between the thymine bases and can be switched to a columnar liquid crystal &#8211; thermally and by the addition of complementary adenine guests.

         <title>Quo Vadis CO2 Activation: Catalytic Reduction of CO2 to Methanol Using Aluminum and Gallium/Carbon&#8208;based Ambiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stoichiometric vs. Catalytic: The herein reported aluminum and gallium/carbon&#8208;based ambiphiles, a new class of hidden frustrated Lewis pairs consisting of a phosphorus ylide featuring an aluminum or gallium fragment in the ortho position of a phenyl ring scaffold, react stoichiometrically with CO2 forming the stable adducts but also act as an efficient catalyst for the reduction of CO2 mediated by HBpin.







Abstract
We report on so&#8208;called &#8220;hidden FLPs&#8221; (FLP: frustrated Lewis pair) consisting of a phosphorus ylide featuring a group 13 fragment in the ortho position of a phenyl ring scaffold to form five&#8208;membered ring structures. Although the formation of the Lewis acid/base adducts was observed in the solid state, most of the title compounds readily react with carbon dioxide to provide stable insertion products. Strikingly, 0.3&#8211;3.0&#8197;mol% of the reported aluminum and gallium/carbon&#8208;based ambiphiles catalyze the reduction of CO2 to methanol with satisfactory high selectivity and yields using pinacol borane as stoichiometric reduction equivalent. Comprehensive computational studies provided valuable mechanistic insights and shed more light on activity differences.

         <title>Stabilization of sp&#8208;Hybridized Nitrogen Cation by Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Complex Formation with Intramolecular Iodine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchimeric interaction with an sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen cation with iodine affords an isolable acid&#8208;base complex. The N&#8722;I bonding is non&#8208;covalent but rather strong, while the O&#8722;I bond of the ligand is ionic and weak, facilitating ligand exchange in the presence of a Br&#248;nsted acid. The generated I+ cation species can be employed for &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation of ketones.







Abstract
Here we show that the sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen cation is strongly stabilized by a peri&#8208;iodine substituent in the tetralone system. The cation is captured by anionic species such as CF3CO2&#8722;, affording hypervalent iodine(III) compounds with a short nitrogen&#8208;iodine (N&#8722;I) bond, in which the cation serves as a Lewis acid. Notably, the O&#8722;I bond of the O&#8208;trifluoroacetate or O&#8208;acetate is intrinsically weaker than the N&#8722;I bond due to its more ionic character and is further weakened by protonation in trifluoroacetic acid. As a result, the oxygen ligand can dissociate in the presence of a Br&#248;nsted acid, affording a I+ cation intermediate that retains the N&#8722;I bond. We isolated the cation as the tetrafluoroborate, and characterized it experimentally by 1H NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure analysis, and theoretically by means of DFT calculation. The results suggest that the N&#8722;I bonded cation is intrinsically stable, and is weakly coordinated with water and the BF4 counter anion or trifluoroacetate anion. This cation can be employed as a reagent for &#945;&#8208;oxidation of ketones.

         <dc:description>
The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.







Abstract
The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. TX&#8208;100, TX&#8208;165 and TX&#8208;405 were used as non&#8208;ionic surfactants. Stability and other properties of the hybrid materials were tested by the following methods: UV&#8211;Vis, TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), CHN (elemental analysis), SEM&#8208;EDX (scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy) and tensiometry. According to the results with the increasing polymer concentration the colloidal stability of the tested systems also increases. Moreover, the addition of the surfactants causes the increase of polysaccharide adsorption but the colloidal stability of the tested systems decreases due to large weights of formed aggregates. As follows from the thermal analysis, the comparison of the TG/DTG&#8208;DSC curves obtained for the investigated polymers confirms that their thermal decomposition courses have some common features. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.

An unexpected [4+3]/[4+1] reaction of diene&#8208;vinylcyclopropanes (diene&#8208;VCPs) and carbon monoxide to access challenging 5/7/5 tricycles was developed, together with its mechanistic study by using ab initio calculations.







Abstract
Report here is a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [4+3]/[4+1] cycloaddition of diene&#8208;vinylcyclopropanes (diene&#8208;VCPs) and carbon monoxide to access compounds with angular 5/7/5 tricyclic skeleton found in natural products. The reaction has broad scope and further transformation of the [4+3]/[4+1] cycloadduct was also investigated. How this [4+3]/[4+1] reaction occurs and why its competing [4+3] reaction is disfavored have been investigated computationally.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Fluorenone&#8208;Containing Cycloparaphenylenes and Their Late&#8208;Stage Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of donor&#8211;acceptor cycloparaphenylenes by incorporating fluorenone is presented, the process yields a selection of four nanohoops that vary in ring size and acceptor strength. Their donor&#8211;acceptor characters were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies as well as electrochemical and computational studies, and the geometries were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography.







Abstract
Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) are the smallest possible armchair carbon nanotubes, the properties of which strongly depend on their ring size. They can be further tuned by either peripheral functionalization or by replacing phenylene rings for other aromatic units. Here we show how four novel donor&#8211;acceptor chromophores were obtained by incorporating fluorenone or 2&#8208;(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile into the loops of two differently sized CPPs. Synthetically, we managed to perform late&#8208;stage functionalization of the fluorenone&#8208;based rings by high&#8208;yielding Knoevenagel condensations. The structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses, which revealed that replacing a phenylene for a fused&#8208;ring&#8208;system acceptor introduces additional strain. The donor&#8211;acceptor characters of the CPPs were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies, electrochemical studies (displaying the CPPs as multi&#8208;redox systems undergoing reversible or quasi&#8208;reversible redox events), as well as by computations. The oligophenylene parts were found to comprise the electron donor units of the macrocycles and the fluorenone parts the acceptor units.

         <title>Bromine Substitution Improves the Photothermal Performance of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Phototheranostic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromine substitution enhances the photothermal properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated phototheranostic molecules; this is the outcome of a combination of the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enhanced ICT effect, and more intense bromine&#8208;mediate intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The results demonstrate that bromine substitution is promising for developing high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided photothermal agents.







Abstract
NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8211;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) has been widely investigated due to its great application potential in tumor theranostics. PTT is an effective and non&#8208;invasive tumor treatment method that can adapt to tumor hypoxia; nevertheless, simple and effective strategies are still desired to develop new materials with excellent PTT properties to meet clinical requirements. In this work, we developed a bromine&#8208;substitution strategy to enhance the PTT of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. The experimental results reveal that bromine substitution can notably enhance the absorptivity (&#1013;) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, resulting in the brominated molecules generating two times more heat (&#1013;808&#8197;nm&#215;PCE) than their unsubstituted counterpart. We disclose that the enhanced photothermal properties of bromine&#8208;substituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are a combined outcome of the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enhanced ICT effect, and more intense bromine&#8208;mediate intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Finally, the NIR&#8208;II tumor imaging capability and efficient PTT tumor ablation of the brominated &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials demonstrate that bromine substitution is a promising strategy for developing future high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided PTT agents.

The cover feature represents the crystal structure of LiMoS2. It consists of slightly distorted MoS2 layers with lithium sandwiched in between, illustrated as isosurfaces for potential lithium mobility. The compound is notoriously difficult to prepare with high crystallinity. Now, a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature synthesis has allowed the elucidation of the crystal structure. Thus, the tungsten carbide cubes of the multianvil press used at the Innsbruck laboratory encompass the structure. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Schwarzm&#252;ller and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302565).

         <dc:description>
Dehydrogenation of Group 13 and 14 substrates has been explored by using a rhodium pincer complex. While primary and secondary silanes and germanes are able to release H2 (blast off!), generating silylene and germylene compounds, the grounded boron and tin symbolize synthetic challenges with respect to this process. The same rhodium complex is able to catalyze the dehydrogenative coupling of silanes/germanes with pinacol; an example product is illustrated as a constellation in the night sky. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8208;J. Hsiang and P.&#8197;G. Hayes (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302925).

The aim of this review is to give an overview of diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds in synthesis and application.







Abstract
Diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) connected to diazo methyl center were a type of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds with potential reaction abilities similar to ordinary diazo compounds. Although several diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds were synthesized and used in the nucleophilic substitution reactions as early as 1994, the synthesis and application of new iodine(III) diazo compounds have only been reported to a certain extent in recent years. In the presence of rhodium catalyst, photocatalyst, or nucleophiles, diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds can be converted into rhodium&#8208;carbenes, diazomethyl radicals, ester radicals or nucleophilic intermediates, which can be used as key intermediates for the formation of chemical bonds. The aim of this review is to give an overview of diazomethyl&#8208;substituted iodine(III) compounds in organic synthesis.

         <title>Confining Ionic Liquids in Developing Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 5, January 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress and achievement of using IL&#8208;confinement in developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes for lithium metal batteries are surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, and the influence of specific parameters was discussed, indicating that the IL&#8208;confinement improves the performance of electrolytes, and the IL&#8208;confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent.







Abstract
The concept of confining ionic liquids (ILs) in developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSEs) has been proposed, where ILs are dispersed in polymer networks/backbones and/or filler/host pores, forming the so&#8208;called confinement, and great research progress and promising research results have been achieved. In this review, the progress and achievement in developing QSSEs using IL&#8208;confinement for lithium metal batteries (LMBs), together with advanced characterizations and simulations, were surveyed, summarized, and analyzed, where the influence of specific parameters, such as IL (type, content, etc.), substrate (type, structure, surface properties, etc.), confinement methods, and so on, was discussed. The confinement concept was further compared with the conventional one in other research areas. It indicates that the IL&#8208;confinement in QSSEs improves the performance of electrolytes, for example, increasing the ionic conductivity, widening the electrochemical window, and enhancing the cycle performance of the assembled cells, and being different from those in other areas, that is, the IL&#8208;confinement concept in the battery area is in a broad extent. Finally, insights into developing QSSEs in LMBs with the confinement strategy were provided to promote the development and application of QSSE LMBs.

         <title>Tryptophan&#8208;Doped Poly(vinyl alcohol) Films with Ultralong&#8208;Lifetime Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Color&#8208;Tunable Afterglow Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of a persistent luminescence system with long&#8208;lived phosphorescence and color&#8208;tunable afterglow at room temperature represents a challenge, largely due to the intensive non&#8208;radiative deactivation pathway. In this study, an ultralong&#8208;lived room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) system has been achieved using a hydrogen&#8208;bonding strategy where poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) matrices were doped with tryptophan (Trp) derivatives. The PVA film doped with N&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(9&#8208;Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl)&#8208;L&#8208;tryptophan (Fmoc&#8208;L&#8208;Trp) exhibited a long&#8208;lived phosphorescence emission of up to 3859.70 ms, and a blue afterglow for a duration greater than 34 s, under ambient conditions. The introduction of two other fluorescent dyes (i.e., Rhodamine B and Basicred14) to the PVA film facilitates adjustment to the color of the afterglow from blue to orange, and pink, by a triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET) process. These films have been successfully applied in silk&#8208;screen printing and in multicolor afterglow light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) arrays.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light Induced Oxidative Cleavage of C(sp3)&#8722;C, and C(sp3)&#8722;N Bonds of Nitriles, Alcohols, and Amines</title>

         <dc:description>
This work presents a visible&#8208;light mediated oxidative cleavage of unstrained C&#8722;C(sp3) and C&#8722;N(sp3) bonds of nitriles, alcohols (diols), and amines using Acr+&#8208;Mes/Selectfluor/DMAP system and O2 as the oxidant.







Abstract
Selective cleavage of unstrained (sp3) C&#8722;C/ C&#8722;N bonds under mild conditions is highly challenging due to the higher bond dissociation energy. A visible light mediated metal&#8208;free oxidative dehomologation of aryl acetonitriles, primary alcohols and diols to carboxylic acids via organophotocatalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;CN, C(sp3)&#8722;C(OH) bond cleavage is reported. Notably, this methodology was further extended towards selective synthesis of aldehydes via deamination of both primary as well as secondary amines. This mild protocol features wide array of substrate variation with excellent functional group tolerance, preparative&#8208;scale synthesis, and operational simplicity. Possible mechanisms for these transformations were demonstrated through a series of control experiments.

         <title>Tuning Reactivities of tert&#8208;Butyllithium by the Addition of Stoichiometric Amounts of Tetrahydrofuran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After more than 35&#8197;years, the search for the single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of tert&#8208;butyllithium with tetrahydrofuran ends successfully. However, contrary to expectations, two different aggregates depending on the amount of THF used could be determined in non&#8208;polar environment, which also differ significantly in their reactivity. Thus, opening up a simple way for synthetic chemists to tune the reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi according to their application.







Abstract
In alkyllithium chemistry the highest reactivity has historically been linked to the smallest degree of aggregation possible. Since tert&#8208;butyllithium is known to form a monomer in tetrahydrofuran solution, using just stoichiometric amounts of the lewis base to selectively form a dimeric species seemed irrational. In this study, we showed a considerable increase of the reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi when using stoichiometric amounts of THF in the non&#8208;polar solvent n&#8208;pentane in order to enable the deprotonation of simple methyl silanes and other low C&#8722;H&#8722;acidic substrates. In this context, we were able to obtain the corresponding aggregates of t&#8208;BuLi with the ligand THF in suspension and as crystalline solids and investigate them by single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis, in&#8197;situ FTIR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Furthermore, we were able to explain the enhanced reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi with stoichiometric amounts of THF on the basis of structural features of the bridged dimer obtained under these conditions. With these findings, we present a new target in the aggregation of alkyllithium reagents: the selectively formed &#8220;frustrated&#8221; aggregates!

Chemodivergent [3+3] annulations: The reactivity of Rh&#8208;enalcarbenoid has been switched from carbenoid to vinylogous NH&#8208;insertion by altering acyclic to cyclic &#945;&#8208;amino ketones to deliver functionalized 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,2&#8208;DHPs) and fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines respectively. The structural diversification of 1,2&#8208;DHP and fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines gave valuable piperidines, pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole, 2&#8208;pyridone, hexahydroquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, hexahydroquinolines, and tetrahydroquinolinones.







Abstract
Novel rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [3+3] annulations of diazoenals and &#945;&#8208;amino ketones has been disclosed here. The reactivity of diazoenals has been switched from carbenoid to vinylogous NH&#8208;insertion by altering acyclic to cyclic &#945;&#8208;amino ketones. In this direction, we report an efficient strategy to synthesize 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs) and fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the formyl group is necessary for carbenoid [3+3] annulation and the cyclohexyl group is the dictating factor for vinylogous NH&#8208; insertion. The synthetic utility of 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines was demonstrated by synthesizing piperidine, pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole, and 2&#8208;pyridone scaffolds. Further, structural diversification of fused 1,4&#8208;oxazines resulted in the short synthesis of hexahydroquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones, hexahydro quinolines and tetrahydroquinolinones via ring opening rearrangement and a new oxidative deformylation, respectively.

         <title>In&#8208;situ construction of poly(tetraisopentyl acrylate) based gel polymer electrolytes with LixLa2&#8208;xTiO3 for high energy density lithium&#8208;metal batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LLTO&#8208;containing PAN was prepared by electrostatic spinning as a polymer matrix, which was subsequently used to prepared gel polymer electrolyte by in&#8208;situ polymerization. The obtained gel polymer electrolyte has a high ionic conductivity and lithium&#8208;ion transference number, which assembles to form a high energy density lithium metal battery with excellent performance.







Abstract
As promising alternatives to liquid electrolytes, polymer electrolytes attract much research interest recently, but their widespread use is limited by the low ionic conductivity. In this study, we use electrostatic spinning to introduce particles of an ionic conductor into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers to prepare a porous membrane as the host of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs). The relevant in&#8208;situ produced GPE performs a high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, and a high lithium transfer number (tLi+) of 0.85 at 30&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. A symmetrical Li cell with this GPE can cycle stably for 550&#8197;h at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. While the capacity retention of the NCM|GPE|Li cell is 79.84&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 2&#8197;C. Even with an increased cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#8197;V, the 1st coulomb efficiency reaches 91.58&#8201;% with a specific discharge capacity of 213.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. This study provides a viable route for the practical application of high energy density lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Construction and Application of a Pepsin&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework with Prominent Chiral Recognition Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pepsin@ Covalent Organic Framework (Pepsin@COF) was constructed for enantioselective adsorption and chromatographic enantioseparation. Serving as a protective &#8220;armor&#8221;, the COF ensures the safeguarding of the enzyme, while the enzyme itself offers sites for chiral recognition. This research uncovers a first&#8208;time correlation between enzyme chiral recognition and activity, expanding biocomposite design and enriching the CSP library.







Abstract
The stable Pepsin@covalent organic framework (Pepsin@COF) were constructed base on matching COF pore diameter to pepsin dimension. It exhibits excellent chiral recognition capabilities (e.&#8201;e.&#8201;% up to 62.63&#8201;%) and potential for enantioseparation. Furthermore, a positive correlation between the immobilized enzyme activity and chiral recognition was revealed, offering insights for the design of biocatalytic nanosystems in chiral separation.

         <title>CARBON DOTS: Bioimaging and Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores Carbon Dots (CDs) in cancer treatment, highlighting their synthesis, bioimaging applications, and role in drug delivery. The review details potential barriers to drug delivery, and details recent studies and developments, with a focus on the use of CDs as nanocarriers in drug delivery systems designed for the delivery of doxorubicin.







Abstract
Cancer, responsible for approximately 10 million lives annually, urgently requires innovative treatments, as well as solutions to mitigate the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, such as long&#8208;term adverse side effects and multidrug resistance. This review focuses on Carbon Dots (CDs), an emergent class of nanoparticles (NPs) with remarkable physicochemical and biological properties, and their burgeoning applications in bioimaging and as nanocarriers in drug delivery systems for cancer treatment. The review initiates with an overview of NPs as nanocarriers, followed by an in&#8208;depth look into the biological barriers that could affect their distribution, from barriers to administration, to intracellular trafficking. It further explores CDs&#8242; synthesis, including both bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches, and their notable biocompatibility, supported by a selection of in&#8197;vitro, in&#8197;vivo, and ex vivo studies. Special attention is given to CDs&#8242; role in bioimaging, highlighting their optical properties. The discussion extends to their emerging significance as drug carriers, particularly in the delivery of doxorubicin and other anticancer agents, underscoring recent advancements and challenges in this field. Finally, we showcase examples of other promising bioapplications of CDs, emergent owing to the NPs flexible design. As research on CDs evolves, we envisage key challenges, as well as the potential of CD&#8208;based systems in bioimaging and cancer therapy.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds in the Ebselen Class of Antioxidants Probed by X&#8208;ray Quantum Crystallography</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray wavefunctions reveal that the nature of Se&#8722;N bonds in ebselen class of antioxidants is akin to dynamic bonds, with electronic features intermediary to covalent and ionic bonds.







Abstract
Dynamic bonds are essential structural ingredients of dynamic covalent chemistry that involve reversible cleavage and formation of bonds. Herein, we explore the electronic characteristics of Se&#8722;N bonds in the organo&#8208;selenium antioxidant ebselen and its derivatives for their propensity to function as dynamic covalent bonds by employing high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray quantum crystallography and complementary computational studies. An analysis of the experimentally reconstructed X&#8208;ray wavefunctions reveals the salient electronic features of the Se&#8722;N bonds with very low electron density localized at the bonding region and a positive Laplacian value at the bond critical point. Bond orders and percentage covalency and ionicity estimated from the X&#8208;ray wavefunctions, along with localized orbital locator (LOL) and electron localization function (ELF) analyses show that the Se&#8722;N bond is unique in its closed shell&#8208;like features, despite being a covalent bond. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations simulate the cleavage of Se&#8722;N bonds in ebselen in the excited state, further substantiating their nature as dynamic bonds.

         <title>Water&#8208;soluble triazolium covalent cages for ATP sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two water&#8208;soluble organic cages were synthesized through a three&#8208;fold click reaction, followed by N&#8208;methylation and anion exchange. The cages bind to the HPTS (8&#8208;hydroxypyrene&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;trisulfonic acid trisodium salt) dye and quench its emission. The cage&#8834;HPTS complexes exhibit turn&#8208;on emission to sense ATP with a nanomolar detection limit, both in water and in human serum matrix.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble organic cages are attractive targets for their molecular recognition and sensing features of biologically relevant molecules. Here, we have successfully designed and synthesized a pair of water&#8208;soluble cationic cages employing click reaction as the fundamental step followed by the N&#8208;methylation of the triazole rings. The rigid and shape&#8208;persistent 3D hydrophobic cavity, positively charged surface, H&#8208;bonding triazolium rings, and excellent water solubility empower both cages to exhibit a superior affinity and selectivity for binding with adenosine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) compared to cyclophanes and other macrocyclic receptors. Both cage molecules (PCC&#8901;Cl and BCC&#8901;Cl) can bind a highly emissive dye HPTS (8&#8208;hydroxypyrene&#8208;1,3,6&#8208;trisulfonic acid trisodium salt) to form non&#8208;fluorescent complexes. The addition of ATP resulted in the stronger cage&#8834;ATP complexes with the retention of HPTS emission upon its displacement. The resultant indicator&#8208;displacement assay system can efficiently sense and quantify ATP in nanomolar detection limits in buffer solutions and human serum matrix. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies revealed the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interaction between the aromatic moiety of the cationic cages and the adenine moiety of ATP, as well as the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interaction between the phosphate anion of ATP and triazole protons of cages, played the pivotal roles in the sensing process.

         <dc:description>
The depicted stainless steel autoclave is the heart of the presented methodology. It allows the performance of the method's key steps, which are the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed in&#8208;situ generation of aldehydes and their subsequent organocatalytic activation. The resulting dipyrromethanes are directly converted to highly fluorescent meso&#8208;alkyl and &#8208;aryl BODIPYs in yields of up to 78&#8201;% over five consecutive steps from stable and readily available alkenes or aryl bromides.

         <title>Electrochemical Redox Conversion of Formate to CO via Coupling Fe&#8722;Co Layered Double Hydroxides and Au Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Although formate is an inactive molecule which cannot be further reduced, this work provides a redox chemistry route for converting formate into active CO through a coupled slit parallel&#8208;plate electrode system.







Abstract
Formate has been considered an inactive molecule and thus cannot be further reduced under CO2 reduction conditions, which limits its widespread application as feedstock. Here we present an electrochemical redox conversion of formate to CO through the potential&#8208;dependent generation of carbon dioxide radical anions (CO2&#8901;&#8722;) on Fe&#8722;Co layered double hydroxides (Fe&#8722;Co LDHs) and the subsequent reduction of CO2&#8901;&#8722; to CO on Au catalysts. We present an electrodeposition protocol for the synthesis of Fe&#8722;Co LDHs with precise composition control and find that Fe1Co4 exhibits a promising potential window for CO2&#8901;&#8722; formation between 1.14 and 1.4&#8197;V and an optimized potential at 1.24&#8197;V at a neutral pH condition. We further determined the formation of CO2&#8901;&#8722; at 1.24&#8197;V via electron paramagnetic resonance and CO2 at &gt;1.4&#8197;V through differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. This work provides a redox chemistry route for converting formate into CO through a coupled slit parallel&#8208;plate electrode system.

         <title>Synthesis of the Reducing&#8208;end Hexasaccharide Fragment of Marine Lipopolysaccharide Axinelloside A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A properly protected hexasaccharide relevant to the reducing&#8208;end half of telomerase inhibitor axinelloside A was synthesized. Features of the synthetic approach include (1) preparation of the scyllo&#8208;inositol unit via Ferrier&#8208;type&#8208;II rearrangement, (2) formation of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic linkages via remote acyl group participation, and (3) concise [2+2+2] assembly by virtue of Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation.







Abstract
Chemical synthesis of an orthogonally protected hexasaccharide relevant to the reducing&#8208;end half of axinelloside A, a highly sulfated marine lipopolysaccharide, is disclosed. The synthesis features preparation of the scyllo&#8208;inositol unit via a Ferrier&#8208;type&#8208;II rearrangement, construction of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;glycosidic bonds via remote participation, and concise [2+2+2] assembly via Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation.

         <title>A New Porphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework with High Iodine Capture Capacity and I&#8208;doping Enhanced Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel COF was prepared. Structure of the COF was characterized by PXRD, TEM, BET and CV et&#8197;al. Theoretical simulation fit well in with experimental data, including XRD profile, layer distance, pore size and HOMO/LUMO energy level. The material showed high iodine capture capability and interaction between iodine and framework was studied. After iodine&#8208;doping, enhanced conductivity was observed.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous organic materials with well&#8208;defined and uniform structure. The material is an excellent candidate as a solid adsorbent for iodine adsorption. In the present study, we report the synthesis of COF with porphyrin moiety, TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF, by solvothermal reaction, which was characterized by XRD, solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, IR, TGA, and nitrogen adsorption&#8208;desorption analysis. TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF showed a high specific surface area of 443&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, and exhibited good adsorption performance for iodine vapor, with an adsorption capacity of 2.74&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1. XPS and Raman spectrum indicated that a hybrid of physisorption and chemisorption took place between host COF and iodine molecules. The electric properties of iodine&#8208;loaded TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF were also studied. After doped with iodine, the conductivity of the material increased by more than 5 orders of magnitude. The photoconductivity of I2&#8208;doped COF was also studied and TF&#8208;TA&#8208;COF showed doping&#8208;enhanced photocurrent generation.

         <title>Pyridine Iodine(I) Cations: Kinetic Trapping as a Sulfonate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two components, pyridinic N&#8208;bonded iodine and sulfonate oxygen, stabilize in crystals via the I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O halogen bonding interaction validating the N&#8208;iodopyridinium sulfonate, (Pyridine)N&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OSO2R formula.







Abstract
Seven pyridine iodine(I) sulfonate complexes were prepared and isolated at low temperatures and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The inherently instable pyridine iodine(I) cations are stabilized by an oxygen of sulfonate anions via the I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O halogen bond. In these complexes, the iodine atom of the pyridine iodine(I) cation acts as an electron acceptor and the sulfonate oxygen as the electron donor. These complexes are stable enough in the crystalline state, yet decompose rapidly under ambient conditions, also being unstable in solution. The (pyridine)N&#8722;I bond lengths [2.140(3)&#8211;2.197(2)&#8197;&#197;] and the I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O halogen bonds [2.345(6)&#8211;2.227(3)&#8197;&#197;] are analogous to (imide)N&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8722;N&#8208;pyridine uncharged halogen&#8208;bonded complexes formed from N&#8208;haloimides and pyridine N&#8208;oxides, thus confirming the existence of elusive pyridine iodine(I) cation.

         <title>Hydroxytrifluoroethylation and Trifluoroacetylation Reactions via SET Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review we present the recent methods available in the literature for the direct introduction of hydroxytrifluoroethyl and trifluoroacetyl groups in organic molecules governed by single&#8208;electron transfer processes.







Abstract
Hydroxytrifluoroethyl and trifluoroacetyl groups are of utmost importance in biologically active compounds, but methods to tether these motifs to organic architectures have been limited. Typically, the preparation of these compounds relied on the use of strong bases or multistep routes. The renaissance of radical chemistry in photocatalytic, transition metal mediated, and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes have allowed the installation of these medicinally relevant fluorinated motifs. This review provides an overview of the methods available for the direct synthesis of hydroxytrifluoroethyl&#8208; and trifluoroacetyl&#8208;derived compounds governed by single&#8208;electron transfer processes.

         <title>Direct growth control of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria using visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive novel photoswitchable antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoswitchable arylazopyrazole&#8208;modified norfloxacin with MIC of 0.25&#8197;&#956;g/mL of the cis isomer displayed 24&#8208;fold higher antibacterial potency than its trans isomer against norfloxacin&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive S.&#8197;aureus strain MTCC96. The antimicrobial activity can be controlled by visible light with high spatiotemporal precision and retained for &gt;7&#8197;hours. These features render this molecule very attractive for photopharmacology applications.







Abstract
In addition to the discovery of new (modified) potent antibiotics to combat antibiotic resistance, there is a critical need to develop novel strategies that would restrict their off&#8208;target effects and unnecessary exposure to bacteria in our body and environment. We report a set of new photoswitchable arylazopyrazole&#8208;modified norfloxacin antibiotics that present a high degree of bidirectional photoisomerization, impressive fatigue resistance and reasonably high cis half&#8208;lives. The irradiated isomers of most compounds were found to exhibit nearly equal or higher antibacterial activity than norfloxacin against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Notably, against norfloxacin&#8208;resistant S.&#8197;aureus bacteria, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive p&#8208;SMe&#8208;substituted derivative showed remarkably high antimicrobial potency (MIC of 0.25&#8197;&#956;g/mL) in the irradiated state, while the potency was reduced by 24&#8208;fold in case of its non&#8208;irradiated state. The activity was estimated to be retained for more than 7&#8197;hours. This is the first report to demonstrate direct photochemical control of the growth of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria and to show the highest activity difference between irradiated and non&#8208;irradiated states of a photoswitchable antibiotic. Additionally, both isomers were found to be non&#8208;harmful to human cells. Molecular modellings were performed to identify the underlying reason behind the high&#8208;affinity binding of the irradiated isomer to topoisomerase IV enzyme.

         <title>Aerobic Asymmetric Allylic C&#8722;H Alkylation by Synergistic Chiral Primary Amine&#8208;Palladium&#8208;Hydroquinone Catalysis</title>

A ternary and synergistic chiral primary amine/palladium /p&#8208;hydroquinone catalysis was developed to facilitate oxidative asymmetric allylic C&#8722;H alkylation under aerobic conditions with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
A synergistic chiral primary amine/palladium /p&#8208;hydroquinone catalysis was developed to facilitate oxidative asymmetric allylic C&#8722;H alkylation under aerobic conditions. The ternary synergistic catalysis enables a facile allylic C&#8722;H activation and alkylation with oxygen so that stoichiometric utilization of benzoquinone can be avoided. The identified optimal catalytic system allows for terminal addition to allyl arenes with &#945;&#8208;branched &#946;&#8208;ketocarbonyls to afford allylic adducts bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers with high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This work provides new insights for further studies on the aerobically oxidative C&#8722;H alkylation reaction.

Compound 1 displayed superior catalytic performance in the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (yield=94&#8201;%; turnover number=500; turnover frequency=20.8&#8197;h&#8722;1).







Abstract
An unclassical structure of {Ru(C6H6)}&#8208;based polyoxometalate, Cs6H4[Te2Mo12O46{Ru(C6H6)}]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;16.5H2O (1), has been successfully constructed from {Te2Mo12O46}&#8208;type heteropolymolybdate and {Ru(C6H6)} group, which structure type was discovered for the first time. Compound 1 not only possesses strong light&#8208;harvesting ability, but also exhibits high carrier separation efficiency and lower charge transfer resistance. Under visible light irradiation, compound 1 displayed excellent catalytic activity and circularity in the conversion of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (yield=94&#8201;%; turnover number=500; turnover frequency=20.8&#8197;h&#8722;1). Finally, the electron paramagnetic resonance measurement and energy level matching analysis provide theoretical basis for the derivation of the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Simple Air&#8208;Stable [3]Radialene Anion Radicals as Environmentally Switchable Catholytes in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive [3]radialene radical anions dimerize reversibly in a controlled manner. An unprecedented tristate switching mechanism can be achieved by changing the solvent environment, temperature, or salinity of the solution. This allows the radical to be toggled between the free radical, a &#960;&#8208;dimer, and a &#963;&#8208;dimer, which exhibit dramatically different optical, magnetic, and redox properties. The addition of salt to the radialene catholyte solution in an aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) converts the &#963;&#8208;dimer to the &#960;&#8208;dimer and increases the electrochemical reversibility and stability of the charged species, which are advantageous for galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge studies at neutral pH. More information can be found in the Research Article by Arthur&#8197;H. Winter, C. Bejger, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302829). Illustration by Frank&#8197;A. Martinez.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Promoted Reductive Amination of DNA&#8208;Conjugated Amines for DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have become a leading technology for hit identification in drug discovery projects as large, diverse libraries can be generated. DELs are commonly synthesised via split&#8208;and&#8208;pool methodology; thus, chemical transformations utilised must be highly efficient, proceeding with high conversions. Reactions performed in DEL synthesis also require a broad substrate scope to produce diverse, drug&#8208;like libraries. Many pharmaceutical compounds incorporate multiple C&#8208;N bonds, over a quarter of which are synthesised via reductive aminations. However, few on&#8208;DNA reductive amination procedures have been developed. Herein is reported the application of the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, to the on&#8208;DNA reductive amination of DNA&#8208;conjugated amines, yielding highly efficient conversions with a broad range of aldehydes, including medicinally relevant heterocyclic and aliphatic substrates. The procedure is compatible with DNA amplification and sequencing, demonstrating its applicability to DEL synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn(II) Promoted Divergent&#8208;Convergent Domino Reaction Giving Dinuclear Tetrasubstituted Pyrrole Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Domino reaction of benzo[d]thiazole&#8208;2&#8208;methylamine (S1) has been developed in the presence of MnCl2&#183;4H2O, leading to tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated dinuclear Mn(II) complex 1 ([MnClP]2, P&#8208; = 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;ide). The reaction process has been studied by assigning a series of intermediates based on time&#8208;dependent mass spectrometry, control experiments, crystallography, and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculation. A plausible mechanism involving an unprecedented divergent&#8208;convergent domino sequence has been proposed. Compound S1 could be activated by MnCl2&#183;4H2O via coordination, which divergently produces two intermediates imine II (1&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)methanimine) and alkene C (1,2&#8208;bis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene) through oxidative self&#8208;condensation and free radical coupling followed by elimination, respectively. They could then react with each other convergently via formal [3+2] cycloaddition to give deprotonated tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated intermediate [MnClP] after aromatization. Dimerization of [MnClP] produces the final product 1. Three C&#8208;C bonds and one C&#8208;N bond are formed through this six&#8208;step domino sequence. The corresponding organic skeleton (HP: 2,2',2'',2'''&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrayl)tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazole)) has been obtained from 1 and shows a higher fluorescent quantum yield (52%) than the reported 3,4&#8208;diphenyl substituted analogue 2,2'&#8208;(3,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl)bis(benzo[d]thiazole) (DPB) (42%).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fluorescence spectroscopy proves to be a powerful and versatile tool in scientific research, demanding ongoing advancements of fluorescence probes to cater to a broad range of applications. The particular interest lies in the development of fluorophores with multiplexing capability, emitting from more than one excited state depending on the polarity and viscosity of the surrounding medium. Here, we present a variety of novel dual planarized intramolecular charge transfer (PLICT) emitters based on cyano&#8208;1&#8208;aminoindole structures. We have chosen a combination of experimental studies, theoretical calculations and the creation of a unique fluorophore cataloging map. This map serves as a useful tool for empirically determining the origin of both fluorescence bands.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Chemical Bond in Semiconductor/MXene Composites: TiO2 Clusters Anchored on the Ti2C MXene Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>First&#8208;principles calculations on titania clusters (TiO2)n (n = 5 and 10) supported on the pristine Ti2C (0001) surface were carried out to understand the properties of semiconductor/MXene composites with implications in (photo)&#8208;catalysis. The reported results reveal a high exothermic interaction accompanied by a substantial charge transfer with a concomitant, notorious, deformation of the titania nanoclusters. The analysis of the density of states analysis of the composite systems evidences a metallic character with titania related states crossing the Fermi level. The picture of the chemical bonds is completed by the analysis of X&#8208;Ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS) features, evidencing clear shifts of the C(1s) and O(1s) related peaks relative to the isolated systems that have a quite complex origin. This detailed analysis provides insights to experimentalists interested in the design and synthesis of these systems with possible applications in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Polymerized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers show a great potential in low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;area and flexible full&#8208;color flat&#8208;panel displays. One of the most promising design rules is based on TADF + Linker, where a small molecular TADF unit is bonded to each other by a simple linker. Unlike the expensive vacuum deposition for small molecules, these polymerized TADF small molecules (Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs) are capable of cost&#8208;effective solution processing. Meanwhile, the good luminescent property of small molecular TADF emitters can be well inherited by Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs so as to bridge the efficiency gap between small molecules and polymers. Herein, we will highlight the recent progress of Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs, together with emphasis on their molecular design, photophysical and electroluminescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreduction of CO2 on Cu, Fe, or Ni&#8208;doped diamane sheets: A DFT study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poor mass transfer behavior and inherent activity limit the efficiency of traditional catalysts in electrocatalyzing carbon dioxide reduction reactions. However, the development of novel nanomaterials provides new strategies to solve the above problems. Herein, we propose novel single&#8208;metal atom catalysts, namely diamane&#8208;based electrocatalysts doped with Cu, Fe, and Ni, explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We thoroughly investigated the doping pattern and energetics for different dopants. Furthermore, we systematically investigated the conversion process of CO2 to C1 or C2+ products, utilizing the free energy analysis of reaction pathways. Our results reveal that dopants could only be introduced into diamane following a specific pattern. Dopants significantly enhance the CO2 adsorption ability of diamane, with Fe and Ni proving notably more effective than Cu. After CO2 adsorption, Cu&#8208; and Fe&#8208;doped diamane prefer to catalyze CO2RR, while Ni&#8208;doped diamane favors hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The C&#8208;C coupling reaction on Cu&#8208;hollow diamane, Cu&#8208;bridge diamane and Fe&#8208;hollow diamane tends to from C2+ products. Among all examined catalysts, Cu&#8208;hollow diamane shows better electro&#8208;catalytic performance. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of and contributes to the development of diamane based electro&#8208;catalysts for CO2RR.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of functional glycopolymer nanoparticles with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motif was designed, synthesized and applied for tumor cell imaging. With the pH&#8208;sensitive and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect of the 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide fluorescent probe, the presence of glucose&#8208;based glycopolymers enhanced its water&#8208;solubility and biocompatibility. Owing to the dual tumor&#8208;targeting effects of the dense glucose part and the boronic ester modification, the obtained glycopolymers showed high affinity to tumor cells, with a much faster staining rate than normal cells, indicating a great potential for diagnosis and treatments of cancers.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Congested Protecting Group for a Boronyl Group in Iterative Aminations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we found that the sterically bulky &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide moiety is a suitable framework for protecting the boronyl group of boron reagents during aminations. Condensation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxamide with ArB(OH)2 produced aryloxazaborolidinone (ArOxB). The reactivity of the C&#8208;B bond in ArOxB is easily controlled by the steric and weak electronic effects of the backbone. H2N&#8208;(or Br&#8208;)ArOxB underwent Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam (C&#8208;E&#8208;L) or Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig (B&#8208;H) amination with retaining the C&#8208;B bond. On the other hand, direct C&#8208;E&#8208;L amination of ArOxB was also possible in an oxidative atmosphere, in which the C&#8208;B bond was activated by CuII species. Our methodology is effective for the precise synthesis of two or more arylamino group substituted arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein&#8208;Templated Ugi Reactions versus In&#8208;Situ Ligation Screening: Two Roads to the Identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;templated fragment ligation was established as a method for the rapid identification of high affinity ligands, and multicomponent reactions (MCR) such as the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi 4CR) have been efficient in the synthesis of drug candidates. Thus, the combination of both strategies should provide a powerful approach to drug discovery. Here, we investigate protein&#8208;templated Ugi 4CR quantitatively using a fluorescence&#8208;based enzyme assay, HPLC&#8208;QTOF&#8208;MS, and native protein MS with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease as template. Ugi reactions were analyzed in aqueous buffer at varying pH and fragment concentration. Potent inhibitors of the protease were formed in presence of the protein via Ugi 4CR together with Ugi three&#8208;component reaction (Ugi 3CR) products. Binding of inhibitors to the protease was confirmed by native mass spectrometry and resulted in the dimerization of the protein target. Formation of Ugi products was, however, more efficient in the non&#8208;templated reaction, apparently due to interactions of the protein with the isocyanide and imine fragments. Consequently, in&#8208;situ ligation screening of Ugi 4CR products was identified as a superior approach to the discovery of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protease inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>A Three&#8208;dimensional Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptor with Contorted Hexabenzocoronene and Perylenediimide for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61/C71&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM) have dominated the the photoactive acceptor materials in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) for decades, they have several drawbacks such as weak absorption, limited structural tunability, prone to aggregation, and high costs of production. Constructing non&#8208;fullerene small molecules with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) molecular geometry is one of the strategies to replace fullerenes in OSCs. In this study, a 3D molecule, contorted hexa&#8208;cata&#8208;hexabenzocoronene tetra perylenediimide (HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI), was designed and synthesized. HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI shows a wide and strong light absorption in the whole UV&#8208;vis region as well as suitable energy levels as an acceptor for OSCs. More importantly, the 3D construction effectively reduced the self&#8208;aggregation of c&#8208;HBC, leading to an appropriate scale phase separation of the blend film morphology in OSCs. A preliminary power conversion efficiency of 2.70% with a champion open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.06 V was obtained in OSCs with HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI as the acceptor, which was the highest among the previously reported OSCs based on c&#8208;HBC derivatives. The results indicated that HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI may serve as a good non&#8208;fullerene acceptor for OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction to CO on cadmium sulfide enhanced by chloride anion doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) to produce valuable fuel is a promising process for addressing atmospheric CO2 emissions and energy shortages. In this study, Cl&#8208;anion doped cadmium sulfide structures were directly fabricated on a nickel foam surface (Cl/CdS&#8208;NF) using an in situ hydrothermal method. The Cl&#8208;anion doping could significantly improve ECR activity for CO production in ionic liquid and acetonitrile mixed solution, compared to pristine CdS. The highest Faradaic efficiency of CO is 98.1% on a Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2 cathode with an excellent current density of 137.0 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.25 V versus ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+, all potentials are versus Fc/Fc+ in this study). In particular, CO Faradaic efficiencies remained above 80% in a wide potential range of &#8722;2.05 V to &#8722;2.45 V and a maximum partial current density (192.6 mA cm&#8722;2) was achieved at &#8722;2.35 V. The Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2, with appropriate Cl anions, displayed abundant active sites and a suitable electronic structure, resulting in outstanding ECR activity. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that Cl/CdS is beneficial for increasing the adsorption capacities of *COOH and *H, which can enhance the activity of the ECR toward CO and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) to produce valuable fuel is a promising process for addressing atmospheric CO2 emissions and energy shortages. In this study, Cl-anion doped cadmium sulfide structures were directly fabricated on a nickel foam surface (Cl/CdS-NF) using an in situ hydrothermal method. The Cl-anion doping could significantly improve ECR activity for CO production in ionic liquid and acetonitrile mixed solution, compared to pristine CdS. The highest Faradaic efficiency of CO is 98.1% on a Cl/CdS-NF-2 cathode with an excellent current density of 137.0 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.25 V versus ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+, all potentials are versus Fc/Fc+ in this study).

         <dc:description>The electrophilic functionalization of the triple&#8208;decker sandwich complex [{Cp*Mo}2( &#956; , &#951;  6:6  &#8208;P6)] (A) and its mono&#8208;oxidized counterpart [{Cp*Mo}2( &#956; , &#951;  6:6  &#8208;P6)][SbF6] (B) with reactive main&#8208;group electrophiles as well as radical scavengers is a reliable method for the selective functionalization of the hexaphospha&#8208;benzene ligand. Depending on the electrophile used, the regioselectivity of the functionalization can be adjusted. Using group 16 electrophiles, the trisubstituted compounds [{Cp*Mo}2{( &#956; , &#951;  3:3  &#8208;P3)( &#956; , &#951;  1:1:1:1  &#8208;1,3&#8208;(SePh)2&#8208;2&#8208;Br&#8208;P3)}][TEF] (1), [{Cp*Mo}2( &#956; , &#951;  3:3  &#8208;P3)( &#956;,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;(EPh)3&#8208;P3)][SbF6] (E = S (2), Se (3)) as well as the side product [{Cp*Mo}2(&#956;,&#951;4:4&#8208;P4)(&#956;,&#951;1:1&#8208;P(SPh)2)][SbF6] (4) are obtained.

         <title>Exploring electrophilic hydrophosphination via metal phosphenium intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two Mo(0) phosphenium complexes containing ancillary secondary phosphine ligands have been investigated with respect to their ability to participate in electrophilic addition at unsaturated substrates and subsequent P&#8208;H hydride transfer to &#8220;quench&#8221; the resulting carbocations. These studies provide stoichiometric &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; for a proposed new metal&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic hydrophosphination mechanism. The more strongly Lewis acidic phosphenium complex, [Mo(CO)4(PR2H)(PR2)]+ (R = Ph, Tolp), cleanly hydrophosphinates 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, benzophenone, and ethylene, while other substrates react rapidly to give products resulting from competing electrophilic processes. A less Lewis acidic complex, [Mo(CO)3(PR2H)2(PR2)]+, generally reacts more slowly but participates in clean hydrophosphination of a wider range of unsaturated substrates, including styrene, indene, 1&#8208;hexene, and cyclohexanone, in addition to 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, benzophenone, and ethylene. Mechanistic studies are described, including stoichiometric control reactions and computational and kinetic analyses, which probe whether the observed P&#8208;H addition actually does occur by the proposed electrophilic mechanism, and whether hydridic P&#8208;H transfer in this system is intra&#8208; or intermolecular. Preliminary reactivity studies indicate challenges that must be addressed to exploit these promising results in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability of the protactinium(V) mono&#8208;oxo cation probed by first&#8208;principle calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the distinctive behavior of Protactinium (Z = 91) within the actinide series. In contrast to neighboring elements like uranium or plutonium, Protactinium in the pentavalent state diverges by not forming the typical dioxo protactinyl moiety PaO2+&#160;in aqueous phase.&#160;Instead, it manifests as a monooxo PaO3+ cation. Employing first&#8208;principle calculations with implicit and explicit solvation, we investigate two stoichiometrically equivalent neutral complexes: PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) and Pa(OH)4(X), where X represents various monodentate and bidentate ligands. Calculating the Gibbs' free energy for the reaction PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) &#8208;&gt; Pa(OH)4(X), we find that the PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) complex is stabilized with Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, I&#8208;, NCS&#8208;, NO3&#8208;, and SO42&#8208; ligands, while it is not favored with OH&#8208;, F&#8208;, and C2O42&#8208; ligands. Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) methods reveal the Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond as a triple bond, with significant contributions from the 5f and 6d shells. Covalency of the Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond increases with certain ligands, such as Cl&#8208;, Br&#8208;, I&#8208;, NCS&#8208;, and NO3&#8208;. These findings elucidate Protactinium's unique chemical attributes and provide insights into the conditions supporting the stability of relevant complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Catalyzed at the Exterior of Chiral Coordinated Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Confined spaces inside molecular hosts can function as reaction vessels. However, this concept significantly limits the scope of reactants. When the exterior of molecular hosts is used instead, we can ease the restriction because reactants are not necessary to be trapped inside molecular hosts, although studies along this line have not been reported. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of enantioselective reactions at the exterior of chiral molecular hosts, we utilized host&#8210;guest complexes of enantiomerically enriched Cu&#8208;coordinated capsules and guests possessing a catalytic center to realize the kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols. Under suitable reaction conditions, a selectivity factor of 2.6 was realized, demonstrating that the reactions occur at the exterior of the capsules. A series of experiments indicated that the substituents on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arms and the alkyl chains on the lower rim contributed to the enantioselectivity of the reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Orbital Analysis Captures the Existence of a Mixed&#8208;Valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII Active&#8208;Site and its Role in Water&#8208;Assisted Aliphatic Hydroxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our computations reveal that the mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core is formed via the transfer of 2H+ and 2e&#8722; from the phenolic groups of the ligands to peroxo&#8208;dicopper core. This mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII is highly reactive towards the aliphatic C&#8722;H bond following a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. Further, the role of an in&#8208;situ generated water molecule in aliphatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation was also analysed.







Abstract
The Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Cu core has been proposed as a potential site for methane oxidation in particulate methane monooxygenase. In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) to design a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII species from an experimentally known peroxo&#8208;dicopper complex supported by N&#8208;donor ligands containing phenolic groups. We found that the transfer of two&#8208;protons and two&#8208;electrons from phenolic groups to peroxo&#8208;dicopper core takes place, which results to the formation of a bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core. The bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;hydroxo&#8208;dicopper core converts to a mixed&#8208;valent CuIII&#8722;O&#8722;CuII core with the removal of a water molecule.

&lt;p&gt;Our computations reveal that the mixed-valent Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; core is formed via the transfer of 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; from the phenolic groups of the ligands to peroxo-dicopper core. This mixed-valent Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; is highly reactive towards the aliphatic C&#8722;H bond following a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. Further, the role of an in-situ generated water molecule in aliphatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation was also analysed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Cu core has been proposed as a potential site for methane oxidation in particulate methane monooxygenase. In this work, we used density functional theory (DFT) to design a mixed-valent Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; species from an experimentally known peroxo-dicopper complex supported by N-donor ligands containing phenolic groups. We found that the transfer of two-protons and two-electrons from phenolic groups to peroxo-dicopper core takes place, which results to the formation of a bis-&#956;-hydroxo-dicopper core. The bis-&#956;-hydroxo-dicopper core converts to a mixed-valent Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; core with the removal of a water molecule. The orbital and spin density analyses unravel the mixed-valent nature of Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;. We further investigated the reactivity of this mixed-valent core for aliphatic C&#8722;H hydroxylation. Our study unveiled that mixed-valent Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; core follows a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism for C&#8722;H activation. An in-situ generated water molecule plays an important role in C&#8722;H hydroxylation by acting as a proton transfer bridge between carbon and oxygen. Furthermore, to assess the relevance of a mixed-valent Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; core, we investigated aliphatic C&#8722;H activation by a symmetrical Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; core. DFT results show that the mixed-valent Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; core is more reactive toward the C&#8722;H bond than the symmetrical Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&#8722;Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; core.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shaping Chirality via Stereoselective, Organocatalytic [4+2] Cycloadditions involving Heterocyclic ortho&#8208;Quinodimethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic compounds bearing a complex heterocyclic core such as an aromatic heterocycle &#8220;fused&#8221; with one or more functionalized rings, are widespread leading molecules in the domain of synthetic organic chemistry and pharmaceuticals. Although many synthetic methodologies have been devised to access achiral, fused heteroaromatic scaffolds, or related chiral variants adorned with out&#8208;of&#8208;cycle stereogenic elements, equally efficient strategies to afford chiral heterocycles featuring in&#8208;cycle stereocenters, exist to a lesser extent and presently represent a growing field of investigation. The mild, organocatalytic generation of elusive ortho&#8208;quinodimethane intermediates (oQDMs), derived from suitable heteroaromatic carbonyl&#8208; or carbonyl&#8208;like pronucleophiles has recently proved successful in the synthesis of such peculiar chiral architectures via stereoselective [4+2] cycloadditions. This review provides an overview of the most important advances attained in this field over the last decade.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Cyclic Dienamine Reactivity in Radical tert&#8208;Alkylation for Molecular Diversity to Synthesize Multicyclic Compounds possessing a Quaternary Carbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of diverse sterically congested molecules from a single important intermediate is one of the ideal synthetic strategies in organic synthesis. In this paper, we found that &#947;&#8208;oxoalkyl substituted cyclohexenone derivatives (OAC) possessing a quaternary carbon are a useful key intermediate to derive both congested fused [5,6] rings and spirocycles. For this purpose, we have established an efficient synthetic method to obtain OAC by tertiary alkylation of &#946;&#8208;methylcyclohexenone derivatives using &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds as a tertiary alkyl source. The key to the success of this reaction is controlling the reactivity of the dienamine intermediate. While there have been many reports on enamine reactions, dienamine reactions have not been well studied. Herein, we report controlling reactivity of dienamines and molecular diversification from OAC.</dc:description>

Antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT)&#160;offers promise in treating&#160;intracellular bacteria, provided that selective damage to&#160;the bacteria&#160;ranther than host cells can be realized.&#160;According to the different nitroreductase (NTR) levels in mammalian cells and S. aureus, herein NTR&#8208;responsive photosensitizers&#160;(PSs)&#160;(T)CyI&#8208;NO2&#160;were designed and synthesized. The emission and 1O2&#160;generation of (T)CyI&#8208;NO2&#160;are quenched by the 4&#8208;nitrobenzyl group, but can be specifically switched on by bacterial NTR.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemodivergent Coupling of Alcohols: Efficient Routes to Access &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Ketones and &#945;&#8208;Substituted Chalcones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemodivergent (de)hydrogenative coupling of primary and secondary alcohols is achieved utilizing an inexpensive nickel catalyst, (6&#8208;OH&#8208;bpy)NiCl2. This protocol demonstrates the synthesis of branched carbonyl compounds, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones, and &#945;&#8208;substituted chalcones via borrowing hydrogen strategy and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling, respectively. A wide range of aryl&#8208;based secondary alcohols are coupled with various primary alcohols in this tandem dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reaction. The nickel catalyst, along with KOtBu or K2CO3, governed the selectivity for the formation of branched saturated ketones or chalcones. A preliminary mechanistic investigation confirms the reversible dehydrogenation of alcohols to carbonyls via metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) and the involvement of radical intermediates during the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of Dinitrogen Trioxide for Organic Synthesis: A Phase Equilibrium Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3) is a potent nitrosating agent featured with high reactivity and appealing atom economy. Because of its instability and the entanglement of chemical and phase equilibria, N2O3 has rarely been utilized in organic synthesis as a stock reagent with well&#8208;defined composition. In this review, the preparations of pure N2O3 and its concentrated solution (&gt; 0.1 M) are discussed from the aspect of phase equilibrium. Understanding the physical and chemical characteristics of N2O3, along with how reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, molar ratio) interact, plays a crucial role in managing the concentration of N2O3 in the liquid phase. This control holds practical significance in achieving quantitative reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and photophysical characterization of a pH&#8208;sensitive quadracyclic uridine (qU) analogue</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent base analogues (FBAs) have become useful tools for applications in biophysical chemistry, chemical biology, live&#8208;cell imaging, and RNA therapeutics. Herein, two synthetic routes towards a novel FBA of uracil named qU (quadracyclic uracil/uridine) are described. The qU nucleobase bears a tetracyclic fused ring system and is designed to allow for specific Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing with adenine. We find that qU absorbs light in the visible region of the spectrum and emits brightly with a quantum yield of 27% and a dual&#8208;band character in a wide pH range. With evidence, among other things, from fluorescence lifetime measurements we suggest that this dual emission feature results from an excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) process. Furthermore, we find that both absorption and emission of qU are highly sensitive to pH. The high brightness in combination with excitation in the visible and pH responsiveness makes qU an interesting native&#8208;like nucleic acid label in spectroscopy and microscopy applications in, for example, the field of mRNA and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tethering of a stereogenic Tr&#246;ger's base to a curved hexaparaphenylene has led to the synthesis of the homochiral nanohoop TB[6]CPP. This nanohoop possesses a C2 symmetrical structure, which gives rise to pale blue emission with a high quantum yield of ca. 0.69 and shows chiroptical properties, especially circular polarized luminescence with a moderate dissymmetry factor (|glum|) of 2.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Sensitive Switchable Sensors for Hydroxide on Glass Surfaces Based on Isoquinolinium&#8208;Quinolinium&#8208;substituted&#160; Acetylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bi&#8208;substituted acetylenes with a quinolinium and an &#160;isoquinolinium substituent are described, which reversibly form intensely colored adducts with O&#8208;nucleophiles and thus enable the detection of &gt;0,5 ppm hydroxide on the surfaces of various glasses. Acids reconstitute the colorless bi&#8208;substituted acetylenes. The quinolinium and isoquinolinium rings are bound via their 2&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 4&#8208; and 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 4&#8208;positions to the triple bond, respectively. The choice of substitution sites of the hetarenium rings enables the design of mixed conjugated/cross&#8208;conjugated p&#8208;electron systems. Depending on the combination of binding sites, the frontier orbital profile, the triple bond polarization, the fluorescence behaviour, and the sensitivity to hydroxide differs.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of GanodermaMeroterpenoids Cochlearol B and Its Congeners Driven by Structural Similarity and Biological Homology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Secondary metabolites that have the same biological origin must share some relationship in their biosynthesis. Exploring this relationship has always been a significant task for synthetic biologists. However, from the perspective of synthetic chemists, it is equally important to propose, prove, or refute potential biosynthetic pathways in order to elucidate and understand the biosynthesis of homologous secondary metabolites. In this study, driven by the high structural similarity between the homologous Ganoderma meroterpenoids cochlearol B and ganocin B, two chemically synthetic strategies were designed and investigated sequentially for the synthesis of cochlearol B from ganocin B. These strategies include intramolecular metal catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and intramolecular photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. The aim was to reveal their potential biosynthetic conversion relationship using chemical synthesis methods. As a result, a highly efficient total synthesis of cochlearol B, cochlearol T, cochlearol F, as well as the formal total synthesis of ganocins A&#8208;B, and ganocochlearins C&#8208;D, has been achieved. Additionally, a novel synthetic approach for the synthesis of 6,6&#8208;disubstituted 6H&#8208;dibenzo[b,d]pyran and its analogues has been developed through palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type/cross coupling cascade reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Photochemical Preparation of CdS/Poly(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;MAA) Composite with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper presents a one&#8208;step photochemical method for the preparation of CdS/Poly(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;MAA) composite&#160;photocatalyst, based on the concept of simultaneous photocatalytic polymerization of organic monomers during UV&#8208;light induced formation of CdS. The preparation is carried out in an aqueous solution of Na2S2O3, CdSO4, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA), under a UV lamp. The continuously formed CdS particles with photocatalytic activity act the role of initiator to directly initiate the copolymerization of MMA and MAA, resulting in the in situ formation of the composite and full contact of the CdS particles with the oxygen&#8208;containing groups in the polymer. Taking the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue as a case study, the composite exhibited significantly higher activity under simulated solar light compared to the pure CdS. By analysis on various data, the enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption, and especially the high electron&#8208;hole separation efficiency caused by the electrostatic interaction between photogenerated holes and carbonyl oxygen atoms with negatively charged features. Furthermore, the composite displays excellent sunlight activity and recyclability, suggesting its potential for practical applications. Such a one&#8208;step construction strategy relying only on photo&#8208;energy is green, low&#8208;cost and promising in obtaining high&#8208;performance semiconductor/polymer composite photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalysed Direct Arylation of Distyrylbenzene: Strong Dual&#8208;state Fluorescence and Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distyrylbenzenes (DSBs) are well&#8208;known for their strong multicolour fluorescence. Fluorescence tuning of DSB via further functionalization/arylation, on the other hand, is uncommon. This paper reports a Pd&#8208;catalysed direct arylation approach for introducing different aryl groups onto fluorobenzene&#8208;containing DSB moiety (7) in high yields (67&#8208;72%). The versatile methodology allows the substitution of neutral, electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich aryl groups. The electron&#8208;deficient aryls render mono&#8208;substitution, while the electron&#8208;rich counterparts promote di&#8208;substitution. The compounds (1&#8208;6) show blue, green, and yellow fluorescence in both the solution and solid states; the fluorescence quantum yields reach 100% and the peak maxima span from 425 to 560 nm. The mono&#8208;carbazole DSB(5) exhibit white light emission(WLM) in polar solvents (acetone, DMF, CH3CN, DMSO and NMP) with very high fluorescence quantum yields(&#981;f) of 60&#8208;80%. For WLM, such high efficiency (&#981;f) is somewhat uncommon. Moreover, visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR reversible electrochromism is demonstrated by the TPA&#8208;integrated DSB(6). The colour of 6 changes from pristine light yellow to orange, and the absorption maxima shifts from 372 to 1500 nm when a positive potential of 1.0 V vs Ag/Ag+ is applied. Moreover, the system shows high colouration efficiency in the NIR region with fast switching speeds for colouration and decolouration as fast as 0.98s and 1.05s.</dc:description>
