         <title>Axial Coordination Engineering on Fe&#8210;N&#8210;C Materials for Oxygen Reduction: Insights from Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Axial coordination engineering has emerged as an effective strategy to regulate the catalytic performance of metal&#8210;N&#8210;C materials for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the ORR mechanism and activity changes of their active centers modified by axial ligands are still unclear. Here, a comprehensive investigation of the ORR on a series of FeN4&#8210;L moieties (L stands for an axial ligand) is performed using advanced density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The axial ligand has a substantial effect on the electronic structure and catalytic activity of the FeN4 center. Specially, FeN4&#8210;C6H5 is screened as a promising active moiety with superior ORR activity, as further revealed by constant&#8208;potential calculations and kinetic analysis. The enhanced activity is attributed to the weakened *OH adsorption caused by the altered electronic structure. Moreover, microkinetic modeling shows that at pH = 1, FeN4&#8210;C6H5 possesses an impressive theoretical half&#8208;wave potential of ~1.01 V, superior to the pristine Fe&#8210;N&#8210;C catalysts (~0.88 V) calculated at the same level. These findings advance the understanding of the ORR mechanism of FeN4&#8210;L and provide guidance for optimizing the ORR performance of single&#8208;metal&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Catalyzed Conjugate Additions to &#946;&#8208;Nitroacrylates &#8211; Steric Bulk Increases the Reaction Rate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The organocatalytic conjugate addition of aldehydes to &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates provides direct access to &#946;&#8208;ester&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes and, thereby, common structural motifs of many bioactive compounds. However, the deactivation of amine&#8208;based catalysts by alkylation with the highly electrophilic nitroacrylates hampers this reaction. Here, we show that the peptide H&#8208;Mep&#8208;dPro&#8208;dGlu&#8208;NH2, which is reluctant to under alkylation,&#160;catalyzes this reaction at low catalyst loading (0.5&#8211;1 mol%) within short reaction times (15&#8211;60 min) to yield a broad range of &#946;&#8208;ester&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes with high stereoselectivity. Kinetic studies revealed that increased steric bulk on the &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylate enhances the reaction rate by hindering catalyst alkylation.</dc:description>

         <title>An imine&#8208;functionalized silicone&#8208;based epoxy coating with stable adhesion and controllable degradation for enhanced marine antifouling and anticorrosion properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofouling and corrosion of submerged equipment caused by marine organisms severely restrict the rapid development of the marine industry. Traditional antifouling or anticorrosion coatings typically serve a sole purpose and exhibit limited degradability upon failure, rendering them inadequate for current demands. Herein, a novel imine&#8208;functionalized command&#8208;degradable bio&#8208;based epoxy coating (SAHPEP&#8208;DDM) with enhanced integrated antifouling and anticorrosion performances was synthesized utilizing 1,3&#8208;bis (3&#8208;aminopropyl)&#8208;1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyldisiloxane and syringaldehyde. Compared with commercial epoxy resins (E51&#8208;DDM) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), the SAHPEP&#8208;DDM coating exhibits superior antifouling and anticorrosion properties due to the existence of &#8208;C=N&#8208; and Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si chain segments in the cross&#8208;linking network. The coating&#160;shows promising resistance against bacteria, algae and proteins, as well as excellent corrosion resistance in artificial seawater. The coating also exhibits excellent chemical resistance in organic solvents as well as neutral and alkaline environments. Moreover, its controlled degradation after&#160;failure can be achieved in acid aqueous solutions through temperature and acidity adjustments, facilitated by the presence of &#8208;C=N&#8208;. This work presents a novel degradable coating successfully coupled the dual functions of antifouling and anticorrosion coatings, avoiding the employment of intermediate coat, indicating vast potential for application in&#160;marine engineering fields.</dc:description>

Traditional antifouling or anticorrosion coatings typically serve a sole purpose and exhibit limited degradability upon failure, rendering them inadequate for current demands. Herein, a novel imine-functionalized command-degradable bio-based epoxy coating (SAHPEP-DDM) with enhanced integrated antifouling and anticorrosion performances was synthesized utilizing 1,3-bis (3-aminopropyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane and syringaldehyde. Compared with commercial epoxy resins (E51-DDM) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), the SAHPEP-DDM coating exhibits superior antifouling and anticorrosion properties due to the existence of -C=N- and Si-O-Si chain segments in the cross-linking network. The coating&#160;shows promising resistance against bacteria, algae and proteins, as well as excellent corrosion resistance in artificial seawater. The coating also exhibits excellent chemical resistance in organic solvents as well as neutral and alkaline environments.

Abstract
An efficient and practical method was developed for the synthesis of C2&#8208;symmetric 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;1&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;diol ligands. The disclosed synthesis involves the Ullmann homocoupling of a keto bromo&#8208;pyridine under NiCl2/Zn/PPh3 conditions, followed by the stereoselective double hydrogen transfer to the obtained 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;diketone using RuII Noyori&#8211;Ikariya catalysts. This approach allowed the successful synthesis of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;1&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;diol, i.e (S,S)&#8208;Bolm's ligand, with a quantitative yield and an excellent stereoselectivity (ee&gt;99.5&#8201;%, de&gt;99.5&#8201;%), with an overall yield of 69&#8201;% from easily accessible starting materials.

         <title>Complex Biophysical and Computational Analyses of G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligands: The Porphyrin Stacks Back</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), as non&#8208;canonical DNA structures, attract a great deal of research interest in the molecular biology as well as in the material science fields. The use of small molecules as ligands for G&#8208;quadruplexes has emerged as a tool to regulate gene expression and telomeres maintenance. Meso&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin (TMPyP4) was shown as one of the first ligands for G&#8208;quadruplexes and it is still widely used. We report an investigation comprising molecular docking and dynamics, synthesis and multiple spectroscopic and spectrometric determinations on simple cationic porphyrins and their interaction with different DNA sequences. The study allowed to synthesize a few compounds that have shown to interact with DNA; the detailed characterization has shown that the presence of amide groups at the periphery improves selectivity for parallel G4s binding over other structures. Taking into account the ease of synthesis, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(1&#8208;acetamido&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin bromide could be considered a better alternative to TMPyP4 in studies involving G4 binding.</dc:description>

         <title>An Electrosynthesis of 1,3,4&#8208;Oxadiazoles from N&#8208;Acyl Hydrazones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole is a widely encountered motif in the areas of pharmaceuticals, materials, and agrochemicals. This work has established a mild, mediated electrochemical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from N&#8208;acyl hydrazones. Using DABCO as the optimal redox mediator has enabled a mild oxidative cyclisation, without recourse to stoichiometric oxidants. In contrast to previous methods, this indirect electrochemical oxidation has enabled a broad range of substrates to be accessed, with yields of up to 83%, and on gram scale. The simplicity of the method has been further demonstrated by the development of a one&#8208;pot procedure, directly transforming readily available aldehydes and hydrazides into valuable heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Improvement of photocatalytic CO2 reduction with conjugated organic polymers by rational modulation of donor, acceptor and bonding method</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of metal&#8208;free catalysts to convert CO2 into valuable chemicals is very challenging. Here, we synthesized a conjugated organic polymer (TpTf&#8208;1) featuring 2,4,6&#8208;Triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Triazine as the acceptor unit, triphenylamine as the donor unit, and vinylidene bond as the linkage. The local structure of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) forms an intramolecular electric field that can promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and charges, meanwhile, the vinylidene bond can further change the charge distribution to promote exciton dissociation. Without the use of photosensitizers, the TpTf&#8208;1 exhibits outstanding selectivity of CO of up to 91.96%, with a production rate of 45.2 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 at visible light, which is 3.4&#8208;fold than TaTf&#8208;1 with the same D&#8208;A structure but linking in imine bond and is 2.8&#8208;fold than TpTf&#8208;2 linking in vinylidene bond but with a different donor unit. Moreover, TpTf&#8208;1 has a CO production rate of up to 117.3 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 under full wavelength light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Conduction via Water and Ammonia Coordinated Metal Cationic Species in MOF and MHOF Platforms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and metalo hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MHOFs) are designed as promising solid&#8208;state proton conductors by incorporating various protonic species intrinsically or extrinsically, design and development of such materials by employing the concept of proton conduction through coordinated polar protic solvent is largely unexplored. Herein, we have constructed two proton&#8208;conducting materials having different solvent coordinated metal cationic species: In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF, ({[In(H2O)6][In3(Pzdc)6]&#183;15H2O}n; H2Pzdc: pyrazine&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarboxylic acid) with coordinated water molecules from hexaaquaindium cationic species, and MHOF&#8208;4, ([{Co(NH3)6}2(2,6&#8208;NDS)2(H2O)2]n; 2,6&#8208;H2NDS: 2,6&#8208;naphthalenedisulfonic acid) with coordinated ammonia from hexaammoniacobalt cationic species. Interestingly, higher proton conductivity was achieved for In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF (1.5 &#215; 10&#8208;5 S cm&#8208;1) than MHOF&#8208;4 (6.3 &#215; 10&#8208;6 S cm&#8208;1) under the extreme conditions (80 &#186;C and 95% RH), which could be attributed to enhanced acidity of coordinated water molecules having much lower pKa value than that of coordinated ammonia. Greater charge polarization on hydrogen atoms of In3+&#8208;coordinated water molecules than that of Co2+&#8208;coordinated ammonia led to the high conductivity of In&#8208;H2O&#8208;MOF, as evident by quantum chemical studies. Such a comparative study on metal&#8208;coordinated protic polar solvents in achieving proton conduction in crystalline solids is yet to be made.</dc:description>

         <title>Neptunyl Pyrrophen Complexes: Exploring Schiff Base Chemistry with Multidentate Acyclic Ligands and Transuranics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first two neptunyl&#8208;pyrrophen compounds. Formerly synthesized with uranyl, these unique hexadentate ligands readily coordinate equatorially with neptunyl ions. The crystal structure is determined, and diffuse reflectance and FTIR spectra are measured. Scrutiny is placed on the NpO2L1 compound which is determined to exist as a mixed valence species of Np(V/VI).







Abstract
We report the synthesis, structure, and characterization of two novel neptunyl complexes (NpO2L1 and NpO2L2) constructed from phenylene&#8208;substituted benzyl ester bis(pyrrole)phenylenediamine (named &#8220;pyrrophen&#8221;) ligands. In both cases, the neptunium center exists in the +6 oxidation state,. As our specific interest is in exploring the chemistry of neptunium compounds containing the linear neptunyl ion (NpO22+) through equatorially coordinating the metal by multidentate organic ligands, we have identified the differences that are likely to cause discrepancy between the two complexes by examining the ions and their coordinative environments through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, diffuse reflectance, and Raman spectroscopy. This is the first time pyrrophen has been utilized in Np chemistry and demonstrates a new platform to study 5&#8201;f electron participation and coordination.

         <title>Recent Toolboxes for Chemoselective Dual Modifications of Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity to synthesize complex protein conjugates functionalized with two or more distinct moieties has revolutionized the field of chemical biology. This review summarizes contemporary chemical biology tools for protein dual chemical modifications, along with the discussion of their respective advantages, limitations, and potential future directions within this rapidly evolving area.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective chemical modifications of proteins have emerged as a potent technology in chemical biology, materials science, and medicine, facilitating precise manipulation of proteins with tailored functionalities for basic biology research and developing innovative therapeutics. Compared to traditional recombinant expression methods, one of the prominent advantages of chemical protein modification lies in its capacity to decorate proteins with a wide range of functional moieties, including non&#8208;genetically encoded ones, enabling the generation of novel protein conjugates with enhanced or previously unexplored properties. Among these, approaches for dual or multiple modifications of proteins are increasingly garnering attention, as it has been found that single modification of proteins is inadequate to meet current demands. Therefore, in light of the rapid developments in this field, this review provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in chemical and biological approaches for dual functionalization of proteins. It further discusses their advantages, limitations, and potential future directions in this relatively nascent area.

Among these, approaches for dual or multiple modifications of proteins are increasingly garnering attention, as it has been found that single modification of proteins is inadequate to meet current demands. Therefore, in light of the rapid developments in this field, this review provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in chemical and biological approaches for dual functionalization of proteins. It further discusses their advantages, limitations, and potential future directions in this relatively nascent area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Dinitrogen Reduction to Ammonia Using Easily Reducible N&#8208;Fused Cobalt Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, based on easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins, have been developed for dinitrogen reduction to ammonia. Faradic efficiencies have been achieved in the 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% range with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at room temperature and neutral pH conditions. Mild reaction conditions for dinitrogen electro&#8208;reduction are accomplished.







Abstract
Single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, especially those that perform catalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, are highly desirable to derive fundamental structure&#8208;activity relations and as potential alternatives to the current energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch ammonia production process. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental evidence, it has been shown that easily reducible cobalt porphyrins catalyze the six&#8208;electron, six&#8208;proton reduction of dinitrogen to NH3 at neutral pH and under ambient conditions. Two easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF and CoNHF(Br)2 &#8211; reveal NRR activity with Faradic efficiencies between 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Contrary to this, much harder&#8208;to&#8208;reduce N&#8208;fused porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF(Ph)2 and CoNHF(PE)2 &#8211; reveal no NRR activity. The present study highlights the significance of tuning the redox and structural properties of single&#8208;site NRR electrocatalysts for improved NRR activity under mild conditions.

         <title>Neutral and Anion Species of Quinoidal Thienothiophene Diketopyrrolopyrroles Display a Common Aggregation Mode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diketopyrrolopyrrol quinoidal oligomers aggregate in a very similar way in the neutral state and in the dimer dianion states due to an uniform distribution of the electron charge excess between the two molecules in the dimer dianion.







Abstract
A comprehensive investigation of two new molecular triads incorporating the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit into a quinoidized thienothiophene skeleton, which is further end&#8208;capped with dicyanomethylene (DPP&#8208;TT&#8208;CN) or phenoxyl groups (DPP&#8208;TT&#8208;PhO), has been carried out. A combination of UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and infrared spectroelectrochemical techniques and cryogenic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption spectroscopy supported by theoretical calculations has been used. The main result is the formation of similar H&#8208;aggregates in the dimerization process of the neutral molecules and of the charged anionic species. The experimental absorption spectra of the aggregated species are accurately reproduced by quantum chemical calculations using the Spano's model, including excitonic coupling for the dimeric forms and full vibronic resolution of the absorption bands. The strong excitonic coupling taking place is key to understand the electronic structure of the dimeric species and has been instrumental to disentangle the type of H&#8208;aggregation. This study is of relevance to get a better understanding of the molecular aggregation of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores and is useful as a guideline for the refinement of the engineering of molecular materials for which supramolecular design is required.

         <title>Tuning The Intracellular Distribution of [3+2+1] Iridium(III) Complexes In Bacterial And Mammalian Cells By iClick Reaction With Biomolecular Carriers Functionalized With Alkynone Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;The colour and intracellular distribution of iridium(III) complexes is tuned by iClick conjugation of different biomolecular carriers&#8221;. The iClick (inorganic click) reaction enables a modular modification of iridium(III) complexes with ancillary triazolato ligands carrying biological targeting groups like biotin and cholic acid. The stability and non&#8208;toxicity of these compounds facilitates their use as biological imaging probes in bacterial and human cancer cells. Their intracellular localization can be tuned by proper peripheral functionalization of the complexes.







Abstract
Three iridium(III) triazolato complexes of the general formula [Ir(triazolatoR,R&#8217;)(ppy)(terpy)]PF6 with ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine and terpy=2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terpyridine were efficiently prepared by iClick reaction of [Ir(N3)(ppy)(terpy)]PF6, with alkynes and alkynones, which allowed facile introduction of biological carriers such as biotin and cholic acid. In contrast to the precursor azido complex, which decomposed upon photoexcitation on a very short time scale, the triazolato complexes were stable in solution for up to 48&#8197;h. They emit in the spectral region around 540&#8197;nm with a quantum yield of 15&#8211;35&#8201;% in aerated acetonitrile solution and exhibit low cytotoxicity with IC50 values &gt;50&#8197;&#956;M for most complexes in L929 and HeLa cells, demonstrating their high suitability as luminescent probes. Cell uptake studies with confocal luminescence microscopy in prokaryotic Gram&#8208;positive S. aureus and Gram&#8208;negative E. coli bacteria as well as eukaryotic mammalian L929 and HeLa cells showed significant uptake in particular of the cholic acid conjugates iridium(III) moiety and distinct intracellular distribution modulated by the nature of the peripheral functional groups that can easily be modified by the iClick reaction.

         <title>Skeletal Editing by Hypervalent Iodine Mediated Nitrogen Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodonitrene (ArI=NR) is a highly reactive species that is commonly employed in a single&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;atom insertion reaction and skeletal editing for generating N&#8208;heterocycles. Skeletal editing with reactive iodonitrene intermediates has recently emerged as a powerful strategy in modern synthesis. In this review, we address the rapidly expanding field of nitrene insertion, which includes skeletal editing and nitrogen insertion, the use of hypervalent iodine compounds to access nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and our present understanding of the process.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine reagents are versatile and readily accessible reagents that have been extensively applied in contemporary synthesis in modern organic chemistry. Among them, iodonitrene (ArI=NR), is a powerful reactive species, widely used for a single&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;atom insertion reaction, and skeletal editing to construct N&#8208;heterocycles. Skeletal editing with reactive iodonitrene components has recently emerged as an exciting approach in modern chemical transformation. These reagents have been extensively used to produce biologically relevant heterocycles and functionalized molecular architectures. Recently, the insertion of a nitrogen&#8208;atom into hydrocarbons to generate N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds using hypervalent iodine reagents has been a significant focus in the field of molecular editing reactions. In this review, we discuss the rapidly emerging field of nitrene insertion, including skeletal editing and nitrogen insertion, using hypervalent iodine reagents to access nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and the current mechanistic understanding of these processes.

Replacing traditional aqueous reaction media with non&#8208;conventional solvents shows great potential for enhancing the sustainability of enzyme catalysis and addressing issues in large&#8208;scale production applications. This review highlights significant advancements in using non&#8208;conventional media, such as organic green solvents and Deep Eutectic Solvents, to produce chiral amines with high yields and enantiomeric excesses, as well as to enable chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascades.







Abstract
The application of biocatalysis has become essential in both academic and industrial domains for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines, and it serves as an alternative tool to transition&#8208;metal catalysis and complements traditional chemical methods. It relies on the swift expansion of available processes, primarily as a result of advanced tools for enzyme discovery, combined with high&#8208;throughput laboratory evolution techniques for optimizing biocatalysts. This concept paper explores the utilization of non&#8208;conventional media such as ether&#8208;type solvents, deep eutectic solvents, and micellar catalysis to enhance biocatalytic reactions for chiral amine synthesis. Each section focuses on the unique properties of these media, including their ability to stabilize enzymes, alter substrate solubility, and modulate enzyme selectivity. The paper aims to provide insights into how these innovative media can overcome traditional limitations, offering new avenues for sustainable and efficient chiral amine production through biocatalytic processes.

         <title>A Peptide Strategy for Inhibiting Different Protein Aggregation Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
General peptide inhibitors of protein aggregation were developed by discovering the molecular determinants of inherent anti&#8208;aggregation activity. Substitutions maximizing &#960;&#8208;stacking, H&#8208;bonding and flexibility further enhanced the potency of natural inhibitors. So&#8208;designed peptides potently inhibited unrelated proteins aggregating via different mechanisms ranging from amorphous aggregation to Tau and Huntingtin amyloid aggregation.







Abstract
Protein aggregation correlates with many human diseases. Protein aggregates differ in structure and shape. Strategies to develop effective aggregation inhibitors that reach the clinic failed so far. Here, we developed a family of peptides targeting early aggregation stages for both amorphous and fibrillar aggregates of proteins unrelated in sequence and structure. They act on dynamic precursors before mechanistic differentiation takes place. Using peptide arrays, we first identified peptides inhibiting the amorphous aggregation of a molten globular, aggregation&#8208;prone mutant of the Axin tumor suppressor. Optimization revealed that the peptides activity did not depend on their sequences but rather on their molecular determinants: a composition of 20&#8211;30&#8201;% flexible, 30&#8211;40&#8201;% aliphatic and 20&#8211;30&#8201;% aromatic residues, a hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity ratio close to 1, and an even distribution of residues of different nature throughout the sequence. The peptides also suppressed fibrillation of Tau, a disordered protein that forms amyloids in Alzheimer's disease, and slowed down that of Huntingtin Exon1, an amyloidogenic protein in Huntington's disease, both entirely unrelated to Axin. Our compounds thus target early stages of different aggregation mechanisms, inhibiting both amorphous and amyloid aggregation. Such cross&#8208;mechanistic, multi&#8208;targeting aggregation inhibitors may be lead compounds for developing drug candidates against various protein aggregation diseases.

         <title>Origins of Temperature&#8208;Dependent Anomeric Selectivity in Glycosylations with an L&#8211;Idose Thioglycoside</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>

Computational modelling reveals the key mechanistic details explaining why glycosylations involving L&#8208;idose thioglycoside donors, and potentially also a wide range of other donors, become increasingly &#945;&#8208;selective as the temperature is raised.







Abstract
L&#8211;Idose thioglycosides are useful glycosyl donors for the construction of glycosaminoglycan oligosaccharides. When activated with NIS and catalytic TMSOTf in the presence of methanol, the stereoselectivity of O&#8208;glycosylation displays an intriguing dependence on the reaction temperature, with an increased preference for formation of the &#945;&#8208;glycoside at higher temperatures. Using a combination of vt&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we show how a simple mechanistic model, based on competing reactions of the iodinated thioglycoside, can explain the main features of the temperature dependence. In this model, the increased selectivity at high temperature is attributed to differences among the entropy and energy terms of the competing reaction pathways. Neighbouring&#8208;group participation (giving an intermediate acyloxonium ion) plays an increasingly dominant role as temperature is raised. The general features of this kinetic regime may also apply more broadly to other glycosylations that likewise favour &#945;&#8208;glycoside formation at high temperature.

         <title>Redox Transformations of the OX063 Radical in Biological Media: Oxidative Decay of Initial Trityl with Further Formation of Structurally&#8208;Modified TAM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied in details redox reactions of OX063 radical in biological media. These reactions can introduce distortions into EPR oximetry data derived for objects under hypoxia, and they may possibly pose obstacles to the successful application of TAMs to spin&#8208;labeling of biopolymers for experiments in&#8197;vivo or in the cell. The use of 13C labeling to track these reactions is described.







Abstract
Being a low&#8208;toxic and hydrophilic representative of TAM, OX063 has shown its suitability for in&#8208;vivo and in&#8208;cell EPR experiments and design of spin labels. Using 13C labeling, we investigated the course of oxidative degradation of OX063 into quinone&#8208;methide (QM) under the influence of superoxide as well as further thiol&#8208;promoted reduction of QM into TAM radical, which formally corresponds to substitution of a carboxyl function by a hydroxyl group. We found these transformations being quantitative in model reactions mimicking specific features of biological media and confirmed the presence of these reactions in the blood and liver homogenate of mice in&#8197;vitro. The emergence of the trityl with the hydroxyl group can be masked by an initial TAM in EPR spectra and may introduce distortions into EPR&#8208;derived oximetry data if they have been obtained for objects under hypoxia. 13C labeling allows one to detect its presence, considering its different hyperfine splitting constant on 13C1 (2.04&#8197;mT) as compared to OX063 (2.30&#8197;mT). The potential involvement of these reactions should be considered when using TAM in spin&#8208;labeling of biopolymers intended for subsequent EPR experiments, as well as in the successful application of TAM in experiments in&#8197;vivo and in cell.

         <title>Intramolecular Cyclization and a Retro&#8208;Ene Reaction Enable the Rapid Fragmentation of a Vitamin B1&#8208;Derived Breslow Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism has been proposed to explain the rapid fragmentation of a thiamin&#8208;derived Breslow intermediate. Extensive DFT analyses demonstrate that the cyclization, thiazolium expulsion, and retro&#8208;ene reactions that comprise this mechanism provide a lower energy pathway to fragmentation than the currently accepted mechanism. This improved mechanistic understanding sheds light on how thiamin&#8208;dependent enzymes avoid cofactor fragmentation.







Abstract
In solution, analogues of the Breslow intermediate formed during catalysis by benzoylformate decarboxylase (BFDC) undergo rapid, irreversible fragmentation. The ability of BFDC to prevent this reaction and preserve its cofactor is a striking example of an enzyme &#8216;steering&#8217; a reactive intermediate towards a productive pathway. To understand how BFDC suppresses the off&#8208;pathway reactivity of this Breslow intermediate, a clear mechanistic understanding of the fragmentation reaction is required. Here, DFT calculations reveal an unexpected mechanism for the solution&#8208;phase fragmentation that involves an intramolecular cyclization and a subsequent retro&#8208;ene reaction to release the final products. Free energy profiles demonstrate that this pathway is significantly more facile than the previously proposed mechanism that invoked Breslow intermediate enolates as intermediates. Additional computations have been performed to understand why related Breslow intermediates do not undergo analogous fragmentation reactions. Calculations performed with two closely related Breslow intermediates suggest that subtle differences in the relative values of &#916;G&#8800; for protonation and fragmentation dictate whether a given intermediate will fragment or not. These differences and the fragmentation mechanism unveiled in this work may have ramifications for the mechanism of BFDC and other thiamin&#8208;dependent enzymes and could provide general lessons related to the control of reactive intermediates by enzymes.

These differences and the fragmentation mechanism unveiled in this work may have ramifications for the mechanism of BFDC and other thiamin-dependent enzymes and could provide general lessons related to the control of reactive intermediates by enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition Metal Complexes with Appended Benzimidazole Groups for Sensing Dihydrogenphosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anion recognition behaviour of several emissive metal complexes, with appended benzimidazole groups, is discussed. These show a selective response to both acetate and dihydrogen phosphate: with acetate these complexes appear to adopt a simple one to one adduct, but with dihydrogenphosphate several binding modes are evident dependant on the steric influence of the complex, and the solvent environment.







Abstract
Four new complexes [Ru(bpy)2(bbib)](PF6)2, [Ru(phen)2(bbib)](PF6)2, [Re(CO)3(bbib)(py)](PF6) and [Ir(ppy)2(bbib)](PF6) [where bbib=4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine] have been prepared and their photophysical properties determined. Their behaviour has been studied with a variety of anions in acetonitrile, DMSO and 10&#8201;% aquated DMSO. Acetate and dihydrogenphosphate demonstrate a redshift in the bbib ligand associated absorptions suggesting that the ligand is strongly interacting with these anions. The 3MLCT emissive state is sensitive to the introduction of small quantities of anion (sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities) and significant quenching is typically observed with acetate, although this is less pronounced in the presence of water. The emissive behaviour with dihydrogenphosphate is variable, showing systematic changes as anion concentration increases with several distinct interactions evident. 1H&#8208; and 31P&#8208;NMR titrations in a 10&#8201;% D2O&#8722;DMSO&#8208;D6 mixture suggest that with dihydrogenphosphate, the imidazole group is able to act as both a proton acceptor and donor. It appears that all four complexes can form a {[complex]2&#8208;H2PO4} &#8220;dimer&#8221;, a one&#8208;to&#8208;one species (which the X&#8208;ray crystallography study suggests is dimeric in the solid&#8208;state), and a complex with a combined bis(dihydrogenphosphate) complex anion. The speciation relies on complex equilibria dependent on several factors including the complex charge, the hydrophobicity of the associated ligands, and the solvent.

         <title>DNA Molecular Glue Assisted Bacterial Conjugative Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial conjugation, a widely used method to transfer DNA from the donor to the recipient strains, shows a very low efficiency with the current method. A new technique that employed DNA molecule &#8220;glue&#8221; to connect the donor and recipient bacteria to address this issue has been realized for the first time here, mechanistically different from the reported method of using nanomaterials, exploring a new field for the applications of DNA nanotechnology.







Abstract
Bacterial conjugation, a commonly used method to horizontally transfer functional genes from donor to recipient strains, plays an important role in the genetic manipulation of bacteria for basic research and industrial production. Successful conjugation depends on the donor&#8208;recipient cell recognition and a tight mating junction formation. However, the efficiency of conjugative transfer is usually very low. In this work, we developed a new technique that employed DNA molecule &#8220;glue&#8221; to increase the match frequency and the interaction stability between the donor and recipient cells. We used two E. coli strains, ETZ and BL21, as a model system, and modified them with the complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides by click chemistry. The conjugation efficiency of the modified bacteria was improved more than 4 times from 10&#8201;%&#8211;46&#8201;%. This technique is simple and generalizable as it only relies on the active amino groups on the bacterial surface. It is expected to have broad applications in constructing engineered bacteria.

         <title>Stacking Structure of Vaterite Revealed by Atomic Imaging and Diffraction Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
After a century of discussion, the atomic arrangements of vaterite are fully visualized and described as a layer structure consisting of calcium planes and carbonate (CO32&#8722;)&#8208;containing sheets. The layers are stacked with +60&#176;, &#8722;60&#176;, or 180&#176; rotations from the underlying layer under two constraints: (i) carbonate ions cannot occupy equivalent positions in alternate layers, and (ii) the stacking sequences with orthogonal components are dominated.







Abstract
Anhydrous calcium carbonate crystals exist as three polymorphs: calcite, aragonite, and vaterite. Although vaterite is a metastable phase rarely found in the geological environment, it is intriguing that various biominerals are composed of vaterite. The processes of stable vaterite formation in biological systems cannot be understood without elucidating the nature of vaterite. The crystal structure of vaterite has been discussed for nearly a century but is still an open question. Here we propose the actual structure of vaterite by combining atomic imaging and diffraction analysis with simulations of disordered stacking sequences. Vaterite basically appears as layers of hexagonal calcium planes and carbonate (CO32&#8722;)&#8208;containing sheets stacked with +60&#176;, &#8722;60&#176;, or 180&#176; rotations from the underlying layer. However, equivalent carbonate positions in alternating layers are forbidden, and four&#8208;layer stacking in which the fourth layer rotates 180&#176; relative to the first layer are predominant, forming an orthogonal reciprocal lattice in diffraction patterns. These stacking characteristics replicate the intensity distribution in the electron and X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. This study has almost completely elucidated the crystal structure and stacking sequence of vaterite. Our findings provide insights into the thermodynamic stability of vaterite, which facilitates comprehension of the biomineralization processes and growth dynamics of calcium carbonate.

         <title>Fluorogenic in&#8208;situ Labelling of Gelatin Polymer in Aqueous Solution and Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical fluorogenic gelatin labelling was achieved directly in the aqueous phase using water&#8208;soluble tetraphenylethylene fluorophores via multivalent tetrazolate&#8208;amine electrostatic interactions during macromolecular encapsulation. This strategy allowed the construction of fluorescence&#8208;responsive hydrogel biomaterials exhibiting dynamic behaviors upon salting&#8208;in/out treatments, and enabled high spatio&#8208;temporal imaging of the hydrogel network for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Gelatin polymers made from partially degraded collagen are important biomaterials, but their in&#8208;situ analysis suffers from uncontrollable covalent labelling and poor spatial&#8208;temporal imaging resolution. Herein, three tetrazolate&#8208;tagged tetraphenylethylene fluorophores (TPE&#8722;TAs) are introduced for practical fluorogenic labelling of gelatin in aqueous phase and hydrogels. These probes with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics offer negligible background and elicit turn&#8208;on fluorescence by simply mixing with the gelatin in aqueous phase, giving a detection limit of 0.15&#8197;mg/L over a linear dynamic range up to 100&#8197;mg/L. This method does not work for collagens and causes minimal interference with gelatin properties. Mechanistic studies reveal a key role for multivalent electrostatic interactions between the abundant basic residues in gelatin (e.&#8201;g., lysine, hydroxylysine, arginine) and anionic tetrazolate moieties of the lipophilic fluorophore synergistically in spatially rigid macromolecular encapsulation to achieve fluorogenic labelling. The AIE strategy by forming non&#8208;covalent fluorophore&#8208;gelatin complexes was developed for novel hydrogels that exhibited reversible fluorescence in response to dynamic microstructural changes in the hydrogel scaffold upon salting&#8208;in/out treatments, and enabled high spatial&#8208;temporal imaging of the fiber network in lyophilized samples. This work may open up avenues for in&#8208;situ imaging analysis and evaluation of gelatin&#8208;based biomaterials during processes such as in&#8197;vivo degradation and mineralization.

         <title>Dimers and 2D Networks of Adamantane&#8208;Related Ternary Organosilicon Coinage Metal Sulfide Clusters</title>

Reactions of the organosilicon sulfide cluster [(PhSi)4S6] with [AgCl(PMe2Ph)2]2 or mixtures of MCl (M=Cu or Ag) and a phosphine ligand in CH2Cl2 caused its disassembly and reorganization under incorporation of metal phosphine moieties to form [(Ph3P)3Ag(&#956;&#8208;S)SiCl2Ph], [(PhSiClS2CH2)2(&#956;&#8208;dppb)], [{(dppbCu2)Cu(&#956;&#8211;dppb)0.5(PhSi)3S6}2], and [Na2(thf)1.5][(Me2PhPAg)(PhSi)3S6]. The latter two represent ternary M&#8722;S&#8722;Si&#8208;based clusters with complex crystal structures and wideband semiconductor&#8208;like optical gaps.







Abstract
Adamantane&#8208;type organotin sulfide clusters were recently shown to react with coinage metal phosphine complexes under replacement of an organic substituent by a metal&#8208;phosphine unit. An extension of such studies involving the silicon&#8208;based congener [(PhSi)4S6] (A) revealed that the cluster core will be partly disassembled and a {PhSi} moiety is replaced by a coinage metal phosphine complex to form [(Et3PAg)3(PhSi)3S6] (B) and [Na2(thf)2.33][(Me3PCu)(PhSi)3S6] (C). Herein, we present an extension of this work upon variation of the reactants and reaction conditions. Besides the isolation of crystalline precursor complexes [CuCl(PMe2Ph)3] (1) and [AgCl(PMe2Ph)2]2 (2), the study addresses reactions of A with AgCl and a phosphine ligand in CH2Cl2, upon which A is completely disassembled to form [(Ph3P)3Ag(&#956;&#8208;S)SiCl2Ph] (3). In another case a CH2 group, most likely stemming from CH2Cl2, was attached to the ligand, thus generating [{PhCl(S)SiSCH2P(Ph2)CH2CH2}2] (4). Upon using CuCl and 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (dppb) we isolated the phosphine&#8208;bridged analog of B, [{(dppbCu2)CuP(Ph2)(CH2CH2)(PhSi)3S6}2] (5). In order to receive the yet elusive silver homolog of C, we used PMe2Ph as a bulkier ligand. This way we generated a 2D coordination polymer of the desired composition, [Na2(thf)1.5][(Me2PhPAg)(PhSi)3S6] (6). UV&#8208;visible spectra of 6 indicated a bandgap of 3.89&#8197;eV, thus blue&#8208;shifted in regards to B and C.

         <title>Gold Trifluoromethyl Complexes as Efficient Regioselective Catalysts in Alkyne Hydration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Easy&#8208;access gold (III) complexes containing three trifluoromethyl and a labile ligand (MeCN or THT) are efficient catalysts in hydration of terminal and internal alkynes. The gold fragment &#8220;(CF3)3Au&#8221; induces moderate to notable regioselectivities in hydration of internal asymmetric alkynes.







Abstract
Gold(III) complexes containing trifluoromethyl ligands are efficient catalysts in the hydration of alkynes, operating at low catalyst loadings, without additives, using environmentally friendly solvents and at mild conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C). Hydration of terminal and internal alkynes provides the corresponding ketones in quantitative yields without special precautions as dry solvents or inert atmospheres. Remarkably, hydration of asymmetric internal alkynes proceeds with moderate to notable regioselectivities, providing mixtures of the two possible isomers with ratios up to 90&#8201;:&#8201;10.

         <title>Highly Selective Boron&#8208;Wittig Reaction: A Practical Method to Synthesize Trans&#8208;Aryl Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective Boron&#8208;Wittig reaction for trans&#8208;alkenes has been developed, offering a practical pathway to access diverse trans&#8208;alkenes from readily available carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
Olefins play an essential role in synthetic chemistry, serving not only as important synthons but also as key functional groups in numerous bio&#8208;active molecules. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in the development of more powerful methods for olefins. While the Wittig reaction stands as a prominent choice for olefin synthesis due to its simplicity and the ready availability of raw materials, its limitation lies in the challenge of controlling cis&#8208;trans selectivity, hampering its broader application. In this study, a novel Boron&#8208;Wittig reaction has been developed utilizing gem&#8208;bis(boryl)alkanes and aldehydes as starting materials. This method enables creating favourable intermediates, which possess less steric hindrance, and leading to trans&#8208;olefins via intramolecular O&#8722;B bonds elimination. Notably, synthesis studies have validated its good efficacy in modifying bioactive molecules and synthesizing drug molecules with great trans&#8208;selectivity. Furthermore, the reaction mechanism was elucidated based on intermediate trapping experiments, isotope labelling studies, and kinetic analyses.

         <title>Nature Products Chlorophyll Derivatives for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging and Plant&#8208;Imaging</title>

Chlorophyll, the most well&#8208;known natural product, has applications in a variety of fields, and we have applied it to NIR&#8208;II imaging for the first time, and the results show that it has great potential in plant and biological research.







Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) fluorescence imaging has attracted significant attention in research fields because of its unique advantages compared with conventional optical windows (400&#8211;900&#8197;nm). A variety of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores have been actively studied because they serve as a key component of fluorescence imaging. Among them, organic small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores display outstanding imaging performance and many advantages, but types of small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores with high biocompatibility are still quite limited. Novel molecular scaffolds based NIR&#8208;II dyes are highly desired. Herein, we hypothesized that chlorophyll is a new promising molecular platform for discovery NIR&#8208;II fluorophores. Thus, seven derivatives of derivatives were selected to characterize their optical properties. Interestingly, six chlorophyll derivatives displayed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability. This characteristic allowed the successful NIR&#8208;II imaging of green leaves of various plants. Furthermore, most of these fluorophores showed capacity to monitor viscosity change because of their sensitive for viscosity. For demonstration of its biomedical applications, these probes were successfully used for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided surgical resection of lymph nodes. In summary, chlorophylls are novel valuable tool molecules for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and have potential to expand their applications in biomedical field and plant science.

For demonstration of its biomedical applications, these probes were successfully used for NIR-II fluorescence-guided surgical resection of lymph nodes. In summary, chlorophylls are novel valuable tool molecules for NIR-II fluorescence imaging and have potential to expand their applications in biomedical field and plant science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aerobic Oxidation of PMB Ethers to Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O and TEMPO as cocatalysts and oxygen as green oxidant, PMB ethers have been converted to carboxylic acids at room temperature with high efficiency and selectivity. Total synthesis of naturally occuring (R)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7,9&#8208;octadecadiynoic acid has been realized by applying this protocol as key step. A mechanism involving oxygen&#8208;stabilized benzylic cation has been proposed based on careful studies.







Abstract
The first aerobic protocol of direct transformation of p&#8208;methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers to carboxylic acids efficiently with Fe(NO3)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;9H2O and TEMPO as catalysts at room temperature has been developed. The reaction accommodates C&#8722;Br bond, terminal/non&#8208;terminal C&#8722;C triple bond, amide, cyano, nitro, ester, and trifluoromethyl groups. Even highly selective oxidative deprotection of different benzylic PMB ethers has been realized. The reaction has been successfully applied to the total synthesis of natural product, (R)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7,9&#8208;octadecadiynoic acid, demonstrating the practicality of the method. Based on experimental studies, a possible mechanism involving oxygen&#8208;stabilized benzylic cation has been proposed.

         <title>Aromaticity in the Spectroscopic Spotlight of Hexaphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through TD&#8208;DFT calculations, aromaticity descriptors, and chemical compound space maps, we connected the spectroscopic fingerprints of functionalized hexaphyrins to the macrocycle's aromaticity. While the intensity of the Q&#8208;band in the NIR region is well described by (&#916;HOMO&#8211;&#916;LUMO)2 and not by their aromaticity descriptors, highly planar and hexaphyrin structures showing large aromaticity and antiaromaticity exhibit an intense B&#8208;band.







Abstract
Spectroscopic properties are commonly used in the experimental evaluation of ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state aromaticity in expanded porphyrins. Herein, we investigate if the defining photophysical properties still hold for a diverse set of hexaphyrins with varying redox states, topologies, peripheral substitutions, and core&#8208;modifications. By combining TD&#8208;DFT calculations with several aromaticity descriptors and chemical compound space maps, the intricate interplay between structural planarity, aromaticity, and absorption spectra is elucidated. Our results emphasize that the general assumption that antiaromatic porphyrinoids exhibit significantly attenuated absorption bands as compared to aromatic counterparts does not hold even for the unsubstituted hexaphyrin macrocycles. To connect the spectroscopic properties to the hexaphyrins&#8217; aromaticity behaviour, we analyzed chemical compound space maps defined by the various aromaticity indices. The intensity of the Q&#8208;band is not well described by the macrocyclic aromaticity. Instead, the degeneracy of the frontier molecular orbitals, the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, and the |&#916;HOMO&#8211;&#916;LUMO|2 values appear to be better indicators to identify hexaphyrins with enhanced light&#8208;absorbing abilities in the near&#8208;infrared region. Regions with highly planar hexaphyrin structures, both aromatic and antiaromatic, are characterized by an intense B&#8208;band. Hence, we advise using a combination of global and local aromaticity descriptors rooted in different criteria to assess the aromaticity of expanded porphyrins instead of solely relying on the absorption spectra.

         <title>Fluorescence of Aggregated Aromatic Peptides for Studying the Kinetics of Aggregation and Hardening of Amyloid&#8208;like Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic fluorescence anisotropy of peptide based amyloid&#8208;like structures gives clues about kinetics of aggregation and hardening of these supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
The capability of amyloid&#8208;like peptide fibers to emit intrinsic&#8208;fluorescence enables the study of their formation, stability and hardening through time&#8208;resolved fluorescence analysis, without the need for additional intercalating dyes. This approach allows the monitoring of amyloid&#8208;like peptides aggregation kinetics using minimal sample volumes, and the simultaneous testing of numerous experimental conditions and analytes, offering rapid and reproducible results. The analytical procedure applied to the aromatic hexapeptide F6, alone or derivatized with PEG (polyethylene glycol) moiety of different lengths, suggests that aggregation into large anisotropic structures negatively correlates with initial monomer concentration and relies on the presence of charged N&#8208; and C&#8208;termini. PEGylation reduces the extent of aggregates hardening, possibly by retaining water, and overall impacts the final structural properties of the aggregates.

         <title>Amorphous Strategy and Doping Copper on Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Surface for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2H4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous MOF was prepared by using the regulator, which significantly improved the carrier separation efficiency and the selectivity of multi&#8208;electron products. The addition of surfactants effectively alleviates the agglomeration of MOF, further improve the carrier separation efficiency and promote the formation of ethylene products. Finally, copper doping and amorphous MOF cooperate to improve the yield of ethylene products.







Abstract
Amorphous photocatalysts are characterized by numerous grain boundaries and abundant unsaturated sites, which enhance reaction efficiency from both kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. However, amorphization strategies have rarely been used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Doping copper onto a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surface can regulate the electronic structure of photocatalysts, promote electron transfer from the MOF to Cu, and improve the separation efficiency of electron&#8208;hole pairs. In this study, an amorphous photocatalyst MOFw&#8208;p/Cu containing highly dispersed Cu (0, I, II) sites was designed and synthesized by introducing a regulator and in&#8197;situ copper species during the nucleation process of MOF (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2). Various characterizations confirmed that the Cu species were anchored to the organometallic skeleton of the surface amorphization MOF structure. The synergistic effect of Cu doping and surface amorphization in MOFw&#8208;p/Cu can significantly enhance the CO and CH4 yields while promoting the formation of the multicarbon product C2H4. The approach holds promise for developing novel, highly efficient MOFs as photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction, enabling the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2 products.

The increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled amino acids and derivatives has heightened interest in direct hydrogen/deuterium exchange reactions of free amino acids. Existing methods, including biocatalysis and metal catalysis, typically require expensive deuterium sources or excessive use of deuterium reagents and often struggle with site selectivity. In contrast, this binary catalysis system, employing benzaldehyde and Cs2CO3 in the presence of inexpensive D2O with minimal stoichiometric quantities, facilitates efficient hydrogen/deuterium exchange at the &#945;&#8208;position of amino acids without the need for protecting groups in the polar aprotic solvent DMSO. The process is highly compatible with most natural and non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and derivatives, even those with potentially reactive functionalities. This advancement not only addresses the cost and efficiency concerns of existing methods but also significantly broadens the applicability and precision of deuterium labeling in biochemical research.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Chain Hydrosilylation of Alkenes Enabled by Triplet Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light&#8208;triggered organophotocatalytic hydrosilylation of alkenes and alkynes, which proceeds via a triplet energy transfer (EnT)&#8208;enabled radical chain pathway, has been developed.







Abstract
Development of mild, robust and metal&#8208;free catalytic approach for the hydrosilylation of alkenes is critical to the advancement of modern organosilicon chemistry given their powerful capacity in the construction of various C&#8722;Si bonds. Herein, we wish to disclose a visible light&#8208;triggered organophotocatalytic strategy, which proceeds via a triplet energy transfer (EnT)&#8208;enabled radical chain pathway. Notably, this redox&#8208;neutral protocol is capable of accommodating a broad spectrum of electron&#8208;deficient and &#8208;rich alkenes with excellent functional group compatibility. Electron&#8208;deficient alkenes are more reactive and the reaction could be finished within a couple of minutes even in PBS solution with extremely low concentration, which suggests its click&#8208;like potential in organic synthesis. The preparative power of the transformations has been further highlighted in a number of complex settings, including the late&#8208;stage functionalization and scale&#8208;up experiments. Furthermore, although only highly reactive (TMS)3SiH is suitable hydrosilane substrate, our studies revealed the great reactivity and versatility of (TMS)3Si&#8722; group in diverse C&#8722;Si and Si&#8722;Si bond cleavage&#8208;based transformations, enabling the rapid introduction of diverse functional groups and the facile construction of valuable quaternary silicon architectures.

         <title>Uncatalyzed Diboron Activation by a Strained Hydrocarbon: Experimental and Theoretical Study of [1.1.1]Propellane Diborylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report reveals that a special apolar hydrocarbon can activate a boron&#8208;boron bond to produce its electrophilic diborylation. Interestingly, this unique reaction occurs with surprising ease within minutes at room temperature, and its detailed mechanistic study has revealed several disruptive features in the context of both propellane and diboron chemistries.







Abstract
The synthesis of strained carbocyclic building blocks is relevant for Medicinal Chemistry, and methylenecyclobutanes are particularly challenging with current synthetic technology. Careful inspection of the reactivity of [1.1.1]propellane and diboron reagents has revealed that bis(catecholato)diboron (B2cat2) can produce a bis(borylated) methylenecyclobutane in a few minutes at room temperature. This reaction constitutes the first example of B&#8722;B bond activation by a special apolar hydrocarbon and also the first time that propellane is electrophilically activated by boron. Mechanistic studies including in&#8197;situ NMR kinetics and DFT calculations demonstrate that the diboron moiety can be directly activated through coordination with the inverted sigma bond of propellane, and reveal that DMF is involved in the stabilization of diboronate ylide intermediates rather than the activation of the B&#8722;B bond. These results enable new possibilities for both diboron and propellane chemistry, and for further developments in the synthesis of methylenecyclobutanes based on propellane strain release.

We present a novel hydrazone&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor covalent organic polymer ETBC&#8208;PyHz, as an efficient photocatalyst for an oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving C&#8722;S bond formation. This environment&#8208;friendly method does not require a metal&#8208;based catalyst and does not generate side products.







Abstract
In the realm of solar energy utilization, there is a growing focus on designing and implementing effective photocatalytic systems, for the conversion of solar energy into valuable chemical fuels. The potential of Covalent Organic Polymers (COPs) as photocatalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic transformation has been widely investigated, positioning them as promising candidates in this field. In the design of COPs, introducing a donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement facilitates the transfer of electrons from the donor to the acceptor, creating a charge transfer complex and leading to enhanced conductivity and improved charge separation. Here we present a novel hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic polymer ETBC&#8208;PyHz containing TPE donor and pyridine acceptor. Utilizing this, an efficient method has been developed for an oxidative cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving C&#8722;S bond formation. This process involves arylhydrazines and arenethiols, and results in the production of unsymmetrical diaryl sulfides via the formation of aryl and thioarene radicals. This conversion holds significant importance because the byproducts produced during the process are nitrogen and water, making it environmentally benign.

         <title>Narrowband Blue Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emitter Based on BN&#8208;Doped Benzo[6]helicene with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>

Two 1,4&#8208;azaborinine [6]helicenes, H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2, exhibit blue fluorescence with narrow FWHMs below 31&#8197;nm and high PLQY up to 92&#8201;%. Desirable circularly polarized luminescence with glum reaching 4~5&#215;10&#8722;4 and good configurational stability are relized for H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2. Mechanochromism occurs between H[6]BN1&#8242;s crystalline and amorphous states by modulationg &#960;&#8208;&#960; intermolecular interanctions. An turquoise OLED based H[6]BN1 is manufactured with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3.18&#8201;%.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;doped helicenes, known for their unique electronic and photophysical properties, are of great interest for numerous applications. This research introduces two new azabora[6]helicenes, H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2, synthesized through an efficient method. These molecules have boron and nitrogen atoms in opposing positions, enhancing their distinctive attributes. Both helicenes show excellent emission properties, with H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2 exhibiting narrowband blue fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), achieving glum values of 4~5&#215;10&#8722;4 which is beneficial for chiroptical applications. The addition of a donor group, 3, 6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, in H[6]BN2 improves luminescence, likely due to enhanced molecular orbital overlap and electron delocalization. H[6]BN1&#8242;s needle&#8208;like single crystals exhibit mechanochromism, changing luminescent color from yellow to green under mechanical stress, which is promising for stimulus&#8208;responsive materials. In conclusion, this study presents a novel class of BN[6]helicenes with superior chiroptical properties. Their combination of electronic features and mechanochromism makes them ideal for advanced chiroptical materials, expanding the potential of helicene&#8208;based compounds and offering new directions for the synthesis of molecules with specific chiroptical characteristics.

Both helicenes show excellent emission properties, with &lt;b&gt;H[6]BN1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;H[6]BN2&lt;/b&gt; exhibiting narrowband blue fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), achieving &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values of 4~5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; which is beneficial for chiroptical applications. The addition of a donor group, 3, 6-di-tert-butyl-9H-carbazole, in &lt;b&gt;H[6]BN2&lt;/b&gt; improves luminescence, likely due to enhanced molecular orbital overlap and electron delocalization. &lt;b&gt;H[6]BN1&lt;/b&gt;&#8242;s needle-like single crystals exhibit mechanochromism, changing luminescent color from yellow to green under mechanical stress, which is promising for stimulus-responsive materials. In conclusion, this study presents a novel class of BN[6]helicenes with superior chiroptical properties. Their combination of electronic features and mechanochromism makes them ideal for advanced chiroptical materials, expanding the potential of helicene-based compounds and offering new directions for the synthesis of molecules with specific chiroptical characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Ion&#8208;Pair Recognition for Encapsulation of a Stilbazolium&#8208;Type Dye with Enhanced Photophysical Properties and Nonlinear Optical Activity</title>

A pillar[5]arene is used as an ion&#8208;pair receptor for the modulation of both the crystalline&#8208;state packing and photophysical properties of a dye guest. The host&#8722;guest complex cocrystals formed from this pillar[5]arene receptor and the dye guest not only show enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yields compared to dye crystals, but also possess second harmonic generation activity.







Abstract
Constructing organic composite materials through molecular recognition has emerged as an important theme in materials science. Here we report an ion&#8208;pair recognition system involving the use of a propoxylated pillar[5]arene (PrP5) to modulate the solid&#8208;state photophysical properties of dye trans&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;stilbazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMASP). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the dye guest DMASP is encapsulated by PrP5 to form a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8722;guest complex 2PrP5&#11815;DMASP in the crystalline state. The macrocyclic skeleton of PrP5 imposes restrictions on the intramolecular motions of the dye guest, leading to a significant enhancement of its fluorescence emission. Additionally, within the 2PrP5&#11815;DMASP complex crystal structure, DMASP molecules are found to display two possible opposite orientations in the one&#8208;dimensional channels formed by PrP5 molecules. This arrangement is believed to alter the overall solid&#8208;state packing structure of DMASP, thereby activating its nonlinear optical activity. This work not only reports a novel ion&#8208;pair molecular recognition system based on pillararenes but also provides valuable insights into the modulation of the crystalline state photophysical properties of organic dyes via cocrystal engineering.

         <title>Intramolecular Nucleophilic Vinylic Substitution (SNV) by Carbon Nucleophiles: Conformationally Directed Formation of Dienes from N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diallyl Ureas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diallyl ureas, on treatment with base, undergo a cascade of reversible deprotonations and alkene isomerisations that culminate in an intramolecular SNV reaction that links the two allylic substituents together to form a diene.







Abstract
Nucleophilic vinylic substitution (SNV) by carbon nucleophiles allows the formation of vinylic C&#8722;C bonds without transition metal catalysts. In this paper, we show that tethering two alkenes together through a urea linkage can lead to the formation of a diene by an intramolecular SNV reaction. The starting materials are fully substituted N,N&#8217;&#8208;diallyl ureas; the reaction proceeds in the presence of base, and entails a cascade of deprotonations, reprotonations, and an SNV reaction of an allylic carbanion on a rare electrophile: a vinylic urea. As a result, two allylic substituents couple to form a diene, despite the fact that neither is activated towards electrophilic attack. The reaction is tolerant of significant steric bulk, and exhibits regioselectivity with unsymmetrical diallyl ureas: &#946;&#8208;substituted allyl groups invariably behave as nucleophiles, while electrophilic behavior may be enforced by the use of an E&#8208;vinylic urea substituent that cannot be deprotonated under the reaction conditions.

         <title>CaLi2PN3 &#8211; A Quaternary Chain&#8208;Type Nitridophosphate by Medium&#8208;Pressure Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CaLi2PN3 was synthesized under MP conditions and analyzed by SCXRD, EDX and MAS NMR. Beside an established bottom&#8208;up approach, we present a novel double salt approach, starting from pre&#8208;synthesized nitridophosphate&#8208;precursors. DFT calculations provide insights into the band structure and the relative stability to the used precursors. This new approach represents a promising addition to the synthesis strategies in nitridophosphate chemistry.







Abstract
Nitridophosphates are in the focus of current research interest due to their structural versatility and properties, such as ion conductivity, ultra&#8208;incompressibility and luminescent properties when doped with suitable activator ions. Multinary representatives often require thorough investigation due to the competition with the thermodynamically more stable binary and ternary compounds. Another point of concern is the synthetic control of structural details, which is usually limited by conventional bottom&#8208;up syntheses. In this study, we report on the synthesis and characterization of the quaternary nitridophosphate CaLi2PN3. Various synthesis protocols were used for the preparation of CaLi2PN3, including the novel nitridophosphate double salt approach. The crystal structure was solved and refined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and confirmed by Rietveld refinement, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, EDX measurements and low&#8208;cost crystallographic calculations. The experimental results were corroborated by DFT calculations, which revealed the electronic band structure. Formation energy calculations allowed conclusions to be drawn about the stability in comparison to the initial ternary nitridophosphates. The synthesis of CaLi2PN3 exemplifies the enormous potential of medium&#8208;pressure syntheses in the field of nitridophosphate research. Furthermore, the presented new synthesis route allows a certain degree of structural control, which is a promising addition to previous synthesis strategies in nitridophosphate chemistry.

         <title>A New Structural Motif in Aggregation of Methylalumoxanes: Non&#8208;Hydrolytic Route by the Alkylation of Dicarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report the first systematic studies on the alkylation of dicarboxylic acids by AlMe3 that, passing through the double methylation of each carboxylic group, allowed for the isolation and structural characterisation of a family of methylalumoxanes incorporating neutral Me10Al6O4 scaffold flanked by methylaluminium diolate units.







Abstract
Alumoxanes are typically produced via controlled hydrolysis of short&#8208;chain alkyl aluminium compounds which leads to oligomeric species that are usually difficult to obtain in crystalline form. Simultaneously, various alternative non&#8208;hydrolytic approaches to alumoxanes have also been used. In this work, we report on a new methylalumoxane scaffold derived from the alkylation of a series of dicarboxylic acids: itaconic acid (HO2CCH2C(=CH2)CO2H), succinic acid (HO2CCH2CH2CO2H) and homophthalic acid (HO2CCH2C6H4CO2H). The reactions of AlMe3 with a selected dicarboxylic acid in the molar ratio 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 conducted at elevated temperature occur with double methylation of each carboxylic group and provide to the formation of a new methylalumoxane aggregate, Me10Al6O4, flanked by methylaluminium diolate units. We also aimed to obtain dialkylaluminium derivatives of dicarboxylic acids by the controlled reaction of the appropriate acid with AlMe3 in the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometry. While the synthesis of organoaluminium derivatives of flexible aliphatic dicarboxylic acids (itaconic and succinic acids) is challenging due to their insolubility, the related homophtalate compound readily forms a molecular tetranuclear cluster, [([(O2CCH2C6H4CO2)(&#956;&#8208;AlMe2)2]2. The molecular and crystal structures of the resulting compounds were determined via NMR spectroscopic analysis and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography.

In this work, we report on a new methylalumoxane scaffold derived from the alkylation of a series of dicarboxylic acids: itaconic acid (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H), succinic acid (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) and homophthalic acid (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H). The reactions of AlMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with a selected dicarboxylic acid in the molar ratio 4&#8201;:&#8201;1 conducted at elevated temperature occur with double methylation of each carboxylic group and provide to the formation of a new methylalumoxane aggregate, Me&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, flanked by methylaluminium diolate units. We also aimed to obtain dialkylaluminium derivatives of dicarboxylic acids by the controlled reaction of the appropriate acid with AlMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 stoichiometry. While the synthesis of organoaluminium derivatives of flexible aliphatic dicarboxylic acids (itaconic and succinic acids) is challenging due to their insolubility, the related homophtalate compound readily forms a molecular tetranuclear cluster, [([(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(&lt;i&gt;&#956;-&lt;/i&gt;AlMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The molecular and crystal structures of the resulting compounds were determined via NMR spectroscopic analysis and single crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A ubiquitous and well&#8208;understood natural product, chlorophyll has a variety of applications, and we hypothesized that it could also be applied in NIR&#8208;II imaging. A series of experiments were conducted to verify the optical properties and successful applications in NIR&#8208;II bioimaging, and plant imaging was performed. With high biocompatibility and readily availability, chlorophylls were found to be promising new dyes for NIR&#8208;II imaging. More information can be found in the Research Article by W. Xu, C. Qu, Z. Cheng, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401805).

         <dc:description>
After a century of discussion, the atomic arrangements of vaterite, one of the polymorphs of CaCO3, have been fully visualized and described as a layer structure consisting of calcium planes and carbonate (CO32&#8722;)&#8208;containing sheets. The layers are stacked with +60&#176;, &#8722;60&#176;, or 180&#176; rotations from the underlying layer with two constraints: i)&#8197;carbonate ions cannot occupy equivalent positions in alternate layers, and ii)&#8197;the stacking sequences with orthogonal components are dominated. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Okumura and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401557).

         <title>Cover Feature: Aromaticity in the Spectroscopic Spotlight of Hexaphyrins (Chem. Eur. J. 52/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature represents work on the connection between aromaticity and absorption spectra in porphyrinoids. Hexaphyrins were put under a spectroscopic spotlight, colored by (anti)aromaticity. Contrary to previous studies that link weak spectra to antiaromatic porphyrinoids, our green antiaromatic [28]hexaphyrin exhibits a peak as intense as our aromatic red [26]hexaphyrin. We recommend using both global and local aromaticity descriptors from different criteria to assess expanded porphyrins, rather than relying solely on absorption spectra. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. De&#8197;Vleeschouwer, M. Alonso and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401933). Cover design by Eline Desmedt.

Ternary adamantane&#8208;related Cu/Si/S and Ag/Si/S clusters were obtained by reactions of [(PhSi)4S6] (A) with CuCl and 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (dppb) to form [{(dppbCu2)CuP(Ph2)(CH2CH2)(PhSi)3S6}2], a unique dppb&#8208;bridged dimer of ternary clusters, and with [AgCl(PMe2Ph)2]2 to form [Na2(thf)1.5][(Me2PhPAg)(PhSi)3S6], which assembles into an unprecedented 2D coordination polymer through the Na+ cations. The studies illustrate a generally similar reaction behavior and product spectrum for the two coinage metal ions, but also highlight the subtle influence that affords related, yet different compounds.

         <title>A Review of Electrospun Carbon&#8208;Based Nanofibers Materials used in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers materials have characteristics such as high electronic conductivity, large specific surface area, and good flexibility. This article reviews representative research results of different types of CNF (with various pore structures, heteroatoms, metallic compounds, and other substances) as sulfur hosts and interlayer materials to improve the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries are gradually approaching their theoretical specific energy, which cannot meet the fast&#8208;growing energy storage demands. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are anticipated to supersede lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the next&#8208;generation energy storage system owing to their high atheoretical specific capacity (1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and energy density (2600&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1). Nonetheless, Li&#8722;S batteries encounter several challenges, including the inadequate conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide, sulfur's volume expansion, and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides, all of which significantly impact the practical utilization of Li&#8722;S batteries. Electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers can simultaneously resolve these issues with their economical preparation, distinctive nanostructure, and exceptional flexibility. This review presents the most recent research findings on electrospun carbon&#8208;based nanofibers materials serving as sulfur hosts and interlayer components in Li&#8722;S batteries. We analyzed the impact of the material's structural design on the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries and the relative underlying mechanism.

     alt="A Review of Electrospun Carbon-Based Nanofibers Materials used in Lithium-Sulfur Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrospun carbon-based nanofibers materials have characteristics such as high electronic conductivity, large specific surface area, and good flexibility. This article reviews representative research results of different types of CNF (with various pore structures, heteroatoms, metallic compounds, and other substances) as sulfur hosts and interlayer materials to improve the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial lithium-ion batteries are gradually approaching their theoretical specific energy, which cannot meet the fast-growing energy storage demands. Lithium-sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are anticipated to supersede lithium-ion batteries as the next-generation energy storage system owing to their high atheoretical specific capacity (1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and energy density (2600&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Nonetheless, Li&#8722;S batteries encounter several challenges, including the inadequate conductivity of sulfur and lithium sulfide, sulfur's volume expansion, and the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides, all of which significantly impact the practical utilization of Li&#8722;S batteries. Electrospun carbon-based nanofibers can simultaneously resolve these issues with their economical preparation, distinctive nanostructure, and exceptional flexibility. This review presents the most recent research findings on electrospun carbon-based nanofibers materials serving as sulfur hosts and interlayer components in Li&#8722;S batteries. We analyzed the impact of the material's structural design on the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries and the relative underlying mechanism. Finally, the current challenges and issues faced by carbon-based nanofibers composites in the application of Li&#8722;S batteries are summarized, and the future development trajectory are outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Halogen and Chalcogen Activation by Nucleophilic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 52, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic halogen activation has seen substantial transformation in the last several years. The ability to selectively and efficiently activate halogen functionalities through nucleophilic catalysis holds promise for enhancing reaction specificity, selectivity, and sustainability. This review will outline important nucleophilic activators that have been employed for halogen activation and describes their mode of action.







Abstract
The high utility of halogenated organic compounds has prompted the development of numerous transformations that install the carbon&#8208;halogen motif. Halogen functionalities, deemed as &#8220;functional and functionalizable&#8221; molecules due to their capacity to modulate diverse internal properties, constitute a pivotal strategy in drug discovery and development. Traditional routes to these building blocks have commonly involved multiple steps, harsh reaction conditions, and the use of stoichiometric and/or toxic reagents. With the emergence of solid halogen carriers such as N&#8208;halosuccinimides, and halohydantoins as popular sources of halonium ions, the past decade has witnessed enormous growth in the development of new catalytic strategies for halofunctionalization. This review aims to provide a nuanced perspective on nucleophilic activators and their roles in halogen activation. It will highlight critical discoveries in effecting racemic and asymmetric variants of these reactions, driven by the development of new catalysts, activation modes, and improved understanding of chemical reactivity and reaction kinetics.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Masked Organic Sulfates</title>

         <dc:description>
Although nature presents unique sulfated endobiotics (e.&#8201;g., sulfated glycosaminoglycans, sulfated tyrosine peptides, sulfated steroids/bile acids/catecholamines, etc.) that are antithrombotic, antimicrobial, and/or anticancer in action, major hurdles exist in their synthesis. This review focuses on synthetic masking/unmasking strategies that can help realize highly sulfated molecules as drugs.







Abstract
Nature offers a variety of structurally unique, sulfated endobiotics including sulfated glycosaminoglycans, sulfated tyrosine peptides, sulfated steroids/bile acids/catecholamines. Sulfated molecules display a large number of biological activities including antithrombotic, antimicrobial, anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and others, which arise from modulation of intracellular signaling and enhanced in&#8197;vivo retention of certain hormones. These characteristics position sulfated molecules very favorably as drug&#8208;like agents. However, few have reached the clinic. Major hurdles exist in realizing sulfated molecules as drugs. This state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art has been transformed through recent works on the development of sulfate masking technologies for both alkyl (sulfated carbohydrates, sulfated steroids) and aryl (sTyr&#8208;bearing peptides/proteins, sulfated flavonoids) sulfates. This review compiles the literature on different strategies implemented for different types of sulfate groups. Starting from early efforts in protection of sulfate groups to the design of newer SuFEx, trichloroethyl, and gem&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;based protection technologies, this review presents the evolution and application of concepts in realizing highly diverse, sulfated molecules as candidate drugs and/or prodrugs. Overall, the newer strategies for sulfate masking and demasking are likely to greatly enhance the design and development of sulfated molecules as non&#8208;toxic drugs of the future.

         <title>Suppressing Protodeboronation in Cu&#8208;Mediated 19F/18F&#8208;Fluorination of Arylboronic Acids: A Mechanistically Guided Approach Towards Optimized PET Probe Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method was rationally optimized to minimize deleterious protodeboronation side&#8208;product in Cu&#8208;mediated 19F&#8208; and 18F&#8208;fluorination of arylboronic acids. Fluoride anion is activated through a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) effect under ligandless conditions featuring a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)2. This mild protocol occurs at lower temperature and demonstrates improved generality with good yields and radiochemical conversions and minimal protodeboronation.







Abstract
Fluorinated arenes play a crucial role in drug discovery, specialty materials, and medical imaging. Although several variants for Cu&#8208;mediated nucleophilic fluorination of arylboronic acids and derivatives have been developed, these protocols rarely address the occurrence and control of protodeboronation, which greatly complicates product separation and can compromise the effectiveness of a radiotracer for in&#8197;vivo imaging. Consequently, simpler and more efficient procedures are needed to allow rapid 18F/19F&#8208;fluorination of both arylboronic acids and esters while minimizing protodeboronation. Mechanistic controls revealed that in addition to a high temperature, strong donor ligands such as acetonitrile and pyridine accentuate a Cu&#8208;mediated protodeboronation. This observation guided the optimization of a ligandless procedure, with t&#8208;BuOH as solvent, to activate fluoride under milder conditions at lower temperatures minimizing protodeboronation. Additionally, a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)2 was employed to further improve the fluorination efficiency. A large range of functional groups are tolerated under the new procedure, which is complete within 30&#8197;minutes at a temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, and affords fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes in 39&#8201;% to 84&#8201;% yield. With minimal modifications, the protocol can also be applied in 18F&#8208;radiofluorination, affording radiochemical conversions (RCCs) between 17 and 54&#8201;% with minimal protodeboronation compared to previously established protocols.

         <title>Phosphorous and Nitrogen Dual&#8208;Doped Carbon as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P, N co&#8208;doped carbon has been used as cathode materials in Na&#8208;O2 batteries. The high battery performance is ascribed to the high adsorption energy toward NaO2 of this advanced cathode materials. The high adsorption energy of NaO2 can prevent NaO2 from decomposing into hard&#8208;to&#8208;decompose Na2O2 during discharging and thus increase the battery efficiency during the cycles.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;oxygen batteries have been regarded as promising energy storage devices due to their low overpotential and high energy density. Its applications, however, still face formidable challenges due to the lack of understanding about the influence of electrocatalysts on the discharge products. Here, a phosphorous and nitrogen dual&#8208;doped carbon (PNDC) based cathode is synthesized to increase the electrocatalytic activity and to stabilize the NaO2 superoxide nanoparticle discharge products, leading to enhanced cycling stability when compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC). The PNDC air cathode exhibits a low overpotential (0.36&#8197;V) and long cycling stability (120 cycles). The reversible formation/decomposition and stabilization of the NaO2 discharge products are clearly proven by in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction. Based on the density functional theory calculation, the PNDC has much stronger adsorption (&#8722;2.85&#8197;eV) for NaO2 than that of NDC (&#8722;1.80&#8197;eV), which could efficiently stabilize the NaO2 discharge products.

         <title>Exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Endohedral Metallofullerene C36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferential position of 3d metal atoms inside the C36 cage and their effect on exohedral Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity is reported in comparison with the empty C360 and C362&#8722; cages. Among all [5&#8208;5], [6&#8208;5] and [6 6] C&#8722;C bonds the [5&#8208;5] bond is the most reactive bond in both the empty C36 and metallofullerene M@C36.







Abstract
Understanding the exohedral reactivity of metallofullerenes is crucial for its application in various fields. By systematically controlling the trapped species inside the fullerene its reactivity can be tamed. In this work we report the preferential position of 3d metal atoms inside the C36 cage and their effect on exohedral reactivity in comparison with the neutral and the dianionic cage. The Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction between butadiene and all non&#8208;equivalent [5&#8208;5], [6&#8208;5] and [6&#8208;6] C&#8722;C bonds on the fullerene cage was considered for the analysis, by using density functional theory at the S12g/TZ2P level including COSMO solvation model to elucidate the complete mechanistic pathways. Our results indicate that the preferential position of the metal ion is at the position close to the upper hexagon, and that the general trend in the reactivity of bonds follows the order [5&#8208;5]&gt;[6&#8208;5]&gt;[6&#8208;6]. Moreover, the encapsulation of metal atoms further enhances the reactivity of these bonds, by lowering the LUMOs of the cage, hence maximizing the orbital interactions.

         <title>Computer&#8208;Aided Synthesis Planning (CASP) and Machine Learning: Optimizing Chemical Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the topic of the Computer Aided Synthesis Project (CASP) and gives a detailed overview of the methods of machine learning to predict chemical reaction conditions, including the problem of data and descriptor selection, the indicators for the evaluation of results and the current research progress of various algorithms. The future research trends and possible challenges in chemical condition prediction are prospected.







Abstract
Computer&#8208;aided synthesis planning (CASP) has garnered increasing attention in light of recent advancements in machine learning models. While the focus is on reverse synthesis or forward outcome prediction, optimizing reaction conditions remains a significant challenge. For datasets with multiple variables, the choice of descriptors and models is pivotal. This selection dictates the effective extraction of conditional features and the achievement of higher prediction accuracy. This review delineates the origins of data in conditional optimization, the criteria for descriptor selection, the response models, and the metrics for outcome evaluation, aiming to acquaint readers with the latest research trends and facilitate more informed research in this domain.

         <title>Advancing Optoglycomics: Two Orthogonal Azobenzene Glycoside Antennas in One Glycocluster&#8211;Synthesis, Switching Cycles, Kinetics and Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new tool for the glycosciences: A heterobivalent glycocluster combines two photoswitchable azobenzene glycoside antennas with different photochromic properties. Hence, wavelength&#8208;selective E/Z isomerization of the glycoantennas is enabled and a switching cycle comprising three major isomers (EE, EZ, ZZ). Kinetic analysis explains the relaxation mechanism and MD simulations illustrate the relationship between isomeric state and distance between the sugar ligands.







Abstract
Carbohydrate recognition is essential for numerous biological processes and is governed by various factors within the supramolecular environment of the cell. Photoswitchable glycoconjugates have proven as valuable tools for the investigation and modulation of carbohydrate recognition as they allow to control the relative orientation of sugar ligands by light. In order to advance the possibilities of such an &#8220;optoglycomics&#8221; approach for the glycosciences, we have synthesized a biantennary glycocluster in which two glycoazobenzene antennas are conjugated to the 3&#8208; and 6&#8208;position of a scaffold glycoside. Orthogonal isomerization of the photoswitchable units was made possible by the different conjugation of the azobenzene moieties via an oxygen and a sulfur atom, respectively, and the ortho&#8208;fluorination of one of the azobenzene units. This design enabled a switching cycle comprising the EE, EZ and the ZZ isomer. This is the first example of an orthogonally photoswitchable glycocluster. The full analysis of its photochromic properties included the investigation of the isolated glycoazobenzene antennas allowing the comparison of the intra&#8208; versus the intermolecular orthogonal photoswitching. The kinetics of the thermal relaxation were analyzed in detail. A molecular dynamics study shows that indeed, the relative orientation of the glycoantennas and the distances between the terminal sugar ligands significantly vary depending on the isomeric state, as intended.

         <title>Synthesis of Ce(IV) Heteroleptic Double&#8208;Decker Complex with a New Helical Naphthalocyanine as a Potential Gearing Subunit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gearing up double&#8208;decker complexes. A prototype of a molecular gear has been synthesized in 12 steps, using a helical naphthalocyanine ligand as rotating cogwheels and a thioether octa&#8208;functionalized phthalocyanine as anchoring stator.







Abstract
This paper describes the synthesis of a cerium(IV)&#8208;based molecular gear composed of a thioether functionalized phthalocyanine anchoring ligand, and a helical naphthalocyanine rotating cogwheel functionalized with four carbazoles. The naphthalocyanine ligand 9 was obtained after eleven steps (overall yield of 0.2&#8201;%) as a mixture of three geometrical isomers, two of which are chiral and exhibit high levels of steric hindrance, as shown by DFT calculations. Their attributions have been made using 1H&#8208;NMR based on their different symmetry groups. The ratio of isomers was also determined and the prochiral C4h naphthalocyanine shown to be the major compound (55&#8201;%). Its heteroleptic complexation with cerium (IV) and the anchoring phthalocyanine ligand 10 gave the targeted molecular gear in a 16&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Green Synthesis of the Triazine Derivatives and their Application for the Benign Electrocatalytic Reaction of Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper studies the process of eco&#8208;friendly microwave assisted synthesis of a material based on triazine compounds and the possibility of its use as part of a hybrid catalyst for the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia under mild conditions by the NO3RR reaction.







Abstract
This work uses green sustainable reactions twice. Firstly, it is microwave synthesis: 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and similar compounds were prepared in a closed microwave reactor in n&#8208;octane by the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. Second, a hybrid electrocatalyst for the highly demanded electrochemical reaction of nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) was prepared based on this material. This reaction has great potential to replace the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process, and in addition, has independent value for the elimination of nitrate contamination of water resources. As shown in the work, microwave synthesis is an eco&#8208;friendly method for the synthesis of complex organic compounds; fast, selective and with a high yield of the target product. The electrocatalyst deposited on the graphite electrode consisted of a layer of 2,4&#8208;bis([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and related compounds coated with cobalt oxide. The hybrid catalyst was firmly retained on the graphite electrode during NO3RR and the material showed impressive stability with almost no decrease in catalytic activity even after the fifth cycle. Both 2,4&#8208;bis([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and the catalyst based on this substance were characterized by SEM, XPS, XRD, UV&#8208;vis spectra, cyclic (and linear) voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. This work can serve as a starting point for the development of stable and durable electrocatalysts for NO3RR using triazine derivatives.

&lt;p&gt;This work uses green sustainable reactions twice. Firstly, it is microwave synthesis: 2,4,6-tribiphenyl-4-yl-1,3,5-triazine and similar compounds were prepared in a closed microwave reactor in n-octane by the Friedel-Crafts reaction.

The hybrid catalyst was firmly retained on the graphite electrode during NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR and the material showed impressive stability with almost no decrease in catalytic activity even after the fifth cycle. Both 2,4-bis([1,1&#8242;-biphenyl]-4-yl)-6-hydroxy-1,3,5-triazine and the catalyst based on this substance were characterized by SEM, XPS, XRD, UV-vis spectra, cyclic (and linear) voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. This work can serve as a starting point for the development of stable and durable electrocatalysts for NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR using triazine derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Effect of Reactive Oxygen Species on Respiratory Complex I Activity in Liposomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Respiratory complex I (R&#8208;CI) is a major contributor to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. By reconstituting R&#8208;CI into artificial membrane vesicles and in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy, the effects of ROS are investigated. The activity of R&#8208;CI is reduced because of ROS, not only by damaging the enzyme but also by making the membrane more polar and protic.







Abstract
Respiratory complex I (R&#8208;CI) is an essential enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain but also a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. While the mechanism of ROS production by R&#8208;CI is well&#8208;established, the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity is poorly understood. Here, we perform EPR spectroscopy on R&#8208;CI incorporated in artificial membrane vesicles to reveal that ROS (particularly hydroxyl radicals) reduce R&#8208;CI activity by making the membrane more polar and by increasing its hydrogen bonding capability. Moreover, the mechanism that we have uncovered reveals that the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity via the membrane is transient and not permanent; lipid peroxidation is negligible for the levels of ROS generated under these conditions. Our successful use of modular proteoliposome systems in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques is a powerful approach for investigating ROS effects on other membrane proteins.

         <title>Stacking Transformation&#8208;Triggered Circularly Polarized Luminescence Reversion in &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrins&#8208;Pyrene Co&#8208;Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>
CPL signal direction of cyclodextrins&#8208;pyrene co&#8208;assembly can be regulated through host&#8208;guest interaction&#8208;induced stacking transformation, demonstrating that (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;CPL of pyrene&#8208;pyrene excimer is originated from right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed stacking conformation in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins, respectively.







Abstract
Considerable attention has been directed towards cyclodextrins (CDs) in the creation of co&#8208;assembled CPL&#8208;active materials, owing to their intrinsic chiral host cavities and synergistic host&#8208;guest interactions. However, achieving reversed CPL emission regulation with single&#8208;handedness CDs moiety poses a significant challenge. In this study, we have devised a series of &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexes comprising dual pyrene imidazolium derivatives with multiple linkers, which exhibit reversed circularly polarized emission. We have uncovered that the transformation of excimer stacking within &#947;&#8208;CD/pyrene complexes contributes to the inverted CPL emissions originating from a single&#8208;handed chiral host. This research elucidates the phenomenon of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE) within &#947;&#8208;CD, arising from right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed stacking conformations, respectively.

         <title>Switchable Deep Eutectic Solvents for Sustainable Sulfonamide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and scalable synthesis of sulfonamides, from amines and sulfonyl chlorides, is achieved under aerobic conditions, at ambient temperature, in reusable choline chloride&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents. The interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the selected DESs drives the sulfonamide synthesis over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides.







Abstract
A sustainable and scalable protocol for synthesizing variously functionalized sulfonamides, from amines and sulfonyl chlorides, has been developed using environmentally responsible and reusable choline chloride (ChCl)&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs). In ChCl/glycerol (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and ChCl/urea (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1), these reactions yield up to 97&#8201;% under aerobic conditions at ambient temperature within 2&#8211;12&#8197;h. The practicality of the method is exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of an FFA4 agonist and a key building block en route to anti&#8208;Alzheimer drug BMS&#8208;299897. A subtle interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the aforementioned DESs seem to be responsible for driving the reaction successfully over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides. The procedure's eco&#8208;friendliness is validated by quantitative metrics like the E&#8208;factor and the EcoScale, with products isolated by extraction or filtration after decantation.

Valence isomers of benzene have long attracted both synthetic and theoretical chemists due to their unique bonding and chemical reactivity. What new chemistry can be unlocked by introducing isosteric boron and nitrogen atoms in these structures? This concept paper highlights the recent development of boron(B)&#8208;nitrogen(N)&#8208;containing benzene valence isomers, specifically, BN&#8208;Dewar benzene and BN&#8208;benzvalene.







Abstract
Benzene is one of the most ubiquitous structural motifs in chemistry. The valence isomers of benzene have also attracted synthetic chemists&#8217; attention due to their unique structures, bonding, and reactivity. We have been investigating boron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing benzene valence isomers via photoisomerization of 1,2&#8208;azaborines. In this contribution, we summarize recent developments of these highly strained BN&#8208;heterocyclic compounds including their synthesis, characterization, proposed mechanism of formation, and their potential applications.

         <title>Sequential&#8208;Flow Synthesis of Donepezil: A Green and Sustainable Strategy Featuring Heterogeneous Catalysis and Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atom&#8208;economical, sequential, and continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of donepezil was developed using inexpensive precursors. Key elements included highly functional heterogeneous catalytic processes for condensation and hydrogenation, with water as the sole byproduct. Additionally, in&#8208;line treatments eliminated inhibitory factors, enabling seamless integration of the multi&#8208;step continuous&#8208;flow reactions.







Abstract
An atom&#8208;economical sequential&#8208;flow synthesis of donepezil, a widely prescribed drug for Alzheimer's disease, was accomplished using inexpensive, commercially available precursors. This achievement was made possible by reconfiguring the synthetic route to include only heterogeneous catalytic addition and condensation reactions, with a particular emphasis on skeletal transformation and bond formation through hydrogenation processes. Notably, water was the sole byproduct in this synthesis. A crucial aspect of this work was the development of appropriate continuous&#8208;flow processes to achieve a one&#8208;flow synthesis. This was accomplished by implementing in&#8208;line treatments of the main reaction stream to eliminate inhibitory factors that could affect catalyst performance in the hydrogenation steps.

         <title>Isonitrile Photochemistry: A Functional Group Class Coming in from the Cold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from a historical background that acknowledges isonitriles as a neglected class of compounds due to their unpleasant smell and hardly controlled reaction conditions with open shell species, the present concept article aims at highlighting the seeds of the modern isonitrile photochemistry. Representative essential transformations achieved via either UV light irradiation or radical initiators at high temperatures are brought into play to draw a parallel with the current literature relying on the exploitation of visible light photochemical methods. Such a comparison points out the potential of this enabling technology to further expand the scope of isonitrile chemistry and the unmet challenges which makes it a very stimulating field.</dc:description>

         <title>Melanin and Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Melanin is responsible, in Nature, for photoprotection, for this reason it is expected to be poorly photoreactive. However, the photo&#8208;reactivity of melanin and related materials is well documented. Here we discuss some relevant recent examples to demonstrate that, indeed, the actual mechanism of interaction of melanin with light is complex and still not completely understood. Photochemical and photothermal processes are involved, giving a contribution that strongly depends on light wavelength and intensity. Moreover, some interesting experiments demonstrated that photochemical reactivity of melanin related compounds is likely to be indirect, in the sense that the effect of light is to increase the number of radical species rather than creating photoreactive excited state. These suggestions open&#8208;up new perspectives in the interpretation of the role of melanin in photoprotection and in the design of new melanin based photoactive materials for energy conversion, environmental remediation, and nanomedicine. Further complication is given by the role of atmospheric oxygen and humidity in the photoinduced processes. Beside this complexity of behavior makes it difficult a systematic understanding of the interaction of melanin with light, it surely strongly contributes to make the properties of melanin and related materials unique.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Deconstructive Methoxylation of Arylalcohols &#8211; A Synthetic and Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a mechanistic investigation of a recently developed electrochemical method for the deconstructive methoxylation of arylalcohols. A combination of synthetic, electroanalytical, and computational experiments have been performed to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism and the structural requirements for fragmentation to occur. It was found that 2&#8208;arylalcohols undergo anodic oxidation to form the corresponding aromatic radical cations, which fragment to form oxocarbenium ions and benzylic radical intermediates via mesolytic cleavage, with further anodic oxidation and trapping of the benzylic carbocation with methanol to generate the observed methyl ether products. It was also found that the electrochemical fragmentation of 2&#8208;arylalkanols is promoted by structural features that stabilize the oxocarbenium ions and/or benzylic radical intermediates formed upon mesolytic cleavage of the aromatic radical cations. With an enhanced understanding of the reaction mechanism and the structural features that promote fragmentation, it is anticipated that alternative electrosynthetic transformations will be developed that utilize this powerful, yet underdeveloped, mode of substrate activation.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8211;H Activation and Hydrogen Isotope Exchange of Aryl Carbamates using Iridium(I) Complexes Bearing Chelating NHC&#8208;Phosphine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) via C&#8211;H activation constitutes an efficient method for the synthesis of isotopically&#8208;enriched compounds, which are crucial components of the drug discovery process and are extensively employed in mechanistic studies. A series of iridium(I) complexes, bearing a chelating phosphine&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, was designed and synthesized for application in the catalytic HIE of challenging N&#8208; and O&#8208;aryl carbamates. A broad range of substrates were labeled efficiently, and applicability to biologically&#8208;relevant systems was demonstrated by labeling an &#671;&#8208;tyrosine&#8208;derived carbamate with excellent levels of deuterium incorporation. Combined theoretical and experimental studies unveiled intriguing mechanistic features within this process, in comparison to C&#8211;H activation and hydrogen isotope exchange catalysed by monodentate Ir(I) NHC/phosphine complexes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a solid&#8208;acid catalyzed aminolysis of epoxides under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. A titania&#8208;zirconia supported molybdenum oxide catalyst demonstrated exceptional substrate compatibility, enabling the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols in excellent yields with high catalyst durability. Characterization of the catalyst revealed the crucial role of the titania&#8208;zirconia ratio in optimizing its performance.

         <title>The Conformational Behaviour of Fluorinated Tetrahydrothiopyran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interactions played a significant role in stabilizing the axial fluorine orientation of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyran, occasionally supported by stereoelectronic interactions. These combined forces were observed to stabilize less polar conformers of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyrans even in polar solutions. Both experimental and computational investigations were thoroughly conducted on a variety of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyran derivatives.







Abstract
We present a comprehensive study on the conformational behavior of diversely substituted 4&#8208;fluorotetrahydrothiopyran derivatives. Through quantum chemical simulations including DFT as well as NBO and NPA analysis, we elucidate the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions, occasionally complemented by hyperconjugative interactions, in stabilizing axial fluorine conformers. Less polar conformers were occasionally obtained, attributed to the interplay of electrostatic and hyperconjugative interactions. Experimental validation through NMR spectroscopy aligns with the computational analysis, thus providing a coherent understanding of the structural dynamics of these compounds.

&lt;p&gt;Electrostatic interactions played a significant role in stabilizing the axial fluorine orientation of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyran, occasionally supported by stereoelectronic interactions. These combined forces were observed to stabilize less polar conformers of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyrans even in polar solutions. Both experimental and computational investigations were thoroughly conducted on a variety of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyran derivatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a comprehensive study on the conformational behavior of diversely substituted 4-fluorotetrahydrothiopyran derivatives. Through quantum chemical simulations including DFT as well as NBO and NPA analysis, we elucidate the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions, occasionally complemented by hyperconjugative interactions, in stabilizing axial fluorine conformers. Less polar conformers were occasionally obtained, attributed to the interplay of electrostatic and hyperconjugative interactions.

         <title>Chiral Sulfoximine Mediated Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Atropselective C&#8722;H Annulation of Ynamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cp*Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective annulation of arenes with ynamides has led to the synthesis of axially chiral five&#8208;membered 2&#8208;amidoindenones. The chiral sulfoximine directing group plays crucial; the sulfoximine moiety is cleaved and reused. DFT studies shed insights in understanding the origin of asymmetric induction.







Abstract
An achiral Cp*Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation/annulation of chiral sulfoximine&#8208;enabled thioamides with ynamides is presented herein. This method successfully synthesizes axially chiral five&#8208;membered 2&#8208;amidoindenones with good enantiocontrol. Interestingly, the annulation with chiral oxazolidone&#8208;containing ynamides could provide a separable mixture of diastereomers (up to ~10&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Moreover, enantiopure sulfoximines could be recovered with ~99&#8201;% purity, making this method practical. DFT studies show valuable insight into the mechanism and origin of asymmetric induction.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Stepwise Double Dehydrogenation for the Formation of a para&#8208;Quinodimethane&#8208;Containing Undecacene Isomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of an undecacene isomer with unique structural features, including two cyclobutadiene and two para&#8208;quinodimethane (p&#8208;QDM) moieties within the 1D polycyclic system, was achieved via a novel on&#8208;surface dehydrogenation reaction induced by voltage pulses. This work broadens the arsenal of on&#8208;surface synthesis methods and provides new insights into modifying the electronic properties of acene analogs through the incorporation of nonbenzenoid rings.







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface synthesis of an isomer of undecacene, bearing two four&#8208;membered rings and two para&#8208;quinodimethane moieties, starting from a tetramethyl&#8208;substituted diepoxy precursor, is presented. The transformation implies a thermal double deoxygenation followed by a stepwise double dehydrogenation reaction on the Au(111) surface, locally induced by inelastic tunneling electrons. This results in the transformation of para&#8208;dimethylbenzene moieties into non&#8208;aromatic para&#8208;quinodimethanes. The structures and electronic properties of the intermediate and final products are investigated at the single molecule level with high spatial resolution, using both scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy. The experimental results are supported by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of High Performance Energetic Biocidal Bicyclic Compounds Derivated from Iodopyrazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular synthesis for energetic biocidal materials was represented. Iodopyrazole precursors 1&#8211;2 were synthesized for the first time as biocidal modules, and then C&#8722;N coupling reactions were carried out with two energetic modules respectively to obtain bicyclic molecules 3&#8211;6 in one&#8208;step facile method. 5 and 6 exhibited highest gas production (V) of 212.85&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1, 217.66&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively so far.







Abstract
Modular synthesis can combine different functional modules to flexibly regulate comprehensive properties and study the diversity of compounds. This study established a modular bicyclic synthesis strategy of combining polynitro energetic module with iodine&#8208;containing biocidal module. Compounds 1&#8211;6 with high iodine content (48.72&#8211;69.56&#8201;%) and high thermal stability (Td: 172&#8211;304&#8201;&#176;C) were synthesized and exhaustively identified. By modular synthesis, the detonation properties and gas&#8208;production of 3&#8211;6 improved greatly expanding their biocidal efficacy and maintained the iodine atomic utilization of iodine&#8208;containing module. Notably, 4,5&#8208;diiodo&#8208;3,4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;trinitro&#8208;1,3&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazole (5) and 3,5&#8208;diiodo&#8208;4,4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;trinitro&#8208;1,3&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazole (6) exhibit high detonation velocities (D: 5903&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, 5769&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively) and highest gas production of 212.85&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and 217.66&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1 after decomposition. This study diversifies polyiodio&#8208;nitro compounds, and also inspire the implementation of similar synthesis strategies to provide family&#8208;level synthetic solutions to energetic biocidal materials.

         <title>Insight from Electrochemical Analysis in the Radical Cation State of a Monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical studies on a bistable [2]rotaxane incorporating a monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene (MPTTF) unit (green) and an oxyphenylene (OP) moiety (red) in the dumbbell component and encircled by the cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+) ring (blue) was used to profile the energy landscapes when the CBPQT4+ ring moves across the MPTTF unit in all of its three accessible redox states (0, +1, and +2).







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules are a class of compounds used for controlling directional movement when barriers can be raised and lowered using external stimuli. Applied voltages can turn on redox states to alter electrostatic barriers but their use for directing motion requires knowledge of their impact on the kinetics. Herein, we make the first measurements on the movement of cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+) across the radical&#8208;cation state of monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene (MPTTF) in a [2]rotaxane using variable scan&#8208;rate electrochemistry. The [2]rotaxane is designed in a way that directs CBPQT4+ to a high&#8208;energy co&#8208;conformation upon oxidation of MPTTF to either the radical cation (MPTTF&#8901;+) or the dication (MPTTF2+). 1H&#160;NMR spectroscopic investigations carried out in acetonitrile at 298&#8197;K showed direct interconversion to the thermodynamically more stable ground&#8208;state co&#8208;conformation with CBPQT4+ moving across the oxidized MPTTF2+ electrostatic barrier. The electrochemical studies revealed that interconversion takes place by movement of CBPQT4+ across both the MPTTF&#8226;+ (19.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and MPTTF2+ (18.7&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) barriers. The outcome of our studies shows that MPTTF has three accessible redox states that can be used to kinetically control the movement of the ring component in mechanically interlocked molecules.

         <title>Benzoic Acid Serves as Precursor of Catalytic HAT Reagent in a Two&#8208;Molecule Photoredox System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl carboxy radicals generated from benzoic acids in a two&#8208;molecule photoredox system can function as catalytic HAT reagents. Various acetals, ethers, alcohols, and alkenes can be employed in the photoreaction to provide both high yields of adducts and high recoveries of benzoic acids.







Abstract
The photoinduced regioselective HAT reactions of acetals, ethers, and alcohols using benzoic acids in a two&#8208;molecule photoredox system led to the formation of new C&#8722;C bonds with alkenes under mild conditions. Aryl carboxy radicals generated from benzoic acids in a two&#8208;molecule photoredox system can function as catalytic HAT reagents, even though an excess amount of a hydrogen donor substrate is required. Various acetals, ethers, alcohols, and alkenes can be employed in the photoreaction to provide both high yields of adducts and high recoveries of benzoic acids.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Molecule Hybridization at a Ferromagnetic Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using angle&#8208;resolved photoemission and density functional theory, we show that introducing graphene as a buffer layer between a molecular layer and a ferromagnetic substrate nearly isolates the molecule electronically, yet hybridization persists. In particular, FePc/Gr/Co and F16FePc/Gr/Co reveal a &#960; hybrid state due to vertical interaction between graphene's pz state and the molecular &#960; core.







Abstract
The introduction of a graphene (Gr) buffer layer between a ferromagnetic substrate and a metallorganic molecule is known to mediate the magnetic coupling between them, an effect attributed to a weak hybridization between graphene and molecule. In this paper, we present experimental evidence of this effect through a detailed investigation of the frontier electronic properties of iron phthalocyanine deposited on cobalt&#8208;supported graphene. Despite being physisorbed, the molecular adsorption on Gr/Co induces a sizeable charge transfer from graphene to the molecular macrocycle leading to the partial occupation of the LUMO and the appearance of an energetically localized hybrid state, which can be attributed to the overlap between the graphene pz state and the molecular macrocycle. Graphene is not inert either; the adsorption of the molecule induces doping and alters the Fermi velocity of both the hybrid minicone state and the Dirac cone. Similar effects are observed when the molecular periphery is decorated with fluorine atoms, known for their electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, with minimal changes in the energy alignment.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Protein Stabilization in VIVO/8&#8208;Hydroxyquinoline&#8211;Lysozyme Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of potential drug [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2], with 8&#8208;HQ = 8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato, with lysozyme results in the formation of a non&#8208;covalent adduct with [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2(H2O)] and covalent with [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ upon the binding to Asp119. Covalent binding is favored by a &#960;&#8208;&#960; contact with Trp62 of another protein molecule, unveiling the role of protein&#8208;protein interaction in the stabilization of metal&#8208;protein adducts.







Abstract
The binding of the potential drug [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2], where 8&#8208;HQ is 8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato, with hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) was evaluated through spectroscopic (electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR, and UV&#8208;visible), spectrometric (electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry, ESI&#8208;MS), crystallographic (X&#8208;ray diffraction, XRD), and computational (DFT and docking) studies. ESI&#8208;MS indicates the interaction of [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ and [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2(H2O)] species with HEWL. Room temperature EPR spectra suggest both covalent and non&#8208;covalent binding of the two different V&#8208;containing fragments. XRD analyses confirm these findings, showing that [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ interacts covalently with the solvent exposed Asp119, while cis&#8208;[VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2(H2O)] non&#8208;covalently with Arg128 and Lys96 from a symmetry mate. The covalent binding of [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ to Asp119 is favored by a &#960;&#8208;&#960; contact with Trp62 and a H&#8208;bond with Asn103 of a symmetry&#8208;related molecule. Additionally, the covalent binding of VVO2+ to Asp48 and non&#8208;covalent binding of other V&#8208;containing fragments to Arg5, Cys6, and Glu7 are revealed. Molecular docking indicates that, in the absence of the interactions occurring at the protein&#8208;protein interface close to Asp119, the covalent binding to Glu35 or Asp52 should be preferred. Such a protein&#8208;protein stabilization could be more common than what believed up today, at least in the solid state, and should be considered in the characterization of metal&#8208;protein adducts.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two universal triptycene&#8208;based tripodal pedestals featuring terminal alkynes in the axial position are presented. Their versatility is showcased by incorporating them into the structures of diverse functional molecules such as unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motors, photoswitches, and Brownian molecular rotors.







Abstract
Molecular platforms are essential components of various surface&#8208;mounted molecular devices. Here, we document the synthesis of two universal triptycene&#8208;based tripodal pedestals featuring terminal alkynes in the axial position. We showcase their versatility by incorporating them into the structures of diverse functional molecules such as unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motors, photoswitches, and Brownian molecular rotors using standard cross&#8208;coupling reactions. We also present their fundamental physical properties, including acidity constants, data from differential scanning calorimetry, and crystallographic analysis of two parent and five derived structures. Finally, and importantly, we demonstrate that the photochemical properties of selected photoswitch representatives remain uncompromised when fused with tripods.

         <title>Recent Applications of Sulfonium Salts in Synthesis and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of sulfonium salts in organic synthesis has experienced a dramatic increase during the last years that can arguably be attributed to three main factors; the development of more direct and efficient synthetic methods that make easily available sulfonium reagents of a wide structural variety, their intrinsic thermal stability, which facilitates their structural modification, handling and purification even on large scale, and the recognition that their reactivity resembles that of hypervalent iodine compounds and therefore, they can be used as replacement of such reagents for most of their uses. This renewed interest has led to the improvement of already existing reactions, as well as to the discovery of unprecedented transformations; in particular, by the implementation of photocatalytic protocols. This review aims to summarize the most recent advancements on the area focusing on the work published during and after 2020. The scope of the methods developed will be highlighted and their limitations critically evaluated.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigations of Crucial Factors for the Non&#8208;Covalent Functionalization of Black Phosphorus (BP) using Perylene Diimide Derivatives for the Passivation of BP Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;covalent functionalization of black phosphorus (BP) was studied with a scope of ten tailor&#8208;made perylene diimides (PDIs). A combination of UV/Vis&#8208;, fluorescence&#8208;, as well as Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy was used to investigate the structural factors, which contribute to a pronounced PDI&#8208;BP interaction and thus support the protection of BP nanosheets against oxidative degradation. We were able to show, that water&#8208;soluble, amphiphilic PDIs with highly charged head groups can be used for the non&#8208;covalent functionalization of BP in aqueous media. Here, based on the hydrophobic effect, an efficient adsorption of the respective PDI molecules takes place and leads to the formation of a passivating film, yielding a considerable stabilization of the BP flakes under ambient conditions exceeding 30 days.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Steric and Electronic Properties of Hemilabile NHC ligands for Gold(I/III) Catalyzed Oxyarylation of Ethylene: A Computational Study.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic studies on 1,2&#8208;oxyarylation of ethylene promoted by gold catalysts bearing hemilabile N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC^X) ligands were conducted by DFT calculations, exploring the whole catalytic cycle. After highest energy transition state (TS) barriers were located for NHC^N gold catalyst, and experimental results with different iodoarenes and alcohols rationalized, the study was extended to modified NHC^X catalysts, to observe how electronic and steric effects could affect the rate determining step TS. Electronic effects were investigated on NHC^X (X = H, N, O, P, and S), whereas steric effects emerged when comparing catalysts with different N&#8208;R groups (R = Dipp, Mes, tBu and Me). Finally, we suggest a different catalyst design based on N&#8208;aryl N&#8208;o&#8208;donor&#8208;aryl NHC, with different donors and NHC backbones to search for better performing systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational screening two&#8208;dimensional conjugated microporous polymer applied in perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated microporous polymer with a structure of 2D nanosheets has been synthesized. Theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that the Fermi level of this 2D polymer aligns well with perovskite absorber, and its conduction band is high enough to block electron transport to the anode. This 2D polymer is used to modify the hole transport layer, significantly improving its photoelectric properties, including enhanced hole mobility, matched energy level, and reduced recombination. Furthermore, the 2D polymer exhibits a mesoporous structure, allowing perovskite to fill into its loose framework, increasing the hole export area and providing a large hole transport flux. As a result, the efficiency of inverted perovskite solar cells enhances to 24.64% from 21.17% of control device without 2D conjugated microporous polymer. Given that this material can be synthesized on a large scale, this work has significant implications for the future development of 2D polymers in perovskite solar cells, potentially accelerating industrialization.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Enantioselective Triplet Radical Reaction on Metal: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition of Acylsilanes to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Ketones and Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition of acylsilanes has been developed. The conjugate acylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones and aldehydes was promoted by a copper(I)/chiral NHC catalyst under visible&#8208;light irradiation for synthesizing various 2&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds in enantioenriched forms. Mechanistic studies combining experiments and quantum chemical calculations indicated a reaction mechanism involving copper&#8208;to&#8208;acyl charge transfer (i.e., metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT)) excitation of an alkene&#8208;bound acylcopper complex. The MLCT excitation is followed by an electronical and geometrical change to generate a &#946;&#8208;radical&#8208;C&#8208;enolate&#8208;Cu(II)&#8208;acyl complex with an acyl radical character, which undergoes facile C&#8211;C bond formation in the copper coordination sphere, affording the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition product.</dc:description>

         <title>High Yield of L&#8208;Sorbose via D&#8208;Glucose Isomerization in Ethanol over a Bifunctional Titanium&#8208;Boron&#8208;Beta Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>D&#8208;Glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization on Lewis acidic zeolite is a highly attractive avenue for sorbose production. But the L&#8208;sorbose yield is limited by the competing D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;D&#8208;fructose isomerization and reaction equilibrium. In this work, it is suggested that ethanol directs the glucose conformation for selective D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization. It also reacts with the produced L&#8208;sorbose to form ethyl&#8208;sorboside, which allows the D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization to proceed beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium limit.&#160; It is shown that a bifunctional zeolite Beta containing framework titanium (Ti) and boron (B) is a selective catalyst for this tandem reaction: Lewis acidic framework Ti catalyzes the D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization via an intramolecular 5,1&#8208;hydride shift process as confirmed by isotopic tracing experiments followed by 13C&#8208;NMR, while weak Br&#248;nsted acid framework B selectively promotes the sorbose ketalization with ethanol. A remarkably high yield of L&#8208;sorbose with a high fraction of sugar (&gt;95%: 27% unreacted glucose, 11.4% fructose, 57% sorbose) was obtained after the mixture produced in ethanol was hydrolyzed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancement of Effective Energy Barrier and Magnetic Blocking Temperature in Tetraoxolene Radical Coupled Dinuclear Dysprosium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A well&#8208;judged combination of a high axial ligand field and a bridging radical ligand in a dinuclear lanthanide complex provides a single&#8208;molecule magnet with a higher effective energy barrier for magnetic relaxation and blocking temperature compared to its non&#8208;radical analog due to significant magnetic exchange coupling between radical and Ln(III) ions. In this work, we report two chloranilate (CA) bridged dinuclear dysprosium complexes, [{(bbpen)Dy(&#956;2&#8208;CA)Dy(bbpen)}] (1Dy) and [{(bbpen)Dy(&#956;2&#8208;CA&#8226;)Dy(bbpen)}&#8208;{CoCp2}+] (2Dy), where 2Dy is the radical bridged Dy&#8208;complex obtained via the chemical reduction of bridging CA moiety (H2bbpen = N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxybenzyl)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methylpyridyl)ethylenediamine). The presence of high electronegative phenoxide moiety enhances the axial anisotropy of pseudo&#8208;square antiprismatic Dy(III) ions. The diffused spin of radical is efficiently coupled with anisotropic Dy(III) centres and decreases the quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) in the magnetic relaxation process. The magnetic relaxation of 1Dy follows Orbach, Raman, and QTM processes whereas for 2Dy it follows Orbach and Raman Processes. Due to less involvement of the QTM relaxation process, 2Dy shows a higher thermal energy barrier (Ueff = 700 K) and a high blocking temperature (6.7 K), compared to its non&#8208;radical analog. Remarkably, the radical coupled 2Dy complex shows the highest energy barrier among the radical bridged Dy(III)&#8208;based SMMs to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimensionally Extending from 1D MX&#8208;Chain to Ladder and Nanotube Systems: Structural and Electronic properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular one&#8208;dimensional (1D) electron systems have attracted much attention due to their unique electronic state, physical and chemical properties derived from high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio structures. Among 1D materials, mixed&#8208;valence halogen&#8208;bridged transition&#8208;metal chain complexes (MX&#8208;chains) based on coordination assemblies are currently of particular interest because their electronic properties, such as mixed&#8208;valence state and band gap, can be controlled by substituting components and varying configurations. In particular, chemistry has recently noted that dimensionally extending MX&#8208;chains through organic rung ligands can introduce and modulate electronic coupling of metal atoms between chains, i.e., interchain interactions. In this review, for the first time, we highlight the recent progress on MX systems from the viewpoint of dimensionally extending from 1D chain to ladder and nanotube, mainly involving structural design and electronic properties. Overall, dimensional extension can not only tune the electronic properties of MX&#8208;chain, but also build the unique platform for studying transport dynamics in confined space, such as proton conduction. Based on these features, we envision that the MX&#8208;chain systems provide valuable insights into deep understanding of 1D electron systems, as well as the potential applications such as nanoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We have introduced Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes (ReL1 &#8208; ReL6) [Re(CO)3(N^N)Cl] where N^N = extensive &#960; conjugated imidazo&#8208;[4,5&#8208;f]1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives that helps in strong DNA intercalation, enhanced photophysical behavior, increase the 3&#960;&#8208;&#960;* character of T1 state for PDT and high value of lipophilicity for cell membrane penetration. These complexes exhibited prominent intraligand/ligand&#8208;centered (&#960; &#8208; &#960;*/ 1LC) absorption bands at &#955; 260 &#8208; 350 nm and relatively weak metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (1MLCT) bands within the &#955; 350 &#8208; 550 nm range. Among the six synthesized complexes, [(CO)3ReICl(K2&#8208;N,N&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;(1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;f][1,10]phenanthroline] (ReL6) exhibited outstanding potency (IC50 ~ 6 &#181;M, PI &gt; 9) under yellow light irradiation compared to dark conditions. Importantly, extremely lipophilic complex ReL6 showed effective penetration through the cell membrane and localized primarily in mitochondria (Pearson&#8217;s correlation coefficient, PCC = 0.918) of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells. Complex ReL6 exhibited more than 9 times higher photo&#8208;toxicity in normoxic and hypoxic environment of tumor by inducing 1O2 generation (type II PDT), radical generation triggered by NADH oxidation (type I PDT). This complex is a promising candidate for TNBC treatment in hypoxic tumors, with efficacy comparable to photofrin and have demonstrated CO release ability under UV light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;surface&#8208;mediated synthesis of sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework photocathodes for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution</title>

         <dc:description>Sp2&#8208;carbon (sp2&#8208;c) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring distinctive &#960;&#8208;conjugated network structures, facilitate the migration of photo&#8208;generated carriers, rendering them exceptionally appealing for applications in photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, owing to the powdery nature of COFs, leaving anchor the sp2&#8208;c COFs powder tightly onto a conductive substrate challenging. Here, we propose a method for preparing photoactive substance&#8208;conductive substrate integrated photocathodes through copper surface&#8208;mediated knoevenagel polycondensation (Cu&#8208;SMKP), this approach results in a uniform and stable sp2&#8208;c COF film, directly grown on commercial copper foam (COFTh&#8208;Cu). The COFTh&#8208;Cu demonstrates a high H2&#8208;evolution photocurrent density of 56 &#956;A cm&#8722;2 at 0.3 V versus RHE, sustaining stability for 12 hours. The as&#8208;prepared COFTh&#8208;Cu represents a 4.5&#8208;fold increase in current density compared to traditional spin&#8208;coating methods and outperforms most COF photocathodes without cocatalysts. This innovative copper surface&#8208;mediated approach for preparing photocathodes opens up a crucial pathway towards the realization of highly active COF photocathodes</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To tackle the global energy scarcity and environmental degradation, developing efficient electrocatalysts is essential for achieving sustainable hydrogen production via water splitting. Modulating the d&#8208;band center of transition metal electrocatalysts is an effective approach to regulate the adsorption energy of intermediates, alter reaction pathways, lower the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, and ultimately improve electrocatalytic water splitting performance. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in modulating the d&#8208;band center for enhanced electrocatalytic water splitting is offered. Initially, the basics of the d&#8208;band theory are discussed. Subsequently, recent modulation strategies that aim to boost electrocatalytic activity, with particular emphasis on the d&#8208;band center as a key indicator in water splitting are summarized. Lastly, the importance of regulating electrocatalytic activity through d&#8208;band center, along with the challenges and prospects for improving electrocatalytic water splitting performance by fine&#8208;tuning the transition metal d&#8208;band center, are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Encapsulation of Menthol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of flavoring ingredients like menthol in the food industry is hindered by their high volatility and poor thermal stability, which lead to significant losses during processing and storage. Encapsulation of flavors into porous materials to obtain inclusion complexes (ICs) has proved to be an efficient strategy. In the present study, we synthesized a series of relatively food&#8208;safe three&#8208;dimensional anionic cyclodextrin&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (CD&#8208;COFs) with spiroborate linkages using a facile microwave&#8208;assisted method. The high surface area and newly formed cavitied of COFs significantly enhanced the encapsulation efficiency of menthol compared to native CD materials. Our findings revealed that &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Li, with Li+ as the counterion, achieved superior encapsulation efficiency of 25.9%, outperforming &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Na, &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;K and &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Li under the same conditions. Thermal stability measurements show that the menthol/&#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Li&#8208;ICs effectively stabilize menthol against heat evaporation at elevated temperatures due to the strengthened interaction between menthol and &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;COF&#8208;Li. The promising results of this research suggest that rapid advancements in COF technology will provide new opportunities for enhancing the stability of flavoring ingredients in the food industry.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The application of flavoring ingredients like menthol in the food industry is hindered by their high volatility and poor thermal stability, which lead to significant losses during processing and storage. Encapsulation of flavors into porous materials to obtain inclusion complexes (ICs) has proved to be an efficient strategy. In the present study, we synthesized a series of relatively food-safe three-dimensional anionic cyclodextrin-based covalent organic frameworks (CD-COFs) with spiroborate linkages using a facile microwave-assisted method. The high surface area and newly formed cavitied of COFs significantly enhanced the encapsulation efficiency of menthol compared to native CD materials. Our findings revealed that &#947;-CD-COF-Li, with Li+ as the counterion, achieved superior encapsulation efficiency of 25.9%, outperforming &#947;-CD-COF-Na, &#947;-CD-COF-K and &#945;-CD-COF-Li under the same conditions. Thermal stability measurements show that the menthol/&#947;-CD-COF-Li-ICs effectively stabilize menthol against heat evaporation at elevated temperatures due to the strengthened interaction between menthol and &#947;-CD-COF-Li. The promising results of this research suggest that rapid advancements in COF technology will provide new opportunities for enhancing the stability of flavoring ingredients in the food industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Photophysical Characterization of Biocompatible Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Carbazole&#8208;Coumarins for Sensing Applications.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of biocompatible fluorescent carbazole&#8208;coumarins with robust photoluminescence quantum yields and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties have been meticulously designed and synthesized. The TADF characteristics of these compounds were methodically investigated both in solution and in the solid state. Furthermore, the study showcased the promising practical applications of these compounds by integrating them into a Cmr&#8208;PMMA&#8208;based sensor for molecular oxygen detection.







Abstract
A series of fluorescent carbazole&#8208;coumarins exhibiting good photoluminescence quantum yields and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties have been designed and synthetized using computer&#8208;aided density functional theory calculations. The TADF characteristics of the carbazole&#8208;coumarins were systematically explored both in solution and in the solid state, utilizing poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a matrix. The study revealed that the introduction of carbazole units onto the coumarin benzene ring led to compounds with thermally induced reverse intersystem crossing and delayed fluorescence. The study further demonstrated the potential utility of these compounds in practical applications by incorporating them into a Cmr&#8208;PMMA&#8208;based sensor for molecular oxygen detection. The resulting sensor exhibited promising performance, highlighting the adaptability and efficacy of the synthesized TADF&#8208;carbazole&#8208;coumarin compounds for reversible molecular oxygen sensing.

         <title>Theoretical Insight into Complexation Between Cyclocarbons and C60 Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding energy between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene is significantly stronger than that between two C18 or two C60 fullerenes. As the ring size increases, the angle between the cyclocarbons of the 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 trimers formed by two cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene gradually decreases. The research results on the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 trimers formed by cyclocarbon and two C60 fullerenes showed when the cyclocarbon is not quite large, the trimers exhibit an ideal dumbbell&#8208;like structure.







Abstract
This work conducts a comprehensive theoretical study on the non&#8208;covalent complexation between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene for the first time. The binding energy between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene is significantly stronger than that between two C18 or two C60 fullerenes, indicating a particularly strong affinity. The cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene can spontaneously assemble into complexes in the gas phase at room temperature, and the hydrophobic effect caused by the solvent environment can promote this binding. The binding strength with C60 fullerene increases almost linearly with the increase of cyclocarbon size, and the C34@C60 dimer exhibits a perfect nano&#8208;Saturn structure. As the ring size increases, the angle between the two cyclocarbons of the 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 trimers formed by cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene gradually decreases. In C60@2&#8197;C34 trimer, the fullerene is symmetrically surrounded by two cyclocarbons. The results on the trimers formed by cyclocarbon and C60 fullerenes in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio showed when the cyclocarbon sandwiched between two fullerenes is not quite large, the trimers exhibit an ideal dumbbell&#8208;like structure, and the presence of the first fullerene has a significant synergistic effect on the binding of the second one. The cyclocarbon greatly promotes the dimerization of fullerenes, which acted as a &#8220;molecular glue&#8221;.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We summarized recent advances in photocatalytic sulfonylation utilizing sulfonyl chloride, sodium sulfinates, sulfonyl hydrazides, and sulfinic acids as sources of sulfonyl radicals. All the reaction designs and mechanisms have been comprehensively analyzed.







Abstract
Photosynthesis, converting sustainable solar energy into chemical energy, has emerged as a promising craft to achieve diverse organic transformations due to its mild reaction conditions, sustainability, and high efficiency. The synthesis of sulfonated compounds has drawn significant attention in the pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials industries due to the unique structure and electronic properties of the sulfonyl groups. Over the past decades, many photocatalytic sulfonylation reactions have been developed. In this review, the recent advances in photocatalyzed sulfonylation have been reviewed since 2020, with a primary focus on discussing reaction design and mechanism.

         <title>Superior Tumor Cell Uptake by Mono&#8208; and Tri&#8208;Nuclear Rhodamine&#8208;Gadolinium(III) Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superior cell uptake and tumor cell selectivity at low incubation concentrations by new mono&#8208; and tri&#8208;nuclear rhodamine&#8208;gadolinium(III) agents are reported, offering potential dual MRI/fluorescent probes for advanced theranostic applications.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel trinuclear rhodamine&#8208;Gd(III) complex, along with two analogous mononuclear rhodamine&#8208;Gd(III) complexes, are reported. All complexes displayed good selectivity in a human glioma cell line (T98G) when compared to a glial cell line (SVG p12), with low cytotoxicities. Superior tumor cell uptake for these Gd(III) complexes was observed at lower incubation concentrations compared to previously&#8208;reported delocalized lipophilic cations such as a rhodamine&#8208;lanthanoid(III) probe and Gd(III)&#8208;arylphosphonium complexes, with ca. 150&#8201;% and 250&#8201;% increases in Gd uptake, respectively.

         <title>Unexpectedly Regioselective Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions of New Unsymmetrical Benzoquinones: A Convenient Synthetic Entry to Uniquely Substituted Decalins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report flexible synthesis of new unsymmetrically 2,6&#8208;disubstituted benzoquinones (33 examples) and their Diels&#8208;Alder reactions proceeding with high (and rather unpredictable) regioselectivity. These experimental findings were rationalized by DFT calculations and exploited in the convenient preparation of uniquely substituted and stereochemically defined decalins, and a novel forskolin analog with ethyl group at the fusion of the rings B and C.







Abstract
We report flexible synthesis of new unsymmetrically 2,6&#8208;disubstituted benzoquinones (33 examples) and a systematic study of their reactivity in the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. The Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of selected unsymmetrical benzoquinones with seemingly similar substituents were found to proceed with high regioselectivity and the formation of selected experimentally observed main products was rationalized by theoretical (DFT) calculations. The findings can be exploited in the convenient preparation of densely substituted and stereochemically defined decalins with unique angular substituents at ring fusion. We also demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology in complex molecule synthesis through the total synthesis of a novel forskolin analog possessing an ethyl group at the fusion of the rings B and C.

         <title>Cooperative NHC and Photoredox Catalyzed Radical Aminoacylation of Alkenes to Tetrahydropyridazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) radical organocatalysis offers a powerful platform to construct valuable molecules. Herein, we report the synthesis of 1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridazines through cooperative NHC/photoredox catalysis. The aminoacylation reaction involves a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization of N&#8208;centered radicals, followed by radical&#8208;radical coupling of the resulting benzylic radicals with ketyl radicals, which are generated via single&#8208;electron reduction of in&#8197;situ formed acyl azolium ions.







Abstract
Tetrahydropyridazines constitute an important structural motif found in numerous natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, we report an aminoacylation reaction of alkenes that enables the synthesis of 1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridazines through cooperative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and photoredox catalysis. This approach involves the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization of N&#8208;centered hydrazonyl radicals, generated via single&#8208;electron oxidation of hydrazones, followed by a radical&#8211;radical coupling step. The mild process tolerates a wide range of common functional groups and affords a variety of tetrahydropyridazines in moderate to high yields. Preliminary investigations using chiral NHC catalysts demonstrate the potential of this protocol for asymmetric radical reactions.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of NiMn Layered Double Hydroxides/Graphene Oxide Composites Synthesized by One&#8208;Step Hydrothermal Method for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the enhanced electrochemical performance of supercapacitors by optimizing electrode materials through the synthesis of NiMn layered double hydroxides combined with graphene oxide using a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method.







Abstract
This study aims to enhance the performance of supercapacitors, focusing particularly on optimizing electrode materials. While pure NiMn layered double hydroxides (LDHs) exhibit excellent electrochemical properties, they have limitations in achieving high specific capacitance. Therefore, this paper successfully synthesized composite materials of NiMn LDHs with varying loadings of graphene oxide (GO) using a hydrothermal method. Systematic physicochemical characterization of the synthesized materials, such as powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM), and Raman spectroscopy, revealed the influence of GO doping on the microstructure and electrochemical performance of NiMn LDHs. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the NiMn LDHs/GO electrode material exhibited optimal electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 2096&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 current density and 1471&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, when GO doping level was 0.45&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Furthermore, after 1000 cycles of stability testing, the material retained 53.3&#8201;% capacitance at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, indicating good cyclic stability. This study not only provides new directions for research on supercapacitor electrode materials but also offers new strategies for developing low&#8208;cost and efficient electrode materials.

         <title>Electrolytes for Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries: Progress and Outlook</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents an overview of recent advances in electrolytes in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). AIB electrolytes mainly include liquid and solid electrolytes. The main research directions in liquid electrolytes for AIBs mainly include electrolyte solutes, &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; (WIS) electrolytes, and electrolyte additives







Abstract
Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) are promising electrochemical energy storage sources because of their high theoretical specific capacity, light weight, zero pollution, safety, inexpensiveness, and abundant resources. These theoretical advantages have recently made AIBs a research hotspot. However, electrolyte&#8208;related issues significantly limit their commercialization. The electrolyte choices for AIBs are significantly limited, and most of the available options do not facilitate the Al3+/Al three&#8208;electron transfer reaction. Thus, this review presents an overview of recent advances in electrolytes and modification strategies for AIBs to clarify the limitations of existing AIB electrolytes and offer guidance for improving their performance. Furthermore, herein, the advantages, limitations and possible solutions for each electrolyte are discussed, after which the future of AIB electrolytes is envisioned.

         <title>Two&#8208;Fold Oxidative Coupling of Furan with Indole Provides Modular Access to a New Class of Tetra&#8208;(hetero)arylated Furans with up to Four Different Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly arylated propeller&#8208;shaped heteroarenes constitute an intriguing class of molecular scaffolds for material science applications. Among these, tetraarylated furans demonstrate differentiated properties as compared to other similar heterocyclic cores. The synthetic complexity to access tetraarylated furans increases significantly with increasing number of different peripheral aryl groups. There are only a very limited number of methodologies available to access furans with four different (hetero)aryl substituents. Notably, none of these involve direct oxidative coupling on the furan core as the method of choice. Herein, we report the first methodology based on a sequential two&#8208;fold oxidative C&#8208;C coupling of furans with indoles to access bis(indolyl)furans (BIFs) &#8208; a new class of &#8216;extremely congested&#8217; tetra&#8208;(hetero)arylated furans with up to four different substituents. The reaction is mediated by inexpensive, earth&#8208;abundant FeCl3.6H2O and displays high efficiency, wide substrate scope, modularity and aqueous compatibility. Moreover, we also present the first validation of the distinct aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) property of the tetraarylated furans beyond only phenyls as peripheral groups and disclose new mechanistic underpinnings for the same.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Interaction of Chiral Carbon Dots with Nucleic Acids: A Promising Nanosensing Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) represent an emerging class of nanomaterials that combine outstanding photoluminescent properties with low toxicity and excellent biocompatibility. These unique features have garnered significant interest for potential applications in sensing as well as nanovectors for bioactive compounds. Within this context, the possibility of synthesizing chiral carbon dots (CCDs) has paved the way for a plethora of bioapplications in their interaction with chiral biomolecules. In this study we report the synthesis and characterization of CCDs with opposite chiralities and their selective interaction with nucleic acids. A systematic study on their interaction with different oligonucleotides (ODNs) using UV&#8208;vis, photoluminescence, and circular dichroism analyses highlighted how the chiral surface of the CCDs induces distinct spectroscopic responses in CCDs&#8208;ODN conjugates. These findings establish the foundation for innovative applications of CCDs as nanosensors and nanocarriers for nucleic acids. Additionally, the antioxidant properties of CCDs were investigated, highlighting their dual potential as both sensing and preservative nanomaterials for genetic material. Our results suggest significant implications for the development of chiral&#8208;specific diagnostic tools, drug delivery systems, and therapeutic agents. Furthermore, these properties open new avenues for the use of CCDs in antibiotic residue detection, fluorescence imaging, and photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed [3+1+1] Cascade Cyclization of O&#8208;Acyl Oximes with Sulfur and Silyl Enol Ethers: Rapid Access to Naphthothiazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component cyclization reaction of O&#8208;acyl oximes, silyl enol ethers and elemental sulfur has been developed, in which silyl enol ether acts as a C1 synthon to participate in cyclization reaction and build series of 2&#8208;aroylnaphthothiazoles and 2&#8208;aroylbenzothienothiazoles. The preliminary exploration of the reaction mechanism indicated that this transformation probably proceeded through a radical process, involving S3&#8226;&#8722; as a key intermediate, enabling subsequent nucleophilic substitution with O&#8208;acyl oximes to afford iminosulfur radical, which undergoes 1,3&#8208;H shift to yield sulfur&#8208;centered radical intermediate. And then this intermediate undergoes radical addition with silyl enol ether, leading to the formation of the titled products through intramolecular cyclization and oxidation. Moreover, the products obtained exhibit favorable fluorescence properties, which indicates their potential application as functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Synthesis of 3D Aligned VO2 and V2O5 Carbon Nanotube Hybrid Materials by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3D carbon nanotube hybrid materials containing VO2 and V2O5 evenly distributed onto vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) is reported. Adjustable loading of particles in controllable sizes onto the VACNTs was developed via a stepwise chemical vapour deposition (CVD) approach. Solid VO(acac)2 is chosen as vanadium source. CO2 acts as reactive gas for the pre&#8208;functionalisation of the VACNTs. The process temperature was identified as key parameter to control the deposited vanadium oxide phase. A temperature of 550&#176;C results in monoclinic VO2, while 600 &#176;C results in the deposition of V2O5 onto the VACNT support. The morphology and the amount of deposited material was found to be dependent on the reactor dimensions and the degree of functionalization of the carbon support. An increase of the D/G ratio of the VACNT from 0.75 to 1.08 caused by a CO2 treatment step within the process led to an increase of the particle coverage from a scarce coverage without prior CO2 treatment to a dense coverage of the VACNT support after 15 min of CO2 exposure time. Size and crystallinity of the as deposited particles can be further adjusted by a controlled heat treatment after VO(acac)2 precursor deposition.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust and Irreversible Sortase&#8208;Mediated Ligation by Empolyment of Sarkosyl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sarkosyl significantly enhances sortase&#8208;mediated ligation by promoting substrate solubility, sorting motif accessibility and rendering reaction irreversibility, thereby leading to excellent ligation yields. Notably, this method is compatible with peptides or proteins capable of forming liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation, offering a powerful approach for conjugating aggregation&#8208;prone substrates in peptide and protein chemistry.







Abstract
Sortase&#8208;mediated ligation (SML) is a widely used method for peptide and protein ligation due to ease of substrate preparation and fast enzymatic kinetics. But there are drawbacks that limit broader applications. Sorting motif in substrates may not be exposed to sortase efficiently due to folding or aggregation. In addition, the ligation is reversible under transpeptidation equilibrium that restricts ligation yield. Here we report a simple but robust method to overcome such limitations. By employment of sarkosyl, the detergent alters substrate conformation to raise sorting motif accessibility for sortase catalysis. Moreover, transpeptidation becomes irreversible presumably by formation of micelle to shield ligation products from sortase. In consequence, excellent yields were achieved from sortase variants with different substrate specificity. Notably, this method is compatible with peptides or proteins capable of forming liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), presenting a powerful approach for the conjugation of aggregation&#8208;prone substrates. Therefore, we believe the sarkosyl&#8208;enhanced SML could be widely applied in peptide and protein chemistry and the unique irreversible transpeptidation mechanism offers an insight to detergent&#8208;driven equilibrium.

A series of titanium &#956;2&#8208;nitrido complexes supported by the triamidoamine ligand Xy&#8208;N3N (Xy&#8208;N3N={(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8722;) is reported. The titanium azido complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiN3] (1&#8208;N3) reacted with lithium metal or with alkali metal naphthalenides (alkali metal M=Na, K, and Rb) in THF to give the corresponding dinuclear &#956;2&#8208;nitrido complexes M[(Xy&#8208;N3N)Ti=N&#8208;Ti(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (2&#8208;M; M=Li, Na, K, Rb). While 2&#8208;Li and 2&#8208;K consist of a &#956;2&#8208;nitrido ligand with a linear Ti&#8722;N&#8722;Ti core, 2&#8208;Na contains a T&#8208;shape &#956;3&#8208;nitrido ligand with the sodium cation interacting with the aryl substituent.







Abstract
A series of titanium &#956;2&#8208;nitrido complexes supported by the triamidoamine ligand Xy&#8208;N3N (Xy&#8208;N3N={(3,5&#8208;Me2C6H3)NCH2CH2}3N3&#8722;) is reported. The titanium azido complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiN3] (1&#8208;N3), prepared by salt metathesis of the chloride complex [(Xy&#8208;N3N)TiCl] (1&#8208;Cl) with NaN3, reacted with lithium metal or with alkali metal naphthalenides (alkali metal M=Na, K, and Rb) in THF to give the corresponding dinuclear &#956;2&#8208;nitrido complexes M[(Xy&#8208;N3N)Ti=N&#8208;Ti(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (2&#8208;M; M=Li, Na, K, Rb). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of 2&#8208;Li, 2&#8208;Na, and 2&#8208;K revealed alkali metal dependent structures in the solid state. While 2&#8208;Li and 2&#8208;K contain a &#956;2&#8208;nitrido ligand with a linear Ti&#8722;N&#8722;Ti core, 2&#8208;Na includes a &#956;3&#8208;nitrido ligand as part of a T&#8208;shape Ti2NaN fragment with the sodium cation weekly coordinated to the nitrido nitrogen atom. When the synthesis of the nitrido complexes was carried out in the presence of excess alkali metals, decomposition of the nitrido complexes was observed affording some intractable titanium species along with the trialkali metal salts [M3(Xy&#8208;N3N)] (3&#8208;M) (M=Li, Na, K, and Rb). These salts were also prepared by deprotonation of (Xy&#8208;N3N)H3 with the corresponding alkali metal hexamethyldisilazide and characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Improving Environmental Stress Cracking Resistance of High&#8208;Density Polyethylene Grades by Comonomer Addition and Nanocomposite Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study aims to assess how polymer density, influenced by comonomer content and nanosilica addition, impacts the mechanical and ESCR of HDPE. Results showed varying tensile properties and ESCR based on comonomer content. Additionally, incorporating chemically modified nanosilica improved ESCR by 40&#8201;%, as revealed by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and NCI plots.







Abstract
The aim of this paper is to determine the effect of polymer density, correlated to the comonomer content, and nanosilica addition on the mechanical and Environmental Stress Cracking Resistance (ESCR) characteristics of high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE). In this regard, five HDPE samples with similar Melt Flow Index (MFI) and molar mass but various densities were acquired from a petrochemical plant. Two polymerization reactors work in series and differ only in the amount of 1&#8208;buene comonomer fed to the second reactor. To ascertain the microstructure of the studied samples, GPC and SSA (successive self&#8208;nucleation and annealing) analyses were accomplished. All samples resulted having similar characteristics but slightly various SCB/1000&#8197;C=7.26&#8211;9.74 (SCB=Short Chain Branching). Consequently, meanwhile studied HDPEs reveal similar notched impact and stress at yield values, the tensile modulus, stress&#8208;at&#8208;break, and elongation&#8208;at&#8208;break tend to demonstrate different results with the SCB content. More significantly, ESCR characteristic varied considerably with SCB/1000&#8197;C extent, so that higher amount of SCB acknowledged advanced ESCR. Notably, blending HDPE sample containing higher amount of SCB/1000&#8197;C, with 3&#8197;wt.% of chemically modified nanosilica enhanced ESCR characteristic by 40&#8201;%. DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations unveiled the role of the comonomer, quantitatively by binding energies and qualitatively by Non Covalent Interaction (NCI) plots.

     alt="Improving Environmental Stress Cracking Resistance of High-Density Polyethylene Grades by Comonomer Addition and Nanocomposite Approach"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study aims to assess how polymer density, influenced by comonomer content and nanosilica addition, impacts the mechanical and ESCR of HDPE. Results showed varying tensile properties and ESCR based on comonomer content. Additionally, incorporating chemically modified nanosilica improved ESCR by 40&#8201;%, as revealed by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and NCI plots.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of this paper is to determine the effect of polymer density, correlated to the comonomer content, and nanosilica addition on the mechanical and Environmental Stress Cracking Resistance (ESCR) characteristics of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). In this regard, five HDPE samples with similar Melt Flow Index (MFI) and molar mass but various densities were acquired from a petrochemical plant. Two polymerization reactors work in series and differ only in the amount of 1-buene comonomer fed to the second reactor. To ascertain the microstructure of the studied samples, GPC and SSA (successive self-nucleation and annealing) analyses were accomplished. All samples resulted having similar characteristics but slightly various SCB/1000&#8197;C=7.26&#8211;9.74 (SCB=Short Chain Branching). Consequently, meanwhile studied HDPEs reveal similar notched impact and stress at yield values, the tensile modulus, stress-at-break, and elongation-at-break tend to demonstrate different results with the SCB content. More significantly, ESCR characteristic varied considerably with SCB/1000&#8197;C extent, so that higher amount of SCB acknowledged advanced ESCR. Notably, blending HDPE sample containing higher amount of SCB/1000&#8197;C, with 3&#8197;wt.% of chemically modified nanosilica enhanced ESCR characteristic by 40&#8201;%. DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations unveiled the role of the comonomer, quantitatively by binding energies and qualitatively by Non Covalent Interaction (NCI) plots.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploiting Nitroreductases for the Tailored Photoenzymatic Synthesis of Structurally Diverse Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tailored photoenzymatic synthesis of anthranils and quinolines from o&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;substituted carbonyl substrates has been achieved using the flavin&#8208;dependent nitroreductase BaNTR1 in cooperation with chlorophyll as photocatalyst. This tunable photoenzymatic system achieved high conversions (up to &gt;99&#8201;%) and good product yields (up to 96&#8201;%), performing the chemoselective reduction of the nitro group without reduction of the carbonyl moiety or the activated carbon&#8208;carbon double bond.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds have a broad range of applications and their selective synthesis is very appealing for the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Herein we report the usage of the flavin&#8208;dependent nitroreductase BaNTR1 for the photoenzymatic synthesis of various anthranils and quinolines from retro&#8208;synthetically designed o&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;substituted carbonyl substrates, achieving high conversions (up to &gt;99&#8201;%) and good product yields (up to 96&#8201;%). Whereas the effective production of anthranils required the inclusion of H2O2 in the reaction mixtures to accumulate the needed hydroxylamine intermediates, the formation of quinolines required the use of anaerobic or reducing conditions to efficiently generate the essential amine intermediates. Critical to our success was the high chemoselectivity of BaNTR1, performing selective reduction of the nitro group without reduction of the carbonyl moiety or the activated carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. The results highlight the usefulness of an innocuous chlorophyll&#8208; and nitroreductase&#8208;based photoenzymatic system for the tailored synthesis of diverse N&#8208;heterocycles from simple nitro compounds.

         <title>Molecular Necklaces Formed Through Zn2+&#8208;Templated Binding of Macrocycles with Dynamically Formed Imines as Guest Recognition Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;in&#8208;ring establishing&#8221; strategy has afforded a molecular necklace from two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented dialdehydes, two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented diamines, four macrocycles, and four Zn2+ ions, in an overall yield of 69&#8201;% over three steps (assembly, imine reduction, and amine protonation).







Abstract
Herein we demonstrate an &#8220;in&#8208;ring establishing&#8221; strategy for assembling interlocked molecules through dynamic imine formation, &#8220;establishing&#8221; the host recognition sites in&#8197;situ. Using Zn2+ ions to template the assembly of a pyridine&#8208;containing macrocycle with semidumbbell&#8208;shaped triazole&#8208;containing aldehyde and amine derivatives, we obtained the corresponding [2]rotaxane in high yield (85&#8201;%) after subsequent imine reduction (NaBH4) and amine protonation (NH4PF6). We performed the same three steps (assembly, reduction, protonation) to prepare a stable and highly symmetrical [5]molecular necklace ([5]MN) from 12 components (two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented dialdehydes, two almost&#8208;90&#176;&#8208;oriented diamines, four macrocycles, four Zn2+ ions) in an overall yield of 69&#8201;%.

         <title>A Highly Selective Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring the Thyroid Hormone Transporter Activity in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the first example of a highly selective fluorescent probe for the transmembrane thyroid hormone transporter, monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8). The halogen bond forming ability of the iodine atoms with the transporter and the presence of a free carboxylic acid group are essential for the MCT8 selectivity.







Abstract
Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) is a trans&#8208;membrane transporter, which mediates the cellular delivery of thyroid hormones, L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3&#8242;&#8208;triiodo&#8208;L&#8208;thyronine (T3). In humans, the MCT8 protein is encoded by the SLC16A2 gene and mutations in the transporter cause a genetic neurological disorder known as Allan&#8208;Herndon&#8208;Dudley Syndrome (AHDS). MCT8 deficiency leads to impaired transport of thyroid hormones in the brain. Radiolabelled T4 and T3 or LC/MS&#8208;MS methods have been used to monitor the thyroid hormone uptake through MCT8. Herein, we developed a fluorescent based assay to monitor the thyroid hormone uptake through MCT8. A dansyl&#8208;based fluorescent probe having L&#8208;thyroxine moiety is found to be highly selective towards MCT8 in living cells. The high selectivity of the probe towards MCT8 can be attributed to the halogen bond&#8208;mediated recognition by the transporter protein. The presence of a free carboxylic acid group is essential for the specificity of the probe towards MCT8. Additionally, the selectivity of the probe for MCT8 is abolished upon esterification of the carboxylic group. Similarly, MCT8 does not recognize the probe when it contains a free amine group.

         <dc:description>Post&#8208;transition state bifurcation (PTSB) has received wide attention in the field of reaction mechanism research due to its role in producing nonstatistical reaction selectivity, which cannot be solely explained by transition state theory. Particularly, even subtle molecular motions such as bond torsion can precipitate PTSB, thereby significantly complicating the quantitative understanding of dynamic selectivity. In this work, we found that the radical addition of allenes is an elementary transformation that generally exhibits PTSB stereoselectivity, where a single radical addition transition state can lead to both Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic radicals via the post&#8208;transition state allylic single bond torsion. Interestingly, dynamic Z/E&#8208;selectivity favors the Z&#8208;allylic radicals, which contrasts the thermodynamic preference. Based on the dynamics study of twenty&#8208;five radical additions of mono&#8208;substituted allenes with diverse electronic and steric effects, we have identified that this dynamic stereoselectivity is synergistically controlled by the transition state structure and the differential trends within specific dimensions of the bifurcating reaction coordinates, which also holds true for di&#8208;substituted allene substrates. This study refines the mechanism of radical addition of allenes and underscores the importance of the differential trend of the reaction coordinates in controlling dynamic selectivity, offering a deeper insight into PTSB selectivity factors.</dc:description>

         <title>MoSe2&#8208;Sensitized Water Splitting Assisted by C60&#8208;Dendrons on the Basal Surface</title>

         <dc:description>We propose a new class of H2 evolution photocatalyst&#160;containing TMD not as a co&#8208;catalyst, but as a photosensitizer: MoSe2/C60&#8208;dendron nanohybrids, assisted by 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) as a sacrificial donor and Pt nanoparticles as co&#8208;catalysts. The 2D/0D mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunction formed by MoSe2 and C60 is highly effective in generating mobile carriers under visible and NIR light irradiation. &#160;This process involves electron extraction from the exciton in MoSe2 to C60, followed by electron transfer to Pt nanoparticles via MV2+, leading to H2 production from water. &#160;Even NIR light, such as 800 nm light corresponding to the A&#8208;exciton absorption of MoSe2, can facilitate water splitting. &#160;The EQY of the H2 evolution reaction was estimated to be 0.0027%.</dc:description>

We combine electronic coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) calculations with positronic multicomponent renormalized partial&#160;third&#8208;order propagator (MC&#8208;REN&#8208;PP3) calculations to effectively recover correlation energies. Analysis of potential energy curves confirms the energetic stability of these positronic&#160;molecules, with optimized structures identified as global minima. Further investigation of electron and positron densities&#160;reveals stabilization owing to the formation of two&#8208;positron bonds. The global stability of the Ps2XY complexes contrasts&#160;with the metastable two&#8208;positron&#8208;bonded (PsH)2, which energetically favors the emission of Ps2. Comparative analysis of one&#8208; and two&#8208;positron dihalides indicates that adding&#160;a positron to PsXY&#8211; generally results in shorter bond distances, higher force constants, and lower dissociation energies, with exceptions due to differences in positron affinities of&#160;PsXY&#8211; and Y&#8211;. We explore the analogy between two&#8208;positron&#8208;bonded dihalide systems Ps2XY and two&#8208;electron&#8208;bonded dialkali molecules AB, (A,B=Na,K,Rb). The bonding properties in positron dihalides and their electronic dialkali analogs display&#160;identical periodic trends. However,&#160;compared to their isoelectronic AB counterparts, the positron bonds in Ps2XY&#160;have shorter bond lengths, higher force constants, and higher bond energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic Properties and Reactivity of a MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo Complex that is Stable at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese catalysts that activate hydrogen peroxide have seen increased use in organic transformations, such as olefin epoxidation and alkane C&#8722;H bond oxidation. Proposed mechanisms for these catalysts involve the formation and activation of MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo intermediates. Examples of well&#8208;defined MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo complexes are rare, and the properties of these species are often inferred from MnIIIalkylperoxo analogues. In this study, we show that the reaction of the MnIII&#8208;hydroxo complex [MnIII(OH)(6Medpaq)]+ (1) with hydrogen peroxide and acid results in the formation of a dark&#8208;green MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo species [MnIII(OOH)(6Medpaq)]+ (2). The formulation of 2 is based on electronic absorption, 1H NMR, IR, and ESI&#8208;MS data. The thermal decay of 2 follows a first order process, and variable&#8208;temperature kinetic studies of the decay of 2 yielded activation parameters that could be compared with those of a MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo analogue. Complex 2 reacts with the hydrogen&#8208;atom donor TEMPOH two&#8208;fold faster than the MnIII&#8208;hydroxo complex 1. Complex 2 also oxidizes PPh3, and this MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo species is 600&#8208;fold more reactive with this substrate than its MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo analogue [MnIII(OOtBu)(6Medpaq)]+. DFT and time&#8208;dependent (TD) DFT computations are used to compare the electronic structure of 2 with similar MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo and MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Spectroscopic Study of a Homogenous Bimetallic Os(II) Complex as a New Gastric Cancer Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A homogenous dinuclear Os(II) complex bisOs was synthesized and fully characterized. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry study, and density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the electronic property. bisOs showed an obvious interaction with lipase and BSA, and can generate singlet oxygen under blue and red LED light irradiation, with a singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#1060;&#916;) of 0.36 in comparison to that of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 in acetonitrile. bisOs exhibited moderate to great photocytotoxicity against HGC&#8208;27 human gastric cancer cells under blue LED light irradiation, giving the IC50 value as low as 1.83 &#181;M (PI value is 9.7), while was almost non&#8208;cytotoxic in the dark. The cellular singlet oxygen detection in HGC&#8208;27 cancer cells exhibited a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, and cell uptake of bisOs in A549 cells was as high as 120 ng/106 cells, subcellular colocalization study indicated that bisOs was not accumulated in nucleus, and less likely to target mitochondria. This work provides a new example of dinuclear osmium complex as potential photosensitizer candidate for gastric treatment.</dc:description>

A facile reaction of a pyridyl&#8208;substituted dithienylperfluorocyclopentene derivative with octafluorocyclopentene constructed the betaine structure. The introduction of the betaine moiety provided the diarylethene molecule with bathochromically shifted optical absorption and fluorescing ability, thus enabling the molecule to function as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive turn&#8208;off mode photoswitchable fluorophore. The molecule in the open&#8208;ring form emitted bright blueish green fluorescence. Upon irradiation with 405 nm light, the molecule underwent cyclization isomerization to form the closed&#8208;ring isomer and the fluorescence intensity significantly decreased. The turn&#8208;off mode fluorescence photoswitching was observed not only in solution but also in polymer films.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum Elimination From Bis(triethylsilylpolyynyl) Complexes and Macrocycles Comprised of Four L2Pt Corners and Four C&#926;CC&#926;CC&#926;C Linkers; An Approach to Cyclo[24]carbon</title>

         <dc:description>The overarching goal of this study is to effect the elimination of platinum from adducts with cis &#8208;C&#926;C&#8208;Pt&#8208;C&#926;C&#8208; linkages, thereby generating novel conjugated polyynes. Thus, the bis(hexatriynyl) complex trans&#8208;(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt((C&#926;C)3H)2&#160;is treated with 1,3&#8208;diphosphines R2C(C&#173;H2PPh2)2&#160;to generate (R2C(CH2PPh2)2)2Pt((C&#926;C)3H)2&#160;(14; R = c, n&#8208;Bu; e, p&#8208;tolCH2). These con&#173;dense with the diiodide complexes R2C(CH2PPh2)2PtI2&#160;(9a,c) in the presence of CuI (cat.) and excess HNEt2&#160;to give the title macrocycles [(R2C(CH2PPh2)2)Pt(C&#926;C)3]4&#160;(16c,e) as adducts of the byproduct [H2NEt2]+&#160;I&#8211;&#160;(30&#8208;66%). DOSY NMR experiments establish that this association is maintained in solution, but NaOAc removes the ammonium salt. The bis(triethylsilylpolyynyl) complexes (n&#8208;Bu2C(CH2PPh2)2)Pt((C&#926;C)nSiEt3)2&#160;(n = 2, 3) are synthesized analogously to 14c. They react with I2&#160;at rt to give mainly the diiodide complex 9c and the coupling product Et3Si(C&#926;CC&#926;C)nSiEt3. The possibility of competing reactions giving IC&#926;C species is investigated. Analogous reactions of the Pt4C24&#160;macrocycle 16c also give 9c, but no sp 13C NMR signals or mass spectrometric Cxz+&#160;ions (x = 24&#8208;100) could be detected. It is proposed that some cyclo[24]car&#173;bon is generated, but then rapidly converts to other forms of elemental carbon. No cyclotetracosane (C24H48) is detected when this sequence is carried out in the presence of PtO2&#160;and H2.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Synergistic Catalytic Effect of TiO2 Supported V&#8208;W Oxides for Selective C&#8211;H Bond Oxidation of Cyclohexane to KA Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is urgent to develop an efficient and stable non&#8208;noble metal catalyst for selective C&#8211;H bond oxidation of cyclohexane. Herein, a series of V&#8208;W oxides supported on TiO2&#160;catalysts (V&#8208;W/TiO2) were fabricated. The V&#8208;W/TiO2&#160;catalysts exhibited much higher catalytic activity for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane to KA oil, compared to that of V/TiO2&#160;and W/TiO2&#160;catalysts. The good distribution of active metals and the synergistic effect were responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity. H2&#8208;TPR results disclosed that the presence of V in&#160;V&#8208;W/TiO2 affected the reducibility of W6+&#160;species, and XPS verified that an electronic interaction was formed between them. Such results led to good catalytic reusability of V&#8208;W/TiO2&#160;catalyst during the reactions, and no obvious activity loss was found after six runs. The reaction mechanism was investigated, and the results verified that hydroxyl radicals generated from H2O2&#160;homolysis were the main active oxidative species. Theoretical study revealed that V dopant could regulate electronic structure of adjacent O atom, facilitating the adsorption of cyclohexane, and lower energy was needed for the rate&#8208;limiting step over V&#8208;W/TiO2&#160;during the whole oxidation reaction. This work developed an efficient V&#8208;W/TiO2&#160;catalyst for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane via a synergistic effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Pericyclic Re&#8208;hydroboration via Six&#8208;membered Transition State: Synthesis of Fused Borolo[3,2&#8208;b]siloles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We experimentally demonstrate a new type of the intramolecular reaction between non&#8208;activated alkyne units and the dialkylboryl group (9&#8208;BBN), which was previously only hypothesized and studied on a calculational level. The reaction described here can formally be classified as a 1,2&#8208;hydroboration reaction, but, in contrast to the classical mechanism via a cyclic four&#8208;membered transition state, the reaction proceeds by a pericyclic mechanism involving a six&#8208;membered transition state. In practice, the reaction allows the synthesis of a new class of the borolenes fused with silole or dihydrosilole units. Thus, the heating (125&#176;C) of 2,3&#8208;dihydrosiloles or 2,3&#8208;dihydrosilolo[2,3&#8208;b]silole bearing 9&#8208;BBN and propargyl or dimethylpropargyl groups in positions 4 and 5, respectively, affords, in high to moderate yields, di&#8208; and tricyclic compounds containing a borolo[3,2&#8208;b]silole unit. In all cases, the reactions are accompanied by an unprecedented dehydroboration of the 9&#8208;BBN fragment, leading, in the final products, to a cyclooct&#8208;4&#8208;enyl group on the boron atom. The effects of the substituents on the rate and the selectivity of the reaction are discussed. The structures of all the new compounds have been determined from HRMS together with multinuclear 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, the results of which are in excellent agreement with DFT calculated chemical shifts.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition State Stabilizing Effects of Oxygen and Sulfur Chalcogen Bond Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transition stabilizing effects of chalcogen bonding interactions of oxygen and sulfur were studied using molecular rotors. The transition stabilizing effects of sulfur and oxygen chalcogen bonds were quantitatively measured and compared. Their strengths strongly correlated with the calculated electrostatic potential (ESP) on the surface of the chalcogen atoms in contact with the chalcogen bond donor.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent chalcogen bond (ChB) interactions have found utility in many fields, including catalysis, organic semiconductors, and crystal engineering. In this study, the transition stabilizing effects of ChB interactions of oxygen and sulfur were experimentally measured using a series of molecular rotors. The rotors were designed to form ChB interactions in their bond rotation transition states. This enabled the kinetic influences to be assessed by monitoring changes in the rotational barriers. Despite forming weaker ChB interactions, the smaller chalcogens were able to stabilize transition states and had measurable kinetic effects on the rotational barriers. Sulfur stabilized the bond rotation transition state by as much as &#8722;7.2&#8197;kcal/mol without electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. The key was to design a system where the sulfur 

&#963;

 ${\sigma }$



&#8208;hole was aligned with the lone pairs of the chalcogen bond acceptor. Oxygen rotors also could form transition state stabilizing ChB interactions but required electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. For both oxygen and sulfur ChB interactions, a strong correlation was observed between transition state stabilizing abilities and electrostatic potential (ESP) of the chalcogen, providing a useful predictive parameter for the rational design of future ChB systems.

         <dc:description>
Merging of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis with transition metal catalysis has attracted increasing attention as they offer new catalytic processes to achieve unprecedented transformations with broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity, which are unfeasible with individual catalyst. This review summarizes the recent achievements of NHC/transition metal dual catalysis, including the reaction design, mechanistic studies and practical applications.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis has been developed as a versatile method for the enantioselective synthesis of complex organic molecules in organic chemistry. Merging of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis with transition metal catalysis holds the potential to achieve unprecedented transformations with broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity, which are unfeasible with individual catalyst. Thus, this dual catalysis has attracted increasing attention, and numerous elegant dual catalytic systems have been established. In this review, we summarize the recent achievements of dual NHC/transition metal catalysis, including the reaction design, mechanistic studies and practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Merging of N-heterocyclic carbene catalysis with transition metal catalysis has attracted increasing attention as they offer new catalytic processes to achieve unprecedented transformations with broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity, which are unfeasible with individual catalyst. This review summarizes the recent achievements of NHC/transition metal dual catalysis, including the reaction design, mechanistic studies and practical applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N-heterocyclic carbene catalysis has been developed as a versatile method for the enantioselective synthesis of complex organic molecules in organic chemistry. Merging of N-heterocyclic carbene catalysis with transition metal catalysis holds the potential to achieve unprecedented transformations with broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity, which are unfeasible with individual catalyst. Thus, this dual catalysis has attracted increasing attention, and numerous elegant dual catalytic systems have been established. In this review, we summarize the recent achievements of dual NHC/transition metal catalysis, including the reaction design, mechanistic studies and practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Quest for Stable Borozene Core in Main&#8208;Group Capped Inverse Sandwich Complexes, [(HE)2B6H6]2&#8722; (E=B, Al, Ga, In, and Tl)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital Engineering helps to design ideal caps to stabilize {B6H6} core in inverse sandwiches using group 13 elements as caps. Optimal ring&#8208;cap overlap makes AlH and GaH as nearly ideal caps for B6H6 ring. Estimates of aromaticity of HEB6H6EH using NICS is comparable to that of benzene, justifying the borozene nomenclature.







Abstract
The ubiquitous chemistry of benzene led us to explore ways to stabilise analogous borozene, by capping them with appropriate groups. The mismatch in overlap of ring&#8208;cap fragment molecular orbitals in [(HB)2B6H6]2&#8722; is overcome by replacing the two BH caps with higher congeners of boron. We calculated the relative energies of all the polyhedral structural candidates for [(HE)2B6H6]2&#8722; (E=Al&#8722;Tl) and found hexagonal bipyramid (HBP) to be more stable with Al&#8722;H caps. A global minimum search also gives HBP as the most stable structure for [Al2B6H8]2&#8722;. The capped B6H6 ring in [(HAl)2B6H6]2&#8722; has aromaticity comparable to that of benzene.

         <title>Syntheses of Diarylmethanes Via an Oxidative Benzylic Functionalization of P&#8208;Alkyl Phenol Derivatives Under Quaternary Ammonium Hypoiodite Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two oxidative quaternary ammonium hypoiodite&#8208;catalyzed strategies for the syntheses of diarylmethanes starting from simple p&#8208;alkyl phenol derivatives have been successfully implemented.







Abstract
We herein report two strategies for the quaternary ammonium hypoiodite&#8208;mediated oxidative benzylic functionalization of p&#8208;alkyl phenol derivatives. By using either dibenzoylperoxide or H2O2 in hexafluoroisopropanol in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium iodide gives access to activated intermediates which can then be coupled with electron&#8208;rich aromatic compounds. Overall, this sequential two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot procedure gives access to diversely decorated diarylmethane derivatives straightforwardly. Furthermore, the suitability of these products to undergo further oxidation reactions was successfully demonstrated.

We designed seven dithienobenzothiazole (DBT) derivatives by considering previous machine&#8208;learning study indicating that the number of hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor (NHBA) is important index for the hole mobility of organic semiconductors. The solution&#8208;processed top&#8208;gate bottom&#8208;contact devices of DBTs exhibit hole mobilities of up to 0.16&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Inspired by the previous machine&#8208;learning study that the number of hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor (NHBA) is important index for the hole mobility of organic semiconductors, seven dithienobenzothiazole (DBT) derivatives 1&#8201;a&#8211;g (NHBA=5) were designed and synthesized by one&#8208;step functionalization from a common precursor. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses confirmed that the molecular arrangements of 1b (the diethyl and ethylthienyl derivative) and 1c (the di(n&#8208;propyl) and n&#8208;propylthienyl derivative) in the crystal are classified into brickwork structures with multidirectional intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer integrals, as a result of incorporation of multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors. The solution&#8208;processed top&#8208;gate bottom&#8208;contact devices of 1b and 1c had hole mobilities of 0.16 and 0.029&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1s&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Triggered Reversible Switching between Dynamic and Quasi&#8208;static &#945;&#8208;Helical Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant change in the interconversion rate between the right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed &#945;&#8208;helices, composed mainly of achiral units, has been successfully achieved through the redox&#8208;triggered reversible transformations of a doubly stapled &#945;&#8208;helical peptide with a rigid staple and a dynamic disulfide staple into a singly stapled one with a dithiol.







Abstract
We report the reversible transformation between a singly stapled dynamic &#945;&#8208;helical peptide and a doubly stapled quasi&#8208;static one through redox&#8208;triggered dithiol/disulfide conversions of a stapling moiety. This process allows the rate of interconversion between the right&#8208;handed (P) and left&#8208;handed (M) &#945;&#8208;helices to be altered by a factor of approximately 103 before and after the transformation. An as&#8208;obtained doubly stapled &#945;&#8208;helical peptide, which is composed of an achiral peptide having an l&#8208;valine carboxylic acid residue at the C&#8208;terminus, a disulfide&#8208;based reversible staple, and a biphenyl&#8208;based fixed staple, adopts an (M)&#8208;rich form as a kinetically trapped state. The (M)&#8208;rich helix was subsequently transformed into the thermodynamically stable (P)&#8208;rich form in 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrachloroethane with the half&#8208;life time (t1/2) of approximately 44&#8197;days at 25&#8201;&#176;C. Reduction of the doubly stapled peptide with tri&#8208;n&#8208;butylphosphine in tetrahydrofuran/water (10/1, v/v) produced the corresponding singly stapled dynamic &#945;&#8208;helical peptide bearing two thiol groups at the side chains, which underwent solvent&#8208;induced reversible helicity inversion. The resulting dithiol of the singly stapled peptide could be reoxidized to form the original doubly stapled form using 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dithiodipyridine. Furthermore, the P/M interconversion of a doubly stapled peptide with two flexible hydrocarbon&#8208;based staples is considerably more rapid than that with more rigid staples.

         <title>Superactivity of Bimetallic CuFeO2&#160;&#160;Submicron Particles towards Selective Proteolysis, Depending on Their Surface Hydroxyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nano bimetallic oxides as nanoproteases have the great advantages in the heterogeneous hydrolysis of proteins. Here, we report that bimetallic delafossite CuFeO2 submicron particles (CuFeO2 SMPs) display a high protease activity towards selective cleavage of peptide bond involving hydrophobic residue at 25 centidegree. CuFeO2 SMPs have excellent regeneration performance with high structural stability. The strong Lewis acidity of Fe(III)&#160;and the strong nucleophilicity of Cu(I)&#160;bound hydroxyl groups are both necessary for the high protease activity of CuFeO2 SMPs. Low&#8208;valent metal ion has a great advantage in that low&#8208;valent Cu(I)&#160;bound hydroxyl has strong nucleophilicity, resulting in promotion of protein hydrolysis via high&#8208;efficient bimetallic catalysis. This study provides evidence that the protease activity of CuFeO2 SMPs depends on metal ion&#8208;bound hydroxyls on their surface. Our findings highlight that the valence of metal ions in artificial protease and their surface hydroxyls are two important factors that determine their catalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionomeric Binders for High Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) based on phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole membrane (PBI/PA) operating at 120&#8208;200 &#176;C can provide insensitivity to carbon monoxide (CO) and simplified managements of water and heat and thus attract significant global attention. However, one signi&#64257;cant drawback is its low utilization of precious metal catalysts resulted from the PA poisoning and inefficient three&#8208;phase boundary. Studies of binder materials in catalyst layers for HT&#8208;PEMFC are gradually emerging and there are few literature reviews on this important topic. The purpose of this review is to describe the various types of binders based on their molecular structure and electrochemical properties, with particular emphasis on catalyst layer for fuel cells. Importantly, this review provides a better understanding of relationship between fuel cell performance and the gas permeability and conductivity of different binders. Then, future directions of research and development in binder materials of HT&#8208;PEMFC are pointed out.</dc:description>

         <title>Recovery of Berry Natural Products using Pyrene&#8208;based MOF Solid Phase Extraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work introduces a novel method of recovering bioactive berry natural products (BNPs) using solid phase extraction with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;SPE). Two pyrene&#8208;based MOFs with different structural topologies, Al&#8208;PyrMOF and Zr&#8208;NU&#8208;1000, were evaluated for their ability to capture and desorb BNPs, including ellagic acid, quercetin, gallic acid, and p&#8208;coumaric acid. Time&#8208;dependent BNP uptake via dispersive SPE revealed that NU&#8208;1000 outperformed Al&#8208;PyrMOF in capturing all BNPs. Our findings show NU&#8208;1000 demonstrated a higher and more consistent BNP capture profile, achieving over 90% capture of all BNPs within 36 hours, with only a 9% variation between the most and least effectively captured BNPs. In contrast, Al&#8208;PyrMOF, displayed a staggered uptake profile, with a significant 53% difference in capture efficiency between the most and least effectively captured BNP. However, when a BNP mixture was used at a loading concentration of 50 &#181;g/mL, Al&#8208;PyrMOF outperformed NU&#8208;1000, capturing over 70% of all BNPs. Al&#8208;PyrMOF also exhibited improved BNP recovery, with a minimum of two&#8208;fold greater amount recovered for all BNPs. Further testing with a BNP mixture at a concentration of 15 &#181;g/mL demonstrated that Al&#8208;PyrMOF efficiently concentrated all BNPs, achieving a maximum extraction factor of 2.71 observed for quercetin.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Switching of A Nano&#8208;Size Urea&#8208;bridged Zn(II)Porphyrin Dimer by External Stimuli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the first time, explicit stabilization of all the three conformers, viz. (cis,cis), (cis,trans) and (trans,trans), of a &#8216;nano&#8208;sized&#8217; highly&#8208;flexible urea&#8208;bridged Zn(II)porphyrin dimer have been achieved via careful manipulations of external stimuli such as solvent dielectrics, temperature, anionic interactions, axial ligation and surface&#8208;induced stabilization. The conformers differ widely in their structures, chemical and photophysical properties and thus have vast potential applicability. X&#8208;ray structural characterizations have been reported for the (cis,cis) and (cis,trans)&#8208;conformers. While (cis,cis) conformer stabilized exclusively in dichloromethane, more polar solvents resulted in the stabilization of (cis,trans) and (trans,trans)&#8208;conformers. Low temperature promotes the stabilization of (cis,trans)&#8208;conformer while rise in temperature facilitates flipping to the (cis,cis) one. Significantly, exclusive stabilization of the (trans,trans)&#8208;isomer has been illustrated using acetate anion which facilitates H&#8208;bonding with the two amide linkages of the urea spacer. Remarkably, HOPG surface facilitates stabilization of the energetically challenging (trans,trans)&#8208;conformer via CH&#183;&#183;&#183;p and p&#183;&#183;&#183;p interactions with the solid surface to the porphyrinic cores. DFT calculations demonstrate that the relative stability of the conformers can be modulated upon slight external perturbations as also observed in the experiment. Several factors contributing towards the conformational landscape for the highly flexible urea&#8208;bridged porphyrin dimers have been mapped.</dc:description>

         <title>Building 3D Crosslinked Graphene&#8208;MXene Nanoarchitectures Decorated with MoS2 Quantum Dots Enables Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust co&#8208;assembly method is developed to the bottom&#8208;up construction of 3D crosslinked graphene&#8208;MXene nanoarchitectures decorated with MoS2 quantum dots, which possess superior electrocatalytic properties towards the hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Although MoS2 quantum dots with abundant edge sites have been regarded as promising eletrode materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), their electrocatalytic capacity still requires improvements in actual applications. Herein. we demonstrate a controllable and robust bottom&#8208;up approach to build 3D crosslinked graphene&#8208;Ti3C2Tx MXene frameworks decorated with MoS2 quantum dots (MQD/RGO&#8208;MX) via a convenient co&#8208;assembly process. The novel structural design gives the MQD/RGO&#8208;MX nanoarchitectures a series of superior textural attributes, including 3D interconnected networks, continuous meso&#8208; and macropores, well&#8208;dispersed quantum dots, ameliorative electronic configuration, and excellent electrical conductivity. Accordingly, the resulting hybrid nanoarchitectures express superior electrocatalytic properties in terms of a low onset potential of only 45&#8197;mV, a small Tafel slope of 61&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 as well as a long service life towards the HER, which make it quite competitive against bare MoS2 quantum dots, MXene as well as binary MQD/RGO and MQD/MXene electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;A robust co-assembly method is developed to the bottom-up construction of 3D crosslinked graphene-MXene nanoarchitectures decorated with MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots, which possess superior electrocatalytic properties towards the hydrogen evolution reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots with abundant edge sites have been regarded as promising eletrode materials for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), their electrocatalytic capacity still requires improvements in actual applications. Herein. we demonstrate a controllable and robust bottom-up approach to build 3D crosslinked graphene-Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; MXene frameworks decorated with MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots (MQD/RGO-MX) &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a convenient co-assembly process. The novel structural design gives the MQD/RGO-MX nanoarchitectures a series of superior textural attributes, including 3D interconnected networks, continuous meso- and macropores, well-dispersed quantum dots, ameliorative electronic configuration, and excellent electrical conductivity. Accordingly, the resulting hybrid nanoarchitectures express superior electrocatalytic properties in terms of a low onset potential of only 45&#8197;mV, a small Tafel slope of 61&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as well as a long service life towards the HER, which make it quite competitive against bare MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots, MXene as well as binary MQD/RGO and MQD/MXene electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Pyridylation of Alkynamides with Pyridylboronic Acids: A Route to Functionalized Enamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridylation of alkynamides with pyridylboronic acids under rhodium catalysis has been developed, providing a practical approach to the stereoselective synthesis of valuable alkenylpyridines with amide group using readily available reagents and a commercial catalyst. Further applications of pyridylation product from Weinreb amide to construct &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone and aldehyde were demonstrated, offering a practical route to synthesizing diverse functionalized alkenylpyridines.







Abstract
The catalytic direct hydroarylation of alkynamides is a highly efficient approach for accessing functionalized trisubstituted arylalkenes with amide groups. Herein, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed pyridylation of alkynamides with pyridylboronic acids, producing a variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary enamides with high yields (up to 94&#8201;%). This reaction demonstrates broad tolerance towards various alkyl and aryl functional groups, providing convenient access to a diverse array of alkenylpyridine derivatives. To demonstrate potential applications in late&#8208;stage hydropyridylation, we synthesized &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones, aldehydes, and esters with high yields from the pyridylation product of Weinreb amides. This indirect expansion of the substrate scope enhances the practicality of this strategy. Additionally, the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketone obtained can be further reduced to yield a chiral alcohol with a 99&#8201;% ee, further demonstrating the versatility and potential utility of this approach.

         <title>Concentration Controlling of Carboxylic Ester&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Low Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of moderate concentrations of LiDFOB and FEC has established a solid electrolyte interface rich in LiF. This effectively suppresses side reactions between the electrolyte and lithium metal and promotes the desolvation process of Li+. Li/LCO batteries using this electrolyte exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Low temperature has been a major challenge for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) to maintain satisfied electrochemical performance, and the main reason is the deactivation of electrolyte with the decreasing temperature. To address this point, in present work, we develop a low&#8208;temperature resistant electrolyte which includes ethyl acetate (EA) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) as solvent and lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) as the primary lithium salt. Due to the preferential decomposition of LiDFOB and FEC, a solid electrolyte interface rich in LiF is formed on the lithium metal anodes (LMAs) and lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) cathodes, contributing to higher stability and rapid desolvation of Li+ ions. The batteries with the optimized electrolyte can undergo cycling tests at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, with a capacity retention of 83.9&#8201;% after 200 cycles. Furthermore, the optimized electrolyte exhibits excellent compatibility with both LCO cathodes and graphite (Gr) anodes, enabling a Gr/LCO battery to maintain a capacity retention of 90.3&#8201;% after multiple cycles at &#8722;25&#8201;&#176;C. This work proposes a cost&#8208;effective electrolyte that can activate potential LIBs in practical scenarios, especially in low&#8208;temperature environments.

         <title>Carbon Dots in Photodynamic Therapy: The Role of Dopant and Solvent on Optical and Photo&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to outstanding optical properties and biocompatibility, carbon dots (CDs) have been extensively gaining attention as a photo&#8208;responsive inducer for cancer photodynamic therapy. This review summarizes the synthesis and modification techniques of CDs that offer red&#8208;shift properties toward stronger fluorescence emission and deeper penetration of light&#8208;responsive reactive radical species generated at the laser&#8208;directing site that cause specific cell damage. The strategies summarized in this review could contribute to addressing the challenges in targeted cancer therapy.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) are novel carbon&#8208;based luminescent materials with wide&#8208;ranging applications in biosensing, bioimaging, drug transportation, optical devices, and beyond. Their advantageous attributes, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, antioxidant activity, photostability, small particle size (&lt;10&#8197;nm), and strong light absorption and excitation across a broad range of wavelengths, making them promising candidates in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT) as photosensitizers (PSs). Further enhancements in functionality are imperative to enhance the effectiveness of CDs in PDT applications, notwithstanding their inherent benefits. Recently, doping agents and solvents have been demonstrated to improve CDs&#8217; optical properties, solubility, cytotoxicity, and organelle targeting efficiency. These improvements result from modifications to the CDs&#8217; carbon skeleton matrices, functional groups on the surface state, and chemical structures. This review discusses the modification of CDs with heteroatom dopants, dye dopants, and solvents to improve their physicochemical and optical properties for PDT applications. The correlations between the surface chemistry, functional groups, the structure of the CDs, and their optical characteristics toward quantum yield, redshift feature, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, have also been discussed. Finally, the progressive trends for the use of CDs in PDT applications are also addressed in this review.

         <title>A Data&#8208;Driven Approach for Enhanced CO2 Capture with Ruthenium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Ru catalysts in the hydrogenation of CO2 are not easily obtained through simple ligand modification. However, adopting an active descriptor that is obtained from the simplified mechanism&#8208;based approach with data&#8208;driven practice (SMADP) is demonstrated as an efficient strategy to understand the catalytic activity.







Abstract
To attain carbon neutrality, significant efforts have been made to capture and utilize CO2. The homogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 catalyzed by transition metal complexes, particularly the ruthenium complexes, has demonstrated significant advantages and is regarded as a viable approach for practical application. Insertion of CO2 into the Ru&#8722;H bond, producing the Ru&#8208;formate product, is the key step in the hydrogenation of CO2. In order to parameterize the catalytic activities in the CO2 insertion into the Ru&#8722;H bond, the concept of simplified mechanism&#8208;based approach with data&#8208;driven practice (SMADP) has been introduced in this paper. The results showed that the hydricity of the Ru&#8722;H complex (&#916;GH&#8208;) might serve as a single active descriptor in the process of CO2 insertion, and that a novel ruthenium complex in CO2 catalysis may not be easily obtained by mere modification of the auxiliary ligand at the ruthenium metal site.

         <title>Steric Effect and Intrinsic Electrophilicity and Nucleophilicity from Conceptual Density Functional Theory and Information&#8208;Theoretic Approach as Quantitative Probes of Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using charge fluctuation descriptors, the intrinsic reaction coordinate is partitioned into three regions which are called Pre&#8208;TS, TS and Post&#8208;TS respectively. For 37 organic and inorganic reactions, linear correlations are found within the three regions between the total energy difference and the steric or charge transfer descriptors. The use of charge fluctuation instead of global reactivity descriptors gives clearer separation of the reaction path which is further justified via energy decomposition analysis.







Abstract
Appreciating reactivity in terms of physicochemical effects for chemical processes is one of the most important undertakings in chemistry. While transition state (TS) theory provides the framework enabling the reliable calculation of the barrier height for a given elementary step, analytical tools are necessary to gain insight into key factors governing the different processes during chemical reactions. In this contribution, we partition the potential energy surface of an elementary step along the intrinsic coordinate into three segments, the so&#8208;called Pre&#8208;TS, TS, and Post&#8208;TS regions, and then determine the most important factors dictating each segment. This analysis is based on the use of both reactivity descriptors from conceptual density functional theory and concepts from the information&#8208;theoretic approach in density functional theory. We found that in both Pre&#8208;TS and Post&#8208;TS regions, steric effects are the dominant factors, whereas in the TS region, it is the intrinsic electrophilic and nucleophilic propensity of the transition state structure that governs the reactivity. The wide applicability of our approach is shown by a validation for a total of 37 organic and inorganic reactions. Different partition approaches from density functional theory, energy decomposition analysis and wavefunction&#8208;based resonance theory are employed to support our main conclusions.

     alt="Steric Effect and Intrinsic Electrophilicity and Nucleophilicity from Conceptual Density Functional Theory and Information-Theoretic Approach as Quantitative Probes of Chemical Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using charge fluctuation descriptors, the intrinsic reaction coordinate is partitioned into three regions which are called Pre-TS, TS and Post-TS respectively. For 37 organic and inorganic reactions, linear correlations are found within the three regions between the total energy difference and the steric or charge transfer descriptors. The use of charge fluctuation instead of global reactivity descriptors gives clearer separation of the reaction path which is further justified via energy decomposition analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Recent Advances in Naturally Occurring [4+2] Type Terpenoid Dimers Assembled through Unmatched&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terpenoid dimers of the [4+2] type, which are naturally occurring compounds biosynthetically derived from the [4+2] cycloaddition of two synthons, have garnered considerable attention due to their complex molecular structures, diverse biological activities, and intriguing biosynthetic pathways. We have previously summarized the advancements in three types of [4+2] terpenoid dimers. In this review, we will focus on the lesser&#8208;explored class of [4+2] terpenoid dimers which assembled from two electron&#8208;deficient synthons via the unmatched&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction&#160; (UMEDDA). We will summarize their sources, biological activities, proposed biosynthesis, and chemical syntheses. Finally, a summary and outlook for this fascinating class of compounds will be presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence changeable CO2&#8208;storage cylinder: Triple&#8208;stranded helical Eu(III)/Tb(III) fluorinated MOFs with amide linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triple&#8208;stranded helical lanthanide MOFs with CO2 adsorption properties were investigated. Lanthanide MOFs ([Eu0.1Tb0.9(hfa)3(dpa)]n) are composed of lanthanide luminophores (Eu(III) and/or Tb(III) ions), fluorinated antenna ligands (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate), and polyamide&#8208;type linker ligands (dpa: 4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)benzamide). The cylindrical structure was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and gas adsorption measurements. The inner surfaces of the cylindrical channels were covered with the fluorine atoms of the hfa ligands. The emission intensity ratio (IEu / ITb) in [Eu0.1Tb0.9(hfa)3(dpa)]n is affected by the CO2 gas adsorption behavior. The change in IEu / ITb value was caused by the intermolecular interactions between the CO2 gas molecules and the fluorinated ligands, resulting in an electronic structural change of the lowest triplet excited state in the photosensitized hfa ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Helical Pitch of Foldamers Through Terminal Functionality: A Solid State Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new methods to control the size and shape of the helical structures adopted by foldamers is highly important as the secondary structure displayed by these supramolecular scaffolds often dictates their activity and function. Herein, we report on a systematic study demonstrating that the helical pitch of ortho&#8208;azobenzene/2,6&#8208;pyridyldicarboamide foldamers can be readily controlled through the nature of the terminal functionality. Remarkably, simply through varying the end group of the foldamer, and without modifying any other structural features of the scaffold, the helical pitch can be over doubled in magnitude (from 3.4 &#197; to 7.3 &#197;). Additionally, crystallographic analysis of a library ten foldamers has identified general trends in the influence of a range of terminal functionalities, including carboxylbenzyl (Cbz), diphenylcarbamyl (N(Ph)2), ferrocene (Fc) and tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), in controlling the folding behaviour of these supramolecular scaffolds. These studies could prove useful in the future development of functional foldamers which adopt specific sizes and shapes.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Activity of Co Species in the Active Sites of CoN x /CoO x &#160;Facilitates Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient bifunctional&#160;oxygen electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing the performance of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). In this study, cobalt/cobalt oxides embedded in N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (Co/CoOx/NCNFs) were synthesized through&#160;a combination of electrospinning and annealing processes. The resulting Co/CoOx/NCNFs catalysts feature abundant CoNx&#160;and CoOx&#160;active species, leveraging the large specific surface area&#160;of nanofibers to facilitate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction&#160;(OER). The optimized&#160;Co/CoOx/NCNFs&#8208;0.1 achieved&#160;a half&#8208;wave potential (vs. RHE) of 0.82 V and required only 429 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8315;&#178; in a typical three&#8208;electrode system with 0.1 M KOH using an electrochemical workstation equipped with a pine instruments rotator, outperforming the Pt/C+RuO2. The assembled ZABs&#160;exhibited high specific capacity (771 mAh gZn&#8722;1), substantial power density (981.6 mWh gZn&#8722;1), and long&#8208;term stability (&gt;325 h). In situ Raman spectroscopy confirmed that the electrocatalytic processes involve&#160;the redox activity&#160;of Co (II and III) species derived from abundant CoNx&#160;and CoOx, elaborating&#160;the origin&#160;of the catalysts' exceptional oxygen electrocatalysis performance. This work&#160;not only presents a straightforward and effective approach for producing bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts in ZABs but also sheds light on the catalytic mechanisms underlying ORR and OER&#160;for CoNx/CoOx&#8208;based oxygen electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The on&#8208;surface synthesis strategy has emerged as a promising route for fabricating well&#8208;defined two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BN&#8208;substituted carbon nanomaterials with tunable electronic properties. This approach relies on specially designed precursors and requires a thorough understanding of the on&#8208;surface reaction pathways. It promises precise structural control at the atomic scale, thus complementing chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this study, we investigated a novel heteroatomic precursor, tetrabromoborazine, which incorporates a BN core and an OH group, on Ag(111) using low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (LT&#8208;STM/STS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Through sequential temperature&#8208;induced reactions involving dehalogenation and dehydrogenation, distinct tetrabromoborazine derivatives were produced as reaction intermediates, leading to the formation of specific self&#8208;assemblies. Notably, the resulting intricate supramolecular structures include a chiral kagom&#233; lattice composed of molecular dimers exhibiting a unique electronic signature. The final product obtained was a random covalent carbon network with BN&#8208;substitution and embedded oxygen heteroatoms. Our study offers valuable insights into the significance of the structure and functionalization of BN precursors in temperature&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface reactions, which can help future rational precursor design. Additionally, it introduces complex surface architectures that offer a high areal density of borazine cores.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Twisted Fenestrindane&#8208;Based Porous Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two fenestrindane&#8208;based porous nanographenes containing four polyaromatic macrocycles in a highly twisted, basically S4&#8208;symmetric conformation were synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Stepwise &#960;&#8208;extension at the periphery of the fenestrindane core by a sequence of eightfold Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, fourfold Scholl cyclodehydrogenation and another eightfold Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction affords the porous nanographene precursors in good yields. In the last step, fourfold intramolecular Yamamoto coupling generates the porous nanographenes in 17&#8722;18% yield. Their optical and electronic properties were studied by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. DFT calculations revealed structural details of the macrocycles. The surprisingly weak binding of these porous structures with chloride ions (K &#8776; 10 M&#8722;1) is attributed to their highly twisted conformation. The title compounds represent the first porous nanographenes based on the [5.5.5.5]fenestrane motif and, at the same time, they consist of a fenestrane&#8208;like polyarylene network.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring Pt Single&#8208;Atom Sites on Vacancies of MgO(Al) Nanosheets as Bifunctional Catalysts to Accelerate Hydrogenation&#8208;Cyclization Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct hydrogenation of 2&#8208;nitroacylbenzene to 2,1&#8208;benzisoxazole presents a significant challenge in the pharmaceutical and fine chemicals industries. In this study, a defect engineering strategy is employed to create bifunctional single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) by anchoring Pt single atoms onto metal vacancies within MgO(Al) nanosheets. The resultant Pt1/MgO(Al) SAC displays an exceptional catalytic activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation&#8208;cyclization of 2&#8208;nitroacylbenzene, achieving a 97.5% yield at complete conversion and a record&#8208;breaking turnover frequency of 458.8 h&#8211;1 under the mild conditions. The synergistic catalysis between the fully exposed single&#8208;atom Pt sites within a unique Pt&#8208;O&#8208;Mg/Al moiety and the abundant basic sites of the MgO(Al) support is responsible for this outstanding catalytic performance. The current work, therefore, paves the way for developing bifunctional or multifunctional SACs that can enhance efficient organocatalytic conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Non&#8208;centrosymmetric Borate Hydride Sr4Ba3(BO3)3.83H2.5</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sr4Ba3(BO3)3.83H2.5, as the second compound to combine borate and hydride ions, has been synthesized by a mechanochemical synthesis route. The structure has been elucidated by synchrotron X&#8208;ray and neutron diffraction and determined to crystallize in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P63mc (186) with the cell parameters a = 10.87762(15) &#197; and c = 6.98061(11) &#197;. A detailed investigation of the compound by vibrational spectroscopy in combination with Density Functional Theory calculations reveals the disordered nature of the structure and proves the presence of both borate and hydride ions. Electronic band structure calculations predict a large band gap of 7.1 eV. Hydride states are predicted at the topmost valence band, which agrees well with earlier reported heteroanionic hydrides. We hereby were able to successfully apply previously synthetic and analytical schemes to introduce another member of the rare compounds that contain complex oxoanions simultaneously with hydride ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognition&#8208;Encoded Molecules: a Minimal Self&#8208;Replicator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids, with their unique duplex structure, which is key for information replication, have sparked interest in self&#8208;replication's role in life's origins. Early template&#8208;based replicators, initially built on short oligonucleotides, expanded to include peptides and synthetic molecules. We explore here the potential of a class of synthetic duplex&#8208;forming oligoanilines, as self&#8208;replicators. We have recently developed oligoanilines equipped with 2&#8208;trifluoromethylphenol&#8211;phosphine oxide H&#8208;bond base pairs and we investigate whether the imine formed between aniline and aldehyde complementary monomers can self&#8208;replicate. Despite lacking a clear sigmoidal kinetic profile, control experiments with a methylated donor and a competitive inhibitor support self&#8208;replication. Further investigations with the reduced aniline dimer demonstrate templated synthesis, revealing a characteristic parabolic growth. After showing sequence selective duplex formation, templated synthesis and the emergence of catalytic function, the self&#8208;replication behaviour further suggests that the unique properties of nucleic acids can be paralleled by synthetic recognition&#8208;encoded molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality at the metal center is a well&#8208;established concept, exemplified by numerous four&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinated complexes. Here, a pioneering example of linear chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is described: L&#8208;2&#8208;[Ag(NHC)2]+ (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). In solution, stabilizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions preserve the chiral information of the solid state. Consequently, a novel class of atropisomers is identified, whose stereogenicity arises from hindered rotation about a C&#8211;Ag&#8211;C axis, instead of a typical C&#8211;C bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic two&#8208;photon&#8208;absorbing photosensitizers can overcome competing light absorption in organic photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional organic photocatalysis typically relies on ultraviolet and short&#8208;wavelength visible photons as the energy source. However, this approach often suffers from competing light absorption by reactants, products, intermediates, and co&#8208;catalysts, leading to reduced quantum efficiency and side reactions. To address this issue, we developed novel organic two&#8208;photon&#8208;absorbing (TPA) photosensitizers capable of functioning under deep red and near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. Three model reactions including cyclization, Sonogashira Csp2&#8208;Csp cross&#8208;coupling, and Csp2&#8208;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions were selected to compare the performance of the new photosensitizers under both blue (427 nm) and deep red (660 nm) light irradiation. The obtained results unambiguously prove that for reactions involving blue light&#8208;absorbing reactants, products, and/or co&#8208;catalysts, deep red light source resulted in better performance than blue light when utilizing our TPA photosensitizers. This work highlights the potential of our metal&#8208;free TPA photosensitizers as a sustainable and effective solution to mitigate the competing light absorption issue in photocatalysis, not only expanding the scope of organic photocatalysts but also reducing reliance on expensive Ru/Ir/Os&#8208;based photosensitizers.</dc:description>

The obtained results unambiguously prove that for reactions involving blue light-absorbing reactants, products, and/or co-catalysts, deep red light source resulted in better performance than blue light when utilizing our TPA photosensitizers. This work highlights the potential of our metal-free TPA photosensitizers as a sustainable and effective solution to mitigate the competing light absorption issue in photocatalysis, not only expanding the scope of organic photocatalysts but also reducing reliance on expensive Ru/Ir/Os-based photosensitizers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Antiaromatic [16]Triphyrin(2.1.1) with Core Modification: Synthesis Using a 16&#960; Electrocyclic Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiaromatic porphyrinoids have attracted significant attention owing to their unique electronic properties and potential applications. However, synthesis of antiaromatic contracted porphyrinoids is challenging owing to the inherent instability associated with smaller ring sizes. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of the first stable trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1), a novel 16&#960; antiaromatic contracted porphyrinoid. We utilized a core modification approach to stabilize the [16]triphyrin(2.1.1). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed a nearly planar structure. Electrochemical studies demonstrated reversible oxidation behavior and a small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, which was consistent with its antiaromatic nature. Chemical oxidation yielded an aromatic [14]triphyrin(2.1.1) dication, highlighting the antiaromaticity&#8211;aromaticity switching capability of this system. This synthesis involved the discovery of a key intermediate, dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1), which underwent oxidative dehydrogenation to yield the target compound. Theoretical calculations suggested that dihydrotrioxatriphyrin(2.1.1) formed via a rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction. The successful synthesis and characterization of this stable trioxa[16]triphyrin(2.1.1) underscores the potential of the core modification strategies for the rational design of novel antiaromatic systems with tunable properties. Moreover, the discovery of the rare 16&#960; electrocyclic reaction advances the understanding of high&#8208;order pericyclic processes and may inspire new synthetic strategies for complex macrocyclic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;attached (NHC)Gold(I) and (NHC)Copper(I) Complexes as Photoswitchable Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>Photoswitchable (pre)catalysts, N,N'&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;based (NHC)gold(I) and N,N'&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;derived (NHC)copper(I) complexes are reported. Trans to cis isomerization of the attached photoswitchable moieties in the Au(I) complex enables four&#8208;fold decrement in the rate of oxazoline formation reaction. Whereas the progress of the copper(I) catalyzed, azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction gets reduced by at least threefold. Alternate exposure to UV and blue light could easily toggle the rate of reactions remotely. The catalytic activity of thermodynamically stable trans&#8208;trans isomers is found to be similar to the common N&#8208;aryl substituted NHC&#8208;Au/Cu(I) complexes. NHC&#8208;Au(I) and &#8208;Cu(I) compounds bearing (trans)azobenzene moieties were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Photoswitching, recyclability studies, and the metastable isomer's thermal half&#8208;life in both complexes were studied via UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Whereas the extent of photoswitching and concomitant formation of geometrical isomers were investigated by using&#160;1H&#8208;NMR&#160;spectroscopic study. Calculated percentage buried volumes of the three geometrical isomers show the trend trans&#8208;trans &lt; trans&#8208;cis &lt; cis&#8208;cis.</dc:description>
