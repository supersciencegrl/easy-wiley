         <title>One&#8208;Step and Universal Strategy for the Synthesis of Hypermodified Uracil Phosphoramidites acp3U and cmnm5U</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;step, highly efficient, and scalable synthesis of acp3U phosphoramidite is described, as well as a new alternative synthesis of cmnm5U phosphoramidite from a highly versatile intermediate. Latter could be scaled&#8208;up, split, and aliquots turned simultaneously into cmnm5U, nm5U, and mnm5U. The synthesis responds to the high demand for hypermodified nucleoside building blocks for the oligonucleotide synthesis.








ABSTRACT
Hypermodified nucleosides have recently been at the center of scientific attention. They represent a unique group of nucleosides with an alternated structure, such as the addition of functional groups or amino acids. Their distinctive structures and positions in RNAs are crucial for the processes of translation and stability. High demand for oligonucleotides bearing those hypermodified nucleobases led us to the development of a single&#8208;step synthesis of acp3U phosphoramidite, as acp3U has been recognized as an important molecule for the structural integrity of tRNA and native immunity. We also present a novel synthesis of cmnm5U phosphoramidite and its incorporation into an oligonucleotide from a highly versatile starting material, allowing a transformation into at least two other hypermodified nucleosides.

         <title>Carbon Dots for Cancer Theranostics: Synthesis Strategies, Luminescence Properties, and Advances in Bioimaging&#8208;Guided Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lighting up the path to precision oncology: This review comprehensively summarizes the rational design of carbon dots (CDs), elucidating how core size, surface chemistry, and heteroatom doping dictate their luminescence mechanisms. Special emphasis is placed on engineering NIR&#8208;II emissive CDs for deep&#8208;tissue imaging. Furthermore, the review highlights the transformative potential of multifunctional CDs in image&#8208;guided surgery and synergistic cancer theranostics, paving the way for their clinical translation.








ABSTRACT
Carbon dots (CDs) have emerged as a transformative class of luminescent nanomaterials for biomedical applications, offering superior biocompatibility, photostability, and tunability compared to conventional organic dyes and inorganic quantum dots. This review distinguishes itself by establishing a critical &#8220;Structure&#8208;Property&#8208;Application&#8221; feedback framework. We comprehensively summarize the rational design of CDs, specifically elucidating how core size, surface chemistry, and heteroatom doping can be precisely engineered to tailor optical emission into the near&#8208;infrared II window. Furthermore, the versatile roles of CDs in cancer theranostics are critically discussed, encompassing their utility in subcellular tracking, image&#8208;guided surgery, and multifunctional therapeutic platforms such as photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and targeted drug delivery. Finally, we address the current challenges regarding scalability, reproducibility, and biosafety, providing a perspective on the future roadmap for the clinical translation of high&#8208;performance CD&#8208;based agents.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Activity Relationship Guided Design of a Highly Sensitive Turn&#8208;on Fluorescent Probe for Imaging Inflammation&#8208;Associated&#8208;HOCl in Early Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) guided donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor probe strategy is developed for hypochlorous acid (HOCl) sensing. Donor&#8208;dependent electronic structures dictate distinct HOCl&#8208;triggered reaction pathways, enabling identification of PMBT as an optimal sensitive turn&#8208;on probe. Mitochondria&#8208;associated HOCl imaging allows precise visualization of inflammation&#8208;related early liver fibrosis in mouse liver tissues.








ABSTRACT
Early&#8208;stage liver fibrosis is potentially reversible, yet its timely diagnosis remains challenging due to the lack of sensitive molecular imaging tools. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), an inflammation&#8208;associated reactive oxygen species has emerged as a key pathogenic mediator and early biomarker of fibrotic progression. Herein, guided by a structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) strategy, three donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) fluorescent probes (PMBT, CMBT, and TMBT) were rationally designed and systematically evaluated for HOCl detection. Density functional theory calculations (DFT) and spectroscopic studies reveal donor&#8208;dependent electronic distributions and distinct HOCl&#8208;responsive behaviors. Among them, PMBT exhibits a rapid turn&#8208;on response (&lt;10 s), naked&#8208;eye&#8208;detectable fluorescence enhancement, and a low detection limit of 11.38&#160;nM, along with favorable mitochondrial localization. Benefiting from its high sensitivity and liver&#8208;targeting capability, PMBT enables effective imaging of endogenous HOCl and allows precise visualization of early&#8208;stage liver fibrosis in mouse models, highlighting its potential as a powerful diagnostic tool.

         <title>Stereoselective Access to Trifunctionalized Z&#8208;Allylic Alcohols via Radical&#8208;Mediated 1,4&#8208;Aryl Migration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic, stereoselective synthesis of trifunctionalized Z&#8208;allylic alcohols from readily available benzyl propargyl ethers is disclosed. The reaction proceeds via a radical&#8208;mediated intramolecular 1,4&#8209;aryl migration and oxidative hydrolysis, delivering products with excellent stereoselectivity under mild, photoredox&#8209;neutral conditions.








ABSTRACT
Given the synthetic significance of allylic alcohols, developing efficient methods for their preparation remains a central pursuit in organic chemistry. Herein, we report a stereoselective approach to access trifunctionalized Z&#8209;allylic alcohols via a radical&#8209;mediated 1,4&#8209;aryl migration. By employing readily available benzyl propargyl ethers and Togni&#8208;II reagent as the CF3 source, this reaction proceeds through inert C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) bond cleavage, enabling the modular assembly of valuable trifluoromethylated Z&#8209;allylic alcohols under mild, photoredox&#8209;neutral conditions. The protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, excellent functional&#8209;group tolerance, and high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Gold Nanocluster&#8208;Silver Nanoparticle&#8208;MoS2 Heterostructures as SERS&#8208;Active Catalysts With Enhanced Electron&#8208;Donating Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of gold nanoclusters into silver nanoparticles&#8208;MoS2 ternary heterostructure enhances the electron&#8208;donating capability of SERS&#8208;active catalytic reaction. By quantifying the electron supply ability using the concept of charge transfer degree, it has been confirmed that silver nanoparticles act as a bridge for charge transfer, helping to transfer the photogenerated charges of gold nanoclusters to MoS2.








ABSTRACT
Metal nanoclusters (MNCs)&#8208;semiconductor (SC) composite materials have garnered significant attention due to the fascinating and versatile properties exhibited by MNCs. However, there is a scarcity of efforts directed toward incorporating metal nanoparticles (MNPs) into MNCs&#8208;SC composites to facilitate charge generation within the system. And the underlying mechanism governing charge transfer in such systems remains elusive. In this work, a straightforward reduction&#8208;adsorption strategy was employed to ingeniously introduce AuNCs into the AgNPs@MoS2 binary nanostructure. This approach effectively improves the electron&#8208;donating performance of resulting AuNCs&#8208;AgNPs@MoS2 ternary heterostructures, which were utilized as the substrates for SERS&#8208;active p&#8208;nitrothiophenol (PNTP)&#8208;catalytic reactions. PNTP&#8208;catalytic experiments further validated the enhanced catalytic performance arising from the introduction of AuNCs into the ternary heterostructure. Furthermore, the composite mechanism of AuNCs and AgNPs in the nanosystem was elucidated, revealing that AgNPs act as charge bridges and synergistically facilitate charge generation in conjunction with AuNCs. The electron&#8208;donating capability was quantified using the concept of charge transfer degree, rendering the impact of AuNCs incorporation on charge yield more intuitive. This study is anticipated to provide a rational approach for the construction of MNCs&#8208;MNPs@SC ternary nanostructures and optimizing the synergistic interaction between MNCs and MNPs, thereby enabling their applications across diverse fields.

&lt;p&gt;Incorporation of gold nanoclusters into silver nanoparticles-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ternary heterostructure enhances the electron-donating capability of SERS-active catalytic reaction. By quantifying the electron supply ability using the concept of charge transfer degree, it has been confirmed that silver nanoparticles act as a bridge for charge transfer, helping to transfer the photogenerated charges of gold nanoclusters to MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal nanoclusters (MNCs)-semiconductor (SC) composite materials have garnered significant attention due to the fascinating and versatile properties exhibited by MNCs. However, there is a scarcity of efforts directed toward incorporating metal nanoparticles (MNPs) into MNCs-SC composites to facilitate charge generation within the system. And the underlying mechanism governing charge transfer in such systems remains elusive. In this work, a straightforward reduction-adsorption strategy was employed to ingeniously introduce AuNCs into the AgNPs@MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binary nanostructure. This approach effectively improves the electron-donating performance of resulting AuNCs-AgNPs@MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ternary heterostructures, which were utilized as the substrates for SERS-active &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrothiophenol (PNTP)-catalytic reactions. PNTP-catalytic experiments further validated the enhanced catalytic performance arising from the introduction of AuNCs into the ternary heterostructure. Furthermore, the composite mechanism of AuNCs and AgNPs in the nanosystem was elucidated, revealing that AgNPs act as charge bridges and synergistically facilitate charge generation in conjunction with AuNCs. The electron-donating capability was quantified using the concept of charge transfer degree, rendering the impact of AuNCs incorporation on charge yield more intuitive. This study is anticipated to provide a rational approach for the construction of MNCs-MNPs@SC ternary nanostructures and optimizing the synergistic interaction between MNCs and MNPs, thereby enabling their applications across diverse fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monomeric Fluorescence of H&#8208;Aggregates in a Series of 2&#8208;(Hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazoles Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of a photochemical channel for the deactivation of excitonic excitation via excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer enables the activation of the forbidden fluorescence from H&#8208;aggregates of 2&#8208;(hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazole derivatives. The fluorescence with an anomalous Stokes shift exhibits high efficiency, with the quantum yield reaching 0.91.








ABSTRACT
The exploitation of molecular self&#8208;assembly, which leads to the formation of aggregates, represents one of the most crucial approaches in the fabrication of advanced functional materials. A fundamental aspect&#160;in this area is the development of novel strategies to construct supramolecular architectures with new (unusual) properties, in particular, strongly fluorescent H&#8208;aggregates. Using 2&#8208;(2&#8208;carboalkoxy&#8208;3,4,5&#8208;trichloro&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazoles (HBOs) as building blocks, H&#8208;aggregates were successfully obtained in both aqueous binary mixtures and the crystalline state. These aggregates exhibit intense fluorescence despite the prohibition imposed by Kasha's rule. This violation seems to result from the deactivation mechanism&#160;of the excited excitonic state in HBO H&#8208;aggregates, which involves, along with internal conversion, a photochemical channel induced by excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) rather than a radiative one. The consequence of ESIPT is monomeric fluorescence from the keto forms of HBOs. The fluorescence quantum yields of HBOs in the crystalline state are significantly higher than those in solution, ranging from 0.81 to 0.91. This enhancement is due to intramolecular hydrogen bonds as well as the dense molecular packing of HBOs, which suppresses conformational transformations.

Generalized photochemical pathways for the synthesis of benzene fused 1,4&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;diazines from 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;aza bis&#8208;nucleophiles and various diazo compounds, utilizing water as the distinct solvent have been materialized. Additionally, &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds can act as 1C&#8208;dipolarophiles and generates 1,2,3&#8208;tri substituted indoles when reacted with suitable 1,4&#8208;dipolarophilic coupling partners (2&#8208;aminoacetophenone) following [4+1]&#8208;annulation pathway. The late&#8208;stage modifications of quinoxalinone and quinoxaline scaffold inforcing photoinduced C&#8208;H activation generates the structurally diverse spiroindene compounds, including steroid&#8208;embedded di&#8208;aza heterocycles. Dihydroquinazolines can be transformed to quinazolines applying DDQ as the oxidative dehydrogenating reagent.








ABSTRACT
The development of innovative and sustainable synthetic methodologies is crucial to address the increasing demand for environmentally benign practices in all domains of organic chemistry. In this regard, harnessing visible light as the sole energy input is particularly attractive. Diazo compounds, being highly versatile reagents with notable reactivity and ready accessibility, are well&#8208;suited for photochemical activation, which offers a promising, eco&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes. In this perspective, we report generalized photochemical pathways for the synthesis of benzene fused 1,4&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;diazines from 1,4&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;aza bis&#8208;nucleophiles and various diazo compounds, employing water as the sole and distinct solvent under aerobic presence. These protocols involve the direct photoinduced generation of carbenes from diazo compounds, averting the need of any photocatalyst, which then opts [4+2] or [5+1]&#8208;annulation pathway and offers distinct products. The detailed insights into the reaction pathways are investigated through several control experiments and DFT studies. Strategically it is also possible to construct a 5&#8208;membered aza&#8208;heterocyclic core applying the same photochemical approach. Finally, the late&#8208;stage modifications of quinoxalinone and quinoxaline scaffold applying the photoinduced C&#8208;H activation technique generate the structurally diverse spiroindene compounds, including steroid&#8208;embedded di&#8208;aza heterocycle.

         <title>Ammonia Concentration&#8208;Directed Preferential Growth Enhancing Lithium&#8208;Ion Diffusion in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ABSTRACT
Ammonia concentration acts as a &#8220;multifunctional structure&#8208;directing factor&#8221; throughout the entire growth of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LRMO) precursors in coprecipitation process. Thus, this study investigates the effect of ammonia concentration on the precursor structure and morphology evolution. It is verified that ammonia concentration can significantly influence the preferential growth of crystallites and the agglomeration behavior of secondary particles. At an optimized ammonia concentration, the Mn0.675Co0.1625Ni0.1625CO3 precursor exhibited preferential growth along the (012) crystallographic plane, facilitating an ordered structural arrangement and suppressing the agglomeration of secondary particle. After lithiation, the resulting LRMO material exhibits an enhanced Li+ diffusion, endowing the material with higher initial capacity, improved rate performance, and superior cycling stability. Furthermore, this work establishes a clear correlation between the lattice parameters of the LRMO material and its Li+ transport and storage properties. These findings offer valuable mechanistic insights and a practical synthesis strategy for enhancing the electrochemical performance of LRMO cathodes by precisely controlling precursor crystallization and microstructure.

Porphyrin arrays go chiral&#8211;A porphyrin Gel&#228;nder macrocycle represents the intriguing prototype architecture of helically chiral butadiyne&#8208;linked porphyrin arrays. This study combines synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational methods to shed light on its structure, chiroptical properties, and tunability, highlighting its promise for advancing functional optoelectronic materials.








ABSTRACT
A new &#8220;Porphyrin&#8208;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; (PoGe) macrocycle rac&#8208;PoGe[Zn, Zn] embodying a twisted butadiyne&#8208;linked porphyrin dyad as the banister was designed and synthesized according to a previously published successful design principle for Gel&#228;nder molecules. The C2&#8208;symmetric properties of rac&#8208;PoGe[Zn, Zn] were revealed by detailed 2D NMR analysis. Postsynthesis modification consisting of central metal ion exchange in the porphyrin moieties led to PoGe macrocycles rac&#8208;PoGe[2H, 2H] and rac&#8208;PoGe[Cu, Cu] and was demonstrated to lead to finely tunable absorption and emission spectra, reaching in the near&#8208;IR region. CSP&#8208;HPLC resolved all rac&#8208;PoGe[M, M] into their (P) and (M) enantiomers, which were analyzed by UV&#8208;Vis, fluorescence and ECD spectroscopy. The absolute configuration was assigned by the exciton chirality method (ECM) and corroborated by comparing experimental and simulated ECD spectra.

         <title>Structural Design of Isomerized Coplanar Ladder Polymers for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different isomerized coplanar ladder polymers were studied to determine the effect of isomerization on the charge generation and separation process of the photocatalyst in the coplanar structure system, thereby achieving significant photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance.








ABSTRACT
The efficient separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers remains a major challenge in polymer&#8208;based photocatalysis. Building planar structures through ladder&#8208;type polymers has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance charge carrier dynamics. In this context, we investigate the crucial yet overlooked role of structural isomerization in such systems. Herein, we report two isomeric ladder polymers with coplanar backbones, PAE&#8208;L and PAE&#8208;Z, to systematically investigate the influence of molecular configuration on photocatalytic performance. The optimized PAE&#8208;L exhibits enhanced light&#8208;harvesting capability, strengthened &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and superior charge transport properties, leading to remarkable photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. This work provides a reference for the design and performance optimization of efficient coplanar conjugated polymer photocatalysts.

         <title>Mitigated Mn Dissolution and Improved Cycling Stability of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 Spinel Cathodes by Zinc Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural stability and electrochemical performance of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 spinel were significantly improved through mitigating the dissolution of Mn during cycling by simple Zn doping.








ABSTRACT
The spinel compound LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) has attracted increasing attention as a potential cathode material for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) of the next generation. Despite its attractive properties, LNMO suffers from transition&#8208;metal ion dissolution and pronounced capacity fading, which significantly limit its practical implementation. To address these limitations, Zn is introduced into the LNMO structure to prepare Zn&#8208;doped LNMO, designed to stabilize the 16c and 8a sites and thus improve its electrochemical performance. This doping approach improves the structural robustness of LNMO and significantly suppresses Mn dissolution during electrochemical cycling. Even after 1000 cycles at a current rate of 1 C (1 C = 147&#160;mA g&#8722;1), the Zn&#8208;LNMO sample maintains 81.2% of its original capacity, demonstrating substantially improved capacity retention. Moreover, the Zn&#8208;LNMO electrode maintains 98.8% of its initial voltage after 1000 cycles, and the corresponding average decline in voltage is as low as 0.06&#160;mV for each cycle. This study establishes an atomically engineered doping concept that can be generalized to various cathode systems and serves as an effective guideline for designing high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Insights Into Symmetry and Substitution Patterns Governing Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Gap in the Chemical Space of Azaphenalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
Molecules that violate Hund's rule by exhibiting an inverted singlet&#8211;triplet gap (STG), where the first excited singlet (S1${\rm S}_1$) lies below the triplet (T1${\rm T}_1$), are rare but hold great promise as efficient fifth&#8208;generation light emitters. Azaphenalenes (APs) represent one of the few known molecular classes capable of such inversion of the S1${\rm S}_1$/T1${\rm T}_1$ energy ordering, yet a systematic exploration of all unique APs is lacking. Here, we investigate 104 distinct APs and classify them based on their adherence to or deviation from Hund's rule using S1${\rm S}_1$&#8211;T1${\rm T}_1$ gaps computed with the second&#8208;order coupled&#8208;cluster method employing the Laplace transform (L&#8208;CC2). To capture substitution&#8208;dependent pseudo&#8211;Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions that are inadequately described by MP2 and DFT methods, we employ a focal&#8208;point extrapolation scheme to obtain near&#8208;CCSD(T)/cc&#8208;pVTZ&#8208;quality geometries. We find 3 APs to undergo D3h&#8594;C3h$D_{\rm 3h} \rightarrow C_{\rm 3h}$ and 10 to show C2v&#8594;Cs$C_{\rm 2v}\rightarrow C_{\rm s}$ symmetry lowering, leading to a total of 117 configurations of 104 unique APs. Our study identifies top candidates with inverted STGs, revealing how substitution and symmetry&#8208;lowering modulate these gaps to uncover new stable AP cores that provide promising targets for designing molecular light&#8208;emitters.

         <title>Core Shell {001}&#8208;TiO2@APF Heterojunction Photocatalysts for Enhanced Water Treatment Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study confirms the formation of Ti&#8208;O&#8208;C covalent bonds at the interface between TiO2 and APF through XPS analysis, effectively addressing charge transport challenges, promoting rapid carrier migration, and significantly enhancing the degradation rate of glyphosate.








ABSTRACT
The efficient separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers remain a difficult challenge in photocatalysis. While the heterojunctions are an effective strategy for promoting photogenerated charge separation, inefficient migration at the interface often hinders the development. Herein, we report a core&#8208;shell organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid system, TiO2@3&#8208;aminophenol formaldehyde resin spheres ({001}&#8208;TiO2@APF) for photocatalytic water treatment. The {001}&#8208;TiO2@APF heterojunction achieves a 100% degradation efficiency of glyphosate in 6&#160;h with a reaction rate constant of 0.0068 min&#8722;1, which is 6.2 times that of APF (0.0011 min&#8722;1) and 1.3 times that of bare TiO2 (0.0051 min&#8722;1). XPS analysis confirms the formation of Ti&#8208;O&#8208;C covalent bonds at the organic&#8208;inorganic interface, which effectively addresses the charge transport challenge and facilitates rapid carrier migration across the heterojunction. This work underscores the importance of atomic&#8208;level interfacial engineering in constructing high&#8208;efficiency inorganic&#8208;organic photocatalysts for sustainable water purification.

         <title>Dual Ligand&#8208;Enabled Nondirected C&#9472;H Olefination of (Hetero)Arenes for the Synthesis of Clickable Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient method for late&#8208;stage installation of &#8220;clickable&#8221; alkyne groups into diverse (hetero)arenes. Using a dual&#8208;ligand palladium catalyst that combines an NASA ligand with an N&#8208;heterocycle, an acrylate unit bearing a terminal alkyne can be introduced via nondirected C&#9472;H activation. This approach enables broad substrate scope and delivers products suitable for subsequent CuAAC reactions.








ABSTRACT
Herein, we present a highly efficient method for the late&#8208;stage introduction of &#8220;clickable&#8221; alkyne moieties into different (hetero)arene scaffolds. A highly efficient dual ligand&#8208;based palladium catalyst combining an N&#8208;acylsulfonamide (NASA) ligand with an N&#8208;heterocycle enables the introduction of acrylate moiety bearing a terminal alkyne via nondirected C&#9472;H activation, providing a versatile platform for subsequent bioconjugation or activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP) applications. The utility of the method is demonstrated through a broad substrate scope and the subsequent use of the obtained products in representative click reactions.

         <title>A Bifunctional Small Molecule Degrader of the Long Noncoding RNA MALAT1 Triplex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting disease&#8208;linked RNAs with small molecules is often limited by the modest impact of binding RNA structure alone. Here, we present a first&#8208;in&#8208;class bifunctional molecule that degrades the oncogenic lncRNA MALAT&#8208;1 by inducing proximity between the RNA and a cleaving warhead. The approach presented herein underscores the relevance of converting a binder into a degrader for generating biological activity beyond simple RNA binding.








ABSTRACT
The targeted degradation of RNA, particularly long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), holds immense potential for therapeutic interventions in diseases associated with aberrant RNA regulation. Here, we introduce a novel Proximity&#8211;Induced Nucleic Acid Degrader (PINAD&#8211;1), a first&#8208;in&#8208;class small molecule that selectively induces the degradation of MALAT1, a lncRNA implicated in the regulation of metastatic processes. PINAD&#8211;1 is designed by conjugating a binder specific for the triple helix structure of MALAT1 to an imidazole&#8208;based RNA&#8208;degrading warhead, enabling specific cleavage of the MALAT1 transcript in vitro and in cellulo, with minimal off&#8208;target effects on the structurally similar NEAT1 lncRNA. Through mechanistic studies, we show that effective RNA degradation is not solely dependent on proximity but requires a precise structural context, as demonstrated by the differential activity of PINAD&#8211;1 compared to the structurally analogous but functionally inert conjugate PINAD&#8211;2. Our findings underscore the importance of binder&#8208;induced destabilization and RNA geometry in facilitating RNA degradation. This work lays the foundation for the design of bifunctional small&#8208;molecule RNA degraders as powerful tools for the modulation of structured noncoding RNAs, offering potential applications in RNA&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Emissive Liquid Crystalline Boron C,N&#8208;Chelates: Synthesis, Self&#8208;assembly, and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel emissive liquid crystalline boron C,N&#8208;chelates were prepared by integrating mesogenic units into the boron C,N&#8208;core. Depending on the substituent at the boron, stable SmA or N mesophases were achieved while maintaining intense blue emission with excellent quantum yields (61%&#8211;100%).








ABSTRACT
A library of novel phenylpyridine&#8208;based boron C,N&#8208;chelates bearing a mesogenic unit was synthesized and investigated to clarify how the chain type, length, and number, as well as the boron substitution (BH2 vs. BMe2) influence the mesomorphic and photophysical behavior. All BH2 derivatives exhibited SmA or N phases even with short alkyl chains, whereas BMe2 analogues remained nonmesomorphic unless a semi&#8208;perfluorinated chain was introduced, demonstrating the strong influence of boron substitution on mesophase formation. All compounds displayed intense blue emission in solution, with spectral properties primarily determined by the boron C,N core and only minor shifts induced by variation in the mesogenic unit in agreement with complementary DFT calculations. Quantum yields reached up to 100% in solution. These results demonstrate that mesomorphic behavior can be introduced and tuned while preserving the excellent photophysical performance of the boron&#8208;C,N&#8208;chelate system.

         <title>Bimetallic MOFs With Enzyme&#8208;Mimetic Active Sites for Nerve Agent Detoxification: Synergistic Insights Into Impeccable Performance From Experiment and Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimetallic MOF incorporating enzyme&#8208;mimetic active sites exhibits outstanding catalytic efficiency for the rapid and selective detoxification of nerve agents. Comprehensive experimental investigations, complemented by theoretical modeling, reveal the synergistic interplay between the dual&#8208;metal centers and the framework architecture, underpinning its exceptional performance.








ABSTRACT
Nerve agents pose severe risks to human health, underscoring the need for efficient decontamination strategies. This study explores metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as catalytic platforms owing to their structural tunability, redox&#8208;active metal centers, and abundance of Lewis acidic sites. Single&#8208; and bimetallic UiO&#8208;series MOFs incorporating Ce(IV) and Zr(IV) (confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) were synthesized using different approaches, including ligand exchange and controlled crystal growth, with four ligands: BDC, BDC&#8211;NH2, BDC&#8211;NO2, and BDC&#8211;(OH)2. These frameworks were systematically evaluated for the hydrolysis of p&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP), a simulant for G&#8208; and V&#8208;type nerve agents (e.g., sarin, VX). The design strategy leverages the redox activity and cooperativity of Ce/Zr nodes, alongside the caging effect of the MOF architecture, to enhance catalytic efficacy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided mechanistic insights into sarin degradation, revealing how metal composition and linker functionality govern substrate binding and activation. Experimental results demonstrated that bimetallic Ce/Zr&#8208;MOFs with electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups exhibit significantly accelerated hydrolysis under basic aqueous conditions. Notably, a Ce/Zr&#8208;MOF with &#8211;NO2 functionality achieved the shortest half&#8208;life of 1.16&#160;min. These findings highlight Ce/Zr&#8208;UiO frameworks as promising candidates for real&#8208;world nerve agent decontamination technologies.

         <title>Uncertainty Calibration in Molecular Machine Learning: Comparing Evidential and Ensemble Approaches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used in quantum chemistry, but their reliability hinges on uncertainty quantification (UQ). In this study, we compare two prominent UQ paradigms&#8212;deep evidential regression (DER) and deep ensembles&#8212;on the QM9 and WS22 datasets, with a specific emphasis on the role of post hoc calibration. Raw uncertainties from both methods were systematically miscalibrated: DER produced uncertainty estimates where data noise and model uncertainty were not cleanly separated, while ensembles produced sharper yet underconfident estimates. Applying calibration techniques such as isotonic regression (ISR), standard scaling, and GP&#8208;Normal corrected these deficiencies, aligning predicted variances with observed errors. On QM9, calibration enabled DER to filter high&#8208;confidence predictions more effectively than ensembles. On WS22, calibrated ensembles not only improved statistical reliability but also delivered substantial computational savings in active learning, reducing redundant ab initio evaluations by more than 20%. These results demonstrate that post hoc calibration is essential to transform uncertainty estimates from descriptive metrics into actionable signals, ensuring both trustworthy predictions and resource&#8208;efficient molecular modeling.

         <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance of Dithienopyrrole and Thienoisoindigo&#8208;Based Conjugated Polymers by Introducing Thiophene Spacers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2',3'&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) and thienoisoindigo (TIIG)&#8208;based D&#8208;A conjugated polymers were synthesized and characterized as TE materials. Through introducing thiophene units as spacers between DTP and TIIG, PTIIG&#8208;2T&#8208;DTP exhibits enhanced backbone coplanarity as well as molecular packing in thin films, which facilitates the charge transport and results in the enhancement of TE performance.








ABSTRACT
Donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated polymers hold significant potential as high&#8208;potential thermoelectric (TE) materials due to their adjustable structures, efficient charge transport ability and tunable doping level. However, achieving a balance between the Seebeck coefficient (S) and electrical conductivity (&#963;) remains challenging. In this work, we employ thienoisoindigo (TIIG) as the acceptor and dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2',3'&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) as the donor to construct two novel D&#8208;A conjugated polymers for TE application. Through introducing thiophene (T) units as spacers between DTP and TIIG, PTIIG&#8208;2T&#8208;DTP enhances the planarity of conjugated backbones compared to PTIIG&#8208;DTP. Moreover, PTIIG&#8208;2T&#8208;DTP film shows more compact packing between conjugated backbones, which improves the charge transport. Despite slightly lower doping efficiency, doped PTIIG&#8208;2T&#8208;DTP exhibits superior carrier mobility and conductivity to PTIIG&#8208;DTP. Additionally, PTIIG&#8208;2T&#8208;DTP shows a higher Seebeck coefficient at same doping concentration. Ultimately, PTIIG&#8208;2T&#8208;DTP achieves a large power factor of 23.2 &#181;Wm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 with &#963; of 120 S cm&#8722;1 which is much higher than that of PTIIG&#8208;DTP. This work develops an effective polymer backbone engineering strategy for developing high&#8208;performance D&#8208;A conjugated TE polymers.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Growth of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 on Carboxymethylated Cellulose Beads for Enhanced Low Concentration Fluoride Ions Removal From Aqueous Solution</title>

         <dc:description>









ABSTRACT
The development of high&#8208;capacity and selective adsorbents for fluoride (F&#8722;) removal is hindered by its inherent characteristics, including its small ionic radius, high charge density, strong hydration ability, high mobility and solubility, as well as the weak diffusion driving force at low concentrations. In this study, a novel composite adsorbent was prepared by loading UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 onto carboxymethylated cellulose beads (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@CMCBs) via an in&#8208;situ generation strategy for efficient adsorption and recovery of F&#8722;. The highly porous structure and abundant surface carboxyl groups of CMCBs provide favorable coordination sites, promoting the growth of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Under environmental conditions (25&#176;C, pH 7.4), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@CMCBs completely remove F&#8722; from aqueous solutions with an initial concentration of 10.0&#160;mg L&#8722;1. Furthermore, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@CMCBs demonstrated excellent column adsorption performance and outstanding reusability, maintaining a removal efficiency exceeding 80% after 5 cycles. These results highlight the potential of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@CMCBs as an efficient and recyclable adsorbent for the practical treatment of fluoride&#8208;contaminated water.

         <title>The Evolving Enantioselective C&#9472;H Functionalization of Tertiary Allylic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
The direct functionalization of tertiary and other inert allylic C&#9472;H bonds represents one of the most attractive strategies in the construction of complicated molecules with quaternary carbon centers. Unlike approaches that rely on pre&#8208;functionalized allylic substrates, such as halides, acetates, and carbonates, allylic C&#9472;H activation provides an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical route to forge diverse and valuable C&#9472;C and C&#9472;X bonds. Although the functionalization of secondary allylic C&#9472;H bonds has been extensively studied and well established in recent years, the corresponding transformation of tertiary allylic C&#9472;H bonds remains considerably underdeveloped. This concept summarizes the progress and mechanistic pathways&#8212;including transition&#8208;metal insertion (via two&#8208;electron transfer) and radical&#8208;involving single&#8208;electron transfer processes&#8212;enabling the functionalization of various tertiary allylic C&#9472;H bonds. Future directions in this long&#8208;standing and challenging field are also discussed.

Synopsis: This review systematically summarizes the design strategies, reaction mechanisms, and application prospects of OSEs, highlighting their potential for sustainable energy conversion and as alternatives to noble metal catalysts.








ABSTRACT
Organic semiconductor electrocatalysts (OSEs), which integrate the properties of organic semiconductors with electrocatalytic performance, have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional noble metal catalysts due to their low cost, earth abundance, and design flexibility. This article reviews the unique structural features of organic material systems, including small organic molecules, conjugated polymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and organic hybrid materials. It elucidates the structure&#8208;activity relationship between the features of organic catalysts and their catalytic advantages. It discusses design strategies, including molecular engineering and interface regulation. Also, it explores applications in key reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Despite challenges in stability and large&#8208;scale preparation, OSEs show great potential in sustainable energy conversion, offering insights for advancing clean energy technologies.

         <title>An Artificial Interphase of Ionic Liquid (EMIMTFSI) for High Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 5, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries face short lifetimes caused by Zn dendrites and corrosion. Here, a versatile ionic liquid interphase is formed by tape&#8208;casting EMIMTFSI on Zn (IL@Zn). The enriched EMIM+ and TFSI&#8722; on the Zn surface form an EMIM+&#8208;I3&#8722; phase and a hydrophobic interface, uniform nucleation is effectively promoted and corrosion is suppressed. As a result, IL@ Zn&#8208;I2 batteries retain 82% capacity after 2000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries suffer from short cycle life due to zinc (Zn) dendrite growth and polyiodide shuttle&#8208;induced corrosion. To address these key challenges, a multifunctional protective film of 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (EMIMTFSI) ionic liquid, denoted as IL@Zn, was constructed on the Zn anode surface via a tape&#8208;casting method to improve the cycle life of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries. EMIM+ cations preferentially adsorb on Zn, creating a water&#8208;lean inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and providing steric hindrance for uniform Zn nucleation, while hydrophobic TFSI&#8722; anions enrich at the surface to build a water&#8208;repellent interface that excludes H2O and suppresses parasitic reactions. Moreover, EMIM+ hinders iodine dissolution and forms an EMIM+&#8208;I3&#8722; dominant phase, mitigating the polyiodide shuttle and the associated Zn corrosion. Consequently, IL@Zn symmetric cells deliver over 350&#160;h of stable cycling at 5.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Zn&#8208;I2 full cells with IL@Zn anodes retain 82% capacity after 2000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 and exhibit higher Coulombic efficiency (CE) after self&#8208;discharge than cells with unprotected Zn anodes. This work demonstrates a facile strategy for aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries that effectively addresses the challenges of dendrite formation and the shuttle effect.

Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cells with IL@Zn anodes retain 82% capacity after 2000 cycles at 2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibit higher Coulombic efficiency (CE) after self-discharge than cells with unprotected Zn anodes. This work demonstrates a facile strategy for aqueous Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries that effectively addresses the challenges of dendrite formation and the shuttle effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Allenes From sec&#8208;Propargyl Alcohols and Their Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 5, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the first alkaline earth catalyst&#8208;mediated synthesis of trisubstituted allenes from sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols with active methylene compounds or electron&#8208;rich arenes. The reaction demonstrates its sustainability not only due to the use of a Ca&#8208;catalyst, but also due to its simple operation, at room temperature, under solvent&#8208;free, open&#8208;air conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis, one&#8208;pot synthetic applications, and a wide substrate scope were demonstrated.








ABSTRACT
We describe here the first report on the alkaline earth&#8208;catalyzed regioselective synthesis of trisubstituted allenes from sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols (PAs) and active methyl ketones/electron&#8208;rich arenes. Unlike previous methods, the current approach does not require the protection of alcohol, heating, transition metal catalysts, or solvents. The reaction mechanism is proposed based on deuterium labelling, step&#8208;wise synthesis, and isolation of intermediates. The current protocol exhibits a broad substrate scope, high reaction yields, and enables gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Besides, we also demonstrated the one&#8208;pot cyclization of these allenes to obtain tetrahydroindoles and fused furans.

         <title>Unprecedented Formation of a Formally Cu(III) Trifluoromethyl Hydroxide Tetramer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 5, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel high&#8208;valent Cu(III) trifluoromethyl hydroxide scaffold with an unprecedented heterocubane structure was synthesized. Its neutralization reactions with acids afford a broad variety of Cu(III) complexes with two trifluoromethyl groups. Synthetic relevance of this compound for C&#9472;CF3 bond formation was demonstrated.








ABSTRACT
Aerobic copper&#8208;mediated oxidative processes play a pivotal role in the context of enzymatic oxidation and catalysis. Herein, the first high&#8208;valent copper(III) trifluoromethyl hydroxide with the tetrameric heterocubane structure [Cu(CF3)2(OH)]4 was synthesized by air oxidation of copper(I) in the presence of TMSCF3/KF and fully characterized, including X&#8208;ray crystallography. This unique compound displays versatile reactivity, functioning as a hydroxide base in neutralization reactions with acids, which affords a broad variety of high&#8208;valent Cu(III) complexes with two trifluoromethyl groups. The synthetic relevance of copper(III) trifluoromethyl hydroxide for boronic acid trifluoromethylation was demonstrated. The natural population analysis (NPA) charge distribution in the tetrameric heterocubane was studied by DFT calculations, which support the experimentally observed behavior of this compound as a weak hydroxide base, and revealed the positive NPA charge of +1.157 on high&#8208;valent copper.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Medium&#8208;Pore Aluminosilicate Zeolite SCM&#8208;53</title>

ABSTRACT
Designing and synthesizing condensed, thermally stable zeolites by inverse sigma expansion of open&#8208;framework zeolites has been well achieved. However, creating thermally stable open&#8208;framework zeolites through sigma expansion of condensed&#8208;frameworks remains rare. Herein, we present the rational design and synthesis of a thermally stable medium&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite SCM&#8208;53, which possesses a 2D 10&#160;&#215; 10&#8208;ring channel system. The framework of SCM&#8208;53 was theoretically predicted by sigma expansion of the framework of SCM&#8208;51, a small&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite featuring a 2D 8&#160;&#215; 8&#8208;ring channel system prepared by calcination of the layered precursor SCM&#8208;50. SCM&#8208;53 was rationally synthesized by successive interlayer silylation and calcination treatments of SCM&#8208;50. The structure of SCM&#8208;53 was validated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and N2 absorption measurement. Our results demonstrate that SCM&#8208;53 possesses accessible micropores (5.9&#160;&#215; 4.9 &#197;), an ultrathin nanosheet morphology (&#8764;15&#160;nm), and high thermal stability (up to 800 &#176;C), suggesting its potential for adsorption and catalytic applications. We anticipate that sigma expansion offers a promising approach for the rational design and synthesis of targeted novel zeolite structures.

         <title>Magnetic Dynamics and Elongated Coherence of a High&#8208;Spin Mn(II) Qubit Doped Into a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 5, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that dilute Mn(II) (&#8764;0.02 mol%) doped into the Zn(II)&#8208;MOF [CH6N3][Zn(HCOO)3] act as high&#8208;spin (S = 5/2) spin qubits, achieving microsecond phase memory times above 50 K&#8212;the first report for Mn(II)&#8208;based systems. Robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks suppress relaxation and stabilize the lattice, extending T2. Resonance between MS = &#177;1/2 and quantization axis tilting reveal tunable spin dynamics, highlighting MOFs as promising platforms for high&#8208;spin molecular qubits.








ABSTRACT
Spin qubits are among the most promising candidates for quantum information processing and sensing technologies. Their potential to function even at elevated temperatures makes them particularly attractive for future devices. However, while extensive studies have been carried out on S = 1/2 systems, high&#8208;spin complexes remain much less explored as spin qubit platforms. In this study, we prepared a Zn(II)&#8208;based MOF, [CH6N3][Zn(HCOO)3], doped with trace amounts of Mn(II) ions (S = 5/2, 0.2, and 0.02 mol%). Magnetic measurements under static fields revealed slow relaxation phenomena dominated by direct and Raman&#8208;like processes. Importantly, Q&#8208;band pulsed ESR confirmed quantum coherence between MS = &#177;1/2 sublevels, achieving phase memory times (T2) up to 5.4 &#181;s at 10 K, which is significantly longer than those reported in other Mn(II)&#8208;based systems. Rabi nutation experiments verified coherent spin control and multilevel transitions, while Wigner matrix analysis revealed reorientation of the nuclear quantization axis during spin flips. Notably, coherence persisted above 150 K, attributed to the stabilization provided in the MOF's hydrogen&#8208;bonded lattice. This work represents the first demonstration of high&#8208;spin Mn(II) qubits with measurable coherence at elevated temperatures, underscoring MOFs as versatile and tunable platforms for advancing quantum materials and molecular spin&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Stepwise and Cascade Synthesis of 9,10&#8208;Diaroylphenanthrenes From Tetraarylthiophenes by Electronically Guided Bond Making and Breaking Under a Scholl&#8208;Type Reaction</title>

An electronically programmable Scholl&#8208;type protocol transforms tetraarylthiophenes through selective [c]&#8208;face annulation to phenanthro[9,10&#8208;c]thiophenes, which then undergo oxidative C&#9472;S cleavage to 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes. A one&#8208;pot cascade integrates both steps, unveiling unprecedented thiophene bond&#8208;making/bond&#8208;breaking dual&#8208;reactivity and providing streamlined access to &#960;&#8208;extended, edge&#8208;edited aromatic frameworks relevant for advanced materials.








ABSTRACT
The Scholl reaction has long stood as a powerful tool for forging C&#8211;C bonds in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) yet controlling regioselectivity and accessing new reactivity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we unveil a strategically designed platform that exploits electronic tuning within tetraarylthiophenes (TATs) to achieve highly selective [c]&#8208;face oxidative cyclodehydrogenation, delivering phenanthro[9,10&#8208;c]thiophenes in exceptional yields, a pathway previously inaccessible. Beyond annulation, we uncover a novel oxidative ring&#8208;opening reaction, wherein these phenanthrothiophenes undergo selective C&#9472;S bond cleavage to yield 9,10&#8208;diaroylphenanthrenes&#8212;a transformation unprecedented in thiophene chemistry under Scholl&#8208;type reaction. Remarkably, we integrate both steps into a one&#8208;pot cascade protocol, streamlining direct synthesis from TATs to complex diketone architectures in notable yields. Mechanistic studies, including radical trapping and EPR spectroscopy, point out toward radical (cation/anion) pathways governing these transformations. This dual reactivity&#8212;from ring construction to ring cleavage&#8212;spotlights new horizons in Scholl chemistry, expanding synthetic access to diverse PAH frameworks and edition of functional edges, that may have potential applications as functional materials in organic electronics.

         <title>Controlling Competitive Radical Pathways: Insights From Aryl Diazonium Electrografting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 5, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work&#160;shows that nitrobenzene diazonium electrografting results from competition between aryl and diazenyl radicals, which govern film composition. Using simulations and control strategies, grafting conditions are tuned to favor specific radicals. It enables selective formation of azo&#8208;enriched films and paves the way toward the precise control of nanofilm structure.








ABSTRACT
Understanding and controlling the reactivity of radical species remains a major challenge in many chemical reactions, with the goal of steering and precisely tuning key processes. Recognized as a simple and efficient method for the preparation of 2D nanomaterials, diazonium electrografting is a prime example of a functionalization technique that still requires deeper mastery to meet the demands of future bottom&#8208;up approaches. In this work, supported by multiphysics simulations, we achieve an unprecedented understanding of the grafting mechanism involved in nitrobenzene diazonium electrografting and its impact on the resulting nanofilm composition. It is demonstrated that film growth arises from a competition between aryl and diazenyl radicals, leading to the incorporation of variable amounts of azo&#8208;bridged nitrophenyl units. By implementing control strategies using radical scavengers and redox inhibitors, corroborated by simulations, we show that diazenyl radicals are preferentially grafted at the substrate/film interface rather than within the film structure itself. Finally, we demonstrate that selective trapping of aryl radicals over diazenyl radicals enables the formation of azo&#8208;enriched films, thus opening the way for precise tuning of film composition and selective radical reactivity.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Thio&#8208;MacMillan Organocatalysts: Stereoselective Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions or Sacrificial Self&#8208;Cyclization to N&#8208;Bridged Bicyclic Lactams</title>

         <dc:description>
The study of the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of cinnamaldehyde and cyclopentadiene, catalyzed by chiral imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones, led to the discovery of a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective Michael&#8208;addition and consecutive ring closure. Here, the imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione not only catalytically activates cinnamaldehyde but also participates as the nucleophile to form a complex N&#8208;bridged bicyclic system, as elucidated by DFT calculations.








ABSTRACT
Chiral secondary amines in lactams are commonly used as chiral organocatalysts (MacMillan catalysts) in a broad range of transformations. The related thiolactam derivatives are less explored although possessing some significantly differing properties originating from the stereoelectronic characteristics of sulfur. In the present study, we present a streamlined synthesis and application of imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones from naturally abundant L&#8208;phenylalanine. Suitable substituents enable asymmetric Diels&#8211;Alder reactions with high enantioselectivity and yield. Here, we discovered the formation of a novel bicyclic thiolactam aldehyde motif in absence of the diene. The obtained hetero&#8208;bicycle, with four consecutive stereocenters, is formed in high yield and stereoselectivity from imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thione and two cinnamaldehyde units, whereas the first gen. MacMillan catalyst shows no reactivity. We propose a mechanism of formation which is supported by DFT calculations, revealing a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic factors for the observed selectivity. Our results demonstrate the surprising versatility of imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones, as this compound class can not only engage as a catalyst but can simultaneously participate as a reagent to form complex structures. The hetero&#8208;bicyclic skeleton is accessible in a single step and allows for facile structural modifications.

         <title>APE1 Activity is Controlled by Non&#8208;G&#8208;Quadruplex Conformations in Single&#8208; and Double&#8208;Stranded G&#8208;Quadruplex Constructs</title>

         <dc:description>
G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) folding in DNA is inhibitory to AP endonuclease, although the protein still binds well to G4s. Curiously, partially folded G&#8208;rich sequences, possibly transient hairpins, containing AP are very good substrates for cleavage by APE1. Herein, the enzyme activity and G4 folding are studied in single&#8208;stranded vs. duplex contexts.








ABSTRACT
Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease&#8208;1 (APE1) is a repair enzyme that efficiently cleaves abasic (AP) site damage in duplex DNA. Reports of in vitro activity assays between APE1 and single&#8208;stranded G&#8208;quadruplex (ssG4) reveal significant decreases in the endonuclease activity. Here, we identify that the low yields observed represent cleavage of the noncanonical folds that did not adopt a complete G4 fold. This conclusion is supported through circular dichroism analysis and activity assays analyzing the cleavage rate, folding impact on cleavage, and product inhibition. Studies were performed on AP&#8208;containing ssG4 and duplex&#8208;embedded G4 scaffolds. The CD spectra of a non&#8208;G4 containing potential quadruplex sequence reveal a noncanonical structure. APE1 can cleave an AP in these non&#8208;G4 conformation(s) in high yields comparable to the preferred duplex substrate. There is direct evidence of decreasing APE1 activity with increasing G4 folding in ssG4 and duplex&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;duplex (DGD) systems. Also observed is a positional dependency on yield in the non&#8208;G4 DGD scaffolds, but not in the non&#8208;G4 ssG4 scaffolds. In conclusion, our studies provide evidence that APE1 efficiently cleaves noncanonical conformations in G4&#8208;like structures, highlighting the control of secondary structure on APE1 endonuclease activity.

         <title>Photoinduced, Chemoselective &#947;&#8208;Alkylation of 2&#8208;Silyloxyfurans With &#945;&#8208;Bromoketones: A Rapid Entry to Chiral &#949;&#8208;Keto&#8208;&#947;&#8208;Butenolides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 5, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced, regio&#8208; and chemoselective &#947;&#8208;alkylation of 2&#8208;silyloxyfurans with a&#8208;bromoketones was achieved by exploiting a photoredox catalytic process promoted by blue light. This approach provides practical and efficient access to chiral, &#949;&#8208;ketobutenolides, in one step and high yields. The usefulness of these scaffolds as versatile platforms to access complex, heterobicyclic molecules via late&#8208;stage modifications was also demonstrated.








ABSTRACT
&#947;&#8208;Butenolides are widespread structural motifs found in many natural and unnatural products which display an impressive range of biological activities.

&lt;p&gt;A photoinduced, regio- and chemoselective &#947;-alkylation of 2-silyloxyfurans with a-bromoketones was achieved by exploiting a photoredox catalytic process promoted by blue light. This approach provides practical and efficient access to chiral, &#949;-ketobutenolides, in one step and high yields. The usefulness of these scaffolds as versatile platforms to access complex, heterobicyclic molecules via late-stage modifications was also demonstrated.

         <title>Synthesis of Fluorocycloparaphenylenes via Macrocyclic Pd Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 5, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorocycloparaphenylenes (F&#8208;CPPs) were synthesized through a novel approach involving the formation of macrocyclic palladium complexes. The thermally stable macrocyclic Pd complexes, followed by ligand exchange with Xantphos, afforded various F&#8208;CPPs incorporating tetrafluorophenylene, phenylene, or thienylene units. Optical measurements combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations revealed size&#8208; and structure&#8208;dependent absorption and emission properties.








ABSTRACT
Fluorocycloparaphenylenes (F&#8208;CPPs) are strained, cyclic, &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules with unique electronic and supramolecular properties. Here, we report a novel synthetic approach to create F&#8208;CPPs via the formation of macrocyclic palladium complexes that contain covalent Pd&#8211;C bonds. The thermal stability of the fluorinated biaryl Pd motifs and the reversibility of the formation of Pd&#8211;C bonds enable the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic Pd complexes. Subsequent ligand exchange with Xantphos facilitates reductive elimination, yielding various F&#8208;CPPs that incorporate tetrafluorophenylene, phenylene, or thienylene units. A structural analysis revealed that the thienylene&#8208;based F&#8208;CPPs adopt tubular packing structures due to their high fluorine content. Optical measurements and time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations demonstrated size&#8208; and structure&#8208;dependent absorption and emission behavior. This Pd&#8208;mediated synthetic strategy provides a new platform for the synthesis of functionalized CPPs with tailored properties for potential applications in nanomaterials and supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>A Riboflavin&#8208;Derived Flavinium Salt Mediates Chemoselective Methylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 32, Issue 5, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;component methylation protocol was developed, where the active flavin mediator can be recycled in a single step. Crystallographic data and NMR spectroscopy support the mechanistic proposal, while chemoselective methylation was observed for a broad range of biologically relevant substrates.








ABSTRACT
Selective methylation is among the most relevant transformations in synthetic chemistry and the discovery of new drug molecules. A methyl group is typically installed using strong electrophiles such as methyl iodide or dimethyl sulfate, which are associated with safety hazards and limited chemoselectivity. A promising strategy for circumventing these limitations relies on splitting the methylation into a two&#8208;step procedure under mediator control. However, such reactions, including the Mukaiyama redox condensation, currently lack applicability since the mediator is lost as organic waste, resulting in a low atom economy. We have developed a flavin&#8208;mediated methylation strategy with easily accessible methyl diphenylphosphinite (Ph2POMe) as the source of the methyl group. The flavin mediator is easily recovered by a simple acidic treatment followed by oxidation with air. Detailed NMR spectroscopic studies and structural information by X&#8208;ray crystallography paint a clear mechanistic picture, while we show the chemoselective modification of a variety of organic substrates and also demonstrate trideuteromethylation. Methylation is accomplished with complex molecules, including venetoclax and nevirapine. We envision the flavin&#8208;mediated methodology to be adaptable to other alkylation reactions besides methylation. Within the realm of the latter, chemoselective modification of nucleobases stands out as a promising target.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bridged Metal&#8208;Free Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Recent development in the field of organic luminescent materials has gained tremendous attention, particularly due to the materials which exhibit efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). The extensive research in the field has led to variety of metal&#8208;free pure organic systems exhibiting excellent performance such as high quantum yield, longer lifetime, and afterglow at ambient conditions. A wide range of strategies were developed to enhance the RTP efficiency, among which the incorporation of chalcogen atoms such as O, S, Se, and Te at bridging position in pure organic system has emerged as a promising strategy. The bridging of the chalcogens atoms not only facilitates the strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) and efficient intersystem crossing (ISC), but also provide more rigid molecular framework to reduce the nonradiative decay pathways and stabilizes the triplet excitons, resulting in RTP with higher quantum yield and longer lifetime. This review focuses on the development of bridged chalcogen&#8208;containing pure organic RTP materials with various strategies to achieve more efficient RTP and their applications. In particular, we discuss and compare a broad range of chalcogen containing organic phosphors, highlighting their structural differences and design strategies that affect the phosphorescence under ambient condition.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Carbon Nitride Copolymers: Enhanced Carrier Dynamics Toward Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridine rings were incorporated into carbon nitride via a Schiff base reaction, constructing a donor&#8208;acceptor configuration. This structure delocalizes the &#960;&#8208;conjugated charge distribution, generating an internal electric field that facilitates the dissociation and migration of photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.








ABSTRACT
Slow carrier dynamics is the primary impediment for graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) to realize its practical application in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In this work, we introduced pyridine groups into g&#8208;C3N4 via Schiff base reaction, targeting a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) system among g&#8208;C3N4 to promote the dissociation and migration of photogenerated charge and hole. The D&#8208;A system induced an internal electric field by delocalizing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated charge distribution. The optimized catalysts achieved an enhanced catalytic activity of 3058&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The main reason for this outperformance is attributed to the improved carrier dynamics resulting from the D&#8208;A system. In addition, multiple characterizations and DFT results indicate that the incorporation of pyridine rings could broaden the response range of visible light and selectively break hydrogen bonds to lower the barrier for charge transfer. This work confirms the structure and interaction in intramolecular framework and provides a facile way to accelerate photogenerated carriers&#8217; migration in g&#8208;C3N4.

         <title>Noncatalytic [2+2] Cycloaddition Providing Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type 2&#8208;Azetines Featuring the 2&#8208;Aminophenyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;abundant terminal alkynes did not require a catalyst for the [2+2] cycloaddition with 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;((methylsulfonyl)imino)propanoate [CF3C(=NMs)CO2Et] affording the isolable 2&#8208;azetines. The 2&#8208;azetines involving the pyramidalized flanking amino group in the donor&#8208;Aryl&#8208;acceptor system show blue fluorescence. We also found that the [2+2] cycloaddition using the azole&#8208;substituted terminal phenylacetylenes accompanied no byproducts.








ABSTRACT
In contrast to the previously reported TiCl4&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] synthesis of 2&#8208;azetines using internal alkynes and ethyl 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;((methylsulfonyl)imino)propanoate [CF3C(&#9552;NMs)CO2Et], electron&#8208;abundant terminal alkynes do not necessarily require a catalyst for the [2+2] cycloaddition process. In this study, we demonstrate that the 2&#8208;azetines, which were produced by using 2&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines (ArC&#8801;CH, Ar = 2&#8208;R2NC6H4, R = alkyl), showed blue fluorescence (&#934; = 4&#8764;9%). The structural elucidation, using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, of the fluorescent 2&#8208;azetines involved the pyramidalized flanking amino groups, as steric congestion prevented conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugation between the amino and phenylene units. It is noteworthy that the C&#9552;C unit in the 2&#8208;azetine cycle plays a crucial role in the fluorescent character, and saturation of the double bond afforded the nonfluorescent azetidine derivative. Thus, the combination of the electron&#8208;donating pyramidal amino group and the electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;molecular skeleton, including the appropriate bridging aryl spacer, is a promising molecular design for developing unique photo&#8208;functional N&#8208;heterocyclic materials. In addition, to investigate the o&#8208;aminophenyl effect on the 2&#8208;azetine framework, we employed the azole&#8208;substituted phenylacetylenes for the [2+2] cycloaddition. 2&#8208;(N&#8208;Pyrrolyl) and 2&#8208;(N&#8208;indolyl)phenylacetylenes facilitated the [2+2] cycloaddition process predominantly and afforded the corresponding 2&#8208;azetines exclusively, whereas the [2+2] synthesis reported so far included the byproducts.

         <title>Ambident Reactivity in the Phenyl + NO Radical Recombination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ABSTRACT
The recombination reaction of nitric oxide (NO) with radicals via its oxygen atom, rather than the more common nitrogen site, offers an intriguing pathway to the formation of oxynitrenes. The photochemical isomerization of nitroso compounds into their corresponding oxynitrenes may involve such a step. However, because this reaction typically proceeds under continuous irradiation, the formation mechanism has so far remained obscure. In this work, we investigate the recombination of the phenyl radical with NO strictly under thermal conditions, using infrared (IR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. A proximal radical pair is generated in a solid argon matrix by photolysis of nitrosobenzene at 254&#160;nm. Upon annealing the matrix to 30 K, the radicals undergo a thermal reaction that yields both nitrosobenzene and phenoxynitrene, notably in comparable amounts. NEVPT2 computations show that phenoxynitrene forms on the 1&#8208;1A&#8242; singlet surface, intersecting the 1&#8208;3A&#8242;&#8242; triplet ground state 1.0&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8722;1 below the separated reactants. At this crossing point, a substantial spin&#8211;orbit coupling (55 cm&#8722;1) enables two&#8208;state reactivity, thereby illuminating the mechanism behind this elusive transformation.

         <title>Ion&#8211;Molecule Reaction Products as Probes and Precursors for Preparative Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion&#8211;molecule reactions in the gas phase of mass spectrometers are important for preparative mass spectrometry because they (1) provide knowledge about the intrinsic reactivity of ions, helping to predict and control their reactivity at interfaces, and (2) generate new complex ions that can be mass selected and deposited on surfaces.








ABSTRACT
The investigation of ion&#8211;molecule reactions in mass spectrometers (i.e., bond formation between a reactive gaseous ion and a neutral reagent) is a well&#8208;established method for analyzing fundamental ion reactivity. However, the potential of such reactions to generate new ions used in preparative mass spectrometry has only recently come into focus. This concept article highlights the dual significance of ion&#8211;molecule reaction products in preparative mass spectrometry: First, they provide valuable insights into the intrinsic reactivity and selectivity of reactive ions in the gas phase, forming the foundation of their reactions at molecular interfaces during ion deposition. Second, the gaseous products themselves can be deposited as mass&#8208;selected building blocks for synthesizing thin films and functional materials. Herein, we discuss opportunities and challenges involved in translating knowledge from the gas&#8208;phase chemistry of reactive ions to interface reactivity. This includes considerations such as the comparability of reaction partners, changes in the nature of ions upon deposition, the emergence of new reaction pathways in condensed phases, and orientation effects at interfaces. A mechanistic understanding of the gas&#8208;phase reactions of reactive ions, as well as the mass&#8208;selected deposition of their products, is opening up new possibilities in surface functionalization and thin&#8208;layer synthesis.

         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8211;boron&#8211;nitrogen (NBN)&#8208;substituted molecular propellers are presented as structural framework for aggregation induced emission (AIE) applications. Steric hindrance is revealed to steer maximum&#8208;AIE behavior, leading to refined control over assembly&#8208;induced luminescence.








ABSTRACT
The phenomenon of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) serves as a promising tool to harness and boost emission properties in luminescent materials. Here, we report nitrogen&#8211;boron&#8211;nitrogen (NBN)&#8208;substituted molecular propellers with different degrees of steric hindrance. Photoluminescence measurements demonstrated that each compound presents AIE behavior in THF/water mixtures, where the less sterically hindered derivative was characterized by higher emission enhancement due to a more pronounced restriction of intramolecular rotations (RIR). A less common maximum behavior was observed upon further addition of water, and this became more pronounced for the more hindered derivative driven by stronger intermolecular electronic effects. Steric hindrance thus serves as an effective design tool to enhance maximum AIE behavior in molecular propellers and gain more precise solvent control.

         <title>Mono(Silylene)&#8208;Stabilized Borylenes for Small Molecule Activation</title>

Quantum chemical calculations suggest the viability of silylene&#8208;stabilized borylenes in small molecule activation.








ABSTRACT
Although base&#8208;stabilized borylenes are now a decade&#8208;old concept, the number of experimentally isolable mono(Lewis base)&#8208;stabilized borylenes is scarce. In this work, we have designed a few mono(Lewis base)&#8208;stabilized borylenes with silylenes as the Lewis base. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the designed systems possess appreciable donor and acceptor properties that motivated us to investigate their potential toward the splitting of enthalpically strong E&#8211;H bonds (E = H, CH3, NHPh) as well as binding of CO and N2. All the activation and the binding processes by the proposed borylenes were found to possess either better or comparable activation barriers compared to that obtained for cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene&#8208;stabilized borylene.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Substituted Molecular Rotors as Polarity and Viscosity Sensors for Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Fibril Formation and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the chalcogen&#8208;substituted chromone&#8208;based fluorescent rotors (O, S, Se, Te) showing tunable charge transfer, strong solvatochromism, viscosity&#8208;sensitive fluorescence, and red&#8208;shifted emission with high quantum yields in viscous media. The dyes are stable, bright, and useful for the amyloid fibril detection and cellular microviscosity imaging.








ABSTRACT
Fluorescent molecular rotors (FMRs) sense their local environment by coupling emission to intramolecular rotation and twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT). Here we introduce a compact chromone&#8208;based donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor platform in which the acceptor is systematically chalcogen&#8208;substituted from O &#8594; S &#8594; Se &#8594; Te. This simple, isostructural series allows us to isolate the effect of chalcogen variation on ICT/TICT processes without changing the molecular framework. Steady&#8208;state spectroscopy and DFT reveal progressively narrowed HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and strengthened charge&#8208;transfer character across the series, consistent with heavier&#8208;chalcogen polarizability. The dyes exhibit strong solvatochromism and function as viscosity&#8208;sensitive probes: their emission intensity increases steadily with higher glycerol content, following the F&#246;rster&#8211;Hoffmann relationship. They also show a large increase in brightness from water to glycerol and have high quantum yields in viscous media. The probes are chemically robust against common interferents and pH within biologically relevant ranges. By exploiting rotor immobilization, the dye series exhibits strong, time&#8208;dependent fluorescence upon binding to amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;1&#8211;42) fibrils, comparable to Thioflavin T but with a red&#8208;shifted emission. In live HeLa cells the rotors are cell&#8208;permeable and biocompatible, yielding bright organelle labeling and reporting microviscosity changes induced by ionophore or lipid&#8208;loading treatments. Collectively, this study establishes chalcogen&#8208;substituted chromone rotors as a tunable, dual&#8208;function platform for polarity/viscosity mapping and amyloid detection and provides clear structure&#8211;property rules across the O/S/Se/Te series that can guide next&#8208;generation FMR design.

         <title>Catalytic Amyloids: Turning Fibrils Into Biocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloids, traditionally associated with diseases, have emerged as versatile catalytic scaffolds. From natural amyloid sequences to bioinspired and de novo designs, we highlight strategies to construct catalytic active sites and anchor enzymes onto fibrils, creating versatile nanomaterials with tunable activities.








ABSTRACT
Amyloids have been regarded as the pathological entities behind neurodegenerative diseases for a long time. The discovery that they also play physiological roles together with their ability to form stable and ordered scaffolds opened the door for their applications in different fields. In this context, catalytic amyloids have emerged as a new class of nanomaterials, merging the efficiency of enzymes with the robustness of heterogeneous catalysts. Indeed, these systems exploit the self&#8208;assembly properties of amyloids while mimicking enzymatic functions by exposing catalytic moieties on their surface. In this review, we first provide an overview of the structural and functional properties of natural amyloids and their application in nanotechnology. Then, we survey the current state of art in the development of catalytic amyloids, based on bioinspired or de novo designed sequences. In both cases, the incorporation of specific functional groups provides the fibrils with catalytic functions. Finally, we illustrate the use of amyloid fibrils as platforms for enzyme immobilization. All the selected examples highlight the power of bridging amyloid structures and catalytic activities to shape innovative nanomaterials toward demanding needs.

         <title>Synthesis, Physicochemical Properties, and Computational Analysis of Tris(fluoromethyl)Alkyl Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(fluoromethyl)alkyl (TFTB&#8208;substituted) building blocks (including homologous amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, and bromides) were prepared from commercially available starting materials. Experimental physicochemical parametrization and computational analysis revealed the resemblance of TFTB with CF3/CF3CH2 groups, providing further rationale into its possible applications in drug discovery.








ABSTRACT
A concise and scalable synthesis of tris(fluoromethyl)alkyl&#8208;building blocks (including amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, and bromides) starting from commercially available 3,3&#8208;bis(bromomethyl)oxetane is reported. Comprehensive physicochemical profiling of the corresponding amines and carboxylic acids (by measuring their pKa and LogP values), benchmarked against less fluorinated and nonfluorinated counterparts, showed that the tris(fluoromethyl)methyl (&#946;,&#946;&#8242;,&#946;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;trifluro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl, (FCH2)3C, TFTB) group mimics the electronic and polarity&#8208;modulating properties of CF3 and CF3CH2 substituents despite substantially larger steric volume. Conformational analysis shows that the (FCH2)3C group adopts a restricted set of low&#8208;energy conformations governed by through&#8208;space electrostatic interactions, with C&#9552;O&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#9472;C and C&#9472;F&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#9472;C contacts playing a crucial stabilizing role. Molecular electrostatic potential analysis rationalizes both the anomalous lipophilicity trends and the CF3&#8208;like polarity modulation of this group. Together, these data confirm the TFTB group as a valuable motif for isosteric replacement in drug design.

         <title>Benzoselenadiazole&#8208;based Photosensitizers: Effect of Substituent Position on the Electrochemical, Photophysical, and Photochemical Properties</title>

Tunable donor&#8211;acceptor benzoselenadiazole photosensitizers show efficient singlet oxygen generation and strong visible&#8208;light photocatalytic activity.








ABSTRACT
Selenium&#8208;containing photosensitizers are attracting growing attention for optoelectronic and biomedical applications due to their distinctive redox and photophysical characteristics. Herein, we present a series of novel donor&#8211;acceptor benzoselenadiazole derivatives synthesized via Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig and Ullmann&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Fine&#8208;tuning of the substitution pattern on the benzoselenadiazole core leads to distinct positive solvatochromism, reflecting strong intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer character. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited efficient singlet oxygen (1O2) generation, with generation quantum yield values (&#934;&#916;) of up to 0.74. Their photocatalytic activity was further demonstrated through the visible light&#8208;driven oxidation of 2&#8208;furoic acid, achieving complete conversion within four hours at a catalyst loading of just 0.05 mol%. The results highlight the potential of benzoselenadiazole&#8208;based chromophores as multifunctional materials for light&#8208;driven applications in photocatalysis, and as promising scaffolds for the future design of photosensitizers.

         <title>Breaking the Si/Al Ratio&#8208;Solid Yield Limitation in Hierarchical Nanosized Beta Zeolite Synthesis Enables One&#8208;Step Catalytic Conversion of Lactic Acid to Lactide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple spirocyclic ammoniums enable the alkali&#8208; and fluorine&#8208;free synthesis of nanosized beta zeolites (10&#8211;20&#160;nm) with high yields (&gt;&#160;90%) and tunable Si/Al ratios (10&#8211;70). Featuring hierarchical pores, high surface area, and abundant external active sites, the obtained zeolites exhibit superior catalytic performance in lactic acid&#8208;to&#8208;lactide conversion (83.6% yield with high selectivity).








ABSTRACT
Efforts in zeolite crystal engineering have largely focused on nanosized materials, aiming to enhance mass transport and accessible active sites. For beta zeolite, however, this is often hindered by the intrinsic Si/Al ratio (SAR)&#8208;solid yield trade&#8208;off. Here, we report the synthesis of nanosized beta zeolites, with uniform dimensions of 10&#8211;20&#160;nm, a broad SAR of 10&#8211;70, and excellent solid yields of &gt;&#160;90% under alkali&#8208; and fluorine&#8208;free conditions. These are achieved by using a family of spirocyclic quaternary ammonium salts as organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs), readily prepared via a simple nucleophilic reaction with commercial precursors. The resulting beta zeolites feature not only hierarchical porosity with a high surface area of &#8764;829&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1 but also abundant external active sites, which enable superior catalytic performance over commercial beta zeolites in the one&#8208;step conversion of lactic acid to lactide, affording 83.6% yield with excellent L&#8208;isomer selectivity. These results demonstrate the unique capability of spirocyclic ammonium OSDAs, opening a new strategy for synthesizing nanosized beta zeolites with simultaneously designed SAR and high yields.

Featuring hierarchical pores, high surface area, and abundant external active sites, the obtained zeolites exhibit superior catalytic performance in lactic acid-to-lactide conversion (83.6% yield with high selectivity).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts in zeolite crystal engineering have largely focused on nanosized materials, aiming to enhance mass transport and accessible active sites. For beta zeolite, however, this is often hindered by the intrinsic Si/Al ratio (SAR)-solid yield trade-off. Here, we report the synthesis of nanosized beta zeolites, with uniform dimensions of 10&#8211;20&#160;nm, a broad SAR of 10&#8211;70, and excellent solid yields of &amp;gt;&#160;90% under alkali- and fluorine-free conditions. These are achieved by using a family of spirocyclic quaternary ammonium salts as organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs), readily prepared via a simple nucleophilic reaction with commercial precursors. The resulting beta zeolites feature not only hierarchical porosity with a high surface area of &#8764;829&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; but also abundant external active sites, which enable superior catalytic performance over commercial beta zeolites in the one-step conversion of lactic acid to lactide, affording 83.6% yield with excellent L-isomer selectivity. These results demonstrate the unique capability of spirocyclic ammonium OSDAs, opening a new strategy for synthesizing nanosized beta zeolites with simultaneously designed SAR and high yields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Induced Luminescence in Crystalline Porous Materials: Material System, Optical Behavior, and Structure&#8208;Property Correlations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically analyzes pressure&#8208;induced luminescence in three crystalline porous materials (MOFs, COFs, HOFs). By correlating their structural architectures with optical behavior under compression, it clarifies key structure&#8208;property relationships. The findings offer a design blueprint for next&#8208;generation piezochromic materials with tailored functionalities.








ABSTRACT
Pressure&#8208;induced luminescence (PIL), activated through diamond anvil cell (DAC) techniques, has emerged as a vibrant research frontier with promising applications in sensing, data storage, and optoelectronics. Crystalline porous materials (CPMs), encompassing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), offer a uniquely versatile platform for studying and engineering this phenomenon. Their inherent characteristics&#8212;modular design, tunable topology, structural flexibility, and well&#8208;defined porosity&#8212;enable not only reversible and highly tunable piezochromic luminescence but also provide critical insights into fundamental structure&#8208;property relationships under mechanical stress. This review systematically consolidates recent advancements in the PIL of CPMs. We first establish the operational principles of the DAC as the principal pressure&#8208;generating tool. We then categorize and analyze PIL behaviors across the three major CPM families, elucidating how intrinsic factors&#8212;bonding nature (coordinative, covalent, or hydrogen&#8208;bonding), framework dimensionality, ligand chromophores, metal&#8208;node electronics, guest&#8208;framework interactions, and mechanical flexibility&#8212;govern optical responses to hydrostatic pressure generated by a DAC. Key paradigms, including reversible piezochromism, pressure&#8208;induced emission enhancement (PIEE), emission quenching, and ambient&#8208;retained luminescence, are discussed with representative studies. A dedicated comparative analysis synthesizes design principles and performance trade&#8208;offs across material systems. Finally, current challenges and perspectives are outlined to provide guidance for developing efficient, controllable, and multifunctional piezochromic materials with promising applications in advanced photonic technologies.

         <title>Harnessing Toluene Solvent as a Reactant: Regioselective Benzyl Radical Addition to Multi&#8208;&#960; 1,5&#8208;Enynes in a Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade to Indenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component radical cascade of 1,5&#8208;enynes with toluene and benzoic acids enables regioselective benzyl radical addition to multi&#8208;&#928; systems, efficiently delivering polysubstituted indenes from an abundant solvent feedstock.








ABSTRACT
C&#9472;H activation of toluene generates a benzyl radical that undergoes C&#9472;C coupling, converting an abundant solvent into carbon building blocks. A major challenge, however, is to direct the highly reactive benzyl radical to add regioselectively to a multi&#8208;&#960; system in a way that initiates a cascade leading to complex products. Here, we achieved this goal for the first time, to our knowledge, and demonstrated that polysubstituted indene derivatives can be efficiently obtained through a three&#8208;component cascade radical cyclization of 1,5&#8208;enynes with toluene solvent and benzoic acids in the presence of a copper catalyst and TBHP oxidant. Notably, the same indene products were also obtained when aldehydes were used in place of benzoic acids. Our combined experimental and computational investigations fully elucidated the reaction mechanism, showing that it proceeds through a Cu(I/II/III) redox cycle. This study further revealed that benzyl radicals are generated at the outset of the reaction but are highly reactive and prone to deactivation unless they undergo rapid and regioselective addition to the multi&#8208;&#960; system. We show that these requirements are satisfied only when both terminal carbons of the alkene moiety in the 1,5&#8208;enyne bear strong electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents such as CN or CO2Me.

         <title>Fog Harvesting Devices Inspired from Single to Multiple Creatures: Current Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature's evolutionary processes have equipped organisms with complex structures to thrive in harsh environments. This study examines their structural characteristics and fog&#8208;collection mechanisms, utilizing interfacial tension theory to uncover key principles, while reviewing advancements in bio&#8208;inspired surfaces. By addressing current challenges and suggesting future directions, it seeks to advance the practical implementation of next&#8208;generation fog&#8208;collection systems.








ABSTRACT
Nature showcases extraordinary wisdom through the creation of diverse species, with plants and animals evolving complex adaptive structures to survive in extreme environments. In today's world, where global water resources are increasingly scarce, finding innovative technologies for effective water collection has become an urgent challenge. Fog collection, proven effective in arid and foggy regions, is receiving widespread attention. In particular, biomimetic surfaces, which mimic the fog collection mechanisms found in nature&#8212;such as spider silk, desert beetles, and cacti&#8212;show immense potential. This study delves into these natural prototypes, uncovering their microstructures and the scientific principles behind their fog collection abilities. Using the theory of interfacial tension, the paper provides a comprehensive explanation of their fog collection mechanisms. Additionally, the article reviews the latest advancements in the manufacturing techniques for biomimetic surfaces and fog collection devices, offering a detailed comparison between single&#8208;surface and multi&#8208;surface designs in terms of performance. Finally, the paper evaluates the current challenges faced in this field and envisions the future development of this technology, aiming to drive the practical application of next&#8208;generation fog collection devices and address the global water crisis.

SEIE transforms stochastic bacterial collisions into quantitative readouts of counting, metabolism, and secretion. This concept outlines the governing impact physics, mediator&#8208;gated metabolic access, and secretion&#8208;resolved strategies that together define the current analytical landscape.








ABSTRACT
Single&#8208;bacterium analysis is increasingly important because population&#8208;averaged assays can obscure functional heterogeneity that governs pathogenicity, metabolic adaptation, and treatment response. Single&#8208;entity impact electrochemistry (SEIE) provides a complementary measurement paradigm by recording discrete current transients when individual cells stochastically collide with a polarized ultramicroelectrode. The resulting waveform observables (event frequency, charge, duration, and polarity) form a quantitative language that links near&#8208;electrode transport, cell&#8211;electrode contact physics, and engineered electrochemical reporting mechanisms to biological state. In this concept, we present a mechanism&#8208;guided view of SEIE for bacterial analysis, organized by increasing analytical depth: (i) bacterial counting framed explicitly as impact physics, where waveform families, electrode bias, and transport regimes determine calibration and interpretability; (ii) exogenous redox mediators as selectors that define metabolic access points and transient signatures for single&#8208;cell electron&#8208;transfer metrology; and (iii) secretion&#8208;resolved SEIE using endogenous reporters or engineered transducers to interrogate native metabolic outputs, stress responses, and interspecies interactions. We conclude by outlining key challenges and opportunities for translation, including operation in complex media, antifouling, and standardization, higher&#8208;throughput platforms, multimodal integration, and automated waveform analysis for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production via Simultaneous Reduction and Oxidation Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important chemical substance and also a promising carbon&#8208;free clean fuel. The design of a sophisticated photoelectrochemical (PEC) reaction system enables the solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production through simultaneous water oxidation and oxygen reduction processes (H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells). This review focuses on the H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells that can achieve Faraday efficiencies exceeding 100% for H2O2, emphasizing the relationship between electrode material properties and cell performances.








ABSTRACT
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an essential substance in chemistry and chemical industry, while being a clean fuel. Currently, research into green and sustainable processes for producing H2O2 is progressing rapidly, with the aim of replacing the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process used in industrial production. Among them, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) method is one that has attracted much attention, because it allows for the solar&#8208;driven production of H2O2 from only water and oxygen. Furthermore, highly designed PEC cells enable the simultaneous production of H2O2 at the anode and cathode (H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells). This review article focuses on the H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells having the potential to achieve a Faraday efficiency (&#951;) exceeding 100% for H2O2, with an emphasis on the relationship between electrode materials properties and cell performances. The H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells can be classified into two types: one involving water oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction (WOR/ORR), and a more recently developed type involving oxygen reduction reaction at both electrodes (ORR/ORR). Based on the fundamental principles of the H2O2/H2O2&#8208;PEC cells, we discussed the electrode material design, and then review some cutting&#8208;edge research on the WOR/ORR&#8208; and ORR/ORR&#8208;PEC cells. Finally, we summarize the conclusions, and outline challenges and perspectives in this hot topic.

&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an important chemical substance and also a promising carbon-free clean fuel. The design of a sophisticated photoelectrochemical (PEC) reaction system enables the solar-driven H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production through simultaneous water oxidation and oxygen reduction processes (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PEC cells).

         <title>Tetrametallic Terbium/Europium Fluorenylphosphonate With Excellent X&#8208;Ray Scintillating and Photo&#8208;Induced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetranuclear lanthanide fluorenylphosphonate clusters Eu4 and Tb4, together with chemically mixed Eu/Tb analogues (c&#8208;EuxTb4&#8722;x, where x&#160;=&#160;2.67, 2, 1.33) and physically mixed Eu/Tb materials (p&#8208;yEu4:zTb4, with y:z&#160;=&#160;2:1, 1:1, 1:2), were successfully synthesized. Eu4 and Tb4 exhibit exceptional X&#8208;ray scintillation performance. The luminescence of both c&#8208;EuxTb4&#8722;x and p&#8208;yEu4:zTb4 can be effectively modulated by precisely&#8208;tuning the Eu3+:Tb3+ stoichiometric ratios.








ABSTRACT
This work reports two lanthanide clusters, [Ln4(RPO3)2(RPO3H)(tBuCO2)7(tBuCO2H)3(H2O)3] (Ln&#160;=&#160;Eu, Tb; RPO3H2 denotes (9&#8208;methyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phosphonic acid). A comprehensive series of characterizations was performed for the Eu4 and Tb4 clusters, including X&#8208;ray crystallography, X&#8208;ray scintillation, and photoluminescence spectroscopy, to elucidate their structural features and physicochemical properties. Notably, these clusters exhibit exceptional X&#8208;ray scintillation performance, attributed to the characteristic luminescence of Ln3+ ions. This finding paves the way for the development of novel scintillator materials and enriches the family of lanthanide&#8208;bearing clusters with X&#8208;ray scintillating properties. Furthermore, photoluminescence modulation was achieved for the chemically mixed Eu/Tb analogues, c&#8208;EuxTb4&#8208;x (x&#160;=&#160;2.67, 2, 1.33), and physically mixed Eu4/Tb4 materials, p&#8208;yEu4:zTb4 (y:z&#160;=&#160;2:1, 1:1, 1:2), with varying the excitation wavelength. Notably, near&#8208;white&#8208;light emission is realized for p&#8208;Eu4:2Tb4 upon excitation at 365&#160;nm. Collectively, these tetranuclear lanthanide phosphonates exhibit excitation&#8208;wavelength and Eu3+:Tb3+ ratio dependent luminescence, indicating their potential as color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials and white&#8208;light&#8208;emitters.

         <title>Simple Access to a Series of Higher Substituted Pentafluoroorthotellurate&#8208;Based Silanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pentafluoroorthotellurate ligand was introduced to organo silanes. A variety of silanes with the formular RxSi(OTeF5)4&#8211;x were synthesized and characterized via spectroscopic techniques and sc&#8208;XRD. The influence of the number of OTeF5 groups on structural properties as well as the fluoride ion affinities (FIA) has been studied and compared to other silanes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents.








ABSTRACT
The preparation and characterization of RxR&#8242;ySiOTeF5 (R&#160;= Me, Et, iPr, Ph; x&#160;= 3, y&#160;= 0; R&#160;= Pr, tBu, R&#8242;&#160;= Me; x&#160;= 1, y&#160;= 2; 1a&#8208;1f), R2Si(OTeF5)2 (R&#160;= Me, Et, iPr, Ph; 2a&#8208;2d) and RSi(OTeF5)3 (R&#160;= Me, Et, tBu, Ph; 3a&#8208;3d) by reaction of the corresponding chlorosilane and an OTeF5 transfer reagent is presented. Molecular structures in the solid state were obtained for Ph3SiOTeF5 (1f), Ph2Si(OTeF5)2 (2d) and tBuSi(OTeF5)3 (3c). Furthermore, the Lewis acidity was assessed by calculating the fluoride ion affinity (FIA), leading to the observation that a higher number of pentafluoroorthotellurate groups results in an increased FIA.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Route for Covalent Cellulose Fiber Dyeing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a proof of concept for a chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach to the covalent dyeing of cotton fibers. Laccase/TEMPO oxidation introduces aldehyde groups, enabling subsequent reductive amination with amino dyes. Excellent color homogeneity and wash fastness were demonstrated using acid red 33, highlighting the robustness of the approach and its potential relevance for dyeing applications.








ABSTRACT
The conventional textile dyeing process, based on reactive dyes, allows covalent dye fixation but requires toxic or hazardous chemicals that raise significant environmental pollution and health concerns. In this study, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, two&#8208;step chemo&#8208;enzymatic process for grafting aminated dyes onto cotton surfaces. Our aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of covalent dye attachment, while noting that full sustainability has yet to be achieved. First, cotton fibers are oxidized using the laccase/TEMPO system to introduce carbonyl groups, which then react with the amino group of dyes to form C&#8208;N bond through reductive amination. Reductive amination of laccase&#8208;oxidized cotton threads was achieved with rhodamine 123 and acid red 33. Covalent dyeing was evidenced by LC&#8208;MS analyses of hydrolysates obtained after cellulase action. The process was successfully transferred to cotton fabrics, and acid red 33 showed excellent color uniformity and fastness. By comparing results with different dyes (acid red 266, acid violet 19, acid black 41, and acid blue 25), useful criteria to guide dye design were identified. Our study presents a chemo&#8208;enzymatic approach to covalent cotton dyeing and offers insights into the future development of dyes.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents a proof of concept for a chemo-enzymatic approach to the covalent dyeing of cotton fibers. Laccase/TEMPO oxidation introduces aldehyde groups, enabling subsequent reductive amination with amino dyes. Excellent color homogeneity and wash fastness were demonstrated using acid red 33, highlighting the robustness of the approach and its potential relevance for dyeing applications.

&lt;p&gt;The conventional textile dyeing process, based on reactive dyes, allows covalent dye fixation but requires toxic or hazardous chemicals that raise significant environmental pollution and health concerns. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept, two-step chemo-enzymatic process for grafting aminated dyes onto cotton surfaces. Our aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of covalent dye attachment, while noting that full sustainability has yet to be achieved. First, cotton fibers are oxidized using the laccase/TEMPO system to introduce carbonyl groups, which then react with the amino group of dyes to form C-N bond through reductive amination. Reductive amination of laccase-oxidized cotton threads was achieved with rhodamine 123 and acid red 33. Covalent dyeing was evidenced by LC-MS analyses of hydrolysates obtained after cellulase action. The process was successfully transferred to cotton fabrics, and acid red 33 showed excellent color uniformity and fastness. By comparing results with different dyes (acid red 266, acid violet 19, acid black 41, and acid blue 25), useful criteria to guide dye design were identified. Our study presents a chemo-enzymatic approach to covalent cotton dyeing and offers insights into the future development of dyes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programming the Optoelectronic Properties of Atomically Precise Gold Nanoclusters Using the Conformational Landscape of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ABSTRACT
The rational design of hybrid nanomaterials with precisely controlled properties remains a central challenge in materials science. While atomically precise gold nanoclusters (Au&#8208;NCs) offer molecule&#8208;like control over a metallic core, tuning their optoelectronic behavior via surface engineering is often empirically driven. Here, we establish a design principle by demonstrating that the conformational landscape of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) can be used as a programmable scaffold to rationally modulate the photophysical properties of a covalently bound Au&#8208;NC. We synthesized a series of bioconjugates between Au25 nanoclusters and bioengineered IDPs containing a variable number of cysteine anchoring points. A combination of mass spectrometry, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and modeling on the conjugates indicates that increasing the number of covalent anchors systematically restricts the conformational ensemble, inducing a progressively more compact protein shell around nanoclusters. This structural rigidification at the interface directly translates into a 15&#8208;fold enhancement of the Au&#8208;NC near&#8208;infrared photoluminescence and a six&#8208;fold increase in its average lifetime. Our findings demonstrate that the conformational plasticity of IDPs and the capacity to engineer them can be harnessed as a molecular tuning knob, moving to a new regime of programmable soft&#8208;matter control over the properties of quantum&#8208;confined nanomaterials for tailored biotechnological applications.

         <title>Isocyanide Incorporation Expands the Anticancer Potential of Diiron(I) Aminocarbyne Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile incorporation of cyclohexyl and 4&#8208;methoxyphenyl isocyanides into diiron aminocarbyne complexes generates amphiphilic, aqueous&#8208;stable structures. The compounds exhibit potent cytotoxicity across a panel of cancer cell lines in both 2D and 3D models, with NTERA&#8208;2 cells being particularly sensitive, while retaining significant selectivity for malignant over normal cells.








ABSTRACT
Diiron(I) bis&#8208;cyclopentadienyl complexes with a bridging aminocarbyne ligand feature an organometallic scaffold with established anticancer potential. Aiming to expand the structure&#8208;activity relationships, seven new compounds were synthesized by incorporating isocyanide ligands: [Fe2Cp2(CO)(CNFc)(&#956;&#8208;CO){&#956;&#8208;CNMe(R)}]CF3SO3 (Fc&#160;= [Fe(Cp)(&#951;5&#8208;C5H4)], R&#160;= Me, 2a; cyclohexyl&#160;= Cy, 2b; p&#8208;methoxyphenyl&#160;= Anis, 2c; Cp&#160;= &#951;5&#8208;C5H5) and [Fe2Cp2(CO)x(CNR&#8242;)(1&#8208;x)(&#956;&#8208;CO){&#956;&#8208;CNMe(R)}]CF3SO3 (R&#160;= Cy, R&#8242;&#160;= Anis, x&#160;= 1, 3b or x&#160;= 2, 4b; R&#160;= Anis, R&#8242;&#160;= Cy, x&#160;= 1, 3c or x&#160;= 2, 4c). The products were isolated in 70%&#8211;85% yields and characterized by IR, NMR spectroscopy, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in one representative case. They display submillimolar water solubility, amphiphilic or moderately lipophilic character, and remarkable inertness in physiological&#8208;like solutions. While the ferrocenyl derivatives 2a&#8211;c exhibited only modest activity, 3 and 4 displayed potent cytotoxicity across a panel of six cancer cell lines, with IC50 values in the low micromolar range in most cases and in the nanomolar range for the NTERA&#8208;2 testis cell line. Moreover, 3b&#8211;c showed significant selectivity toward cancer cells and, along with 4b&#8211;c, retained a remarkable cytotoxic effect in 3D cell spheroids. Complexes 3b&#8211;c were effective in targeting cellular TrxR and increasing cellular ROS production.

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Structure and ROS Generation of BiOCl via Salt&#8208;Mediated Precipitation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple precipitation of the BiOCl photocatalyst in a presence of different metal and metalloid salts result in a broad range of effects on its final properties. Crystal growth, facet exposition, spontaneous formation of substitutional defects, deposition of surface species, optical properties, and ability for the photocatalytic reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were all affected, many of them being described for the first time.








ABSTRACT
Herein, we investigated how the introduction of different metal salts during the synthesis of bismuth oxychloride affects its electronic structure, revealing that the nature of the metal salt plays a key role in determining the resulting&#160; properties. Several species (Mo, Se, W, V, Ti, Mn, Hg, and Pb) were added to affect the precipitation of the BiOCl photocatalysts. Prepared samples were investigated concerning their crystal structure, elemental composition, morphology, surface area, and optical properties, which were discussed considering possible effects of Bi substitution from the density functional theory calculations. Ti and Hg influence only the crystal growth and morphology. Mo, W, and V, as metallates, shift the absorption to the visible region, but the resulting photocatalytic activity was hindered. Pb2+ and Mn2+ ions substitute for Bi, acting as acceptor defects. Moreover, MnCl2 lead to significant crystal growth and formation of well&#8208;defined {100}, {110}, {101}, and {111} facets. The BiOCl:Mn sample shows increased activity, connected with conduction band (CB) shift and enhanced O2 reduction to &#8729;O2&#8722;. Introduction of SeO32&#8722;&#160;deposits Se4+/S0 species on the surface, leading to the formation of smaller, well&#8208;defined rectangular BiOCl crystals. Surface selenium&#160;acts as electron traps, increasing the charge carriers lifetime and promoting 2&#8208;electron reduction of O2 to H2O2.

         <title>Surficial N+ Charge Density as Key Factor for Inhibition of Pseudomonas Biofilm Formation in Non&#8208;Leaching Quaternary Ammonium&#8208;Modified Polydimethylsiloxane Coatings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological fouling threatens marine ecosystems and infrastructures, demanding sustainable solutions. We designed PDMS materials functionalized with quaternary ammonium&#8208;based silanes that inhibit biofilm formation of a highly resilient Gram&#8208;negative Pseudomonas strain. A critical surface charge threshold was identified beyond which adhesion is suppressed. This strategy offers durable and environmentally friendly protection.








ABSTRACT
Marine biofouling represents significant environmental and economic concerns, highlighting the need for sustainable and non&#8208;leaching antifouling materials. In this work, we developed cross&#8208;linked polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coatings functionalized with methyldimethoxysilanes bearing quaternary ammonium groups and alkyl side chains of two different lengths (C8 and C12). 29Si and 13C solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (CP&#8208;MAS NMR) and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the successful incorporation of silanes into the polymer matrix. Surface analysis was carried out by fluorescein assay, surface roughness, and contact angle measurements. Antifouling assays against Pseudomonas delhiensis PS27, a robust Gram&#8208;negative strain exhibiting strong resilience to environmental stresses, demonstrated notable biofilm inhibition in coatings with higher charge surface density without affecting the physiological fitness of planktonic cells. An observed minimum effective value of surface charge density (6.23 &#177; 0.76)&#183;1016 N+/cm2 for biofilm inhibition was observed. These findings suggest a link between surficial N+ charge density and antifouling efficacy. The developed coatings represent a promising and durable strategy for environmentally friendly fouling prevention in marine and aquatic environments.

         <title>Copper(II), a Peculiar Metal Ion for Complexation with Monensin A Ionophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II) forms three chiral and EPR&#8208;active complexes with monensinate A in methanol. Beside the bis [CuL2] and mono [CuL]+ species, the new dinuclear construct [Cu2L]3+ exhibits an [ML]+&#8208;type and a metal salt&#8208;type copper(II) centers weakly bound to each other through counter ion(s) and thus, being magnetically independent.








ABSTRACT
Monensin A transports Na+ ions through the cell membrane, but it is also able to bind divalent metal ions potentially influencing the biological activity of the ionophore. In line with our previous studies, here we explored interaction of the essential Cu(II) with monensinate A and suggested the types of coordination compounds formed. Circular dichroism (VIS&#8208; and NIR&#8208;CD), VIS light absorption, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies, as well as electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) were utilized for identification and characterization of the complexes. Bis or mono Cu(II) complexes prevailed at ligand excess or comparable reactant concentrations, respectively. Excess Cu(II) salt, however, induced the formation of dinuclear coordination species, not observed previously with divalent metal cations as Mg(II), Ca(II), Co(II), Mn(II), Ni(II), Zn(II). The dinuclear complex is EPR&#8208;active being a rare example of non&#8208;EPR&#8208;silent coordination compounds containing two Cu(II) centers and is the first case among the known metal(II) complexes of the antibiotic monensin A. The origin of the counterion did not influence the properties of the bis compound but contributed to the spectral behavior of the newly detected dinuclear Cu(II) species. This study revealed that the interactions of a drug molecule with metal(II) ions during its practical application may be significant and it should be considered in discussions about the mechanism of action.

A PPh2Me&#8208;promoted [4 + 3] annulation of benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones and quinazoline&#8208;derived azomethine imines proceeded to form the polycyclic quinazoline&#8208;fused benzothiadiazepines, which showed good activity and selectivity against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell lines.








ABSTRACT
A PPh2Me&#8208;promoted [4 + 3] annulation between benzo[c][1,2]dithiol&#8208;3&#8208;ones and quinazoline&#8208;derived azomethine imines for the facile synthesis of a novel quinazoline&#8208;fused benzothiadiazepine library is described. This transformation is characterized by its mild conditions and excellent functional group tolerance, affording 25 novel tetracyclic compounds in excellent yields (most &gt;85%). The biological evaluation of the obtained tetracyclic products established the scaffold's promising preliminary anti&#8208;TNBC profile. The lead compound, 3ma, further demonstrated potent anti&#8208;migratory effects in wound healing and transwell assay, suggesting anti&#8208;metastatic potential. Preliminary mechanistic insights from molecular docking studies indicated binding affinity to the EGFR kinase active site, which provides a testable hypothesis for the mechanism of action.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective C&#8211;C Silylation of Cyclopropyl Acetates Harnessing Fluorinated Poly(pyridyl)Borate Rhodium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated poly(pyridyl)borates have been utilized to stabilize rhodium&#8208;diene complexes and as supporting ligands in rhodium&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral C&#8211;C silylation of cyclopropyl acetates, producing silicon&#8208;containing heterocyclic products, dioxasilolanes.








ABSTRACT
Rhodium complexes supported by fluorinated tris&#8208; and bis&#8208;(pyridyl)borates effectively catalyze redox&#8208;neutral C&#9472;C silylation of cyclopropyl acetates, producing the umpolung, silicon&#8208;containing heterocyclic products, dioxasilolanes, in good yields with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The enhanced performance arises from the weakly donating ability of the fluorinated ligands, along with the considerable steric bulk of the poly(pyridyl)borates, which together govern both reactivity and selectivity. Additionally, rhodium(I)&#8208;cyclooctadiene and rhodium(I)&#8208;norbornadiene complexes supported by poly(pyridyl)borate ligands have been isolated and characterized. X&#8208;ray crystal structures show that in these square planar complexes, poly(pyridyl)borate ligands bind to rhodium in a &#954;2&#8208;mode using two&#8208;pyridyl arms, while the cyclic dienes coordinate in an &#951;4&#8208;fashion.

         <title>Cyanobacterial Cyclic Peptides Containing cis&#8208;Pro Conformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanobacterial cyclic natural products are ribosomal or nonribosomal peptides, typically containing one or more proline residues. However, the presence and population of the cis&#8208;Pro conformation are not always explicitly stated in the literature. The two proline isomers can affect protein function and interactions. This review focuses on the NMR characteristics and biosynthetic logic of cyanobacterial cyclic peptides containing cis&#8208;Pro dominant conformations, aiming to provide an overview of the cis&#8208;Pro conformations in cyanobacterial cyclic peptides.








ABSTRACT
More than 3,000 natural products have been identified from cyanobacteria. These natural products often displayed antiparasitic, anti&#8208;inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer activities. Cyanobacterial cyclic natural products are ribosomal or nonribosomal peptides, typically containing one or more proline residues. However, the presence and population of the cis&#8208;Pro conformation are not always explicitly stated in the literature. The two proline isomers can affect protein function and interactions. This review focuses on the NMR characteristics and biosynthetic logic of cyanobacterial cyclic peptides containing cis&#8208;Pro dominant conformations, aiming to provide an overview of the cis&#8208;Pro conformations in cyanobacterial cyclic peptides. We manually reviewed the chemical structures and NMR chemical shifts of 150 cyanobacterial cyclic peptides containing proline residues, of which 51 cyclic peptides possessed cis&#8208;prolyl amide bonds. Furthermore, we explained the Pro cis/trans isomerism in cyclic peptides and discussed methods for better studying these Pro cis/trans conformations in the future.

         <title>Molecules and Linear Polymers With Incorporated Pillar[5]Arene Units: Enhanced Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a unique class of macrocyclic compounds, pillararenes have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their exceptional performance in complexing with AIEgens. This concept aims to consolidate recent research advancements and applications of pillararene&#8208;AIEgens systems, offering valuable insights for future investigations.








ABSTRACT
Pillar[n]arenes are a class of special macrocyclic compounds with rigid and porous structures, representing an important branch of host macrocycles in the field of supramolecular chemistry. Since their discovery in 2008, pillar[n]arenes have been in&#8208;depth applied in the field of biomedicine, such as molecular recognition, bio&#8208;imaging, and tumor detection, due to the enhancement of fluorescent signal when combining with chromophores. Over the past decade, many pillar[n]arene units&#8208;incorporated polymers have been synthesized and served as ideal polymer hosts for the enhancement of luminescent performance of applied to enhance aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) performance. Driven by researchers' keen exploration of pillararene polymers for AIE enhancement, this review will elaborate on the AIE&#8208;enhancing effects of pillararenes from two aspects: pillararene&#8208;containing monomers and pillararene&#8208;containing linear polymers. It also introduces the synthesis methods of pillararenes and the principles underlying their AIE&#8208;enhancing effects. Additionally, their applications in areas such as fluorescent sensing and artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems are presented. Finally, the current challenges and prospects of pillararenes are discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pillar[n]arenes are a class of special macrocyclic compounds with rigid and porous structures, representing an important branch of host macrocycles in the field of supramolecular chemistry. Since their discovery in 2008, pillar[n]arenes have been in-depth applied in the field of biomedicine, such as molecular recognition, bio-imaging, and tumor detection, due to the enhancement of fluorescent signal when combining with chromophores. Over the past decade, many pillar[n]arene units-incorporated polymers have been synthesized and served as ideal polymer hosts for the enhancement of luminescent performance of applied to enhance aggregation-induced emission (AIE) performance. Driven by researchers' keen exploration of pillararene polymers for AIE enhancement, this review will elaborate on the AIE-enhancing effects of pillararenes from two aspects: pillararene-containing monomers and pillararene-containing linear polymers. It also introduces the synthesis methods of pillararenes and the principles underlying their AIE-enhancing effects. Additionally, their applications in areas such as fluorescent sensing and artificial light-harvesting systems are presented. Finally, the current challenges and prospects of pillararenes are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Selective and Chemical Activation Strategies for Nitrogen Mustard Prodrugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ABSTRACT
Nitrogen mustards are highly potent DNA&#8208;alkylating agents, but their clinical utility is limited by systemic toxicity and poor tumor selectivity. Tumor&#8208;selective prodrug strategies have emerged to address these challenges, enabling spatiotemporally controlled activation of otherwise inert precursors. These approaches exploit tumor&#8208;specific cues such as hypoxia, acidic pH, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), and redox imbalance, to achieve precise payload release. Stimulus&#8208;induced bond cleavage or structural transformation liberates the masked nitrogen mustard (NM) in situ, facilitating targeted DNA cross&#8208;linking. This review highlights molecular design principles underlying diverse activation strategies, emphasizing scaffold modifications and linker chemistries tailored to cancer&#8208;associated triggers. We also discuss integration with advanced delivery platforms, including polymeric carriers and nanoplatforms, to enhance tumor accumulation and therapeutic indices while minimizing off&#8208;target toxicity. By consolidating recent advances, this review illustrates how bioorthogonal and tumor&#8208;selective activation strategies, including those responsive to hypoxia, ROS, and pH, are redefining the precision oncology potential of NM prodrugs.

         <title>Structural Aspects of Lithium&#8208;Ion Conduction in the Phosphidotitanate Li8TiP4 and Its Comparison With Li7+5xTa1&#8722;xP4 and Li8&#8722;xTi1&#8722;xTaxP4</title>

ABSTRACT
The chemical system Li/Ti/P has previously been subject to intensive investigation. However, reliable structural data for the reported phases have remained elusive. Motivated by the growing interest in phosphorus&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion conductors, we have reinvestigated the synthesis, crystal structure, and physical properties of Li8TiP4. Phase pure Li8TiP4 was obtained, which crystallizes in the tetragonal space group P42mc (no. 105) with a&#8201;=&#8201;8.37581(2)&#8201;&#197; and c&#8201;=&#8201;5.90489(2)&#8201;&#197;. According to a structure determination from X&#8208;ray diffraction powder data, Li8TiP4 is closely related to known Li8TtP4 with Tt&#8201;=&#8201;Si, Ge, and Sn, but adapts a different structure type. Basic structural findings are confirmed by solid state 6Li and 31P NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations reveal a band gap of 2.5&#8201;eV and a good correlation between theoretical and experimental Raman spectra. From potentiostatic impedance spectroscopy an ion conductivity of (4.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.6)&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;6&#8201;S&#8729;cm&#8722;1 at 298&#8201;K was found. In addition to the investigation of ternary Li8TiP4, an isotypic quaternary Ta&#8208;containing phase is observed and studied by single crystal structure determination. Special emphasis in this study is placed on the role of Li occupancy in the voids of the cubic close&#8208;packed (ccp) P atom arrangement and its impact on the ionic conductivity, in comparison to the known compounds Li7+5xTaxP4 and Li8&#8722;xTi1&#8722;xTaxP4 and traced back to the difference in crystal symmetry. Possible diffusion pathways of the Li+ ions were approached by BVSE calculations.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Sequestration of Oxoanions: Detoxification of Cr(VI) and Immobilization of TcO4&#8722; at ppb Level in Aqueous Systems</title>

A guanidinium&#8208;based redox&#8208;active porous organic polymer (POF&#8208;3) enables the selective removal of carcinogenic chromate and radioactive pertechnetate from water below their WHO safety limit. The incorporation of a thiophene moiety facilitates Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III), while the guanidium moiety facilitates electrostatic interactions and ion exchange governs oxoanions binding.








ABSTRACT
Metal oxoanions present significant challenges because of their high solubility in water and their charge characteristics. Among these, carcinogenic chromate and radioactive pertechnetate are particularly concerning. Conventional adsorbents often suffer from low recyclability and reduced selectivity to remove oxoanionic pollutants. Herein, we report a guanidinium&#8208;based porous organic polymer (POF&#8208;3) that selectively adsorbs CrO42&#8722;and TcO4&#8722; from real&#8208;life water samples. POF&#8208;3 displays maximum adsorption capacities of 123&#160;mg g&#8722;1 for chromate and 177&#160;mg g&#8722;1 for perrhenate at pH&#160;=&#160;6. The removal efficiency of POF&#8208;3 at low concentrations of chromate and pertechnetate is very far below the corresponding EPA limit. The adsorption mechanism mainly follows electrostatic interaction and the ion exchange mechanism. Reducing carcinogenic Cr(VI) to Cr(III) is a crucial step; introducing thiophene in the structural backbone of POF&#8208;3 facilitates the redox properties. Morphological transformation into a sheet&#8208;like structure confirms the effective sorption of chromate and perrhenate. In this context, NMR titration of monomeric compound also suggests interaction of POF&#8208;3(M) with guanidium sites of material towards chromate and perrhenate effectively, as proven by solid phase study. These effective adsorption capacities, faster kinetics, and ion exchange ability make it a promising solution for environmental remediation.

         <title>Making and Breaking: Supramolecular Chirality Modulation via Stepwise Assembly and Disassembly of Nano&#8208;Size Trizinc(II)Porphyrin Trimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work demonstrates the induction of chirality in a nano&#8208;size achiral trizinc(II) porphyrin trimer (host) through sequential addition of chiral diamino esters (substrates, L) through the stepwise formation of polymer and dimer via intermolecular assembling and disassembling processes, respectively.








ABSTRACT
A molecular&#8208;level understanding of supramolecular chirality amplification and attenuation is established through the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a &#8216;nano&#8208;size&#8217; achiral Zn(II)porphyrin trimer (host) and a series of chiral diamino esters (substrates). The processes occur through the stepwise formation of polymer and dimer via intermolecular assembling and disassembling processes, respectively. Crystallographic characterizations of both the polymer and dimer allow systematic scrutiny of their structural changes, elucidating their chiroptical properties. The electronic circular dichroism (CD) spectra display opposite signs for the R and S substrates in both the polymer and dimer, indicating that the chirality of the complexes are dictated solely by the absolute configuration of the substrate. In the dimer, both intra&#8208; and intermolecular couplings were identified while in the polymer, CD signals were significantly amplified, owing to cumulative intermolecular couplings. DFT and TDDFT studies corroborate these experimental findings and provide valuable insights into the origin of the chiroptical responses, amplification and reduction in these systems.

The electronic circular dichroism (CD) spectra display opposite signs for the &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; substrates in both the &lt;i&gt;polymer&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;dimer&lt;/i&gt;, indicating that the chirality of the complexes are dictated solely by the absolute configuration of the substrate. In the &lt;i&gt;dimer&lt;/i&gt;, both intra- and intermolecular couplings were identified while in the &lt;i&gt;polymer&lt;/i&gt;, CD signals were significantly amplified, owing to cumulative intermolecular couplings. DFT and TDDFT studies corroborate these experimental findings and provide valuable insights into the origin of the chiroptical responses, amplification and reduction in these systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper&#8208; and Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions of Active Methylene Isocyanides: Facile Access to Highly Substituted Five&#8208; and Six&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions of active methylene isocyanides for the synthesis of highly substituted five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocycles. Emphasis is placed on [3+n] cycloadditions, annulations, and asymmetric strategies, highlighting current limitations and future opportunities in heterocycle construction.








ABSTRACT
Copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;catalyzed reactions of active methylene isocyanides provide powerful and versatile strategies for the construction of heterocyclic architectures relevant to pharmaceutical and materials science. Owing to their unique ambiphilic reactivity, active methylene isocyanides serve as key building blocks for the synthesis of fused, bicyclic, polycyclic, and spirocyclic heterocycles under mild catalytic conditions. This review summarizes recent advances in the copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;catalyzed transformation of functionalized isocyanides toward multi&#8208;substituted five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered heterocyclic frameworks. Particular emphasis is placed on [3+n] cycloaddition reactions, as well as tandem processes involving cycloaddition, annulation, alkylation, and insertion pathways. In addition, emerging strategies that exploit nonfunctionalized isocyanides, strained alkene surrogates, and multi&#8208;isocyanide reaction manifolds are discussed, highlighting new opportunities for complexity generation and asymmetric heterocycle synthesis.

         <title>Rational Design Strategies for Stimuli&#8208;Responsive DNAzymes Using Modified and Artificial Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity control of RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes in response to external stimuli has attracted growing interest for applications in DNA&#8208;based diagnostics, therapeutics, and dynamic DNA nanotechnology. This review summarizes rational design strategies for stimuli&#8208;responsive DNAzymes using modified or artificial nucleotides, including split and caged DNAzymes, as well as systems that undergo stimuli&#8208;induced structural transformations.








ABSTRACT
DNA, traditionally regarded as genetic material, has emerged as a versatile building block in molecular technology. Catalytic DNA oligomers known as DNAzymes, especially those capable of cleaving target RNA at specific sites, have shown great potential in DNA&#8208;based diagnostics, therapeutics, and dynamic DNA nanotechnology. For advanced applications, stimuli&#8208;responsive DNAzymes, which are activated only under specific conditions or by specific chemical stimuli, have attracted particular attention. Although such DNAzymes can be obtained by in vitro selection under strictly controlled conditions, more general strategies for their rational design are strongly needed. In this approach, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness is introduced into existing DNAzymes by sequence engineering or chemical modification. This review focuses on the rational design of stimuli&#8208;responsive RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes using modified and artificial nucleotides. Here, we discuss representative strategies, including recent examples: (i) stimulus&#8208;induced reconstitution of split DNAzymes, (ii) activity control by strand cleavage or ligation, (iii) blocking of the catalytic core with removable oligonucleotides, (iv) caging with labile protecting groups, and (v) stimuli&#8208;induced conformational switching between inactive and active structures. These approaches enable externally controllable activation mechanisms, while maintaining the intrinsic catalytic activity of DNAzymes, providing a valuable toolkit for molecular sensing and DNA nanotechnology.

         <title>Operando Magic Angle Spinning Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy of Methanol Photoreforming Over Titania&#8208;Coated Silica Monoliths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoreforming of methanol is followed in real time by solid&#8208;state Magic Angle Spinning NMR. The transparent sapphire sample holder is irradiated by four LEDs at 11.5&#160;kHz MAS. Efficient light penetration into the sample volume is ensured by silica monoliths with a network of macropores, coated with TiO2, and enhancing light penetration by a factor of two. Silica monoliths may be a versatile support for photo&#8208;irradiated operando solid&#8208;state NMR.








ABSTRACT
Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy under Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) is one of the most powerful analytic techniques and in principle the method of choice to elucidate with molecular detail all components of complex solid or solid&#8208;liquid samples. MAS NMR under light irradiation is yet little developed, with technical solutions and first applications just emerging. We present the first operando observation of photoreforming of methanol to formaldehyde in a transparent rotor, irradiated at 365&#160;nm by four LEDs, at spinning rates up to 11.5&#160;kHz. The photon flux inside the rotor is quantified by an actinometric reaction. Efficient light penetration into the entire rotor volume is crucial. Therefore, we introduce silica monoliths with a continuous network of macropores, coated with TiO2 (anatase) as supported heterogeneous catalyst. These monoliths provide a large pore volume to accommodate the liquid substrate and a high surface area. Centrally, the network of pores larger than the visible light enhances light penetration into the material by a factor of two compared to a powder. Silica monoliths may be easily decorated with various photocatalysts and thus provide a versatile platform for observing in real time photocatalytic reactions by solid&#8208;state NMR.

         <title>Mini&#8208;Hairpin DNA: Extraordinarily Stable Structure and Its Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mini&#8208;hairpin DNA fragments containing GCGAAGC and GCGAAAGC form exceptionally stable hairpin&#8208;like structures, with only two G&#8722;C pairs and one sheared G&#8722;A pair, remaining undenatured in 7&#160;M urea and resisting nuclease digestion. These mini&#8208;hairpin sequences frequently appear in replication and transcription origins, influence DNA sequencing fidelity, and are applicable for stabilizing versatile nucleic acid functional molecules.








ABSTRACT
Nucleic acids exhibit diverse biological functions through hierarchical structural organization, and higher&#8208;order architectures enable recognition beyond Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing. Here, we describe the discovery and characterization of an unusual, extraordinarily stable motif&#8212;mini&#8208;hairpin DNA&#8212;a compact hairpin structure composed of GCGNNAGC or GCGNAGC sequences (N = A, G, C, or T). About 40 years ago, we serendipitously found this unique structure from unusual mobility in denaturing gel electrophoresis. The tertiary structure of GCGAAGC was determined by NMR and contains two G&#8722;C pairs and one sheared G&#8722;A pair. Despite only three base pairs, the mini&#8208;hairpin structure remains nondenatured even in 7&#160;M urea. This thermal stability cannot be accounted for by conventional thermodynamic or structural models and remains unexplained by current molecular dynamics predictions. In addition to thermal stability, this motif resists nuclease digestion. The motif has been identified not only in certain genomic contexts but also as a stabilizing element in engineered nucleic acids, where it enhances the performance of functional nucleic acid molecules. We hope that this review will accelerate further research and applications of mini&#8208;hairpin DNA.

         <title>Recent Advances in Chemical Probing Strategies for RNA Structure Determination in Vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review illustrates how structural probes combined with advanced sequencing technologies are revolutionizing our ability to map RNA structures and interactions within living cells. It highlights the development of innovative strategies tailored to probe RNA structures in particular biological contexts.








ABSTRACT
The intricate structures of RNA molecules facilitate their diverse cellular functions. These structures are shaped by the cellular environment, a context that in silico and in vitro methods typically cannot reconstitute, making it more difficult to study the structure of RNA in cells. In response to these challenges, RNA structure probing using cell&#8208;permeable chemicals has emerged as an effective method to capture the RNA structural landscape in its native environment. The integration of these probes with advanced adduct detection techniques, particularly second&#8208; and third&#8208;generation sequencing, has propelled the field forward, facilitating a deeper understanding of the RNA structurome within its precise functional context, including the examination of RNA structure at the single&#8208;molecule and single&#8208;cell levels, within specific subcellular compartments, and across various stages of RNA biogenesis and regulation. This Review summarizes the significant advances in the field of RNA structure probing, focusing on the development of novel structural probes, strategies for RNA structure reconstruction, innovative methodologies that offer extended applicability to address unique biological questions, and concludes with an outlook on future directions in the field.

The integration of these probes with advanced adduct detection techniques, particularly second- and third-generation sequencing, has propelled the field forward, facilitating a deeper understanding of the RNA structurome within its precise functional context, including the examination of RNA structure at the single-molecule and single-cell levels, within specific subcellular compartments, and across various stages of RNA biogenesis and regulation. This Review summarizes the significant advances in the field of RNA structure probing, focusing on the development of novel structural probes, strategies for RNA structure reconstruction, innovative methodologies that offer extended applicability to address unique biological questions, and concludes with an outlook on future directions in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
