         <dc:description>Aroyl&#8208; S,N &#8208;ketene acetals are a novel highly diverse class of AIEgens ( a ggregation&#8208; i nduced e mission fluoro gens ) with a plethora of interesting properties. An expanded compound library of more than 110 dyes sets the stage for a first qualitative control and tuneability of all aspects of the photophysical properties. The interplay of substituents not only allows tuning and predicting the emission color, but also the intensity, and quantum yields both in solids and in the aggregated state, which can be rationalized by scrutinizing intermolecular interactions in the crystalline solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Br&#248;nsted acid vs phase&#8208;transfer catalysis in the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation of enesultams</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation reaction using unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides using both chiral Bronsted acid or phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. Under the optimized reaction conditions a variety of bicyclic adducts can be obtained with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The mechanism of the reaction has also been studied using computational tools observing that the reaction involves the participation of a conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic substrate with planar chirality in which the stereochemical outcome is controlled by the relative reactivity of the two pseudorotational enantiomers when interacting with the chiral catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Antiferromagnets Possessing Extended Zero&#8208;, One&#8208;, Two&#8208;, and Three&#8208;Dimensional Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferromagnetic coupling of ferro&#8208; or ferrimagnetically ordered isolated ions (0D), extended chain (1D), layer (2D), or 3D&#8208;network structures can lead to antiferromagnetically ordered materials, which are referred to as artificial (or synthetic) antiferromagnets.







Abstract
Layered (2D) artificial (or synthetic) antiferromagnets are fabricated by atom deposition techniques and possess very thin, nanometer&#8208;scale, magnetically ordered layers separated by a very thin nonmagnetic layer that antiferromagnetically couples the magnetic layers. Artificial antiferromagnets were crucial in the discovery of the giant magnetic effect (GMR), which had an incredible impact on the evolution of computer memory and its applications, and nucleated the dawn of spintronics (magnetoelectrics). The fundamental structural motif has been more recently achieved by using synthetic chemical methods that led to insulating artificial antiferromagnets. Examples of magnetically ordered layers that are antiferromagnetic coupled to form artificial antiferromagnets have been extended to isolated ions (0D) as well as extended chain (1D) and extended network 3D structures, and new phenomena and applications are anticipated as insulating antiferromagnets are more effective at propagating spin currents with respect to dielectric materials.

         <title>Intramolecular, Interrupted Homo&#8208;Nazarov Cascade Biscyclizations to Angular (Hetero)Aryl&#8208;Fused Polycycles</title>

Alkenyl cyclopropyl ketones tethered to (hetero)arenes readily underwent catalytic, intramolecular interrupted homo&#8208;Nazarov cascade biscyclizations to form 6,6,6&#8208;, 6,5,6&#8208;, 6,6,5&#8208;, 6,6,6,5&#8208;, and 6,6,5,6&#8208;fused angular architectures. The approach was used for the concise total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;1&#8208;oxoferruginol, a bioactive abietane diterpenoid.







Abstract
Herein, a SnCl4&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular, interrupted homo&#8208;Nazarov cascade biscyclization to access angular (hetero)aryl&#8208;fused polycycles is reported. Subsequent decarboxylation of the readily enolizable products afforded the angular products in up to 71&#8201;% yield over two steps, with the trans&#8208;diastereomers as the major products. The cyclopropyl homo&#8208;Nazarov cyclization precursors were formed using a scalable and modular synthetic route that, ultimately, offers access to 6,6,6&#8208;, 6,6,5&#8208;, 6,5,6&#8208;, 6,6,5,6&#8208;, and 6,6,6,5&#8208;fused angular polycyclic products. To showcase the rigor and utility of the method, an 8&#8208;step total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;1&#8208;oxoferruginol, an antibacterial aromatic abietane diterpenoid, was disclosed.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Structural Change in Artificial Heterometallic&#8208;Oxide Cluster Mimicking the Photosynthetic Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To understand the chemical principle of the photosynthetic oxygen&#8208;evolving center (OEC), we report two (Mn3XO4)2O&#8208;clusters (X=Sr2+, La3+) closely mimicking both the heterometallic&#8208;oxide cubane and all types of oxide bridges in OEC. Structural comparison of both oxidized and reduced forms of the (Mn3LaO4)2O&#8208;cluster indicates that the reactive site is the &#956;2&#8208;oxide bridge rather than the &#956;4&#8208;oxide or &#956;3&#8208;oxide bridges in the cluster.







Abstract
The oxygen&#8208;evolving center (OEC) in photosynthesis is a unique Mn4CaO5&#8208;cluster that catalyzes the water&#8208;splitting reaction in nature. Understanding its catalytic mechanism for the O=O bond formation is of great challenge and long&#8208;standing issue, which is severely restricted by the lack of precise structure and mechanism mimics of this heterometallic&#8208;oxide cluster. Herein, we report two synthetic (Mn3XO4)2O&#8208;clusters (X=Sr2+, La3+) that closely mimic the heterometallic&#8208;oxide Mn3XO4 cubane and three different types of &#956;&#8208;oxide bridges (&#956;2&#8208;O2&#8722;, &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722;, and &#956;4&#8208;O2&#8722;) simultaneously as seen in the OEC. By resolving the crystal structures of both oxidized and reduced forms of the cluster, we have identified significant redox&#8208;induced structural changes that take place on the &#956;2&#8208;oxide bridge, rather than the &#956;4&#8208;oxide or &#956;3&#8208;oxide bridges. Our results provide chemical insights into understanding the reactivity of three different types of oxide bridges in the biological Mn4CaO5&#8208;cluster in PSII.

&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-O&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) simultaneously as seen in the OEC. By resolving the crystal structures of both oxidized and reduced forms of the cluster, we have identified significant redox-induced structural changes that take place on the &#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-oxide bridge, rather than the &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-oxide or &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-oxide bridges. Our results provide chemical insights into understanding the reactivity of three different types of oxide bridges in the biological Mn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CaO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-cluster in PSII.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective 2D Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Layers with Bis&#8208;Metallic Catalytic Sites for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work 2D ultrathin metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) with bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites were developed to negate the blemish of low&#8208;density catalytic sites and low electron transmission efficiency on the surface of 3D MOFs, thus resulting in efficient and selective visible light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis.







Abstract
As novel generated 2D materials, metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) have recently emerged as a potential platform for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCO2RR). Such 2D structures negate the blemish of low&#8208;density catalytic sites and low electron transmission efficiency on the surface of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), while retaining the advantage of low expenditure when using earth&#8208;abundant metal nodes and meritorious applicability in the PCO2RR. Herein, it is reported that the 2D ultrathin layer material with bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites (Ni&#8722;O metal node and the Ni&#8722;N metal site) from bidentate ligand 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate (H2bpydc) and nickel(II) remarkably boosts the visible light&#8208;driven PCO2RR performance with a CO yield of 2400&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 18&#8197;h and a selectivity up to 99&#8201;%. Consequently, the effects of morphology, catalytic sites and intrinsic properties on PCO2RR efficiency have been investigated in detail. In this context, the ultrathin layer structure has been elucidated as the key point to facilitate electron transfer efficiency. Notably, the bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites with reasonable distance between two adjacent metals presumably induce synergistic effect and offer a guiding ideology for further designing high performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Photocatalytic E&#8594;Z Contra&#8208;Thermodynamic Isomerization of Vinyl Silanes with Lewis Base</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl silanes was reported using rac&#8208;BINAP as the photocatalyst. This reaction proceeds via the in situ formation of a chromophoric species, in the presence of catalyst. Under irradiation at 405&#8197;nm the interconversion of E&#8208;isomers into the Z&#8208;congeners were carried out in good to excellent yields and outstanding Z/E selectivities (18 examples) and the reaction mechanism was studied.







Abstract
Herein, we disclosed the contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of alkenyl silanes, according to the in situ formation of a chromophoric species, in the presence of rac&#8208;BINAP as the catalyst. The reaction carried out in DMSO or CH3CN under irradiation at 405&#8197;nm allowed the interconversion of the E&#8208;isomers into the Z&#8208;congeners in good to excellent yields and outstanding Z/E selectivities, on 18 examples. Finally, the mechanism of this E&#8594;Z isomerization was studied to get insight into the reaction mechanism.

Tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;trioxophenalenyl neutral diradical undergoes a &#963;&#8208;dimerization, generating two types of &#963;&#8208;dimers immediately after the preparation. One of the &#963;&#8208;dimers is a close&#8208;shell dimer linked through double&#8208;&#963;&#8208;bonds, and the other one is a peroxy&#8208;linked open&#8208;shell dimer. These &#963;&#8208;dimers are in equilibrium in the solution state by the reversible &#963;&#8208;bond formation/cleavage via the neutral diradical as a key intermediate.







Abstract
A novel neutral diradical of &#960;&#8208;extended phenalenyl derivative having three oxo&#8208;groups, tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;trioxophenalenyl, and two types of the corresponding &#963;&#8208;dimers were investigated. Quantum chemical calculations showed that the neutral diradical is in triplet ground state having doubly degenerate singly occupied molecular orbitals. The neutral diradical undergoes a &#963;&#8208;dimerization, generating two types of &#963;&#8208;dimers immediately after the preparation. One of the &#963;&#8208;dimers, which was selectively generated in the crystalline state, was a close&#8208;shell dimer linked through double&#8208;&#963;&#8208;bonds on the phenalenyl skeleton with a long C&#8722;C bond length of 1.66&#8197;&#197;. The other &#963;&#8208;dimer, which existed only in the solution state, was a peroxy&#8208;linked open&#8208;shell dimer in which one &#963;&#8208;bond was formed between two oxygen atoms. Furthermore, the temperature&#8208;dependent 1H&#8197;NMR and ESR spectra revealed that these &#963;&#8208;dimers are in equilibrium in the solution state by the reversible &#963;&#8208;bond formation/cleavage via the neutral diradical as a key intermediate.

         <title>Modeling Heme Peroxidase: Heme Saddling Facilitates Reactions with Hyperperoxides To Form High&#8208;Valent FeIV&#8208;Oxo Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The saddling structure of the porphyrin ring can not only promote the coordination of the ROOH to the iron center but also give a significant push effect to facilitate the homolysis of the O&#8722;O bond of FeIII&#8208;OOR complexes into high&#8208;valent iron(IV)oxo compounds. The deformation&#8208;induced electronic effect provides heme&#8208;containing peroxidases with another potential mechanism for the O&#8722;O bond cleavage of FeIIIOOH to form high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species.







Abstract
Saddle&#8208;shaped hemes have been discovered in the structures of most peroxidases. How such a macrocycle deformation affects the reaction of FeIII hemes with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form high&#8208;valent Fe&#8208;oxo species remains uncertain. Through examination of the ESI&#8208;MS spectra, absorption changes and 1H NMR chemical shifts, we investigated the reactions of two FeIII porphyrins with different degrees of saddling deformation, namely FeIII(OETPP)ClO4 (1OE) and FeIII(OMTPP)ClO4 (1OM), with tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH) in CH2Cl2 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which quickly resulted in O&#8722;O bond homolysis from a highly unstable FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate, FeIII&#8208;O(H)OR (2) into FeIV&#8208;oxo porphyrins (3). Insight into the reaction mechanism was obtained from [tBuOOH]&#8208;dependent kinetics. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, the reaction of 1OE with tBuOOH exhibited an equilibrium constant (Ka=362.3&#8197;M&#8722;1) and rate constant (k=1.87&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;sM&#8722;&gt;1) for the homolytic cleavage of the 2 O&#8722;O bond that were 2.1 and 1.4 times higher, respectively, than those exhibited by 1OM (Ka=171.8&#8197;M&#8722;1 and k=1.36&#215;10&#8722;2&#8201;&#8201;s&#8722;1).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The saddling structure&lt;/b&gt; of the porphyrin ring can not only promote the coordination of the ROOH to the iron center but also give a significant push effect to facilitate the homolysis of the O&#8722;O bond of Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-OOR complexes into high-valent iron(IV)oxo compounds. The deformation-induced electronic effect provides heme-containing peroxidases with another potential mechanism for the O&#8722;O bond cleavage of Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;OOH to form high-valent iron(IV)-oxo species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saddle-shaped hemes have been discovered in the structures of most peroxidases. How such a macrocycle deformation affects the reaction of Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; hemes with hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to form high-valent Fe-oxo species remains uncertain. Through examination of the ESI-MS spectra, absorption changes and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR chemical shifts, we investigated the reactions of two Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; porphyrins with different degrees of saddling deformation, namely Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(OETPP)ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;OE&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) and Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(OMTPP)ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;OM&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), with &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl hydroperoxide (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuOOH) in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which quickly resulted in O&#8722;O bond homolysis from a highly unstable Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-alkylperoxo intermediate, Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-O(H)OR (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) into Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;-oxo porphyrins (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). Insight into the reaction mechanism was obtained from [&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuOOH]-dependent kinetics. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, the reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;OE&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuOOH exhibited an equilibrium constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;=362.3&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;=1.87&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;M&#8722;&amp;gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for the homolytic cleavage of the &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; O&#8722;O bond that were 2.1 and 1.4 times higher, respectively, than those exhibited by &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;OM&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=171.8&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;=1.36&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Surface Engineering of Conjugated Polybenzothiadiazoles and Integration with Cobalt Oxides for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polybenzothiadiazoles thermally treated by a hydrolysis process present high hydrophilicity and low water absorption energy, which enable excellent photocatalytic water oxidation performance and stability.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers feature promising structure and properties for photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, a hydrolysis strategy was demonstrated to rationally modulate the surface hydrophilicity and band structures of conjugated poly&#8208;benzothiadiazoles. High hydrophilicity not only enhances the dispersions of polymeric solids in an aqueous solution but also reduces the absorption energy of water molecules. Besides, both theoretical and experimental results reveal that a more positive valence band potential is generated, which contributes to enhancing the photocatalytic water oxidation performance. Accordingly, the surface&#8208;modified conjugated polymers show largely promoted photocatalytic water oxidation activities by deposition of cobalt oxides as cocatalysts.

         <title>Chemoselective Acylation of Nucleosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective functionalization of oxygen atoms versus nitrogen atoms in bifunctional and polyfunctional molecules is a long&#8208;standing challenge in both fundamental chemistry and in complex molecule synthesis. Different conditions that allow high selectivity in the derivatization of complex nucleosides that contain both O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities are described. Particularly intriguing cases are also presented, in which the reactivity of the O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities is quite context dependent, exhibiting reactivity that blurs conventional considerations, yet where selectivity may also be observed.







Abstract
Acylated nucleoside analogues play an important role in medicinal chemistry and are extremely useful precursors to various other nucleoside analogues. However, chemoselective acylation of nucleosides usually requires several protection and deprotection steps due to the competing nucleophilicity of hydroxy and amino groups. In contrast, direct protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free chemoselective acylation of nucleosides is a preferred strategy due to lower cost and fewer overall synthetic steps. Herein, a simple and efficient chemoselective acylation of nucleosides and nucleotides under mild reaction conditions, giving either O&#8208; or N&#8208;acylated products respectively with excellent chemoselectivity is reported.

         <title>A Coordination Network Featuring Two Distinct Copper(II) Coordination Environments for Highly Selective Acetylene Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D coordination network was synthesised from commercial reagents and displays two distinct coordination environments of copper to carboxylate and salicylaldehydato moieties of the ligand. Solvent exchange of the synthesized network shows retention of framework connectivity coupled with unanticipated framework flexibility to accommodate tetrahydrofuran. The activated framework selectively adsorbs CO2 and C2Hn hydrocarbons over CH4.







Abstract
Single crystals of 2D coordination network {Cu2L2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(DMF)3(H2O)3}n (1&#8208;DMF) were prepared by reaction of commercial reagents 3&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid (H2L) and Cu(NO3)2 in dimethylformamide (DMF). The single&#8208;crystal structure shows two distinct Cu(II) coordination environments arising from the separate coordination of Cu(II) cations to the carboxylate and salicylaldehydato moieties on the linker, with 1D channels running through the structure. Flexibility is exhibited on solvent exchange with ethanol and tetrahydrofuran, while porosity and the unique overall connectivity of the structure are retained. The activated material exhibits type I gas sorption behaviour and a BET surface area of 950&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 (N2, 77&#8197;K). Notably, the framework adsorbs negligible quantities of CH4 compared with CO2 and the C2Hn hydrocarbons. It exhibits exceptional selectivity for C2H2/CH4 and C2H2/C2Hn, which has applicability in separation technologies for the isolation of C2H2.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Directional Capping of Rod&#8208;Packing Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on structural analysis of newly synthesized 3D rod&#8208;packing manganese&#8208;based framework, strategic design of capping agent was developed to obtain a 2D rod&#8208;packing framework. SQUID measurements and DFT calculations proved ferrimagnetic ordering of the material below 8&#8197;K, further illustrating the potential of developing spintronic materials through 2D rod&#8208;packing MOFs







Abstract
Two new rod&#8208;packing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RPMOF) are constructed by regulating the in situ formation of the capping agent. In CPM&#8208;s7, carboxylate linkers extend 1D manganese&#8208;oxide chains in four additional directions, forming 3D RPMOF. The substitution of Mn2+ with a stronger Lewis acidic Co2+, leads to an acceleration of the hydrolysis&#8208;prone sulfonate linker, resulting in presence of sulfate ions to reduce two out of the four carboxylate&#8208;extending directions, and thus forming a new 2D rod&#8208;packing CPM&#8208;s8. Density functional theory calculations and magnetization measurements reveal ferrimagnetic ordering of CPM&#8208;s8, signifying the potential of exploring 2D RPMOF for effective low&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Based on structural analysis&lt;/b&gt; of newly synthesized 3D rod-packing manganese-based framework, strategic design of capping agent was developed to obtain a 2D rod-packing framework. SQUID measurements and DFT calculations proved ferrimagnetic ordering of the material below 8&#8197;K, further illustrating the potential of developing spintronic materials through 2D rod-packing MOFs
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new rod-packing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RPMOF) are constructed by regulating the in situ formation of the capping agent. In CPM-s7, carboxylate linkers extend 1D manganese-oxide chains in four additional directions, forming 3D RPMOF. The substitution of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with a stronger Lewis acidic Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, leads to an acceleration of the hydrolysis-prone sulfonate linker, resulting in presence of sulfate ions to reduce two out of the four carboxylate-extending directions, and thus forming a new 2D rod-packing CPM-s8. Density functional theory calculations and magnetization measurements reveal ferrimagnetic ordering of CPM-s8, signifying the potential of exploring 2D RPMOF for effective low-dimensional magnetic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity of Primary Phosphines and Primary Phosphine Sulfides towards Imines</title>

To P(III) or not to P(III). A three&#8208;component mixture containing primary phosphine, chalcogen, and an imine affords a bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminophosphine chalcogenide. Mechanistic studies show an interesting dichotomy between the relative reactivities of P(III) vs. P(V) species towards imines.







Abstract
Reactivity of primary phosphines with two stoichiometric equivalents of imine results in the formation of bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminophosphines (2&#8201;a&#8211;e), which can be subsequently oxidized in the presence of S8 or H2O2 to generate air stable bis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;aminophosphine sulfides (2&#8201;b&#8211;m(S/O)). To elucidate the mechanism of this three&#8208;component reaction, Hammett analysis, kinetic isotope effect (KIE), and trapping experiments were performed. Ultimately a P(V)&#8211;P(III) tautomerization is invoked, followed by nucleophilic attack by the P(III) species to generate the desired products.

         <title>Flexible Alkylene Bridges as a Tool To Engineer Crystal Distyrylbenzene Structures Enabling Highly Fluorescent Monomeric Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing flexible alkylene bridges to distyrylbenzene can realize monomeric emission in the solid state without any requirement for bulky substituents and has many potential applications, diversifying crystal structure design and fabrication strategies.







Abstract
To design ultrabright fluorescent solid dyes, a crystal engineering strategy that enables monomeric emission by blocking intermolecular electronic interactions is required. We introduced propylene moieties to distyrylbenzene (DSB) as bridges between the phenyl rings either side of its C=C bonds. The bridged DSB derivatives formed compact crystals that emit colors similar to those of the same molecules in dilute solution, with high quantum yields. The introduction of flexible seven&#8208;membered rings to the DSB core produced moderate distortion and steric hindrance in the DSB &#960;&#8208;plane. However, owing to this strategy, it was possible to control the molecular arrangement with almost no decrease in the crystal density, and intermolecular electronic interactions were suppressed. The bridged DSB crystal structure differs from other DSB derivative structures; thus, bridging affords access to novel crystalline systems. This design strategy has important implications in many fields and is more effective than the conventional photofunctional molecular crystal design strategies.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Using A Molecular Antimony Complex under Aqueous Conditions: An Experimental and Computational Study on Main&#8208;Group Element Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antimony complex was synthesized and heterogenized onto a carbon paper electrode surface. This system is capable of electrocatalytically evolving hydrogen gas under aqueous acidic conditions with high activity and efficiency. The stability of the heterogenized complex was confirmed by XPS of the used electrode surface and ICP&#8208;MS of the post catalysis electrolyte. Computational kinetic studies suggest that the generation of hydrogen&#8208;catalyst adduct is a rate&#8208;limiting step.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogen gas production is considered a potential pathway towards carbon&#8208;neutral energy sources. However, the development of this technology is hindered by the lack of efficient, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally benign catalysts. In this study, a main&#8208;group&#8208;element&#8208;based electrocatalyst, SbSalen, is reported to catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an aqueous medium. The heterogenized molecular system achieved a Faradaic efficiency of 100&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. NHE with a maximum current density of &#8722;30.7&#8197;mA/cm2. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the catalyst&#8208;bound working electrode before and after electrolysis confirmed the molecular stability during catalysis. The turnover frequency was calculated as 43.4&#8197;s&#8722;1 using redox&#8208;peak integration. The kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the electrocatalytic reaction were further examined by computational methods. This study provides mechanistic insights into main&#8208;group&#8208;element electrocatalysts for heterogeneous small&#8208;molecule conversion.

         <title>Direct C&#8722;H Trifluoromethylation of (Hetero)Arenes in Water Enabled by Organic Photoredox&#8208;Active Amphiphilic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylations of a variety of small organic molecules were studied in water with the aid of amphiphilic polymeric nanoparticles. Excellent recyclability of the nanoparticles, high efficacy and selectivity, and the use of low intensity LED or sunlight render this method versatile and environmentally friendly.







Abstract
Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed chemical conversions are predominantly operated in organic media to ensure good compatibility between substrates and catalysts. Yet, when conducted in aqueous media, they are an attractive, mild, and green way to introduce functional groups into organic molecules. We here show that trifluoromethyl groups can be readily installed into a broad range of organic compounds by using water as the reaction medium and light as the energy source. To bypass solubility obstacles, we developed robust water&#8208;soluble polymeric nanoparticles that accommodate reagents and photocatalysts within their hydrophobic interior under high local concentrations. By taking advantage of the high excited state reduction potential of N&#8208;phenylphenothiazine (PTH) through UV light illumination, the direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of a wide array of small organic molecules is achieved selectively with high substrate conversion. Key to our approach is slowing down the production of CF3 radicals during the chemical process by reducing the catalyst loading as well as the light intensity, thereby improving effectiveness and selectivity of this aqueous photocatalytic method. Furthermore, the catalyst system shows excellent recyclability and can be fueled by sunlight. The method we propose here is versatile, widely applicable, energy efficient, and attractive for late&#8208;stage introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into biologically active molecules.

         <dc:description>
We describe a fast and flow compatible diffusion NMR experiment, that makes it possible to collect accurate diffusion data for samples flowing at up to 3&#8197;mL/min. We use it to monitor the synthesis of a Schiff base with a flow&#8208;tube with a time resolution of approximately 2&#8197;minutes. The one&#8208;shot flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR described here open many avenues for reaction monitoring applications.







Abstract
Online monitoring by flow NMR spectroscopy is a powerful approach to study chemical reactions and processes, which can provide mechanistic understanding, and drive optimisations. However, some of the most useful methods for mixture analysis and reaction monitoring are not directly applicable in flow conditions. This is the case of classic diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) methods, which can be used to separate the spectral information for mixture's components. We describe a fast and flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR experiment that makes it possible to collect accurate diffusion data for samples flowing at up to 3&#8197;mL/min. We use it to monitor the synthesis of a Schiff base with a flow&#8208;tube with a time resolution of approximately 2&#8197;minutes. The one&#8208;shot flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR described here open many avenues for reaction monitoring applications.

         <title>Cover Feature: Flexible Alkylene Bridges as a Tool To Engineer Crystal Distyrylbenzene Structures Enabling Highly Fluorescent Monomeric Emission (Chem. Eur. J. 52/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 52, September 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a new crystal engineering tool, we prepared organic solid&#8208;state light&#8208;emitting materials that exhibit very bright monomeric emissions. Introducing flexible alkylene bridges into distyrylbenzene (blue fluorescent dye) generated the desired crystal structure in which each dye is isolated in a compact space. More information can be found in the Research Article by G.&#8208;i. Konishi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201884).

2D ultrathin metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs) with bis&#8208;metallic sites have been developed for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. The expanded checkerboard represents the 2D MOL structure. The two differently colored pawns represent bis&#8208;metallic sites, the cream one being responsible for transferring electrons to CO2, and the cyan one denoting protons coupling with CO2. The ingenious layout makes them work synergistically resulting in a magical effect that is crucial for efficient CO2 photoreduction to CO. More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8208;N. He et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201767).

Transition metal (TM) layered oxides with rigid frameworks and two&#8208;dimensional ion diffusion pathways have been extensively studied in potassium&#8208;ion batteries. To improve their potassium storage properties, a series of crystal tuning strategies have been developed, including TM layer regulation, potassium and oxygen layers regulation, construction of hierarchical structure, air&#8208;stabilized TM layered oxides.







Abstract
Layered oxide cathodes have demonstrated great potential for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) on account of high reversible capacity, appropriate diffusion paths, and low cost. However, their electrochemical performance in PIBs is generally worse than that in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to large structural changes and deformations during charging and discharging. To improve their potassium storage performance, a series of strategies have been developed in recent studies. In this review, we summarize the latest advancements in layered oxide cathodes for PIBs through different crystal regulation strategies, including transition metal layer doping, potassium content optimization, oxygen partial substitution, functional morphology construction and air stability improvement. Meanwhile, the relationship between the electrochemical properties and structural evolution of these modified cathodes is also investigated. In addition, the challenges and prospects of these layered oxide cathodes in PIBs are analyzed in detail, providing constructive insights for future applications of PIBs.

Upon two&#8208;electron oxidation, they are reversibly transformed into the title dications (  1  2+  and  2  2+  ) exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions, which were also isolated as stable salts. These redox pairs can serve as new entries into less well&#8208;explored organic NIR&#8208;electrochromic systems, and the separation of redox peaks (electrochemical bistability) was attained for  1  /  1  2+  and  2  /  2  2+  , thanks to drastic geometrical changes between neutral and dicationic states, as revealed by a series of X&#8208;ray analyses. Thiepin&#8208;  S,S  &#8208;dioxide analogue (  3  /  3  2+  ) exhibits quite similar redox behavior due to nonaromatic nature of the dibenzothiepin or &#8208;oxepin unit in  1  2+  and  2  2+  , whereas thiepin&#8208;  S  &#8208;oxide derivative (  4  /  4  2+  ) does not exhibit bistability due to the less change in geometry upon electron transfer, showing that a subtle change of a bridging atom in the central seven&#8208;membered ring can modify the redox properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Advance and Designing Strategies in Polymeric Antifungal Agents Inspired by Membrane&#8208;Active Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growing prevalence of invasive fungal diseases, the scarcity of existing antifungal drugs, and the continued emergence of antifungal drug resistance urge the development of new antifungal agents. This concept discusses and highlights the advance and designing strategies of antifungal polymeric agents with a focus on design principles inspired by membrane&#8208;active peptides, including host defense peptides and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides.







Abstract
The high&#8208;mortality invasive fungal infections seriously threaten the lives of immunocompromised people. Host defense peptides and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides are representative membrane&#8208;active peptides with different functions. Among them, host defense peptides mimicking is a valid strategy in the design of synthetic antifungal agents. Despite the brilliance in the field of intracellular delivery, the potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and their mimics for designing antifungal agents has been overlooked. In this concept article, we describe the structural design of synthetic antifungal polymers as mimics of host defense peptides, and highlight the effectiveness and potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptide&#8208;inspired strategy in designing potent and selective antifungal polymeric agents. In addition, an outlook for further expanding the design horizons of antifungal polymers is also presented.

         <title>Dual MOF&#8208;Derived MoS2/CdS Photocatalysts with Rich Sulfur Vacancies for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual MOF&#8208;derived MoS2/CdS photocatalyst with abundant sulfur vacancies was synthesized by in&#8197;situ growth of CdS nanoparticles on 2D MoS2. Because of the existence of both 1T phase and sulfur vacancies, MoS2/CdS not only shows strong charge transport ability, but also possesses prolonged photoelectron lifetime. The 1&#8201;%MoS2/CdS exhibited 27 times higher hydrogen generation activity than pristine CdS.







Abstract
Cocatalyst plays an important role in efficient charge transfer and separation for photocatalysis. Herein, a MoS2/CdS photocatalyst with MoS2 as cocatalyst was designed by using Mo&#8208;MOF and Cd&#8208;MOF as precursors. Due to the existence of rich sulfur vacancies and 1T phase, MoS2 shows strong charge capture and transport ability. The photo&#8208;generated electrons on conduction band (CB) can be bound by the sulfur vacancy of CdS and effectively transported to MoS2 through the compact interface between the CdS nanoparticles and 2D large&#8208;scale MoS2. The optimal photocatalyst 1&#8201;%MoS2/CdS exhibited dramatically improved photocatalytic hydrogen production activity, which is 28 times that of pristine CdS and even about 2 times that of 1&#8201;%Pt/CdS with same loading amount of noble metal Pt. This work highlights the role of Mo&#8208;MOF derived MoS2 with 1T&#8208;2H phases as a sustainable and prospective candidate of cocatalyst for improving charge separation and photocatalytic stability of MoS2/CdS composites.

Because of the existence of both 1T phase and sulfur vacancies, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CdS not only shows strong charge transport ability, but also possesses prolonged photoelectron lifetime.

         <title>Electrochemically Determining Electronic Structure of ZnO Quantum Dots with Different Surface Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is employed to determine the band edges and trap states of ZnO QDs with different surface ligands. It is demonstrated that the ZnO QDs without surface ligands mainly have oxygen interstitial defects whilst the ZnO QDs covered with ligands contain oxygen vacancies.







Abstract
The electronic structure of quantum dots (QDs) including band edges and possible trap states is an important physical property for optoelectronic applications. The reliable determination of the energy levels of QDs remains a big challenge. Herein we employ cyclic voltammetry (CV) to determine the energy levels of three types of ZnO QDs with different surface ligands. Coupled with spectroscopic techniques, it is found that the onset potential of the first reductive wave is likely related to the conduction band edges while the first oxidative wave originates from the trap states. The determined specific energy levels in CV further demonstrates that the ZnO QDs without surface ligands mainly have oxygen interstitial defects whilst the ZnO QDs covered with ligands contain oxygen vacancies. The present electrochemical method offers a powerful and effective way to determine the energy levels of wide bandgap ZnO QDs, which will boost their device performance.

         <title>Tetrahalidometallate(II) Ionic Liquids with More than One Metal: The Effect of Bromide versus Chloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A question of halide: Transition metal&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) are promising candidates for electrochemical energy. Bromide&#8208;based ILs are particularly interesting for their high electrochemical stability, although their conductivities are significantly lower than those of their chloride analogues. [MBr4]2&#8722; units are therefore highly promising building blocks for advanced electrochemically active ILs.







Abstract
Fifteen N&#8208;butylpyridinium salts &#8211; five monometallic [C4Py]2[MBr4] and ten bimetallic [C4Py]2[M0.5aM0.5bBr4] (M=Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn) &#8211; were synthesized, and their structures and thermal and electrochemical properties were studied. All the compounds are ionic liquids (ILs) with melting points between 64 and 101&#8201;&#176;C. Powder and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction show that all ILs are isostructural. The electrochemical stability windows of the ILs are between 2 and 3&#8197;V. The conductivities at room temperature are between 10&#8722;5 and 10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. At elevated temperatures, the conductivities reach up to 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 70&#8201;&#176;C. The structures and properties of the current bromide&#8208;based ILs were also compared with those of previous examples using chloride ligands, which illustrated differences and similarities between the two groups of ILs.

         <title>Profiling Heparan Sulfate&#8211;Heavy Metal Ions Interaction Using Electrochemical Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The connection between heparan sulfate molecular components and heavy metal ion binding is largely unknown because of the complexity and the heterogeneity of the polysaccharide, which limit the ability to study those interactions. By assembling rationally designed synthetic heparan sulfates on surfaces, we have developed new ways to correlate glycan stereochemistry and sulfate group regiochemistry with heavy metal ion binding and selectivity. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Kikkeri, S. Yitzchaik, M. Hurevich, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202193).

         <title>Interface Engineering of Conjugated Polymer Based Composites for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis can create a green way to produce clean energy resources, degrade pollutant as well as achieve carbon neutral, making the construction of efficient photocatalysts significant in solving environmental issues. Conjugated polymers (CPs) with adjustable band structures have superior light absorption capacity and flexible morphology that facilitate the contact with other components to form advanced heterojunctions. Interface engineering can strengthen the interfacial contact between the components and further enlarge interfacial contact area, enhance light absorption, accelerate charge transfer and improve the reusability of the composites. In order to throw some new light on heterojunction interface regulation at molecular level, we summarize CP&#8208;based composites with improved photocatalytic performance according to the types of interactions (covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, and other polar interactions) between the components and introduce the corresponding interface building methods, identify techniques. Then the roles of interfaces in different photocatalytic applications are discussed. Finally, we sum up the existing problems in interface engineering of CP&#8208;based composites and look forward to the possible solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Bromine Pentafluoride BrF5, the Formation of [BrF6]&#8722; Salts, and the Sterical (In)Activity of the Br Lone Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BrF  5  can be prepared by the reaction of BrF  3  with fluorine under UV light in the region of 300 to 400 nm at room temperature. It was analyzed by UV&#8208;Vis, NMR, IR and Raman spectroscopy. Its crystal structure was redetermined by X&#8208;ray diffraction and the space group corrected to  Pnma  . Quantum chemical calculations were performed for the band assignment of the vibrational spectra. A monoclinic polymorph of BrF  5  was quantum chemically predicted and then observed as its low&#8208;temperature modification in space group  P  2  1  /  c  by single crystal diffraction. BrF  5  reacts with the alkali metal fluorides  A  F (  A  = K, Rb) to form alkali metal hexafluoridobromates(V),  A  [BrF  6  ] whose crystal structures have been determined. Both compounds crystallize in the K[AsF  6  ] structure type (  R [[EQUATION]] , no. 148,  hR  24). For the species [BrF  6  ]  +  , BrF  5  , [BrF  6  ]  &#8722;  and [IF  6  ]  &#8722;  the chemical bonds and lone pairs on the heavy atoms were investigated by means of Intrinsic Bond Orbital analysis.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;BrF  5  can be prepared by the reaction of BrF  3  with fluorine under UV light in the region of 300 to 400 nm at room temperature. It was analyzed by UV-Vis, NMR, IR and Raman spectroscopy. Its crystal structure was redetermined by X-ray diffraction and the space group corrected to  Pnma  . Quantum chemical calculations were performed for the band assignment of the vibrational spectra. A monoclinic polymorph of BrF  5  was quantum chemically predicted and then observed as its low-temperature modification in space group  P  2  1  /  c  by single crystal diffraction. BrF  5  reacts with the alkali metal fluorides  A  F (  A  = K, Rb) to form alkali metal hexafluoridobromates(V),  A  [BrF  6  ] whose crystal structures have been determined. Both compounds crystallize in the K[AsF  6  ] structure type (  R [[EQUATION]] , no. 148,  hR  24). For the species [BrF  6  ]  +  , BrF  5  , [BrF  6  ]  &#8722;  and [IF  6  ]  &#8722;  the chemical bonds and lone pairs on the heavy atoms were investigated by means of Intrinsic Bond Orbital analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the potential of innovative gold(I) and silver(I) selenourea complexes as anticancer agents targeting TrxR and cellular redox homeostasis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of NHC&#8208;based selenourea Ag(I) and Au(I) complexes were evaluated for their anticancer potential  in vitro  , on 2D and 3D human cancer cell systems. All NHC&#8208;based selenourea complexes possess an outstanding cytotoxic potency, which was comparable or even better than that of the reference metallodrug auranofin, and were also able to overcome both platinum&#8208;based and multi&#8208;drug resistances. Intriguingly, their cytotoxic potency did not correlate with solution stability, partition coefficient or cellular uptake. On the other hand, mechanistic studies in cancer cells revealed their ability to strongly and selectively inhibit the redox&#8208;regulating enzyme Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR), being even more effective than auranofin, a well&#8208;known TrxR inhibitor, without affecting other redox enzymes such as Glutathione Reductase (GR). The inhibition of TrxR in H157 human cancer cells caused, in turn, the disruption of cellular thiol&#8208;redox homeostasis and of mitochondria pathophysiology, ultimately leading to cancer cell death through apoptosis.</dc:description>

All of these oligonucleotides formed very stable duplexes with complementary sequences pairing the organometallic moiety with either 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;thiothymine. The isomeric monomercurated oligonucleotides were also able to discriminate between 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;thiothymine based on different melting temperatures of the respective duplexes. DFT&#8208;optimized structures of the most stable mononuclear Hg(II)&#8208;mediated base pairs featured a coordinate covalent bond between Hg(II) and either S2 or S4 and a hydrogen bond between the carbazole nitrogen and N3. The dinuclear Hg(II)&#8208;mediated base pairs, in turn, were geometrically very similar to the one previously reported to form between 1,8&#8208;dimercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;carbazole and thymine and had one Hg(II) ion coordinated to a thio and the other one to an oxo substituent.</dc:description>

         <title>A Quick and Reproducible Silanization Method by Using Plasma Activation for Hydrophobicity&#8208;Based Kinesin Single Molecule Fluorescence&#8211;Microscopy Assays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strength in weakness: Weakly hydrophobic, plasma&#8208;activated surfaces silanized with a disilazane turned out to be optimal for single&#8208;molecule fluorescence measurements of biological molecular machines. The novel silanization assay reduced the work load more than tenfold and does not require any organic solvents, thus making the assay environmentally friendly and efficient.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule assays often require functionalized surfaces. One approach for microtubule assays renders surfaces hydrophobic and uses amphiphilic blocking agents. However, the optimal hydrophobicity is unclear, protocols take long, produce toxic waste, and are susceptible to failure. Our method uses plasma activation with hydrocarbons for hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) silanization in the gas phase. We measured the surface hydrophobicity, its effect on how well microtubule filaments were bound to the surface, and the number of nonspecific interactions with kinesin motor proteins. Additionally, we tested and discuss the use of different silanes and activation methods. We found that even weakly hydrophobic surfaces were optimal. Our environmentally friendly method significanty reduced the overall preparation effort and resulted in reproducible, high&#8208;quality surfaces with low variability. We expect the method to be applicable to a wide range of other single&#8208;molecule assays.

The sluggish cathode kinetics and degradation of the Li anode result in large voltage hysteresis and low coulombic efficiency for LOBs, but they can be resolved by MOF&#8208;based catalysts and separators. This concept presents an overview of different kinds of MOF&#8208;based catalysts and separators, and discusses perspectives on the development of MOF&#8208;based LOBs.







Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (LOBs) are considered to be the next&#8208;generation energy technology owing to their high theoretical energy density. However, the sluggish cathode kinetics and degradation of Li anodes result in large voltage hysteresis and low coulombic efficiency. Various materials have been applied to promote the electrochemical performance of LOBs. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing porous structures, open active sites and adjustable pore sizes have been attempted as promising materials for catalysts and separators of LOBs. This concept presents an overview of different MOF&#8208;based catalysts for LOBs, including traditional, conductive, semi&#8208;conductive and soluble MOFs, as well as our recently proposed photo&#8208;involved LOBs. Recent advances in MOF&#8208;based separators to restrain the shuttling of redox mediators between cathodes and anodes and suppress the formation of lithium dendrites are also discussed. Finally, perspectives on the development of MOF&#8208;based LOBs for future research are presented.

         <title>Sequential Formation of Heteroternary Cucurbit[10]uril (CB[10]) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azaphosphatrane (AZAP) forms a host:guest 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with the cucurbit[10]uril (CB[10]) macrocycle in water and forces CB[10] to adopt an 8&#8208;shape with AZAP occupying the majority of the cavity. The CB[10] contraction leads to a residual space which favors the co&#8208;inclusion of planar and monocationic co&#8208;guest (CG) molecules, affording heteroternary CB[10]&#8901;AZAP&#8901;CG complexes.







Abstract
The globular and monocationic guest molecule trimethyl&#8208;azaphosphatrane (AZAP, a protonated Verkade superbase) was shown to form a host:guest 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with the cucurbit[10]uril (CB[10]) macrocycle in water. Molecular dynamics calculations showed that CB[10] adopts an 8&#8208;shape with AZAP occupying the majority of the internal space, CB[10] contracting around AZAP and leaving a significant part of the cavity unoccupied. This residual space was used to co&#8208;include planar and monocationic co&#8208;guest (CG) molecules, affording heteroternary CB[10]&#8901;AZAP&#8901;CG complexes potentially opening new perspectives in supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Electrical&#8208;Conductive/Insulating Bi&#8208;Functional Layers for Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries: A strategy of electrical&#8208;conductive/insulating bi&#8208;functional layers is proposed to reduce local current density and the difference of Zn metal surface concentration, avoiding direct contact between electrolyte and electrode, and alleviating crazy dendrite growth by coordinating the functions of different coating domains. This strategy is expected to provide a design concept and reference for the realization of dendrite&#8208;free ZIBs.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as an extremely promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage equipment due to the inexpensive ingredients and high safety. However, dendrite growth and side reactions occur in the Zn anode, which lead to exceedingly low coulombic efficiency (CE) and poor cycling stability. In this work, we propose a strategy of a conductive/insulating bi&#8208;functional coating layer (CIBL) for stable Zn metal anodes. Porous Ag nanowires (NWs) coating as a conductive layer effectively reduces the nuclear barrier and contains Zn2+ deposition in a certain space. Polyimide (PI) coatings as insulating layer implement a shunting effect on Zn2+, which could reduce the differential concentration on the Zn surface and induce uniform deposition of Zn2+. Therefore, the CIBL&#8722;Zn//CIBL&#8722;Zn battery achieves stable plating/stripping of over 1300&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The CE of CIBL&#8722;Zn//CIBL&#8722;Zn battery maintains at 99.2&#8201;% even after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the CIBL&#8722;Zn//V2O5 battery exhibits a capacity of nearly 289.2&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles and no sign of capacity degradation is found, which further demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy in practical application.

         <title>A Piezo&#8208;Fenton System with Rapid Iron Cycling and Hydrogen Peroxide Self&#8208;Supplying Driven by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The piezo&#8208;Fenton system has attracted attention not only because it can enhance the Fenton reaction activity by mechanical energy input, but also because it is expected to realize a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive advanced oxidation systems by regulating energy input and hydrogen peroxide self&#8208;supply, thus greatly enriching the application possibilities of Fenton chemistry. In this work, a series of Fe&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4  (g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe) as a piezo&#8208;Fenton system were synthesized where the iron stably immobilized through Fe&#8208;N interaction. The piezo&#8208;induced electrons generate on g&#8208;C3N4  matrix support the conversion of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and promote rate&#8208;limiting step of Fenton reaction. With the optimal Fe loading, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe can achieve methylene blue (MB) degradation under ultrasonic treatment with first&#8208;order kinetic rate constants of 75&#215; 10&#8208;3  min&#8208;1  . Most importantly, the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe can maintain good catalytic activity in a wide pH range (pH=2.0~9.0) and be cyclic used without iron leaching to solution (&lt;0.001 &#956;g&#215;L&#8208;1  ), overcoming the disadvantage of traditional Fe&#8208;based Fenton catalysts that can only be applied under acidic conditions and prone to secondary pollution. In addition, g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;0.5Fe also exhibits antibacterial properties of  Escherichia coli  and  Staphylococcus aureus  under ultrasound. Hydroxyl radicals mainly contribute to the degradation of MB and the sterilization process. Our work is an attempt to clarify the role of g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;Fe in the conversion of mechanical energy to ROS and provide inspirations for the piezo&#8208;Fenton system design.</dc:description>

         <title>DOTP versus DOTA as ligands for lanthanide cations: Novel structurally characterized Ce(IV) and Ce(III) cyclen&#8208;based complexes and clusters in aqueous solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A delve into the coordination and redox chemistry of aqueous CeIV/III macrocyclic compounds was performed using the DOTA and DOTP ligands (1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrayl)tetraacetic acid and 1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid) respectively). The hydrolysis tendency of the tetravalent cation in the presence of DOTA is shown to result in the formation of highly&#8208;ordered, fluorite&#8208;like [CeIV6(O)4(OH)4(H2O)8(DOTAH)4] oxo&#8208;hydroxo structure both in solution and in the solid state. The lifetime of the analogous species formed in the presence of DOTP was found to be much shorter. Spectroscopic measurements suggest its similarity to the former. Its gradual in solution decomposition leads to the accumulation of the in cage complexes of [CeIVDOTP] and [CeIIIDOTP(H2O)], which were crystallographically characterized in the present study. The redox energetics and spectroscopic characteristics for the transition between these two in&#8208;cage complexes in aqueous solutions were studied as well. Together with the crystallographic structures of the abovementioned species, the in cage [CeIVDOTA(H2O)] complex structure is presented herein as well for the first time. An elaborative analysis of the x&#8208;ray crystallographic structural data obtained for the herein studied in cage complexes and similar structures published previously, suggests that hard bonding cyclen derived ligands are, counter&#8208;intuitively, better suited for encapsulating, and perhaps kinetically stabilize softer cations than harder ones with DOTP, marked as a possible adequate chelator for the study of the aqueous properties of LnII and AcIII cations.</dc:description>

Its gradual in solution decomposition leads to the accumulation of the in cage complexes of [CeIVDOTP] and [CeIIIDOTP(H2O)], which were crystallographically characterized in the present study. The redox energetics and spectroscopic characteristics for the transition between these two in-cage complexes in aqueous solutions were studied as well. Together with the crystallographic structures of the abovementioned species, the in cage [CeIVDOTA(H2O)] complex structure is presented herein as well for the first time. An elaborative analysis of the x-ray crystallographic structural data obtained for the herein studied in cage complexes and similar structures published previously, suggests that hard bonding cyclen derived ligands are, counter-intuitively, better suited for encapsulating, and perhaps kinetically stabilize softer cations than harder ones with DOTP, marked as a possible adequate chelator for the study of the aqueous properties of LnII and AcIII cations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regiodivergent Asymmetric Pyridinium Additions: Mechanistic Insight and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical protocol for the first regiodivergent asymmetric addition of aryl and alkenyl organometallic reagents to substituted N&#8208; alkyl pyridinium heterocycles is described. The couplings proceed with high regiochemical and stereochemical selectivities, and provide access to chiral 1,2,3&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted dihydropyridine products, as controlled by judicious choice of nitrogen activating agent. To this end, a correlation was found between the parameterized size of the activating group and the C2/C4 regioselectivity in the couplings. The utility of the described chemistry was demonstrated in two concise asymmetric syntheses of (+)&#8208; N &#8208;methylaspidospermidine and (&#8211;)&#8208;paroxetine.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing the Self&#8208;Assembly of Aromatic Foldamer Helices using Acridine Appendages and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic foldamers helices constitute convenient rigid scaffolds but rarely form ordered arrays upon self&#8208;assembly or in crystals. We show that placing acridine appendages at defined position at the surface of aromatic helices guide their organization in the solid state to form discrete dimers or 1D arrays. Furthermore, metal&#8208;coordination at the acridine units of the same compounds drives self&#8208;assembly in solution.







Abstract
Folded molecules provide complex interaction interfaces amenable to sophisticated self&#8208;assembly motifs. Because of their high conformational stability, aromatic foldamers constitute suitable candidates for the rational elaboration of self&#8208;assembled architectures. Several multiturn helical aromatic oligoamides have been synthesized that possess arrays of acridine appendages pointing in one or two directions. The acridine units were shown to direct self&#8208;assembly in the solid state via aromatic stacking leading to recurrent helix&#8208;helix association patterns under the form of discrete dimers or extended arrays. In the presence of Pd(II), metal coordination of the acridine units overwhelms other forces and generates new metal&#8208;mediated multihelical self&#8208;assemblies, including macrocycles. These observations demonstrate simple access to different types of foldamer&#8208;containing architectures, ranging from discrete objects to 1D and, by extension, 2D and 3D arrays.

         <title>Directed Palladium Catalyzed C&#8722;H (Ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylthiolation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented construction of a C(sp2)&#8208;SCF2CO2Et bond was successfully achieved by Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation. This robust protocol allowed the functionalization of a broad panel of aromatic and olefinic derivatives (37&#8197;examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield), a real advance as existing routes were restricted to the SCF3 and SCF2H residues. Post&#8208;functionalization reactions further illustrated the synthetic value of this fluorinated motif.







Abstract
The unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylthiolation reaction of various unsaturated derivatives was studied. In the presence of the (ethoxycarbonyl)difluoromethylsulfenamide reagent I and under mild reaction conditions (60&#8201;&#176;C), both 2&#8208;(hetero)aryl and 2&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;vinyl)pyridine derivatives were smoothly functionalized with this methodology (37 examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield). Moreover, the synthetic interest of this fluorinated moiety was further showcased by its conversion into various original fluorinated residues. Finally, a plausible mechanism for this transformation was suggested.

         <title>Enantioselective Approach for Expanding the Three&#8208;Dimensional Space of Tetrahydroquinoline to Develop BET Bromodomain Inhibitors
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple and selective. Assembling simple functional groups by proline organocatalysis coupled with the addition of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 in the same flask allows for the mild formation of aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide species that undergo nucleophilic addition to give access to enantio&#8208;enriched tri&#8208;substituted tetrahydroquinolines with a novel configuration. This advanced three&#8208;dimensional structure, after only two additional steps, gave rise to a valuable enantiopure and selective anti&#8208;inflammatory compound.







Abstract
The pharmaceutical industry has a pervasive need for chiral specific molecules with optimal affinity for their biological targets. However, the mass production of such compounds is currently limited by conventional chemical routes, that are costly and have an environmental impact. Here, we propose an easy access to obtain new tetrahydroquinolines, a motif found in many bioactive compounds, that is rapid and cost effective. Starting from simple raw materials, the procedure uses a proline&#8208;catalyzed Mannich reaction followed by the addition of BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2, which generates a highly electrophilic aza&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide intermediate capable of reacting with different nucleophiles to form the diversely functionalized tetrahydroquinoline. Moreover, this enantioselective one&#8208;pot process provides access for the first time to tetrahydroquinolines with a cis&#8208;2,3 and trans&#8208;3,4 configuration. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that a three&#8208;step reaction sequence, from simple and inexpensive starting compounds and catalysts, can generate a BD2&#8208;selective BET bromodomain inhibitor with anti&#8208;inflammatory effect.

         <title>Specific Lipid Studies in Complex Membranes by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Specific interactions with phospholipids are often critical for the function of proteins or drugs, but studying these interactions at high&#8208;resolution remains difficult, especially in complex membranes that mimic biological conditions. In principle, molecular interactions with phospholipids could be directly probed by solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR). However, due to the challenge to detect specific lipids in mixed liposomes and limited spectral sensitivity, ssNMR studies of specific lipids in complex membranes are scarce. Here, by using purified biological 13C,15N&#8208;labelled phospholipids, we show that we can selectivity detect traces of specific lipids in complex membranes. In combination with 1H&#8208;detected ssNMR, we show that our approach provides unprecedented high&#8208;resolution insights into the mechanisms of drugs that target specific lipids. This broadly applicable approach opens new opportunities for the molecular characterization of specific lipid interactions with proteins or drugs in complex fluid membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibitory Effect of DMSO on Halohydrin Dehalogenase: Experimental and Computational Insights into the Influence of an Organic Co&#8208;solvent on the Structural and Catalytic Properties of a Biocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pros and cons considered: Halohydrin dehalogenases (HHDHs) are versatile enzymes employed in the synthesis of chiral building blocks. To increase substrate solubility, DMSO stands out as the most commonly used co&#8208;solvent. Here we found that DMSO acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme HheC. To understand the observed phenomena at the molecular level, in&#8208;depth experimental studies were performed in combination with molecular dynamics simulations.







Abstract
Although the application of organic solvents in biocatalysis is well explored, in&#8208;depth understanding of the interactions of solvent with proteins, in particular oligomeric ones, is still scant. Understanding these interactions is essential in tailoring enzymes for industrially relevant catalysis in nonaqueous media. In our study, the homotetrameric enzyme halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH) from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 (HheC) was investigated, as a model system, in DMSO/water solvent mixtures. DMSO, the most commonly used co&#8208;solvent for biocatalytic transformations, was found to act as a mixed&#8208;type inhibitor with a prevalent competitive contribution. Even 5&#8201;% (v/v) DMSO inhibits the activity of HheC by half. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that DMSO keeps close to Ser&#8208;Tyr catalytic residues forming alternate H&#8208;bonds with them. Stability measurements paired with differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic light scattering methods and MD studies revealed that HheC maintains its structural integrity with as much as 30&#8201;% (v/v) DMSO.

         <title>Towards Substrate&#8208;Reagent Interaction of Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser Bases in THF: Bridging THF Hides Potential Reaction Site of a Chiral Superbase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metalation of N,N&#8208;dimethylaminomethylferrocene in THF by the superbasic mixture of nBuLi/KOtBu proceeds readily at low temperatures to afford a bimetallic Li2K2 aggregate containing ferrocenyl anions and tert &#8208;butoxide. Starting from an enantiomerically enriched ortho &#8208;lithiated aminomethylferrocene an enantiomerically pure superbase can be prepared. The molecular compound exhibits superbasic behavior deprotonating N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzylamine in the &#945;&#8208;position and is also capable of deprotonating toluene. Quantum chemical calculations provide insight into the role of the bridging THF molecule to the possible substrate&#8208;reagent interaction. In addition, a benzylpotassium alkoxide adduct gives a closer look into the corresponding reaction site of the Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser base we are reporting herein.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Due to their high stability towards enzymatic hydrolysis  C  &#8208;acyl glycosidic compounds are useful synthetic intermediates for potential candidates in drug discovery. Syntheses for  C  &#8208;acyl mannosides have remained scarce and usually employ donors obtained from lengthy syntheses. Furthermore, syntheses of unprotected  C&#8208;  acyl mannosides have not been reported so far, due to the incapability of the  C  &#8208;acyl mannoside motif with deprotection conditions for protective groups commonly used in carbohydrate chemistry.

         <title>Competing C&#8208;4&#8201;and C&#8208;5&#8208;Acyl Stabilization of Uronic Acid Glycosyl Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uronic acids have a unique reactivity in stereoselective glycosylation reactions. The competing intramolecular stabilization in uronic acid cations by the C&#8208;5 carboxylic acid or the C&#8208;4 acetyl group was studied using infrared ion spectroscopy and computational energy landscape maps. This reveals how the intrinsic interplay of the different functional groups influences the formation of the different regioisomeric products.







Abstract
Uronic acids are carbohydrates carrying a terminal carboxylic acid and have a unique reactivity in stereoselective glycosylation reactions. Herein, the competing intramolecular stabilization of uronic acid cations by the C&#8208;5 carboxylic acid or the C&#8208;4 acetyl group was studied with infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS). IRIS reveals that a mixture of bridged ions is formed, in which the mixture is driven towards the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;5 dioxolanium ion when the C&#8208;5,C&#8208;2&#8208;relationship is cis, and towards the formation of the C&#8208;1,C&#8208;4 dioxepanium ion when this relation is trans. Isomer&#8208;population analysis and interconversion barrier computations show that the two bridged structures are not in dynamic equilibrium and that their ratio parallels the density functional theory computed stability of the structures. These studies reveal how the intrinsic interplay of the different functional groups influences the formation of the different regioisomeric products.

         <title>Reaction of Pertechnetate in Highly Alkaline Solution: Synthesis and Characterization of the Nitridotrioxotechnetate Ba[TcO3N]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot chemistry. The nitridotrioxotechnetate anion has been obtained by the reaction of ammonium pertechnetate under highly alkaline conditions. In addition to a single crystal structure analysis, Raman data proves the existence of Tc&#8722;O and Tc&#8722;N bonds. The oxidation state +VII has further been corroborate by XANES and EXAFS measurements.







Abstract
The preparation of novel technetium oxides, their characterization and the general investigation of technetium chemistry are of significant importance, since fundamental research has so far mainly focused on the group homologues. Whereas the structure chemistry of technetium in strongly oxidizing media is dominated by the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hot chemistry&lt;/b&gt;. The nitridotrioxotechnetate anion has been obtained by the reaction of ammonium pertechnetate under highly alkaline conditions. In addition to a single crystal structure analysis, Raman data proves the existence of Tc&#8722;O and Tc&#8722;N bonds. The oxidation state +VII has further been corroborate by XANES and EXAFS measurements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preparation of novel technetium oxides, their characterization and the general investigation of technetium chemistry are of significant importance, since fundamental research has so far mainly focused on the group homologues. Whereas the structure chemistry of technetium in strongly oxidizing media is dominated by the 
 anion, our recent investigation yielded the new 
 anion. Brown single crystals of Ba[TcO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N] were obtained under hydrothermal conditions starting from Ba(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;8H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] at 200&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Elucidating the Nature of the External Acid Sites of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolites Using NMR Probe Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and acid properties of external sites of ZSM&#8208;5&#8201;zeolites, namely terminal SiOH groups, pore&#8208;mouth Br&#248;nsted, and tricoordinated Al&#8208;Lewis acid sites, are elucidated through the interaction of samples of distinct particle size with the NMR probe molecule trimethylphosphine oxide, assisted by computational methods.







Abstract
The identification of acid and nonacid species at the external surface of zeolites remains a major challenge, in contrast to the extensively&#8208;studied internal acid sites. Here, it is shown that the synthesis of zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 samples with distinct particle sizes, combined with solid&#8208;state NMR and computational studies of trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) adsorption, provides insight into the chemical species on the external surface of the zeolite crystals. 1H&#8211;31P HETCOR NMR spectra of TMPO&#8208;loaded zeolites exhibit a broad correlation peak at &#948;P &#8764;35&#8211;55&#8197;ppm and &#948;H &#8764;5&#8211;12&#8197;ppm assigned to external SiOH species. Pore&#8208;mouth Br&#248;nsted acid sites exhibit 31P and 1H NMR resonances and adsorption energies close to those reported for internal acid sites interacting with TMPO. The presence of an external tricoordinate Al&#8208;Lewis site interacting strongly with TMPO is suggested, resulting in 31P resonances that overlap with the peaks usually ascribed to the interaction of TMPO with Br&#248;nsted sites.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical coupling of amines and carboxylic acids generates a wide variety of amides and dipeptides. The operationally simple and robust process is mediated by iodide and produces triphenylphosphine oxide as a recyclable co&#8208;product. A combination of boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) anode and a platinum cathode ensures maximum performance. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Opatz et&#8197;al.

         <title>Photochromic Fentanyl Derivatives for Controlled &#956;&#8208;Opioid Receptor Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive fentanyl&#8208;based ligands provide the opportunity to spatially, temporally, and non&#8208;invasively regulate &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor activity by using light. The repertoire of such ligands has been expanded in this work, yielding a desirable selection that differ in photophysical properties and/or metabotropic response.







Abstract
Photoswitchable ligands as biological tools provide an opportunity to explore the kinetics and dynamics of the clinically relevant &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor. These ligands can potentially activate or deactivate the receptor when desired by using light. Spatial and temporal control of biological activity allows for application in a diverse range of biological investigations. Photoswitchable ligands have been developed in this work, modelled on the known agonist fentanyl, with the aim of expanding the current &#8220;toolbox&#8221; of fentanyl photoswitchable ligands. In doing so, ligands have been developed that change geometry (isomerize) upon exposure to light, with varying photophysical and biochemical properties. This variation in properties could be valuable in further studying the functional significance of the &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence of a Dinuclear Platinum(II) Compound: Mechanism and Roles of an Upper Triplet State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;state (S0, S1, T1, and T2) model is proposed to rationalize the TADF behavior of a dinuclear Pt(II) compound and two up&#8208;conversion channels are found to contribute TADF at 300&#8197;K: the direct T1&#8594;S1 channel and the T2&#8208;mediated T1&#8594;T2&#8594;S1 one. Both channels contribute to TADF.







Abstract
A dinuclear Pt(II) compound was reported to exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF); however, the luminescence mechanism remains elusive. To reveal relevant excited&#8208;state properties and luminescence mechanism of this Pt(II) compound, both density function theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out in this work. In terms of the results, the S1 and T2 states show mixed intraligand charge transfer (ILCT)/metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand CT (MLCT) characters while the T1 state exhibits mixed ILCT/ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal CT (LMCT) characters. Mechanistically, a four&#8208;state (S0, S1, T1, and T2) model is proposed to rationalize the TADF behavior. The reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process from the initial T1 to final S1 states involves two up&#8208;conversion channels (direct T1&#8594;S1 and T2&#8208;mediated T1&#8594;T2&#8594;S1 pathways) and both play crucial roles in TADF. At 300&#8197;K, these two channels are much faster than the T1 phosphorescence emission enabling TADF. However, at 80&#8197;K, these rISC rates are reduced by several orders of magnitude and become very small, which blocks the TADF emission; instead, only the phosphorescence is observed. These findings rationalize the experimental observation and could provide useful guidance to rational design of organometallic materials with superior TADF performances.

         <title>Infusion of Variable Chemical Structure to Tune Stacking among Metal&#8211;Organic Layers in 2D Nano MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking vs thickness: Stacking between the metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs) of MOFs determines their thickness: the higher the stacking, the higher the thickness. This thickness plays an important role in controlling the function of the material, hence, regulating the stacking in 2D nano&#8208;MOFs might be very important. We tuned the stacking by modulating the chemical structure of the organic linkers in a series of isostructural MOFs. AFM, XRPD, FESEM, etc. showed the chemical functionality of the linkers to play a pivotal role in modulating stacking efficiency. Such an approach might open a new avenue in controlling the thickness of 2D materials. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Manna, S. Ida et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201665).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Dipolar cycloadditions of azomethine ylide (three atoms highlighted in yellow) and a broad scope of alkenyl boronates (the former C=C bond is highlighted in green) provide bi&#8208; and trifunctional 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines with diverse substitution patterns (including fused and spirocyclic ones) valuable for synthetic and medicinal chemistry. The background photo of a beautiful steep shore was taken at the locally well&#8208;recognized Stanislav canyon in the Kherson region, Ukraine. More information can be found in the Research Article by O.&#8197;O. Grygorenko and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202117). The invaluable help of Vladyslava Prykhodko with artwork preparation is appreciated.

         <title>Vibrational Circular Dichroism Unravels Supramolecular Chirality and Hydration Polymorphism of Nucleoside Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular VCD of nucleoside crystal solvomorphs: Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra of guanosine microcrystals exhibit sign inversion upon reversible crystal hydration/dehydration. Such spectral changes occur due to alteration of molecular arrangement in the crystal. Supramolecular chirality of the crystals brings about two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of the VCD signal, thus enabling almost instantaneous spectra measurements. This could be utilized in pharmaceutical industry, e.&#8201;g. for quality and stability control.







Abstract
Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy has been widely used to study (bio)molecules in solution. However, its solid&#8208;state applications have been restricted due to experimental limitations and artifacts. Having overcome some of them, the first VCD study of nucleoside crystals is now presented. A two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement of VCD signal was observed due to high molecular order in the crystals and resulting supramolecular chirality. This allowed to obtain high&#8208;quality VCD spectra within minutes using minute amounts of samples. The VCD technique is extremely sensitive in detecting changes in a crystal order and is able to distinguish different hydration states of crystals. This elevates it to a new level, as a fast and efficient tool to study chiral crystalline samples. This study demonstrates that VCD is capable of near&#8208;instantaneous detection of hydration polymorphs and crystal degradation, which is of substantial interest in pharmaceutical industry (quality and stability control).

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Transitions Govern the Reactivity and Photophysics of Vicinally Diphosphanyl&#8208;Substituted Diborapentacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction provides facile access to the ambipolar dihydrodiborapentacene P with two vicinal Ph2P substituents. Irradiation with visible light leads to a pronounced P&#8208;to&#8208;B charge transfer, which impacts the optoelectronic properties and reactivity of P and can in turn be modulated by Ph2P oxidation or transition&#8208;metal coordination.







Abstract
2,3&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;5,14&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,14&#8208;diborapentacene (DBP) was endowed with two vicinal Ph2P groups by an SNAr reaction at both CF sites using Ph2PSiMe3. Computations reveal the ambipolar product P to undergo P&#8208;to&#8208;B charge transfer under ambient light irradiation. Consequently, P is prone to photooxidation by air, yielding the Ph2P(O) species PO. With S8 or [Me3O][BF4], P furnishes the Ph2P(S) or Ph2P(Me)+ derivatives PS or [PMe][BF4]2. Along the series P, PO, PS, and [PMe][BF4]2, the redox potentials shift anodically from E1/2=&#8722;1.89&#8197;V to &#8722;1.02&#8197;V (CH2Cl2). Thus, derivatization of the Ph2P group allows late&#8208;stage modulation of the LUMO&#8208;energy level of the DBP. Derivatization also influences the emission properties of the compounds, as PO shows green (521&#8197;nm) and [PMe][BF4]2 red (622&#8197;nm) fluorescence in C6H6, while P and PS are dark. With CuBr and AgBr, P forms dimeric [M(&#956;&#8208;Br)]2 complexes [PCu]2 and [PAg]2, which show pronounced metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT), making P a promising ligand for photocatalysts.

Derivatization also influences the emission properties of the compounds, as &lt;b&gt;PO&lt;/b&gt; shows green (521&#8197;nm) and [&lt;b&gt;PMe&lt;/b&gt;][BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; red (622&#8197;nm) fluorescence in C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, while &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;PS&lt;/b&gt; are dark. With CuBr and AgBr, &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; forms dimeric [M(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;-Br)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complexes [&lt;b&gt;PCu&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [&lt;b&gt;PAg&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which show pronounced metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), making &lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt; a promising ligand for photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemoselective Coupling of &#960;&#8208;Systems to Access Metallated 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;Skipped Dienes in Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating distinct unsaturated C&#8211;C systems while simultaneously installing metallic groups has been significantly challenging to execute in a multicomponent reaction. Therefore, designing a suitable mechanistic pathway that provides the required reactivity and selectivity for target C&#8211;C bonds with metallic reagents to ensure successful coupling is the key to success. Copper&#8208;catalyzed borylallylation and silylallylation have emerged as the most efficient strategies for assembling borylated/silylated skipped (1,4 or 1,5) dienes by catalytically combining an organocopper intermediate with allyl electrophiles. However, reactions involving interelemental reagents (e.g., [Si]&#8211;[B]) to accomplish intermolecular atom&#8208;economic couplings have not been studied thoroughly. Therefore, to aid the development of new transformations in this research area, we attempted to include all precedents, including our recent studies. The present Concept article may be extremely useful for researchers working in this area as it provides a strong conceptual framework.</dc:description>

         <title>CH&#8208;&#960;&#160;Multi&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Driven Recognition and Isolation of Planar Compounds in a Spheroidal Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions are established as a powerful supramolecular tool, whereas the usability of CH&#8208;&#960; interactions has been rather limited so far. Here we present (i) selective binding of planar polyaromatics and (ii) effective isolation of planar metal complexes by a polyaromatic capsule, utilizing multiple CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. In the spheroidal cavity, one molecule of large and medium&#8208;sized polyaromatic molecules (i.e., coronene and pyrene) is exclusively bound from mixtures bearing the same number of aromatic CH groups. Theoretical studies reveal that multiple host&#8208;guest CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (up to 32 interactions) are the predominant driving force for the observed selectivity. In addition, one molecule of planar metal complexes (i.e., porphine and bis(acetylacetonato) Cu(II) complexes) is quantitatively bound by the capsule through aromatic and aliphatic CH&#8208;&#960; multi&#8208;interactions, respectively. The ESR and theoretical studies demonstrate the isolation capability of the capsular framework and an unusual polar environment in the polyaromatic cavity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Photochemical Macrocyclization Route to Asymmetric Strained [3.2]Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The intricate frameworks of paracyclophanes found in various chiral auxiliars, solar cells, high&#8208;performance plastics, pharmaceuticals, and molecular machines have become an important target for synthesis. Whereas numerous methods exist for the preparation of symmetric paracyclophanes, protocols for the efficient synthesis of strained asymmetric scaffolds are limited. Here we report a remarkable simple photochemical route to strained [3.2]paracyclophanes starting from readily available educts. By way of NMR and x&#8208;ray analyses, we discovered that UV&#8208;irradiation of an aromatic carboxylic ester tethered to a toluene moiety leads to the intramolecular formation of a new C&#8208;C bond, with loss of an alcohol. A systematic evaluation of the reaction conditions and substituents, as well as radical starter and triplet quenching experiments suggest a reaction mechanism involving an excited triplet state and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). The robust and versatile new method succeeded in the synthesis of range of cyclophanes with different substitutions, including an unusual diastereoisomer with two planar chiral centers and thus proved to be a valuable addition for the synthetic toolbox.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Auxiliary&#8208;mediated Native Chemical Ligation at Challenging Junctions with Pyridine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To expand the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond reactions at cysteine, ligation auxiliaries are appended to the peptide N&#8208;terminus. We introduced the first pyridine&#8208;containing auxiliary which provided access to challenging junctions (proline or &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids). Probing the role of the pyridine ring nitrogen, we observed side reactions leading to preliminary auxiliary loss. Herein, we introduce a new, easy to attach &#946;&#8208;mercapto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinyl)&#8208;ethyl (MMPyE) auxiliary, which 1) has increased stability, 2) enables NCL at sterically encumbered junctions (e.g. Leu&#8208;Val) and 3) allows removal under mildly basic (pH 8.5) conditions. The synthesis of a 120 aa long peptide containing eight MUC5AC tandem repeats via ligation of two 60mers demonstrates the usefulness. Making use of hitherto unexplored NCL to tyrosine, the MMPyE auxiliary provided access to a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8208;cyclized 21&#8208;mer peptide and a His  6  &#8208;tagged hexaphosphorylated peptide comprising 6 heptapeptide repeats of the RNA polymerase II C&#8208;terminal domain.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiodivergent Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution: Conversion of Racemic Propargyl Alcohols into Both Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural lipases typically recognize enantiomers of alcohols based on size differences of substituents near the carbinol moiety and selectively react with (  R  )&#8208;enantiomers of secondary alcohols. Therefore, lipase&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols produces only (  R  )&#8208;enantiomers. We report herein a method for obtaining (  S  )&#8208;enantiomers by DKR of secondary 3&#8208;(trialkylsilyl)propargyl alcohols using a well&#8208;known (  R  )&#8208;selective  Pseudomonas fluorescens  lipase in combination with a racemization catalyst VMPS4, in which the silyl group reverses the size relationship of substituents near the carbinol moiety. Since we have already reported (  R  )&#8208;selective DKR of the corresponding propargyl alcohols without substituents on the ethynyl terminal carbon, the presence of an easily removable silyl group has enabled us to produce both enantiomers of propargyl alcohols in high chemical yields and with high enantiomeric excess. In addition, the immobilization of the lipase on Celite was found to be important for achieving the high efficiency of the DKR.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Natural lipases typically recognize enantiomers of alcohols based on size differences of substituents near the carbinol moiety and selectively react with (  R  )-enantiomers of secondary alcohols. Therefore, lipase-catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic secondary alcohols produces only (  R  )-enantiomers. We report herein a method for obtaining (  S  )-enantiomers by DKR of secondary 3-(trialkylsilyl)propargyl alcohols using a well-known (  R  )-selective  Pseudomonas fluorescens  lipase in combination with a racemization catalyst VMPS4, in which the silyl group reverses the size relationship of substituents near the carbinol moiety. Since we have already reported (  R  )-selective DKR of the corresponding propargyl alcohols without substituents on the ethynyl terminal carbon, the presence of an easily removable silyl group has enabled us to produce both enantiomers of propargyl alcohols in high chemical yields and with high enantiomeric excess. In addition, the immobilization of the lipase on Celite was found to be important for achieving the high efficiency of the DKR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light mediated chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;aryl imino esters was demonstrated. The methodology has allowed the efficient and practical preparation of &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. The mechanism of the reaction was probed by DFT calculations and deuteration experiments, indicated deuterium was introduced into amino acid esters efficiently (up to 99% D ratio), enabling a feasible way to obtain deuterated amino acids using D  2  O as a cheap deuterium source.</dc:description>

         <title>Observing Nearby Nuclei on Paramagnetic Trityls and MOFs via DNP and Electron Decoupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is an NMR sensitivity enhancement technique that mediates polarization transfer from unpaired electrons to NMR&#8208;active nuclei. Despite its success in elucidating important structural information on biological and inorganic materials, the detailed polarization&#8208;transfer pathway&#8212;from the electrons to the nearby and then the bulk solvent nuclei, and finally to the molecules of interest&#8212;remains unclear. In particular, the nuclei in the paramagnetic polarizing agent play significant roles in relaying the enhanced NMR polarizations to more remote nuclei. Despite their importance, the direct NMR observation of these nuclei is challenging because of poor sensitivity. Here, we show that a combined DNP and electron decoupling approach can enable direct NMR detection of these nuclei. We achieved an ~80% improvement in NMR intensity via electron decoupling at 0.35 T and 80 K on trityl radicals. Moreover, we recorded a DNP enhancement factor of &#120576; ~ 90 and ~11% higher NMR intensity using electron decoupling on paramagnetic metal&#8208;organic framework, magnesium hexaoxytriphenylene (MgHOTP MOF).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;The introduction of pseudo&#8208;meta PCPs into carbon&#8208;based macrocycles allowed us to obtain four enantiopure polygon&#8208;shaped structures in high yield, displaying unprecedented large molar circular dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles and high absorption dissymmetry factors.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202201764).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is the group of Marcel Mayor at the University of Basel with co&#8208;workers Olaf Fuhr and Dieter Fenske from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The image depicts the studied all&#8208;carbon polygon shaped macrocycles along with their intense circular dichroism spectra in the background. The bright light within the macrocycles displays its efficient conjugation. Read the full text of the article at 10.1002/chem.202201764.

         <title>Phomoxanthone A Targets ATP Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phomoxanthone A is a naturally occurring molecule and a powerful anti&#8208;cancer agent, although its mechanism of action is unknown. To facilitate the determination of its biological target(s) we used affinity&#8208;based labelling using a phomoxanthone A probe. Labelled proteins were pulled down, subjected to chemoproteomics analysis using LC&#8208;MS/MS and ATP synthase was identified as a likely target. Mitochondrial ATP synthase was validated in cultured cells lysates and in live intact cells. Our studies show sixty percent inhibition of ATP synthase by 260&#160; m M phomoxanthone A.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trianionic polymethines of the A&#8242;&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8242; type comprising the dioxaborine rings (A) and different electron accepting end&#8208;groups (A&#8242;) were synthesized. The obtained dyes absorb and emit light in the near&#8208;infrared region with remarkably high molar attenuation coefficients (&#603;, up to 495&#8201;000 M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1  in DMF) and fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;f, up to 0.73 in DMF). Thus, the novel trianionic dyes take a stand among the brightest individual fluorophores known to date&#8212;with the magnitude of fluorescence brightness (&#603;&#8729;&#934;f) of 313&#8201;000 M&#8722;1cm&#8722;1  in DMF. The synthesized dyes demonstrate a minor negative solvatochromism and small Stokes shifts. The X&#8208;ray data reveal the nearly planar geometry of the trianionic chromophore. All the obtained compounds are stable in the solid state and in a solution, although the relative stability is much higher in polar aprotic than in protic solvents.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly active La(III)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework as a heterogeneous Lewis acid catalyst for Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a novel La(III)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional (2&#8208;D) metal&#8208;organic framework, [La  2/3  (qptca)  1/2  ] (referred to as SLX&#8208;2), from LaCl  3  and 1,1':4',1'':4'',1''':4''',1''''&#8208;quinquephenyl]&#8208;2,2'',2'''',5''&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid (H  4  qptca) was synthesized by conventional solvothermal method and thoroughly characterized using X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. The 2&#8208;D SLX&#8208;2 features a unique lanthanum center exposed to the skeleton and then was used as an efficient Lewis acid catalyst for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indole and pyrrole with &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene along with a wide substrate scope, giving the desired products in good to high yields under the optimal reaction conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst was used for twenty cycles, with nearly no effect on its activity, and the reaction was heterogeneous in nature. Moreover, compared to the previous hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating MOF catalysts for such alkylation reactions, SLX&#8208;2 showed an excellent stability toward harsh acidic and basic environment, and gave comparable catalytic activities.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, a novel La(III)-based two-dimensional (2-D) metal-organic framework, [La  2/3  (qptca)  1/2  ] (referred to as SLX-2), from LaCl  3  and 1,1':4',1'':4'',1''':4''',1''''-quinquephenyl]-2,2'',2'''',5''-tetracarboxylic acid (H  4  qptca) was synthesized by conventional solvothermal method and thoroughly characterized using X-ray single crystal diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. The 2-D SLX-2 features a unique lanthanum center exposed to the skeleton and then was used as an efficient Lewis acid catalyst for the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of indole and pyrrole with &#946;-nitrostyrene along with a wide substrate scope, giving the desired products in good to high yields under the optimal reaction conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst was used for twenty cycles, with nearly no effect on its activity, and the reaction was heterogeneous in nature. Moreover, compared to the previous hydrogen-bond-donating MOF catalysts for such alkylation reactions, SLX-2 showed an excellent stability toward harsh acidic and basic environment, and gave comparable catalytic activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bicomponent Cocatalyst Decoration on Flux&#8208;assisted CaTaO2N Single Crystals for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cubic&#8208;like CaTaO  2  N photocatalysts with high crystallinity and uniform particle size were successfully prepared by the flux&#8208;assisted nitridation method. The growth of CaTaO  2  N single crystals under different synthesis conditions was systematically investigated to understand the effects of the crystallinity and optical property on photocatalytic performance of CO  2  reduction. Moreover, the modification of CaTaO  2  N single crystals with core&#8208;shell Ni&#8208;Ag bicomponent cocatalyst by two&#8208;step decoration process exhibited higher rate of CO evolution than the deposition of sole Ag cocatalyst, because of the synergistic effects of bicomponent cocatalyst on the interfacial electron transfer and surface catalytic process. This study provides a valuable way to construct high&#8208;crystalline photocatalysts with effective bicomponent cocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO  2  reduction with H  2  O.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated reversible thermochromism, high Tc, dielectric switch and narrow band gap in one multifunctional ferroic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid (OIH) materials for multifunctional switchable applications have attracted enormous attentions in recent years due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and good structural tunability. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate one simple OIH compound with multi&#8208;functionals properties, such as dielectric switching, thermochromic properties, semiconductor characteristics and ferroelasticity. Under this context, we successfully synthesized [2&#8208;(2&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;amine]2SnBr6 (compound 1), which has a higher phase transition temperature of 427.7 K. Additionally, it exhibits a semiconducting property with an indirect band gap of 2.36 eV. Combining ferroelastic, narrow band gap, thermochromic, and dielectric properties, compound 1 can be considered as a rarely reported multi&#8208;functional ferroelastic material, which is expected to give inspiration for broadening the new applications in the multifunctional smart devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclic and Acyclic ortho&#8208;Aryloxy Diaryliodonium Salts for Chemoselective Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two regioselective, high&#8208;yielding one&#8208;pot routes to oxygen&#8208;bridged cyclic diaryliodonium salts and&#160;  ortho  &#8208;aryloxy&#8208;substituted acyclic diaryliodonium salts are presented. Starting from easily available&#160;  ortho  &#8208;iodo diaryl ethers, complete selectivity in formation of either the cyclic or acyclic product could be achieved by varying the reaction conditions. The complimentary reactivities of these novel ortho&#8208;oxygenated iodonium salts were demonstrated through a series of chemoselective arylations under metal&#8208;catalyzed and metal&#8208;free conditions, to deliver a range of novel,&#160;  ortho  &#8208;functionalized diaryl ether derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of metal carbonyl stretching frequencies in the second coordination sphere through the internal Stark effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spectroscopic and computational examination of a homologous series of rhodium(I) pybox carbonyl complexes has revealed a correlation between the conformation of the flanking aryl&#8208;substituted oxazoline donors and the carbonyl stretching frequency. This relationship is also observed experimentally for octahedral rhodium(III) and ruthenium(II) variants and cannot be explained through the classical, Dewar&#8211;Chatt&#8211;Duncanson, interpretation of metal&#8208;carbonyl bonding. Instead, these findings are reconciled by local changes in the magnitude of the electric field that is projected along the metal&#8208;carbonyl vector: the internal Stark effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented Combination of Polyketide Natural Product Fragments Identifies the New Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Inhibitor Grismonone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudo&#8208;natural products (pseudo&#8208;NPs) are de novo combinations of natural product (NP) fragments that define novel bioactive chemotypes. For their discovery, new design principles are being sought. Previously, pseudo&#8208;NPs were synthesized by the combination of fragments originating from biosynthetically unrelated NPs to guarantee structural novelty and novel bioactivity. We report the combination of fragments from biosynthetically related NP in novel arrangements to yield a novel chemotype with activity not shared by the guiding fragments. We describe the synthesis of the polyketide pseudo&#8208;NP grismonone and identify it as a structurally novel and potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signalling. The insight that the de novo combination of fragments derived from biosynthetically related NPs also may yield new biologically relevant compound classes with unexpected bioactivity may be considered a chemical extension or diversion of existing biosynthetic pathways and greatly expands the opportunities for exploration of biologically relevant chemical space by means of the pseudo&#8208;NP principle.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Dendritic Magneto&#8208;Plasmonic Nanostructures Applied to Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical analyses in the field using surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) protocols are expected to be part of several analytical procedures applied to water quality monitoring. To date, these endeavors have been supported by developments on SERS substrate nanofabrication, instrumentation portability and the internet of things. Here, we report distinct chemical strategies for preparing magneto&#8208;plasmonic (Fe  3  O  4  :Au) colloids, which are relevant in the context of trace level detection of water contaminants due to their inherent multifunctionality. The main objective of this research is to investigate the role of poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAM) in the preparation of SERS substrates integrating both functionalities in single nanostructures. Three chemical routes have been investigated to design magneto&#8208;plasmonic nanostructures which translate into different ways for assessing SERS detection using distinct interfaces. Hence, a series of magneto&#8208;plasmonic colloids have been characterized and then assessed for their SERS activity by using a model pesticide (thiram) dissolved in aqueous samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of a Synthetic Strategy for Garsubellin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Garsubellin A is a thirty&#8208;carbon meroterpenoid capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is associated with the symptoms of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity along with the novel molecular architecture, this plant metabolite has remained a popular synthetic target. Herein we report a full account of our synthetic investigations that have led to the enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin A, establishing its absolute stereostructure. The protecting group&#8208;free, twelve&#8208;step synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of the natural (&#8211;)&#8208;garsubellin A and its unnatural (+)&#8208;antipode.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Mechanistic Aspects on [3 + 2]&#160;Cycloaddition Reactions of Azides to Nitroolefins: A Computational and Kinetic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[3+2] cycloadditions of nitroolefins have emerged as a selective and catalyst&#8208;free alternative for the synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from azides. We describe mechanistic studies into the cycloaddition/rearomatization reaction sequence. DFT calculations revealed a rate&#8208;limiting cycloaddition step proceeding via an asynchronous TS with high kinetic selectivity for the 1,5&#8208;triazole. Kinetic studies reveal a second&#8208;order rate law, and  13  C kinetic isotopic effects at natural abundance were measured with a significant normal effect at the conjugated olefinic centers of 1.0158 and 1.0216 at the &#945; and &#946;&#8208;carbons of &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene. Distortion/interaction&#8208;activation strain and energy decomposition analyses revealed that the major regioisomeric pathway benefits from an earlier and less&#8208;distorted TS, while intermolecular interaction terms dominate the preference for 1,5&#8208; over 1,4&#8208;cycloadducts. In addition, the major regioisomer also has more favorable electrostatic and dispersion terms. Additionally, while static DFT calculations suggest a concerted but highly asynchronous  Ei  &#8208;type HNO  2  elimination mechanism, quasiclassical direct&#8208;dynamics calculations reveal the existence of a dynamic intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Architecture of an Amphiphilic Amino Alcohol as a Versatile Chiral Environment for Stereocontrolled Photoreaction of Various Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular architecture of an amphiphilic amino alcohol serves as unprecedentedly versatile chiral environment, which can efficiently control the stereochemistry of the self&#8208;photocyclodimerization of various anthracenes (71&#8211;98&#8201;% regio ratio, 76&#8211;86&#8201;% ee) as well as the cross&#8208;photocyclodimerization between two anthracenes (58&#8201;% chemo ratio, 83&#8201;% regio ratio, 90&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
The photocyclodimerization of 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid has been extensively studied as a model reaction of asymmetric photochemistry. So far, numerous chiral environments have been employed to control this photoreaction, while the scope of photoreactants has been limited only to 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid and its simple esters and amides. Here, we developed a systematic series of photoreactants (2&#8201;a&#8211;d) by introducing various substituents to 2&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid, which showed different reactivities and selectivities depending on the substituents. By using the photoreactants 2&#8201;a&#8211;d, we evaluated the performance of a chiral environment composed of an amphiphilic amino alcohol (1), where the photocyclodimerization of 2&#8201;a&#8211;d generally proceeded in excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (71&#8211;98&#8201;% regio ratio, 76&#8211;86&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, by reacting 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b together in the chiral environment of 1, we succeeded in the first stereocontrolled cross&#8208;photocyclodimerization between two prochiral anthracenes (58&#8201;% chemo ratio, 83&#8201;% regio ratio, 90&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Unravelling the Role of the Pentafluoroorthotellurate Group as a Ligand in Nickel Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The homoleptic [Ni(OTeF5)4]2&#8722; anion has been selectively prepared and arises as an analogue of [NiF4]2&#8722;, but featuring the discrete tetrahedral geometry of the heavier halonickelates. This high&#8208;spin complex has enabled the investigation of the electronic properties of the [OTeF5]&#8722; group in coordination chemistry, showing that it behaves as the fluoride also in ligand&#8208;field terms.







Abstract
The pentafluoroorthotellurate group (teflate, OTeF5) is able to form species, for which only the fluoride analogues are known. Despite nickel fluorides being widely investigated, nickel teflates have remained elusive for decades. By reaction of [NiCl4]2&#8722; and neat ClOTeF5, we have synthesized the homoleptic [Ni(OTeF5)4]2&#8722; anion, which presents a distorted tetrahedral structure, unlike the polymeric [NiF4]2&#8722;. This high&#8208;spin complex has allowed the study of the electronic properties of the teflate group, which can be classified as a weak/medium&#8208;field ligand, and therefore behaves as the fluoride analogue also in ligand&#8208;field terms. The teflate ligands in [NEt4]2[Ni(OTeF5)4] are easily substituted, as shown by the formation of [Ni(NCMe)6][OTeF5]2 by dissolving it in acetonitrile. Nevertheless, careful reactions with other conventional ligands have enabled the crystallization of nickel teflate complexes with different coordination geometries, i.e. [NEt4]2[trans&#8208;Ni(OEt2)2(OTeF5)4] or [NEt4][Ni(bpyMe2)(OTeF5)3].

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Metathesis: Recent Theoretical and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;catalyzed olefin metathesis is high on the list of existing challenges in chemistry. Iron is one of the most abundant elements in the earth&#8216;s crust, and, therefore, iron catalysts would offer highly attractive alternatives to Ru&#8208; and Mo&#8208;based catalysts. This Review summarizes the key recent theoretical and experimental advances towards the development of iron&#8208;catalyzed olefin metathesis.







Abstract
The &#8220;metathesis reaction&#8221; is a straightforward and often metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical reaction that transforms two hydrocarbon molecules to two new hydrocarbons by exchange of molecular fragments. Alkane, alkene and alkyne metathesis have become an important tool in synthetic chemistry and have provided access to complex organic structures. Since the discovery of industrial olefin metathesis in the 1960s, many modifications have been reported; thus, increasing scope and improving reaction selectivity. Olefin metathesis catalysts based on high&#8208;valent group six elements or Ru(IV) have been developed and improved through ligand modifications. In addition, significant effort was invested to realize olefin metathesis with a non&#8208;toxic, bio&#8208;compatible and one of the most abundant elements in the earth&#8242;s crust; namely, iron. First evidences suggest that low&#8208;valent Fe(II) complexes are active in olefin metathesis. Although the latter has not been unambiguously established, this review summarizes the key advances in the field and aims to guide through the challenges.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;based Photochromic Delivery Vehicles for Ions and Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;based supramolecular photochromic scaffold for the light&#8208;controlled binding and release of the guest molecules such as anions, cations, and neutral molecules have been demonstrated. These smart photochromic&#8208;hosts display light&#8208;induced change in molecular recognition and thus can act as the light&#8208;driven delivery vehicle for the external analytes.







Abstract
Molecular switches have been used as delivery vehicles for various molecular and ionic species. The ones that reversibly operate with light are arguably the best candidates for the purpose as they can be operated using light. The two states of these photoswitchable systems often possess remarkable differences in terms of their structural features and electronic properties. Photochromic systems with the appropriate embellishment of functionalities at suitable positions have thus been used as photoresponsive receptors. The use of light&#8208;driven alterations of the structural features has led to differential molecular recognition with these switchable host molecules. In this article, we discuss the use of such supramolecular systems as the delivery vehicles for ions and molecules that started with the pioneering work by Shinkai back in 1979. This review will explicitly cover the development from 2001 to 2022 with some past background and the future prospects of the field.

         <title>Dehydrocoupling Polymerization: Poly(silylether) Synthesis by Using an Iron &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient iron catalyzed method for the formation of poly(silylether)s has been developed, where the only by&#8208;product of the reaction is hydrogen gas. Fourteen different polymers have been prepared, which show a range of different thermal properties. Insight into the reaction, which proceeds via a condensation polymerization mechanism is provided.







Abstract
We describe the iron&#8208;catalyzed polymerizations of diol and silane monomers to obtain fourteen different poly(silylether) products with number average molecular weights (Mn) up to 36.3&#8197;kDa. The polymerization reactions developed in this study are operationally simple and applicable to 1&#176; and 2&#176; silane monomer substrates and a range of benzylic and aliphatic diol substrates as well as one polyol example. The polymers were characterized by IR spectroscopy, DSC and TGA and, where solubility allowed, 1H, 13C{1H}, 29Si{1H} NMR spectroscopies, GPC and MALDI&#8208;TOF were also employed. The materials obtained displayed low Tg values (&#8722;70.6 to 19.1&#8201;&#176;C) and were stable upon heating up to T&#8211;5%,Ar 421.6&#8201;&#176;C. A trend in T&#8211;5%,Ar was observed whereby use of a 2&#176; silane leads to higher T&#8211;5%,Ar compared to those obtained using a 1&#176; silane. Reaction monitoring was undertaken by in situ gas evolution studies coupled with GPC analysis to follow the progression of chain&#8208;length growth which confirmed a condensation polymerization&#8208;type mechanism.

         <title>Hydrophilic Chitosan Derivatives: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature&#8208;sourced polymer alternatives have attracted increasing attention for applications in medicine, cosmetics, agriculture, food, water purification, and more. Among those, chitosan, is the most versatile due to its full biodegradability, exceptional biocompatibility, multipurpose bioactivity, and low toxicity. Although remarkable progress has been made regarding its synthetic modifications using C3/C6 secondary/primary hydroxyl (&#8208;OH) and the C2 amino (&#8208;NH2) active sites, its solubility under physiological conditions remained limited and hampered larger&#8208;scale adoption. This minireview summarizes different synthetic methods that increase chitosan's hydrophilicity and water solubility using covalent modifications, namely, amino acid addition, quaternary ammonium formation, phosphorylation, and carboxymethylation. We also reviewed several applications for each type of substitution in fields such as cosmetics, medicine, agriculture, water purification etc., and provided an outlook and perspective for future modifications and implementations.</dc:description>

         <title>Labile Base&#8208;Stabilized Silyliumylidene Ions. Non&#8208;Metallic Species Capable of Activating Multiple Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various base&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ions with different ligands were synthesized. Their behaviour appeared strongly dependent on the type of ligand. Indeed, in contrast to the poorly reactive silyliumylidenes stabilized by strongly donating ligands (DMAP, NHC), the sulfide&#8208;supported one (SMe  2  ) exhibits higher reactivity toward various small molecules. Furthermore, their capability to successively activate multiple small molecules was clearly demonstrated by processes involving successive reactions with silane / formamide, CO  2  and H  2  . Of particular interest, the silyliumylidene&#8208;silylene complex is one of the very rare species able to activate two H  2  molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Capturing a Pentacyclic Fragment&#8208;Based Library Derived from Perophoramidine: Their Design, Synthesis and Evaluation as Anticancer Compounds by DNA Double&#8208;Strand Breaks (DSB) and PARP&#8208;1 Inhibition</title>

A Pentacyclic fragment inspired from Perophoramidine. Natural product inspired PARP inhibitor.







Abstract
Herein we have reported the discovery of a pentacyclic building block comprised of fused indole&#8208;quinoline and piperidinone from the natural product perophoramidine as a formidable anticancer agent. The compounds were synthesized in six steps where the key steps involved a blue LED mediated intramolecular cyclopropanation of the indole intermediates and concomitant reduction of the associated aryl nitro moiety to nitroso in the molecule. Cytotoxicity screening of the compounds against an array of cancer cells that is, MCF7, HCT116 and A549 demonstrated 0.6 to 9&#8197;&#956;M IC50s by few of the compounds. &#947;H2AX immunofluorescence assay of the two most potent molecules from the phenotypic screening with anti&#8208;&#947;&#8208;H2AX Alexa Fluor 488 antibody revealed extensive DNA damage of the A549 cells which indicated probable PARP inhibition (similar to Perophoramidine). Through molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies the binding efficiency of our compounds with poly(ADP&#8208;ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP 1) enzyme was determined. Chemiluminescent PARP Assay with Histone&#8208;coated strips indicated that the most active compounds from the phenotypic screening induced PARP&#8208;1 inhibition with IC50s of 1.3&#8594;1.5&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Arylfluorination of Alkenes: A Powerful New Approach to Organofluorine Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multitasking: One of the newly developed methods for accessing organofluorine compounds is Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylfluorination, which simultaneously introduces an aryl group and a fluorine atom into an olefin framework. This review provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.







Abstract
Fluorine incorporation into organic molecules is often beneficial to their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties or bioactivity. As a consequence, organofluorine compounds have become quite common amongst drugs and agrochemicals, and their preparation is a highly important topic in both synthetic organic chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry. One of the newly developed methods for accessing organofluorine compounds is Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylfluorination of alkenes. It is an olefin difunctionalization process that simultaneously introduces an aryl group and a fluorine atom into an alkene framework. This review provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.

         <title>Free Aluminylenes: An Emerging Class of Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbene analogues: Free aluminylenes and mono&#8208;base&#8208;stabilized aluminylenes are extremely reactive species. The ambiphilicity of these species allows facile activation of inert chemical bonds as well as coordination to transition metals in diverse modes. Free aluminylenes are potent synthons for unusual aluminium species.







Abstract
Aluminylenes (R&#8722;Al) are aluminium analogs of carbenes. In contrast to isolable carbenes, aluminylenes are extremely rare species. In the past years, pioneered by Schn&#246;ckel, Roesky and Power, a few free aluminylenes and their complexes have been reported. Such compounds have the aluminium atom in the oxidation state +I, which contrasts with classical organoaluminium derivatives that contain the element in the +III oxidation state. Aluminylenes, either in their free state or in the coordination sphere of a Lewis base, are capable of coordinating to transition metals and activating inert chemical bonds. Free aluminylenes are emerging as potent synthetic platforms for unusual aluminium species.

         <title>Dioxygen Activation by Redox&#8208;Active Bis(aldimine) Ligand Bridged Diruthenium Complex Possessing Singlet Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;centered dioxygen activation and oxygenation of bis(aldimine) core have been highlighted on a dinuclear Ru platform utilizing the concept of spin isomerism at the redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;ligand interface. Authentication of the complexes along with the redox non&#8208;innocence behavior of their bridge have been validated through structure, spectroelectrochemistry, and DFT calculations.







Abstract
The unexplored &#8216;actor&#8217; behavior of redox&#8208;active bis(aldimine) congener, p&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(picoline)aldimine (L1), towards dioxygen activation and subsequent functionalization of its backbone was demonstrated on coordination with {Ru(acac)2} (acac= acetylacetonate). Reaction under aerobic condition led to the one&#8208;pot generation of dinuclear complexes with unperturbed L1, imino&#8208;carboxamido (L2&#8722;), and bis(carboxamido) (L32&#8722;)&#8208;bridged isovalent {RuII(&#956;&#8208;L1)RuII}, 1/ {RuIII(&#956;&#8208;L32&#8722;)RuIII}, 3 and mixed&#8208;valent {RuII(&#956;&#8208;L2&#8722;)RuIII}, 2. Authentication of the complexes along with the redox non&#8208;innocence behavior of their bridge have been validated through structure, spectroelectrochemistry and DFT calculations. Kinetic and isotope labelling experiments together with DFT analyzed transition states justified the consideration of redox shuttling at metal/L1 interface for 3O2 activation despite of the closed shell configuration of 1 (S=0) to give carboxamido derived 2/3.

         <title>Bismuth gadolinium oxychloride with a remarkable visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive O2 evolution activity promoted by iodine doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive bismuth&#8208;based oxyhalide has recently attracted extensive attention, however, the promotion of its charge separation is still challenging. Herein, we introduce iodine into Bi2GdO4Cl to synthetize I&#8208;doped Bi2GdO4Cl (denoted as yI&#8208;Bi2GdO4Cl, 0&#8804;y&#8804;2).   The incorporation of I&#8208;  ions is found to enhance light absorption and to accelerate charge separation by combining various characterizations such as density functional theory calculation, photoelectrochemical test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectrum, and open&#8208;circuit voltage decay.  The O2&#8208;evolving performances of 1I&#8208;Bi2GdO4Cl with optimized dopant concentration of I&#8208;  ion and the IrO2  loaded 1I&#8208;Bi2GdO4Cl are tremendously promoted by  ca.  4 and 45 times compared with pristine Bi2GdO4Cl. Notably, The O2  evolution rate reaches as high as 154.8 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8208;1  with an apparent quantum efficiency of ~1.1% at 420 nm.  The synthetic iodine&#8208;doped photocatalyst remains stability after long&#8208;term photoreaction, demonstrating its potential  in the field of photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Tags in One Probe: Combining Fluorescence&#8208; and Biotin&#8208;based Detection of the Trypanosomal Cysteine Protease Rhodesain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly potent, bimodal activity&#8208;based probe for the therapeutically relevant cysteine protease rhodesain was developed. We utilized two different access points at the coumarin fluorophore for incorporation of the rhodesain inhibitor part and the biotin affinity label. The two reporter tags were employed for on&#8208;blot chemiluminescence detection and affinity purification as well as post&#8208;labeling quantification of the target protein by size exclusion chromatography with fluorescence detection.







Abstract
Rhodesain is the major cysteine protease of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei and a therapeutic target for sleeping sickness, a fatal neglected tropical disease. We designed, synthesized and characterized a bimodal activity&#8208;based probe that binds to and inactivates rhodesain. This probe exhibited an irreversible mode of action and extraordinary potency for the target protease with a kinac/Ki value of 37,000&#8197;M&#8722;1s&#8722;1. Two reporter tags, a fluorescent coumarin moiety and a biotin affinity label, were incorporated into the probe and enabled highly sensitive detection of rhodesain in a complex proteome by in&#8208;gel fluorescence and on&#8208;blot chemiluminescence. Furthermore, the probe was employed for microseparation and quantification of rhodesain and for inhibitor screening using a competition assay. The developed bimodal rhodesain probe represents a new proteomic tool for studying Trypanosoma pathobiochemistry and antitrypanosomal drug discovery.

         <title>Non&#8208;covalent integration of a [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase mimic to multiwalled carbon nanotubes for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface integration of molecular catalysts inspired from the active sites of hydrogenase enzymes represents a promising route towards developing noble metal&#8208;free and sustainable technologies for H  2  production. Efficient and stable catalyst anchoring is a key aspect to enable this approach. Here, we report the preparation and electrochemical characterization of an original diironhexacarbonyl&#160;complex including two pyrene groups per catalytic unit in order to allow for its smooth integration, through  pi&#8208;pi&#160;  interactions, onto MWNT based electrodes. In this configuration, the grafted catalyst could reach turnover numbers for H  2  production (TON  H2  ) of up to 3.5 &#177; 1.6 x 10  3  within 20 hours of bulk electrolysis, operating at neutral pH.  Post operando  analysis of catalyst func&#173;tionalized electrodes revealed the degradation of the catalytic unit occurred  via  loss of the Fe  2  (CO)  6  units, while the anchoring groups and most part of the ligand remained attached onto MWNT.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyne Activation in the Diversity Oriented Synthesis of sp2&#8208;Rich Scaffolds: A Biased Library Approach for Targeting Polynucleotides (DNA/RNA)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polynucleotides, DNA and RNA (mRNA and non&#8208;coding RNAs), are critically involved in molecular pathways. Small molecule binding interactions with polynucleotides can modify functional polynucleotide topologies and/or their interactions with proteins. Current approaches to library design (lead&#8208;like or fragment&#8208;like libraries) are based on protein&#8208;ligand interactions and often include careful consideration of the 3&#8208;dimensional orientation of binding motifs and exclude &#960;&#8208;rich compounds (polyfused aromatics) to avoid off&#8208;target R/DNA interactions. In contrast to proteins, where &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions are weak, polynucleotides can form strong &#960;,&#960;&#8208;interactions with suitable &#960;&#8208;rich ligands. To assist in designing a polynucleotide&#8208;biased library, a scaffold&#8208;divergent synthesis approach to polyfused aromatic scaffolds has been undertaken. Initial screening hits that form moderately stable polynucleotide&#8208;ligand&#8208;protein ternary complexes can be further optimised through judicious incorporation of substituents (R&#8208;groups) to increase protein&#8208;ligand interactions. An example of this approach is given for topoisomerase&#8208;1 (TOP1), generating a novel TOP1 inhibitory chemotype.</dc:description>

         <title>Discriminating Chiral Supramolecular Motions by Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular motions from the molecular level to the macroscopic scale were discriminated by circularly polarized luminescence, which was associated with the stage of assembly and the geometry of the hierarchically organized particles.







Abstract
Molecular motions are closely associated with the behaviors and properties of organic materials. However, monitoring molecular motions is challenging. Herein, a chiral supramolecular system consisting of L&#8208;/D&#8208;phenylalanine (LPF/DPF) as a chiral inducer and an achiral tetraphenylethene derivative (TPEF) as a molecular rotor has been proposed and explored for real&#8208;time discriminating the supramolecular motions by the visualization of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signal variations. Derived from the ordered molecular motions of TPEF induced by LPF/DPF, highly organized aggregates have been progressively assembled in a controlled manner with differentiated morphologies, including spherical particles, one&#8208;dimensional fibers, and floor&#8208;shaped supercrystals. Notably, increasing level of ordered aggregates, in turn, led to quenching emissions, while the CPL signals have been dramatically amplified accompanying by a sharp enhancement of luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) from nearly 0 to &#8722;0.1. The significant amplification of CPL is attributed to the ordered aggregates of supramolecules, leading to the decrease of electric transition dipole moments in supramolecular system. As a result of the chiral supramolecular motions powered by supramolecular crystallization, the supramolecular motions are conveniently discriminated by visual CPL signal variation with an enhancement of glum value from 0 to &#8722;0.1 in real time.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral macrocyclic dimers, trimers, and tetramers composed of paraphenylene and tethered binaphthyl were synthesized, and their molecular structures and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that multiple twisted molecular structures&#8212;dimer, trimer, and tetramer&#8212;adopt figure&#8208;eight, M&#246;bius triangle, and concave rectangle, respectively. These homologues provide large e values in their absorption spectra because of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the naphthalene&#8208;phenylene&#8208;naphthalene frameworks. Owing to the shape&#8208;persistent ring structure and tethering with &#8208;OCH  2  CH  2  O&#8208;, high fluorescence quantum yields and a relatively high dissymmetry factor  g  CPL  in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra were achieved.&#160;This results in CPL brightness (  B  CPL  ) over 100, which is greater than that of the conventional organic CPL&#8208;dye.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the effect of surface composition on multiwalled carbon nanotubes supported Pt&#8208;Fe alloy electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The designs of efficient and inexpensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are essential to boost the commercialization of direct methanol fuel cells. Here, the highly catalytic performance PtFe alloys supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) decorating nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) have been successfully prepared via co&#8208;engineering of the surface composition and electronic structure. The Pt  1  Fe  3  @NC/MWCNTs catalyst with moderate Fe  3+  feeding content (0.86 mA/mg  Pt  ) exhibits 2.26&#8208;fold enhancement in MOR mass activity compared to pristine Pt/C catalyst (0.38 mA/mg  Pt  ). Furthermore, the CO oxidation initial potential of Pt  1  Fe  3  @NC/MWCNTs catalyst is lower relative to Pt/C catalyst (0.71 V and 0.80 V). Benefited from the optimal surface compositions, the anti&#8208;corrosion ability of MWCNT, strong electron interaction between PtFe alloys and MWCNTs and the N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) layer, the Pt  1  Fe  3  @NC/MWCNTs catalyst presents an improved MOR performance and anti &#8208; CO poisoning ability. This study would open up new perspective for designing efficient electrocatalysts for the DMFCs field.</dc:description>

Furthermore, the CO oxidation initial potential of Pt  1  Fe  3  @NC/MWCNTs catalyst is lower relative to Pt/C catalyst (0.71 V and 0.80 V). Benefited from the optimal surface compositions, the anti-corrosion ability of MWCNT, strong electron interaction between PtFe alloys and MWCNTs and the N-doped carbon (NC) layer, the Pt  1  Fe  3  @NC/MWCNTs catalyst presents an improved MOR performance and anti - CO poisoning ability. This study would open up new perspective for designing efficient electrocatalysts for the DMFCs field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intermetallic Nanocrystals: Seed&#8208;Mediated Synthesis and Applications in Electrocatalytic Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, intermetallic nanocrystals (IMNCs) have attracted extensive attention in the field of electrocatalysis. However, precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs seems to be a challenge to the traditional method of high&#8208;temperature annealing although these parameters have a significant effect on the electrocatalytic performance. Controllable synthesis of IMNCs by the wet chemistry method in the liquid phase shows great potential compared with the traditional high&#8208;temperature annealing method. In this review, we attempt to summarize the preparation of IMNCs by the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis in the liquid phase, as well as their applications in electrocatalytic reduction reactions. Several representative examples are purposely selected for highlighting the huge potential of the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach in chemical synthesis. Specifically, we personally perceive the seed&#8208;mediated synthesis approach as a promising tool in the future for precise control over the size, shape, composition, structure, and exposed crystal facet of IMNCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction in Water to Imidazo[1,2a]pyridazines as Switchable DSEgens, AIEgens, and ACQgens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) luminophores exhibit strong emissions in both solution and solid states, filling the gaps between aggregation&#8208;induced emissions (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ). However, limited design concepts and complicated synthetic strategies restrict the discovery of novel DSE molecules. Developing efficient and green methodologies to access novel DSE scaffolds  via  rational design remains highly desirable. In this work, we report a water&#8208;promoted Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridazine derivatives with DSE properties. The intramolecular interactions of the neighboring benzene rings restrict molecular motion, leading to emissions in the solid state(quantum yield: 11%), and the newly constructed core structure of imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridazine ensures considerable planarity, allowing for emissions in solution. Further removal of the neighboring phenyl groups resulted in ACQgens, while additional methyl groups led to AIEgens. Subsequent live cell imaging investigations suggested that the novel DSEgens could serve as specific lipid droplet (LD) probes in a wide concentration range.</dc:description>

         <title>A Vicinal Diol Approach for the Total Synthesis of Molestin E, ent&#8208;Sinulacembranolide A and ent&#8208;Sinumaximol A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergent total synthesis of furanocembranoids (FC) molestin E, ent&#8208;sinulacembranolide A and ent&#8208;sinumaximol A was achieved in 20&#8211;21 steps in the longest linear sequence (LLS). Building blocks were coupled through a furan metalation sequence and macrocycle formation was effected by Shiina lactonisation. The primary target molestin E was elaborated late&#8208;stage to 12 novel FC compounds.







Abstract
In this work an approach for the synthesis of furanocembranoid natural products containing the C&#8208;7,8&#8208;diol moiety is disclosed. This culminated in the first total synthesis of the natural product molestin E, together with ent&#8208;sinulacembranolide A and ent&#8208;sinumaximol A as well as a thorough exploration of their chemistry. Late&#8208;stage ring&#8208;closure of the C&#8208;7,8&#8208;diols to the corresponding epoxides was also demonstrated. Key features of this synthetic strategy include a stereoselective Baylis&#8208;Hillman reaction, ring&#8208;closing metathesis and Shiina macrolactonisation. Chiral&#8208;pool materials were deployed to ensure the desired absolute stereochemistry which was confirmed by late&#8208;stage single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of an Azaoxyallyl Cation&#8208;Templated Intramolecular Aryl Amination Leading to Oxindole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed investigation on the reactivity of &#945;&#8208;arylated azaoxyallyl cation undergoing intramolecular nucleophilic aryl&#8208;amination under catalyst&#8208;free conditions is presented. Azaoxyallyl cation&#8208;guided ortho&#8208;activation of the adjacent aromatic ring is central to this process aided by HFIP. This reaction manifold offers broad access to oxindole derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, development and detailed investigation of a SN&#8242;&#8208;type intramolecular aromatic substitution reaction involving &#945;&#8208;arylazaoxyallyl cation intermediate, is disclosed. The study showcased that while &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;chlorohydroxamate could be activated by a combination of base and 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) into the corresponding azaoxyallyl cations, it could further emerge into a &#960;&#8208;extended species involving the adjacent &#945;&#8208;aryl moiety, and this transition is contingent on electronic effects of the aromatic ring as well as on &#945;&#8208;substituents. An effective activation of the &#945;&#8208;aromatic ring could pave the path for intramolecular Ar(Csp2)&#8208;N bond formation towards oxindoles. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggested that a non&#8208;pericyclic nucleophilic amination pathway is most likely operative and precluded the possibility of concerted or electrophilic amination mechanism. HFIP as the reaction solvent plays pivotal roles in the transformation.

         <title>Stabilization of Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Zeolite by Boron Substitution for the production of commercially applicable catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron substitution stabilizes the extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite EWT and increases its thermal stability to 850&#8201;&#176;C. B atoms preferentially substitute the interrupted Q3 sites and are partially converted into 3&#8208;coordination to relax framework deformation upon heating. After Al&#8208;reinsertion post&#8208;treatment, it shows higher ethylbenzene selectivity and ethylene conversion rate than commercial ZSM&#8208;5 and Beta zeolite in benzene alkylation reaction.







Abstract
Stable extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites are desirable for industrial purposes due to their ability to accommodate bulky reactants and diffusion through channels. Although there are several extra&#8208;large pore zeolites reported, stable ones are rare. Thus, their stabilization is a feasible strategy for industrial applications. Here, an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite EWT with boron substitution is presented, and the resulting zeolite B&#8208;RZM&#8208;3 increased the thermal stability from 600&#8201;&#176;C in its silica form to 850&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure, determined by combining continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), shows that B atoms preferentially substitute the interrupted (HO)T(OT)3 (Q3) sites and are partially converted into 3&#8208;coordination to relax framework deformation upon heating. After Al&#8208;reinsertion post&#8208;treatment, Al&#8208;B&#8208;RZM&#8208;3 shows higher ethylbenzene selectivity and ethylene conversion rate per mol acid site than commercial ZSM&#8208;5 and Beta zeolite in benzene alkylation reaction. Synthesizing extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolite in borosilicate form is a potential approach to stabilize interrupted zeolites for commercial applications.

Synthesizing extra-large-pore zeolite in borosilicate form is a potential approach to stabilize interrupted zeolites for commercial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Differential Tunneling&#8208;Driven and Vibrationally&#8208;Induced Reactivity in Isomeric Benzazirines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum mechanical tunneling of heavy&#8208;atoms and vibrational excitation chemistry are unconventional and scarcely explored types of reactivity. Once fully understood, they might bring new avenues to conduct chemical transformations, providing access to a new world of molecules or ways of exquisite reaction control. In this context, we present here the discovery of two isomeric benzazirines exhibiting differential tunneling&#8208;driven and vibrationally&#8208;induced reactivity, which constitute exceptional results for probing into the nature of these phenomena. The isomeric 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2  H  &#8208;benzazirines (  3&#8208;a  and  3'&#8208;s  ) were generated in cryogenic krypton matrixes by visible&#8208;light irradiation of the corresponding triplet nitrene  3  2&#8208;a  , which was produced by UV&#8208;light irradiation of its azide precursor. The  3'&#8208;s  was found stable under matrix dark conditions, whereas  3&#8208;a  spontaneously rearranges (&#964;  1/2  ~64 hours at 10 and 20 K) by heavy&#8208;atom tunneling to  3  2&#8208;a  . Near&#8208;IR&#8208;light irradiation at the first OH stretching overtone frequencies (remote vibrational antenna) of the benzazirines induces the  3'&#8208;s  ring&#8208;expansion reaction to a seven&#8208;member cyclic ketenimine, but the  3&#8208;a  undergoes 2  H  &#8208;azirine ring&#8208;opening reaction to triplet nitrene  3  2&#8208;a  . Computations demonstrate that  3&#8208;a  and  3'&#8208;s  have distinct reaction energy profiles, which explain the different experimental results. The spectroscopic direct measurement of the tunneling of  3&#8208;a  to  3  2&#8208;a  constitutes a unique example of an observation of a species reacting only by nitrogen tunneling. Moreover, the vibrationally&#8208;induced sole activation of the most favorable bond&#8208;breaking/bond&#8208;forming pathway available for  3&#8208;a  and  3'&#8208;s  provides pioneer results regarding the selective nature of such processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically and electronically flexible pyridylidene amine dinitrogen ligands at palladium: hemilabile cis/trans coordination and application in dehydrogenation catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligand design is crucial for the development of new catalysts and materials with novel properties. Here we describe the synthesis and unique hemilabile coordination properties of new bispyridylidene amine (bis&#8208;PYE) ligands to palladium, and preliminary catalytic activity of these complexes in formic acid dehydrogenation. The synthetic pathway to form cationic complexes [Pd(bisPYE)Cl(L)]X with a  cis  &#8208;coordinated  N,N&#8208;  bidentate bis&#8208;PYE ligand is flexible and provides access to a diversity of Pd(II) complexes with different ancillary ligands (L = pyridine, DMAP, PPh  3  , Cl, P(OMe)  3  ). The  1  H NMR chemical shift of the  trans  &#8208;positioned PYE N&#8211;CH  3  unit is identified as a convenient and diagnostic handle to probe the donor properties of these ancillary ligands and demonstrates the electronic flexibility of the PYE ligand sites. In the presence of a base, the originally  cis  &#8208;coordinated bis&#8208;PYE ligand adopts a  N,N,N  &#8208;tridentate coordination mode with the two PYE units in mutual  trans  position. This  cis&#8208;trans  isomerization is reverted in presence of an acid, demonstrating a unique structural and steric flexibility of the bis&#8208;PYE ligand at palladium in addition to its electronic adaptability. The palladium complexes are active in formic acid dehydrogenation to H  2  and CO  2  . The catalytic performance is directly dependent on the ligand bonding mode, the nature of the ancillary ligand, the counter anion, and additives. The most active system features a bidentate bisPYE ligand, PPh  3  as ancillary ligand and accomplishes turnover frequencies up to 525 h  &#8722;1  in the first hour and turnover numbers of nearly 1000, which is the highest activity reported for palladium&#8208;based catalysts so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluoro&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Allyl Boronates and Silanes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical synthesis of fluorinated allyl silanes and boronates was disclosed. The addition of electrogenerated boryl or silyl radicals onto many &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl or &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylstyrenes in an undivided cell allowed the formation of a large panel of synthetically useful  gem  &#8208;difluoro and &#947;&#8208;fluoroallyl boronates and silanes (64 examples, from 31% to 95% yield). In addition, a scale up of the reactions under continuous flow was showcased using an electrochemical reactor with promising volumetric productivity (688 g.L  &#8208;1  .h  &#8208;1  and 496 g.L  &#8208;1  .h  &#8208;1  ). Moreover, the synthetic utility of these building blocks was highlighted through versatile transformations. Finally, plausible reaction mechanisms were suggested to explain the formation of the products.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Au(I) Alkynyl Emitters: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;coordinate donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor type coinage metal complexes displaying efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been unveiled to be highly appealing candidates as emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein a series of green to yellow TADF gold(I) complexes with alkynyl ligands has been developed for the first time. The complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 0.76 in doped films (5 wt% in PMMA) at room temperature. The modifications of alkynyl ligands with electron&#8208;donating amino groups together with the use of electron&#8208;deficient carbene ligands induce ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer excited states that give rise to TADF emission. Spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the roles of electron&#8208;donating capability of the alkynyl ligand in tuning the excited&#8208;state properties. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using the present complexes as emitters achieve maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 20%.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes and helicene&#8208;like molecules, usually containing multiple  ortho  &#8208;fused aromatic rings, possess unique helical chirality. These compounds have found a wide range of important applications in many research fields, such as asymmetric catalysis, molecular recognition, sensors and responsive switches, circularly polarized luminescence materials and others. However, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of helicenes was largely underexplored, when compared with the enantioselective synthesis of molecules bearing other stereogenic elements (e.g. central chirality and axial chirality). Since the pioneer work of asymmetric synthesis of helicenes via enantioselective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of triynes by Star&#225; and Star&#253;, last two decades have witnessed the tremendous development in the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of helicenes. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the advances in this field, which include methods enabled by both transition metal catalysis and organocatalysis, and provide our perspective on its future development.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial electro&#8208; and photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction represents an opportunity to tackle the environmental demand for sustainable fuel production. Nanomaterials critically impact the electricity&#8208; and solar&#8208;driven microbial CO2 reduction processes. This minireview comprehensively summarizes the recent developments in the configuration and design of nanomaterials for enhanced the bacterial adhesion and extracellular electron transfer (EET) processes, based on the modification technologies of improving chemical stability, electrochemical conductivity, biocompatibility, and surface area. Furthermore, we detail the investigation of incorporating non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms using advanced light&#8208;harvesting nanostructured photoelectrodes for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, as well as the current understanding of EET mechanisms occurring at photosynthetic semiconductor nanomaterials&#8208;bacteria biohybrid interface. The crucial factors influencing the performance of microbial CO2 reduction systems and future perspectives are discussed to provide guidance for the realization of their large&#8208;scale application.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteophenes &#8211; Amino Acid Functionalized Thiophene&#8208;based Fluorescent Ligands for Visualization of Protein Deposits in Tissue Sections with Alzheimer's Disease Pathology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteophenes. A palette of fluorescent thiophene&#8208;based ligands with distinct amino acid side&#8208;chain functionalities along the conjugated backbone was synthesized. Ligands with specific side&#8208;chain functionalities displayed selectivity towards distinct protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer's disease pathology. We foresee that proteophenes will significantly expand the toolbox of ligands for fluorescent assignment of disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates.







Abstract
Protein deposits composed of specific proteins or peptides are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and fluorescent ligands able to detect these pathological hallmarks are vital. Here, we report the synthesis of a class of thiophene&#8208;based ligands, denoted proteophenes, with different amino acid side&#8208;chain functionalities along the conjugated backbone, which display selectivity towards specific disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The selectivity of the ligands towards AD associated pathological hallmarks, such as aggregates of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide or tau filamentous inclusions, was highly dependent on the chemical nature of the amino acid functionality, as well as on the location of the functionality along the pentameric thiophene backbone. Finally, the concept of synthesizing donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor proteophenes with distinct photophysical properties was shown. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new thiophene&#8208;based ligands that can be utilized for optical assignment of different aggregated proteinaceous species in tissue sections.

         <title>Bimetallic Ruthenium Nitrosyl Complexes with Enhanced Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Properties for Nitric Oxide Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide delivery: A series of bimetallic RuNO complexes with quadrupolar electronic structures exhibit TPA cross&#8208;section up to 1523&#8197;GM under irradiation at &#955;=700&#8197;nm, in the therapeutic window of transparency of biological tissues. The biologically active nitric oxide radical (NO&#8901;) is released in any case.







Abstract
One monometallic and three bimetallic ruthenium nitrosyl (RuNO) complexes are presented and fully characterized in reference to a parent monometallic complex of formula [FTRu(bpy)(NO)]3+, where FT is a fluorenyl&#8208;substituted terpyridine ligand, and bpy the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine. These new complexes are built with the new ligands FFT, TFT, TFFT, and TF&#8208;CC&#8208;TF (where an alkyne C&#8801;C group is inserted between two fluorenes). The crystal structures of the bis&#8208;RuNO2 and bis&#8208;RuNO complexes built from the TFT ligand are presented. The evolution of the spectroscopic features (intensities and energies) along the series, at one&#8208;photon absorption (OPA) correlates well with the TD&#8208;DFT computations. A spectacular effect is observed at two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) with a large enhancement of the molecular cross&#8208;section (&#963;TPA), in the bimetallic species. In the best case, &#963;TPA is equal to 1523&#177;98&#8197;GM at 700&#8197;nm, in the therapeutic window of transparency of biological tissues. All compounds are capable of releasing NO&#8901; under irradiation, which leads to promising applications in TPA&#8208;based drug delivery.

         <title>Improving Photocatalytic Performance through the Construction of a Supramolecular Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular organic framework&#8208;type photocatalyst is constructed by host&#8208;guest complexation. Benefiting from the multivalent supramolecular assembly, it exhibits a higher effective concentration of catalytic sites and better stability to temperature, substrate, and light irradiation. As a result, the supramolecular organic framework shows improved catalytic performance in the photocatalytic oxidation of aryl boronic acids and thioethers.







Abstract
A supramolecular organic framework&#8208;type photocatalyst, named TM&#8208;SOF, is constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of cucurbit[8]uril and a tetra&#8208;arm monomer containing four N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl 2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridinium)thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (MPT) moieties. Benefiting from the multivalent assembly, a photocatalytically active supramolecular MPT dimer can be stably formed in TM&#8208;SOF. In addition, TM&#8208;SOF exhibits better stability against temperature, substrate, and light irradiation. As a result, TM&#8208;SOF shows a significantly improved performance for the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation of aryl boronic acids and thioethers. It is anticipated that this line of research will provide a facile approach for fabricating high&#8208;performance supramolecular photocatalysis systems.

         <title>Recent Progress of Phosphoric Acid Retention in High Temperature Proton Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Great efforts have been conducted to develop high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) due to its features of enhanced electrocatalyst reactivity, simplified hydrothermal management system and high CO tolerance of catalysts, and remarkable progress has been achieved. However, the easy leaching of phosphoric acid (PA) from the membranes&#160;during operation limits its commercial scale&#8208;up in complicated environments. This concept here mainly focuses on the recent developments for mitigation of PA loss in PA doped PEMs. The probably mechanisms of PA loss are proposed. The approaches to improve PA retention e.g. via introduction of phosphonic acid by covalent bond, using ion&#8208;pairs interaction and siphoning effect, and blending with inorganic nanoparticles are described in detail. Among these strategies, the siphoning effect from the intrinsic microporous PEMs is the most efficient and enables the cell to operate flexibly within a broad temperature range. Therefore, this concept may provide new ideas for the scientists to retain PA, to improve the cell performance and expand the potential applications of PA doped PEMs at elevated humidity and wide temperature range.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Great efforts have been conducted to develop high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) due to its features of enhanced electrocatalyst reactivity, simplified hydrothermal management system and high CO tolerance of catalysts, and remarkable progress has been achieved. However, the easy leaching of phosphoric acid (PA) from the membranes&#160;during operation limits its commercial scale-up in complicated environments. This concept here mainly focuses on the recent developments for mitigation of PA loss in PA doped PEMs. The probably mechanisms of PA loss are proposed. The approaches to improve PA retention e.g. via introduction of phosphonic acid by covalent bond, using ion-pairs interaction and siphoning effect, and blending with inorganic nanoparticles are described in detail. Among these strategies, the siphoning effect from the intrinsic microporous PEMs is the most efficient and enables the cell to operate flexibly within a broad temperature range. Therefore, this concept may provide new ideas for the scientists to retain PA, to improve the cell performance and expand the potential applications of PA doped PEMs at elevated humidity and wide temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Water to Enhance Quadrupolar NMR Spectroscopy and Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>17  O and  14  N are attractive targets for  in vivo  NMR spectroscopy and imaging, but low gyromagnetic ratios &#947; and fast spin relaxation complicate these observations. This work explores indirect ways for detecting some of these sites with the help of proton&#8208;detected double resonance techniques. As standard coherence transfer methods are of limited usefulness for such indirect detections, alternative routes for probing the quadrupolar spectra on  1  H were tested. These centered on modulating the broadening effects imparted onto protons adjacent to the low&#8208;g species via J&#8208;couplings through either continuous wave or spin&#8208;echo double resonance decoupling/recoupling sequences. As in all cases the changes imparted by these double&#8208;resonance strategies were small due to the fast relaxation undergone by the quadrupoles, the sensitivity of these approaches was amplified by porting their effects onto the abundant water  1  H signal. These amplifications were mediated by the spontaneous exchanges that the labile  1  Hs bound to  17  O or  14  N undergo with the water protons. In experiments designed on the basis of double&#8208;resonance spin echoes, these enhancements were imparted by looping the transverse encodings together with multiple longitudinal storage periods, leading to Decoupling&#8208;Recoupling with EXchange (D&#8208;REX) sequences. In experiments designed on the basis of continuous on/off quadrupolar decoupling, these solvent exchanges were incorporated into chemical&#8208;exchange saturation transfer schemes, leading to Decoupling&#8208;Recoupling with Saturation Transfer (D&#8208;REST) sequences.&#160; Both of these variants harnessed sizable proportions of the easily detectable water signals, in order to characterize the NMR spectra and/or to image with atomic&#8208;site specificity the  17  O and  14  N species.</dc:description>

The photophysical properties of multi&#8208;DCM derivatives, namely  2DCM  and  3DCM  , were compared to the single model azido&#8208;functionalized  DCM  , in the  E  and  Z  isomers. The (  EE  )&#8208;  2DCM  and (  EEE  )&#8208;  3DCM  were synthesized  via  the click reaction. Steady&#8208;state spectroscopy and photokinetics experiments under UV or visible irradiation indicated the presence of intramolecular energy transfer processes among the DCM units. Homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;energy transfer processes between adjacent chromophores were confirmed by fluorescence anisotropy and decays. Molecular dynamics simulations for  2DCM  were carried out and analyzed using a Markov state model, providing geometrical parameters (orientation and distance between chromophores) and energy transfer efficiency.

         <dc:description>Bismuth&#8208;oxygen&#160;moieties are beneficial for high&#8208;efficiency CO  2  RR producing formate, however, the preservation of bismuth&#8208;oxygen&#160;moietyis challenging while applying a cathodic potential. This work reports&#160;preparation of ultrathin Bi  2  O  2  O/Bi  2  O  2  (OH)(NO  3  )&#160;nanosheets&#160;(BiON&#8208;uts)  via  &#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;tailoring hydrogen bonds&#160;in Bi  2  O  2  (OH)(NO  3  ) precursor.&#160;The&#160;BiON&#8208;uts exhibits&#160;a&#160;formate faradaic efficiency of 98%&#160;with higher partial current density than that&#160;of&#160;most&#160;reported Bi&#8208;based catalysts. Mechanistic&#160;studies demonstrate that the ultrathin nanosheet morphology facilitates ion&#8208;exchange reaction between BiON&#8208;uts and electrolyte to produce Bi  2  O  2  CO  3  &#160;intermediate, and adsorption&#160;reaction of CO  2  &#160;with surface Bi  2  O  2  O. DFT calculations reveal that the rate&#8208;limiting first electron transfer is effectively improved because of the high electron affinity of Bi  2  O  2  CO  3  .

         <title>Magnetic Hyperthermia Enhancement in Iron&#8208;based Materials Driven by Carbon Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic hyperthermia (MH) shows a great potential in clinical applications because of its very localized action and minimal side effects. Because of their high saturation magnetization values, reduced forms of iron are promising candidates for MH. However, their protection is mandatory to overcome their toxicity and instability (i. e. oxidation) in biological conditions. In this work, a novel methodology for the protection of iron nanoparticles through confinement within graphitic carbon layers after thermal treatment of preformed nanoparticles supported on carbon is reported. We demonstrate that the size and composition of the nascent confined iron nanoparticles and the thickness of their protective carbon layer can be controlled by selecting the nature of the carbon support. Our findings reveal that a higher nanoparticle&#8208;carbon interaction mediated by the presence of oxygen&#8208;containing groups, induces the formation of small and well&#8208;protected &#945; &#8208;Fe&#8208;based nanoparticles, which exhibit promising results towards MH based on their enhanced specific absorption rate&#160;values.</dc:description>

Abstract
A scalable and efficient process for the preparation of 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of N&#8208;benzyl azomethine ylide generated in&#8197;situ has been developed. The optimized method included the use of LiF in DMSO at 110&#8201;&#176;C and was suitable for &#945;&#8208;mono&#8208;, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;di&#8208;, and &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trialkyl&#8208;, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;(hetera)cycloalkylidene&#8208;, CO2Et&#8208;, as well as most &#946;&#8208;(het)aryl&#8208;substituted alkenyl boropinacolates. The 1,3&#8208;dipolar reaction proceeded on a multigram scale providing 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines with diverse substitution patterns (including fused and spirocyclic ones) in a diastereoselective manner. The Pd(OH)2&#8208;mediated N&#8208;debenzylation of pyrrolidine hydrochlorides was successfully performed to give the corresponding bifunctional building blocks on an up to 130&#8197;g scale, thus providing a substantial expansion of the synthetic and medicinal chemist's toolbox. Other reactions included the preparation of trifluoroborates, Zweifel&#8208;Aggarwal sp3&#8208;sp2 coupling, and oxidative deborylation as an example of C&#8208;heteroatom bond formation.

The optimized method included the use of LiF in DMSO at 110&#8201;&#176;C and was suitable for &#945;-mono-, &#945;,&#946;-di-, and &#945;,&#946;,&#946;-trialkyl-, &#946;,&#946;-(hetera)cycloalkylidene-, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Et-, as well as most &#946;-(het)aryl-substituted alkenyl boropinacolates. The 1,3-dipolar reaction proceeded on a multigram scale providing 3-borylated pyrrolidines with diverse substitution patterns (including fused and spirocyclic ones) in a diastereoselective manner. The Pd(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-debenzylation of pyrrolidine hydrochlorides was successfully performed to give the corresponding bifunctional building blocks on an up to 130&#8197;g scale, thus providing a substantial expansion of the synthetic and medicinal chemist's toolbox. Other reactions included the preparation of trifluoroborates, Zweifel-Aggarwal sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; coupling, and oxidative deborylation as an example of C-heteroatom bond formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dipole&#8208;Dipole and Anion&#8208;&#960;+ Interaction Manipulation Synergistically Enhance Intrinsic Antibacterial Activities of AIEgens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic manipulation strategy of dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;+ interaction is proposed to enhance the binding affinity of dyes toward pathogenic bacteria and to construct highly efficient luminescence&#8208;guided antimicrobials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature independent of light and the surrounding oxygen.







Abstract
Pathogenic bacteria infections, especially multidrug resistant bacteria infections have aroused worldwide attention due to their severe threats to human beings. Thus, the development of highly effective antibacterial reagents is very important. However, the design of antimicrobials is still quite challenging for the lack of a universal design strategy. Here, a synergistic manipulation strategy of dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;+ interaction is proposed for constructing highly efficient antimicrobials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature. Firstly, four anion&#8208;&#960;+&#8208;type AIE luminogens were designed and synthesized. Due to the electron&#8208;donating and hydrophilic characteristic of methoxy groups, 3MOTPO containing three methoxy groups showed the largest dipole moment (5.06 Debye) and dual anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions in the solid state. Driven by both dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions, 3MOTPO showed the strongest bacterial binding ability and the best antibacterial activities (MIC90=3.76&#8197;&#956;M). The work offers a deep insight into the rational design of highly efficient antimicrobials for luminescence&#8208;guided antibacterial study.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficient Ultrathin PdCuMo Porous Nanosheets with Abundant Defects for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets with rich cavities and structural defects have been successfully prepared by a simple method. Due to the novel structures which can provide extensive active sites and the electronic interaction between Cu, Pd and Mo elements, ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets display outstanding catalytic activities and stabilities.







Abstract
To reduce the over&#8208;dependence on Pt, Pd&#8208;based catalysts have become one of the most effective candidates for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In order to further accelerate the ORR kinetics and strengthen the catalytic performance of Pd catalysts, component optimization and morphology design have been adopted. Although great progress has been made, it is still difficult to obtain porous ultrathin nanosheets with excellent performance by a simple method. Here, ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets (PdCuMo NSs) were successfully prepared. This structure possessed a large specific surface area with rich cavities and structural defects, significantly enhancing its ORR performance. In special, the mass activity of PdCuMo NSs was 1.46&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at 0.90&#8197;V, which was 12.2, 8.6, and 2.7&#8197;times as high as that of Pd/C, Pt/C, and PdCuMo nanoparticles (PdCuMo NPs), respectively. In addition, it had an excellent ability to resist CO poisoning and exhibited remarkable long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Fusion of Aza&#8208; and Oxadiborepins with Furans in a Reversible Ring&#8208;Opening Process Furnishes Versatile Building Blocks for Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Materials</title>

         <dc:description>
Merging furan rings with 1,2,7&#8208;oxa&#8208; and &#8208;azadiborepins. This modular synthesis proceeds through a reversible ring&#8208;opening process and furnishes the novel heteropolyaromatic compounds from a common precursor. The tricyclic systems are overall aromatic, and weak aromaticity in the diboron heterocycles favors &#960; electron delocalization over the bifuran unit. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is easily extended through the &#945;&#8208;positions of the furan rings.







Abstract
A modular synthesis of both difurooxa&#8208; and difuroazadiborepins from a common precursor is demonstrated. Starting from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran, after protection of the positions 5 and 5&#8217; with bulky silyl groups, formation of the novel polycycles proceeds through opening of the furan rings to a dialkyne and subsequent re&#8208;cyclization in the borylation step. The resulting bifuran&#8208;fused diborepins show pronounced stability, highly planar tricyclic structures, and intense blue light emission. Deprotection and transformation into dibrominated building blocks that can be incorporated into &#960;&#8208;extended materials can be performed in one step. Detailed DFT calculations provide information about the aromaticity of the constituent rings of this polycycle.

         <title>A Macrocyclic Furan with Accessible Oxidation States: Switching Between Aromatic and Antiaromatic Global Ring Currents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first macrocyclic furan with accessible oxidation states was synthesized using a post&#8208;macrocyclization approach. It exhibits low oxidation potentials, and switching between antiaromatic and aromatic global ring currents upon oxidation.







Abstract
Macrocyclic furans are predicted to switch between global aromaticity and antiaromaticity, depending on their oxidation states. However, the macrocyclic furans reported to date are stabilized by electron withdrawing groups, which result in inaccessible oxidation states. To circumvent this problem, a post&#8208;macrocyclization approach was applied to introduce methylene&#8208;substituted macrocyclic furans, which display an extremely low oxidation potential of &#8722;0.23 vs. Fc/Fc+, and are partially oxidized in ambient conditions. Additional oxidation to the dication results in aromaticity switching to a global 30&#960;e&#8722; aromatic state, as indicated by the formation of a strong diatropic current observed in the 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum. NICS and ACID calculations support this trend and provide evidence for a different pathway for the global current in the neutral and dicationic states. According to these findings, macrocyclic furans can be rendered as promising p&#8208;type materials with stable oxidation states.

During the past two decades, single&#8208;atom&#8208;centered medium&#8208;sized germanium clusters [M@Gen] (M=transition metals, n&gt;12) have been extensively explored, both from theoretical perspectives and experimental gas&#8208;phase syntheses. However, the actual structural arrangements of the Ge13 and Ge14 endohedral cages are still ambiguous and have long remained an unresolved problem for experimental implementation. In this work, we successfully synthesize 13&#8208;/14&#8208;vertex Ge clusters [Nb@Ge13]3&#8722; (1) and [Nb@Ge14]3&#8722; (2), which are structurally characterized and exhibit unprecedented topologies, neither classical deltahedra nor 3&#8208;connected polyhedral structures. Theoretical analysis indicates that the major stabilization of the Ge backbones arises due to the substantial interaction of Ge 4p&#8208;AOs with the endohedral Nb 4d&#8208;AOs through three/four&#8208;center two&#8208;electron bonds with an enhanced electron density accumulated over the shortest Nb&#8722;Ge13 contact in 1. Low occupancies of the direct two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron (2c&#8211;2e) Nb&#8722;Ge and Ge&#8722;Ge &#963; bonds point to a considerable degree of electron delocalization over the Ge cages revealing their electron deficiency.

         <title>Enhanced Optical Properties of Azaborole Helicenes by Lateral and Helical Extension</title>

         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended Azaborole Helicenes. A unique set of &#960;&#8208;extended azaborole helicenes, assembled from N&#8208;heteroaromatic and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene building blocks, shows excellent optical properties. The lateral and helical extensions of the helicene scaffold significantly enhanced emission quantum yields and dissymmetry factors.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of laterally extended azabora[5]&#8208;, &#8208;[6]&#8208; and &#8208;[7]helicenes, assembled from N&#8208;heteroaromatic and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene building blocks is described. Formally, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems of the pristine azaborole helicenes were enlarged with a phenanthrene unit leading to compounds with large Stokes shifts, significantly enhanced luminescence quantum yields (&#934;) and dissymmetry factors (glum). The beneficial effect on optical properties was also observed for helical elongation. The combined contributions of lateral and helical extensions resulted in a compound showing green emission with &#934; of 0.31 and |glum| of 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3, highest within the series of &#960;&#8208;extended azaborahelicenes and superior to emission intensity and chiroptical response of its non&#8208;extended congener. This study shows that helical and lateral extensions of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are viable strategies to improve features of azaborole helicenes. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of configurationally stable [6]&#8208; and &#8208;[7]helicenes was used to provide insight into their packing arrangements.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer 2D Ni&#8722;BDC MOF Obtained in Supercritical CO2&#8208;Assisted Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chip off the old MOF: A CO2 molecule can exchange with the lattice&#8208;coordinated H2O molecules and side&#8208;on coordinate with the metal Ni sites on Ni&#8722;BDC surface simultaneously; finally this breaks the interlayer hydrogen bond of bulk Ni&#8722;BDC and helps to form 2D MOF.







Abstract
The development of an efficient strategy for fabricating two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with high yield and high stability is desirable. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that large, single&#8208;layer 2D nickel&#8208;benzene dicarboxylate (Ni&#8722;BDC) MOF nanosheets can be fabricated with the assistance of supercritical (SC) CO2 in a pure aqueous system. Detailed experimental evidence reveals that the SC CO2 molecule can exchange with the lattice&#8208;coordinated H2O molecules, side&#8208;on coordinate with the metal Ni1 sites on the Ni&#8722;BDC surface, and finally break the interlayer hydrogen bond to exfoliate the bulk Ni&#8722;BDC into a 2D MOF. More importantly, a thin SC CO2 layer building up at the water&#8722;Ni&#8722;BDC interfaces can transform the pristine hydrophilic interface into a super&#8208;hydrophobic one. This super&#8208;hydrophobic layer at the water&#8208;MOF interface can effectively prevent dissociation, thus promoting the stability of Ni&#8722;BDC in aqueous system.

         <title>Vinylic Trifluoromethylselenolation via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trifluoromethylselenolation of vinylic substrates was performed through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. This reaction was based on the use of 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;amino&#8208;quinoline as directing group and trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as trifluoromethylselenolating reagent. This method was also extended to fluoroalkylselenolation reactions.







Abstract
Trifluorometylselenolation via C&#8722;H activation is barely described in literature. In particular, no such vinylic functionalization has been yet described. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylselenolation of vinylic C&#8722;H bonds is described. The 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;aminoquinoline has been used as auxiliary directing group to perform this reaction. The reaction gives excellent yields with &#945;&#8208;substituted compounds whatever the substituents and a microwave activation can be used to accelerate the reaction. With &#946;&#8208;substituted substrates lower yields, but still satisfactory, are obtained. This methodology was also successfully extended to other fluoroalkylselenyl groups.

         <dc:description>
Combustion time! The synthesis of a &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide is described, addressing the compatibilities of ketones and hydroperoxides in these elusive combustion&#8208;relevant species. The hydroperoxide is installed through sulfonylhydrazine substitution, in which it is found that 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane is an advantageous medium for the transformation. The synthesis is scalable and safe, providing material for future chemical kinetics studies.







Abstract
A synthesis of a &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide is described, addressing potential functional&#8208;group compatibilities in these elusive species relevant to combustion and atmospheric chemistries. The hydroperoxide is installed via sulfonylhydrazine substitution, which was found to be more effective than displacement of secondary halides. As part of this protocol, it was observed that 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane is an advantageous medium for the reaction, avoiding the formation of a tetrahydrofuran hydroperoxide side product. This discovery facilitated the multigram synthesis (6&#8197;steps, 41&#8201;% yield overall) and discrete characterization of the target &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Modulated Synthesis of Novel &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Microporous Polymers for Efficient Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an approach to construct two structurally different (&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine and boranil&#8208;based) CMPs from identical monomers via simple acid modulation (BF3.Et2O and CH3COOH). The polymers display distinctly different optical and electronic properties. Boranil CMP display superior photocatalytic activity producing hydrogen at a superior rate of 252&#8197;&#956;mol/g over &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine polymer (100&#8197;&#956;mol/g).







Abstract
Simple synthetic modifications that tune the molecular structures, thereby the properties of the molecules, are of topical interest. Herein, we report the synthesis of two novel cationic rosaniline&#8208;based conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) from identical monomers via simple acid modulation (Acetic acid and BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O). The condensation reaction of rosaniline with 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol in acetic acid renders &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked CMP (CMP&#8208;A) while changing the acid to BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O, the linkages transform to enol and undergoes BF2&#8208;complexation, leading to boranil CMP (CMP&#8208;B). BF2&#8208;functionalities in boranil CMP significantly modified the optical and functional properties compared to &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked CMP. The cationic&#8208;delocalization along with the extended &#960;&#8208;delocalization supported by chromophoric BF2&#8208;groups allow CMP&#8208;B to exhibit broad absorption spanning the visible to Near&#8208;Infrared region (NIR). The absorption red&#8208;edge of CMP&#8208;B appears around 1277&#8197;nm (optical band gap &#8764;1.58&#8197;eV) while CMP&#8208;A displays at 981&#8197;nm (optical band gap &#8764;1.83&#8197;eV). Most interestingly, as a photocatalyst, CMP&#8208;B catalyzes hydrogen evolution with a superior rate of 252&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 over CMP&#8208;A (100&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1). It is about 2.5&#8197;times higher performance. The transient photocurrent measurements, electrochemical impedance data, and in&#8208;depth mott&#8208;Schottky analysis demonstrate that the BF2&#8208;group in CMP&#8208;B generates photoinduced charge carriers and their migration towards the active sites for photocatalysis. These polymers show significant photocatalytic H2 generation without any supportive metal co&#8208;catalyst. The BF2 complexed building blocks are a unique class of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution through green and cost&#8208;effective approach.

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of Nicotinamide Co&#8208;factor by Perylene Sensitized RhIII Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a catalytically active intramolecular photocatalyst, which combines a perylene photosensitizer and a RhIII catalyst. Spectroscopic studies reveal the formation of a charge&#8208;separated perylene radical cation&#8208;RhII intermediate that results in a catalytically active species in the presence of protons.







Abstract
The ambitious goal of artificial photosynthesis is to develop active systems that mimic nature and use light to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Intramolecular design concepts are particularly promising. Herein, we firstly present an intramolecular photocatalyst integrating a perylene&#8208;based light&#8208;harvesting moiety and a catalytic rhodium center (RhIIIphenPer). The excited&#8208;state dynamics were investigated by means of steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. The studies reveal that photoexcitation of RhIIIphenPer yields the formation of a charge&#8208;separated intermediate, namely RhIIphenPer.+, that results in a catalytically active species in the presence of protons.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;Encapsulation&#8208;Controlled Supramolecular Photoproduct and Radical Fluorescence Emission</title>

Control and stabilize: A host&#8211;guest interaction controlled photoproduct and organic radical fluorescence emission by using cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7])&#8208;based pseudorotaxane structures is reported. Tetrakis(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethylene (TPyE) derivatives can be assembled as cationic guests by the Q[7] host to form a [5]pseudorotaxane in aqueous solution. The host stabilizes the radical fluorescence emission of the photoirradiation&#8208;triggered intermediate of the guest, thus implying that the macrocyclic assembly has potential applications in the development of luminescent radical materials.







Abstract
Herein, a host&#8211;guest interaction&#8211;controlled photoproduct created by using cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7])&#8208;based pseudorotaxane structures is reported. The assembly exhibited controlled behavior towards the reduction of the ethylene (C=C) bond in the tetrakis(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethylene (TPyE) guest molecule under UV light irradiation. This can be attributed to the Q[7] encapsulation masking the four pyridinium arms of the guest, which inhibits planarization of the TPyE core to form the cyclization product. In particular, the strong affinity of Q[7] for the butyl&#8208;substituted guest (TPyE&#8208;4C) led to an unusual radical fluorescence emission of the photoirradiation&#8208;triggered intermediate of the guest molecule being observed in aqueous solution. This work provides a valuable paradigm and new insight for macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8722;guest interactions in supramolecular catalysis and luminescent radical materials.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Linker Containing Detergents for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is pressing but still challenging to explore the structure and function of membrane proteins (MPs). One of the main obstacles lies in the limited availability of matched detergents in the handling of the specific MPs. We describe herein a new design of detergent by the incorporation of a transition linker between the hydrophilic head and the hydrophobic tail. This design allows a gradual change of hydrophobicity between outside and inside of micelles, in contrast to the abrupt switch in conventional detergents. Notably, many of these detergents assembled into micelles in smaller sizes while retaining the low critical micelle concentrations. Meanwhile, thermal stabilizing evaluation identified superior detergents for representative MPs, including G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and a transporter protein. Among them, selected detergent further improved the NMR study of MPs. We anticipate these optimal results would encourage future detergent expansion through the new remodeling on the traditional detergent scaffold.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have synthesized a variety of cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Cyclopentane and cyclohexane were incorporated into the cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Surprisingly, cyclohexane&#8208;fused arsole  2a  gradually decomposed via oxidative ring&#8208;opening under ambient conditions, while cyclopentane&#8208;fused  1a  was stable. In addition, the Stokes shift of  2a  (7766 cm  &#8211;1  ) is larger than that of  1a  (5120 cm  &#8211;1  ). The effects of the fused cycloalkane on the stability and photophysical properties were attributed to the distortion of the cycloalkane. Computational calculations demonstrated that the cyclohexane moiety in  2a  was frustrated upon being incorporated into the rigid arsole ring, while the cyclopentane moiety in  1a  was much less distorted.</dc:description>

         <title>Shedding Light on the Enigmatic TcO2&#183;xH2O Structure with Density Functional Theory and EXAFS Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#946;&#8208;emitting  99Tc isotope is a high&#8208;yield fission product in  235U and  239Pu nuclear reactors, raising special concern in nuclear waste management due to its long half&#8208;life and the high mobility of pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;  ). In the conditions of deep nuclear waste repositories, retention of Tc is achieved via biotic and abiotic reduction of TcO4&#8722;  to compounds like amorphous TcO2&#183;xH2O precipitates. It is generally accepted that these precipitates have linear (Tc(&#956;&#8208;O)2(H2O)2)n  chains, with trans H2O. Although corresponding Tc&#8208;Tc and Tc&#8208;O distances have been obtained from Extended X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, this structure is largely based on analogy with other compounds. Here, we combine Density&#8208;Functional Theory with EXAFS measurements of fresh and aged samples to show that, instead, TcO2&#183;xH2O forms zigzag chains that undergo a slow aging process whereby they combine to form longer chains and, later, a tridimensional structure that might lead to a new TcO2  polymorph.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Charge Carrier Utilization of BiVO4 for Solar Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar energy&#8208;driven overall water splitting (OWS) is an attractive way for generating green hydrogen. This review focuses on the current research status of BiVO4&#8208;constituted photo(electro)catalytic OWS systems, and summarizes the effective strategies for BiVO4 photo(electro)catalysts in a mainline of efficient charge utilization. It is hoped to provide comprehensive guidance for the construction of advanced solar OWS systems.







Abstract
Solar energy&#8208;driven overall water splitting (OWS) is an attractive way for generating clean and renewable green hydrogen. One key challenge is the construction of OWS systems with high solar energy conversion efficiencies, in which how to manipulate photoexcited charge carriers to efficiently participate in the reaction is the top priority. In recent years, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has emerged as one of the most promising materials for photo(electro)catalytic OWS and considerable progress has been achieved. In this review, recent advances of BiVO4&#8208;constituted OWS systems in both photoelectrocatalytic and photocatalytic approaches are presented in a mainline of effective charge carrier utilization. Various strategies for improved charge carrier utilization, including band structure engineering, improving charge separation, reducing charge recombination, and accelerating reaction kinetics, are summarized and analyzed in detail. Finally, perspective and outlook on further exploring the application potential of BiVO4 are proposed.

         <title>A Versatile Palladium Synthon: [Pd(NHC)(PhC&#8801;CPh)] (NHC = N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and isolation of [Pd(NHC)(PhC&#8801;CPh)] complexes are reported. These new 14&#8208;electron Pd(0)&#8208;complexes are key synthons leading to known palladium(0) and palladium(II) species, as well as permitting access to&#160;&#160;unprecedented mixed NHC&#8208;phosphite palladium(0) complexes.This motif permits the facile catalytic hydrosilylation of allenes. DFT calculations have allowed to characterize the relatively weak interaction between the metal and the diphenylacetylene ligand, with a comparison with a series of ligands with more or less coordinating power, bearing varied structural and electronic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Two novel three&#8208;dimensional Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based rare earth MOFs with ultra&#8208;high proton conductivity and performance stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the two examples of La(III) based&#160;MOFs (rare earth based metal organic frameworks), Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB, were obtained by self&#8208;assembly. Both materials showed extremely high proton conductivity, where the proton conductivity value of Eu&#8208;ETTB was 1.53 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S/cm at 98% relative humidity (RH) and 85 &#176;C, while Gd&#8208;ETTB had a proton conductivity value of 2.63 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S/cm at 98% RH and 75 &#176;C. This was almost the best performance observed for three&#8208;dimensional porous MOFs without post&#8208;synthetic modification and was based on milder conditions than most materials. Furthermore, cycle test experiment and continuous work test showed that both materials had excellent performance both in terms of stability and durability. Water vapor adsorption experiment showed that a large number of water molecules are adsorbed, the hydrogen bond network was rebuilt by the adsorbed water molecules in the pore channel and optimized the channels for proton transfer, explained its high performance.</dc:description>
