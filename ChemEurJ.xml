         <title>Regulating Extra&#8208;Framework Cations in Faujasite Zeolites for Capture of Trace Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The explicit structure&#8208;performance relationship and underlying mechanism of trace CO2 capture by faujasite zeolites are elucidated. Two robust adsorbents are screened out, namely Ba&#8722;X with high dynamic CO2 uptake and K&#8722;X with unprecedented resistance to moisture.







Abstract
The development of cost&#8208;effective sorbents for direct capture of trace CO2 (&lt;1&#8201;%) from the atmosphere is an important and challenging task. Natural or commercial zeolites are promising sorbents, but their performance in adsorption of trace CO2 has been poorly explored to date. A systematic study on capture of trace CO2 by commercial faujasite zeolites reveals that the extra&#8208;framework cations play a key role on their performance. Under dry conditions, Ba&#8722;X displays high dynamic uptake of 1.79 and 0.69&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at CO2 concentrations of 10000 and 1000&#8197;ppm, respectively, and shows excellent recyclability in the temperature&#8208;swing adsorption processes. K&#8722;X exhibits perfect moisture resistance, and &gt;95&#8201;% dry CO2 uptake can be preserved under relative humidity of 74&#8201;%. In situ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and neutron diffraction reveal two binding sites for CO2 in these zeolites, namely the basic framework oxygen atoms and the divalent alkaline earth metal ions. This study unlocks the potential of low&#8208;cost natural zeolites for applications in direct air capture.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembling Flavin for Visible Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different micellar and gel states formed by a flavin&#8208;based gelator can be used as effective and selective photocatalysts under visible light. The self&#8208;assembled structure formed directly translates into a difference in the activity of these structures in the photooxidation reactions.







Abstract
A new flavin&#8208;based gelator is reported which forms micellar structures at high pH and gels at low pH. This flavin can be used for the photooxidation of thiols under visible light, with the catalytic efficiency being linked to the self&#8208;assembled structures present.

Abstract
In an interview with Benjamin List, winner of the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, members of the Young Chemists&#8217; Network (JCF) of the German Chemical Society (GDCh) asked him about his science, his career, and the academic system. Benjamin List, Director at the Max&#8208;Planck&#8208;Institut f&#252;r Kohlenforschung in Germany, was awarded the Nobel Prize together with David W. C. MacMillan (Princeton University, USA) for the development of asymmetric organocatalysis. After studying chemistry at the Free University of Berlin, he received his doctorate from Goethe University in Frankfurt. He discovered the amino acid proline to be an efficient catalyst and thus co&#8208;founded the field of organocatalysis. In 2016, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, which is considered the most important research award in Germany.

         <title>Catalytic Activation of Imines by Chalcogen Bond Donors in a Povarov [4+2] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tellurium&#8208;based chalcogen bonding catalysts successfully activate a Povarov [4+2] cycloaddition with catalyst loadings as low as 1&#8197;mol&#8201;%, with different substrates, and in different solvents. Furthermore, new chiral chalcogen bonding catalysts were introduced and tested in this reaction, but only racemic mixtures of the product were obtained.







Abstract
Recently, chalcogen bonding has been investigated in more detail in organocatalysis and the scope of activated functionalities continues to increase. Herein, the activation of imines in a Povarov [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with bidentate cationic chalcogen bond donors is presented. Tellurium&#8208;based Lewis acids show superior properties compared to selenium&#8208;based catalysts and inactive sulfur&#8208;based analogues. The catalytic activity of the chalcogen bonding donors increases with weaker binding anions. Triflate, however, is not suitable due to its participation in the catalytic pathway. A solvent screening revealed a more efficient activation in less polar solvents and a pronounced effect of solvent (and catalyst) on endo&#8201;:&#8201;exo diastereomeric ratio. Finally, new chiral chalcogen bonding catalysts were applied but provided only racemic mixtures of the product.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel one&#8208;pot reaction producing a metal vinylidene structure in a five&#8208;membered ring by cyclization of a multiyne has been achieved. The ring strain and the high stability of the cyclic metal vinylidene complexes have been analyzed experimentally and computationally. The metal vinylidene unit in a fused&#8208;ring complex is unreactive to both nucleophiles and electrophiles. It reacts however at the nearby carbonyl group achieving the unprecedented conversion of metal vinylidene to metal carbyne within the five&#8208;membered ring. The contributing factors for the aromaticity&#8208;driven process has been studied by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Bola&#8208;Amphiphilic Glycodendrimers: New Carbohydrate&#160;Mimicking&#160;Scaffolds to Target Carbohydrate&#8208;Binding Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dendrimers are appealing scaffolds for creating carbohydrate mimics with unique multivalent cooperativity. We report here novel bola&#8208;amphiphilic glycodendrimers bearing mannose and glucose terminals, and a hydrophobic thioacetal core responsive to reactive oxygen species. The peculiar bola&#8208;amphiphilic feature enabled stronger binding to lectin compared to the conventional amphiphile. In addition, these dendrimers are able to target mannose receptors and glucose transporters expressed at the surface of cells, allowing effective and specific cellular uptake.&#160; All these highlight&#160;their great promise for targeted delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Functionalized Syndiotactic Polystyrenes: Synthesis and Application to Immobilization of Transition Metal Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise control of monomer sequence and stereochemistry in copolymerization is of much interest and importance for the synthesis of high performance materials, but studies toward this goal have met with only limited success to date. The syndiospecific polymerization of diphenylphosphinostyrene (  p  &#8208;StPPh  2  and  o  &#8208;StPPh  2  ) and its copolymerization with styrene (St) by (C  5  Me  4  SiMe  3  )Sc(CH  2  C  6  H  4  NMe  2  &#8208;  o  )  2  have been achieved for the first time to afford a new series of phosphine functionalized syndiotactic polystyrene. By the design of the polymer structure, the copolymer of  o  &#8208;StPPh  2  and St (poly(  o  &#8208;StPPh  2  &#8208;  alt  &#8208;St)&#8208;  b  &#8208;  s  PS) containing  o  &#8208;StPPh  2  and St alternating copolymer block and syndiotactic polystyrene block (  s  PS) showed excellent thermal stability and chemical resistance. The simple combination of the triphenylphosphine and the syndiotactic polystyrene structures realized the stable immobilization of metal nanoparticles to afford highly robust metal@poly(  o  &#8208;StPPh  2  &#8208;  alt  &#8208;St)&#8208;  b  &#8208;  s  PS nanocatalysts at high temperature and various atmospheres. The Cu@poly(  o  &#8208;StPPh  2  &#8208;  alt  &#8208;St)&#8208;  b  &#8208;  s  PS catalyst can serve as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of quinoline derivatives by acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of  o  &#8208;aminobenzylalcohol with ketones.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen peroxide&#8211;responsive triggers based on borinic acids: molecular insights into the control of oxidative rearrangement.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylborinic acids represent new, efficient, and underexplored hydrogen peroxide&#8208;responsive triggers. In contrast to boronic acids, two concomitant oxidative rearrangements are involved in the complete oxidation of these species, which might represent a major limitation for an efficient effector (drug or fluorophore) release. Herein, we describe a comprehensive study of H  2  O  2  &#8208;mediated unsymmetrical arylborinic acid oxidation to investigate the factors that could selectively guide their oxidative rearrangement. The  o  &#8208;CF  3  substituent was found to be an excellent directing group since complete regioselectivity was obtained on borinic acid models. This result was successfully applied to synthesizing new borinic acid&#8208;based fluorogenic probes, which exclusively release the fluorescent moiety upon H  2  O  2  treatment. These compounds maintained their superior kinetic properties compared to boronic acids, thus further enhancing the potential of arylborinic acids as valuable new H  2  O  2  &#8208;sensitive triggers.</dc:description>

Dissociation of the labile TMEDA ligand in the resulting complex [{BDI}Ga(H)&#8213;(H)Zn(tmeda)] (1) facilitates insertion of a second equiv. of I into the remaining Zn&#8213;H to form a thermally sensitive trinuclear species [({BDI}Ga(H))2Zn] (2). Compound 1 exchanges with polymeric zinc dideuteride [ZnD2]n in the presence of TMEDA, and with compounds I and 2via sequential and reversible ligand dissociation and gallium(I) insertion.

         <dc:description>High silica zeolite ZK&#8208;5 (framework Si/Al = 4.8) has been prepared by interzeolite conversion from ultrastable zeolite Y via a co&#8208;templating route using alkali metal cations and nitrate anions but without organic structure directing agents. The mechanism, which involves zeolite framework &#8208; alkali metal cation &#8208; nitrate anion ordering, has been established by a combination of chemical and thermal analyses, Raman spectroscopy, computational modelling and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective 2D Ultrathin Metal&#8211;Organic Layers with Bis&#8208;Metallic Catalytic Sites for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As novel generated 2D materials, metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) have recently emerged as a potential platform for photocatalysis CO2 reduction reaction (PCO2RR). Such 2D structures negate the blemish of low&#8208;density catalytic sites and low electron transmission efficiency on the surface of MOFs, while retaining the advantage of low expenditure when using earth&#8208;abundant metal nodes and meritorious applicability in the PCO2RR. Herein, we report that the 2D ultrathin layer material with bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites (Ni&#8208;O metal node and the Ni&#8208;N metal site) from bidentate ligand 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate (H2bpydc) and nickel (II) remarkably boosts the visible light&#8208;driven PCO2RR performance with a CO yield of 2400 mmol/g for 18 h and a selectivity up to 99%. Consequently, the effects of morphology, catalytic sites and intrinsic properties on PCO2RR efficiency have been investigated in detail. In this context, the ultrathin layer structrue has been elucidated as the key point to facilitate electron transfer efficiency. Notably, the bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites with reasonable distance between two adjacent metals presumably induce synergistic effect, offering a guiding ideology for further designing high performance photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Do Antarafacial Cycloadditions Occur? Cycloaddition of Heptafulvalene with Tetracyanoethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antarafacial? No, suprafacial! The [14+2] cycloaddition of heptafulvalene with tetracyanoethylene has long been held as one of the only examples of an antarafacial cycloaddition. Experimental and computational studies demonstrate that it is not a concerted [14&#960;a+2&#960;s] process but instead a stepwise reaction that affords the trans&#8208;cycloadduct through suprafacial addition across the heptafulvalene ring system.







Abstract
The cycloaddition of heptafulvalene (1) with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) was previously described as an example of an antarafacial cycloaddition, a [&#960;14a+&#960;2s] process that afforded only the trans cycloadduct by virtue of the edge&#8208;to&#8208;face approach of TCNE, facilitated by the S shape of 1. The reaction has been investigated in depth and found not to be a concerted antarafacial process. At low temperature, the reaction is observed to give a mixture of cis and trans cycloadducts as well as a [4+2] cycloadduct. The mixture of products is converted to the trans cycloadduct by equilibration upon warming to room temperature. Studies with diethyl 2,3&#8208;dicyanofumarate and &#8208;maleate confirmed the formation of cis cycloadducts. DFT studies at the M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;311+G(2d,p) SCRF=acetone level of theory show that the originally proposed edge&#8208;to&#8208;face approach of TCNE to 1 is highly disfavored, whereas a stepwise mechanism involving the addition of TCNE at C2 to form a zwitterion followed by collapse at either C2&#8242; or C7&#8242; is energetically accessible. The Diels&#8208;Alder adduct is also formed in a stepwise reaction by competitive addition of TCNE at C4 of 1. These studies suggest that edge&#8208;to&#8208;face interactions are prohibitive in even the most favorable cases.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have prepared and characterized a sterically strained 32p&#8208;electron antiaromatic bis&#8208;BODIPY macrocycle  4  in which two BODIPY fragments are linked via  p  &#8208;divinylbenzene groups. Unlike regular BODIPYs, the fluorescence in this macrocycle is quenched. The broad signals in NMR spectra of the macrocycle were explained by the vibronic freedom of the  p  &#8208;divinylbenzene fragments. The possible diradicaloid nature of the macrocycle was excluded on a basis of variable&#8208;temperature EPR spectra in solution and the solid&#8208;state, which is indicative of its closed&#8208;shell quinoidal structure. The  meso  &#8208;C&#8208;H bond in the macrocycle and its precursor dialdehyde  3  forms a weak hydrogen bond with THF and is susceptible for the nucleophilic attack by organic amines and cyanide anion. The reaction products of such nucleophilic attack have  meso  &#8208;sp  3  carbon atoms and were characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry and, in some cases, X&#8208;ray crystallography. Unlike initial macrocycle  4  , the adducts have strong fluorescence in 400 nm region. The electronic structure and spectroscopic properties of new chromophores were probed by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations and correlate well with the experimental data.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Biochemical NO&#8208;Sensing: Insights from Computational Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The production of cGMP and the resulting regulation of numerous physiological functions is regulated by the NO signaling pathway which occurs in soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Previously investigated by experiment, the exact details of the mechanism remain unclear, as two active states have been proposed. In this work, using computational techniques, we find that both active states are plausible, under different partial pressures of NO gas.







Abstract
The binding of small gas molecules such as NO and CO plays a major role in the signaling routes of the human body. The sole NO&#8208;receptor in humans is soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) &#8211; a histidine&#8208;ligated heme protein, which, upon NO binding, activates a downstream signaling cascade. Impairment of NO&#8208;signaling is linked, among others, to cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. In the present work, we use a combination of theoretical tools such as MD simulations, high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations and hybrid QM/MM methods to address various aspects of NO binding and to elucidate the most likely reaction paths and the potential intermediates of the reaction. As a model system, the H&#8208;NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis (So H&#8208;NOX) homologous to the NO&#8208;binding domain of sGC is used. The signaling route is predicted to involve NO binding to form a six&#8208;coordinate intermediate heme&#8208;NO complex, followed by relatively facile His decoordination yielding a five&#8208;coordinate adduct with NO on the distal side with possible isomerization to the proximal side through binding of a second NO and release of the first one. MD simulations show that the His sidechain can quite easily rotate outward into solvent, with this motion being accompanied in our simulations by shifts in helix positions that are consistent with this decoordination leading to significant conformational change in the protein.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The production of cGMP&lt;/b&gt; and the resulting regulation of numerous physiological functions is regulated by the NO signaling pathway which occurs in soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Previously investigated by experiment, the exact details of the mechanism remain unclear, as two active states have been proposed. In this work, using computational techniques, we find that both active states are plausible, under different partial pressures of NO gas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binding of small gas molecules such as NO and CO plays a major role in the signaling routes of the human body. The sole NO-receptor in humans is soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) &#8211; a histidine-ligated heme protein, which, upon NO binding, activates a downstream signaling cascade. Impairment of NO-signaling is linked, among others, to cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. In the present work, we use a combination of theoretical tools such as MD simulations, high-level quantum chemical calculations and hybrid QM/MM methods to address various aspects of NO binding and to elucidate the most likely reaction paths and the potential intermediates of the reaction. As a model system, the H-NOX protein from &lt;i&gt;Shewanella oneidensis&lt;/i&gt; (So H-NOX) homologous to the NO-binding domain of sGC is used. The signaling route is predicted to involve NO binding to form a six-coordinate intermediate heme-NO complex, followed by relatively facile His decoordination yielding a five-coordinate adduct with NO on the distal side with possible isomerization to the proximal side through binding of a second NO and release of the first one. MD simulations show that the His sidechain can quite easily rotate outward into solvent, with this motion being accompanied in our simulations by shifts in helix positions that are consistent with this decoordination leading to significant conformational change in the protein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Striking Size and Doping Effects of Ti&#8722;Si&#8722;O Clusters on Methane Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the size and doping effects of [TimSinO2(m+n)].+ (m+n=2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 14) clusters towards methane activation have been explored by using a combination of gas&#8208;phase experiments and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The size and doping effects in methane activation by Ti&#8722;Si&#8722;O clusters have been explored by using a combination of gas&#8208;phase experiments and quantum chemical calculations. All [TimSinO2(m+n)].+ (m+n=2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 14) clusters can extract a hydrogen from methane. The associated energies and structures have been revealed in detail. Moreover, the doping and size effects have been discussed involving generalized Kohn&#8208;Sham energy decomposition analysis, natural population analysis, Wiberg bond indexes (WBI), molecular polarity index (MPI) and ionization potential (IP). It suggested that Ti&#8722;Si&#8722;O clusters with a low Ti&#8201;:&#8201;Si ratio is beneficial to adsorbing methane and inclination to the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process, while the clusters with a high Ti&#8201;:&#8201;Si ratio favors the generation of a terminal oxygen radical and results in high reactivity and turnover frequency. On the other hand, a cluster size of m+n=12 is recommended considering both the ionization potential and the turnover frequency of the reaction. Hopefully, these finding will be instructive for the design of high&#8208;performance Ti&#8722;Si&#8722;O catalyst toward methane conversion.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Unsaturated Hydrocarbon Chains through C&#8722;S Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;S activation is used in a surface&#8208;supported reaction to create a reticulated network of conjugated hydrocarbon chains on Cu(111). The reaction is initiated at low annealing temperature and the product is characterized by high&#8208;resolution scanning probe microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
We use an on&#8208;surface synthesis approach to drive the homocoupling reaction of a simple dithiophenyl&#8208;functionalized precursor on Cu(111). The C&#8722;S activation reaction is initiated at low annealing temperature and yields unsaturated hydrocarbon chains interconnected in a fully conjugated reticulated network. High&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy imaging reveals the opening of the thiophenyl rings and the presence of trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;oligoacetylene chains as well as pentalene units. The chemical transformations were studied by C 1s and S 2p core level photoemission spectroscopy and supported by theoretical calculations. At higher annealing temperature, additional cyclization reactions take place, leading to the formation of small graphene flakes.

Carbamoyl fluorides are among the emerging fluorinated motifs. but are still quite underexplored. So, an efficient, fast, inexpensive, metal&#8208;free and easy&#8208;to&#8208;perform method to access such compounds easily, even with sophisticated molecules, is described. The physicochemical properties of these compounds were measured to give an insight into the potential of carbamoyl fluorides&#8212;in particular, their stability under close&#8208;to&#8208;physiological conditions. Finally, a first application in radiochemistry to obtain fluorine&#8208;18 radiolabeled compounds easily is proposed. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Toulgoat, T.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multifunctional&lt;/b&gt;: Cyclic disulfide liposomes have been developed for the dual purposes of enhancing cellular delivery through reaction with cell-surface thiols and facilitating liposome functionalization. These liposomes are depicted in the form of beach balls being lofted at their target cells: a scene of a warm day at the beach for a summertime issue of &lt;i&gt;Chemistry&#8212;A European Journal&lt;/i&gt;. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;D. Best and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202201164"&gt;10.1002/chem.202201164&lt;/a&gt;).

With his hand holding the sail and his feet on the sailboard, the position of the windsurfer mimics the key strategy of this work: the activation of hydrogenated substrates by chelating coordination with cobalt. The surfer is the cobalt catalyst holding the sail to coordinate parazole, and with his foot on the hydrogenated substrate board to coordinate the vinyl group. Bubbles in the seawater represent the main reagent of the reaction, hydrogen, the dolphin represents the hydrogenated product of this reaction, and the wind represents the bisphosphine ligand that promotes the catalytic activity. Overall, the picture shows that the reaction we developed is powerful like the sport of surfing. More information can be found in the Research Article by Z. Zhang, W. Zhang, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201517).

         <title>Enhancement of Mass and Charge Transfer during Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction by Enhanced Surface Hydrophobicity without a Barrier Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What you want, where you want it: Fewer H2O and more CO2 molecules can be delivered directly to an in&#8208;situ hydrophobic surface for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH3OH. A traditional hydrophobic surface would hinder charge transfer, while for a hydrophilic surface, the low solubility and slow diffusion rate limit the mass transfer of CO2. Our in&#8208;situ surface fluorination strategy overcomes such mass and charge&#8208;transfer limitations enhancing the performance of CRR, which is a promising route for the clean utilization of renewable resources. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Li, E. Kan, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201034).

         <title>Diverse Supports for Immobilization of Catalysts in Continuous Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 39, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supports for immobilization of catalysts in flow reactors are outlined, with emphases on sustainable binding with channel walls and catalysts, boosted catalysts loading and ability to maintain fine flow properties. Particularly, the synergy of supports and catalysts are discerned, as well as the specific designs. In addition, fabrication of array&#8208;like catalytic supports and application of advanced fluidic devices are included.







Abstract
The rapid development of continuous flow processes is driving innovations in various chemical syntheses and industrial productions. Immobilizing catalysts in flow reactors allows transformations with high&#8208;efficiency and excludes the subsequent separation procedures. This concept outlines the approaches to incorporate catalysts within flow reactors, with particular focus on the application of additional supports including inorganic materials like silica, zeolite and reduced graphene oxide, polymeric materials like polymer packings, monoliths, cross&#8208;linked gels and polymer brushes, and other materials for specific conditions like transparent glass fibers and glass beads. Furthermore, advanced methods to develop ordered micro&#8208;/nanoarrays from internal walls of flow channels for immobilization of catalysts as well as application of innovative vortex fluidic devices are discussed to inspire new designs of supports for novel fluidic reactors with broad applications.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Flavonoid&#8208;Cinnamic Acid Amide Hybrids with Distinct Activity against Neurodegeneration in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 39, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavonoid&#8208;cinnamic acid amides were synthesized and evaluated in phenotypic screening assays related to neurodegeneration. The compounds prevent cell death in models of oxidative stress and energy breakdown. The introduction of an amide yielded higher stability towards hydrolysis and altering the flavonoid core structure showed that the quercetin&#8208;cinnamic acid amide hybrid was the most potent compound, and its in&#8197;vitro properties could be translated into high activity in an in&#8197;vivo AD mouse model.







Abstract
Flavonoids are polyphenolic natural products and have shown significant potential as disease&#8208;modifying agents against neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), with activities even in&#8197;vivo. Hybridization of the natural products taxifolin and silibinin with cinnamic acid led to an overadditive effect of these compounds in several phenotypic screening assays related to neurodegeneration and AD. Therefore, we have exchanged the flavonoid part of the hybrids with different flavonoids, which show higher efficacy than taxifolin or silibinin, to improve the activity of the respective hybrids. Chemical connection between the flavonoid and cinnamic acid was realized by an amide instead of a labile ester bond to improve stability towards hydrolysis. To investigate the influence of a double bond at the C&#8208;ring of the flavonoid, the dehydro analogues of the respective hybrids were also synthesized. All compounds obtained show neuroprotection against oxytosis, ferroptosis and ATP&#8208;depletion, respectively, in the murine hippocampal cell line HT22. Interestingly, the taxifolin and the quercetin derivatives are the most active compounds, whereby the quercetin derivate shows even more pronounced activity than the taxifolin one in all assays applied. As aimed for, no hydrolysis product was found in cellular uptake experiments after 4&#8197;h whereas different metabolites were detected. Furthermore, the quercetin&#8208;cinnamic acid amide showed pronounced activity in an in&#8197;vivo AD mouse model at a remarkably low dose of 0.3&#8197;mg/kg.

         <title>Tricyanoborane&#8208;Functionalized Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Adjustment of Charge and Stereo&#8208;Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 39, July 11, 2022. </description>

The tricyanoborane group is a highly promising substituent for the design of versatile building blocks. The introduction of one and two B(CN)3 groups at the N atoms of the N&#8208;heterocyclic core of NHC ligands results in a successive increase in &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability in conjunction with a tuning of the ditopic coordination properties.







Abstract
The 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate anion (2) was obtained in high yield by deprotonation of the B(CN)3&#8208;methylimidazole adduct 1. Regarding charge and stereo&#8208;electronic properties, anion 2 closes the gap between well&#8208;known neutral NHCs and the ditopic dianionic NHC, the 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate dianion (IIb). The influence of the number of N&#8208;bonded tricyanoborane moieties on the &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of NHCs was assessed by quantum chemical calculations and verified by experimental data on 2, IIb, and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMe, IIa). Therefore NHC 2, which acts as a ditopic ligand via the carbene center and the cyano groups, was reacted with alkyl iodides, selenium, and [Ni(CO)4] yielding alkylated imidazoles 3 and 4, the anionic selenium adduct 5, and the anionic nickel tricarbonyl complex 8, respectively. The results of this study prove that charge, number of coordination sites, buried volume (%Vbur) and &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor abilities of NHCs can be effectively fine&#8208;tuned via the number of tricyanoborane substituents.

         <title>Sulfur and Azobenzenes, a Profitable Liaison: Straightforward Synthesis of Photoswitchable Thioglycosides with Tunable Properties</title>

Tunable properties: A direct thioarylation of azobenzenes allows to obtain symmetrical as well as challenging unsymmetrical conjugates in good yields. Importantly, photochromic and thermal relaxation properties can be easily tuned via oxidation of the sulfide linkage.







Abstract
Azobenzene photoswitches are valuable tools for controlling properties of molecular systems with light. We have been investigating azobenzene glycoconjugates to probe carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions and to design glycoazobenzene macrocycles with chiroptical and physicochemical properties modulated by light irradiation. To date, direct conjugation of glycosides to azobenzenes was performed by reactions providing target compounds in limited yields. We therefore sought a more effective and reliable coupling method. In this paper, we report on a straightforward thioarylation of azobenzene derivatives with glycosyl thiols as well as other thiols, thereby increasing the scope of azobenzene conjugation. Even challenging unsymmetrical conjugates can be achieved in good yields via sequential or one&#8208;pot procedures. Importantly, red&#8208;shifted azoswitches, which are addressed with visible light, were easily functionalized. Additionally, by oxidation of the sulfide bridge to the respective sulfones, both the photochromic and the thermal relaxation properties of the core azobenzene can be tuned. Utilizing this option, we realized orthogonal three&#8208;state photoswitching in mixtures containing two distinct azobenzene thioglycosides.

         <title>Revisiting the Environment Effect on Mass Transfer for Heterogenized Pd6Ru8 Metal&#8208;Organic Cage Photocatalyst Confined within 3D Matrix</title>

Water directly takes part in the formation of H2 catalyzed by MOC&#8208;16@UiO&#8208;66, evidenced by a kinetic isotope effect, in addition to the proton delivery thanks to the hydrophilic nature of UiO&#8208;66. The porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 is essential for the permeation of sacrificial reagent to serve as two&#8208;electron donor, in sharp contrast as one&#8208;electron donor in nonporous CZIF matrix.







Abstract
Artificial light&#8208;driven splitting of water into hydrogen involves multiple links to emulate natural photosynthesis, including light absorption, electron or energy transfer, surface catalysis et&#8197;al., in which, the mass transportation of sacrificial reagent and reactant is always ignored. Metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) of Pd6Ru8 (MOC&#8208;16), assembling multiple photosensitive Ru and catalytic Pd concomitant with directional electron transfer between them, provides an opportunity to explore the environmental effects from the view point of mass transportation without disturbance of other links. Zr&#8208;MOF of UiO&#8208;66 is used as a matrix to heterogenize MOC&#8208;16 and a series of characterizations are carried out to unravel the composition, structure and optical properties. The intact MOC&#8208;16 remains with long&#8208;term photo&#8208;stability and the outstanding photocatalytic activity is obtained by virtue of a long&#8208;lived triplet state. Three matrixes of ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;8 derived carbonate CZIF, and UiO&#8208;66 are intercompared for mass transfer based on wettability and porous structure.

The porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 is essential for the permeation of sacrificial reagent to serve as two&#8208;electron donor, in sharp contrast as one&#8208;electron donor in nonporous CZIF matrix.

Abstract
A new class of electrophilic monofluoromethylselenolation reagents, Se&#8208;(fluoromethyl) benzenesulfonoselenoates, has been developed. They can be readily prepared from sodium benzenesulfinates, Se powder and ClCFH2 in one step under mild reaction conditions. Se&#8208;(fluoromethyl) benzenesulfonoselenoates are efficient electrophilic monofluoromethylselenolation reagents for a wide range of nucleophiles including indole, 6&#8208;azaindole, pyrrole, thiophene, electron&#8208;rich arene, aryl boronic acid and alkyne. The monofluoromethylselenolation approach features mild and environmentally friendly reaction conditions, good tolerance of various functional groups, and broad substrate scope.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled [3+2] Annulation of Aromatic Acids with Maleimides by C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;enabled palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with maleimides without incorporating any exogenous directing group has been developed. The annulation reaction proceeds via double C&#8722;H bond activation such as C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation. An external ligand (MPAA) is crucial for the success of the present protocol. A plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed to account for the present [3+2] cyclization reaction.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of substituted benzoic acids with maleimides leading to tricyclic heterocyclic molecules having a free carboxylic group in a high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical manner is described. The reaction proceeds via a dual C&#8722;H bond activation such as C(sp3)&#8722;H at the benzylic position and C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation at the meta position of substituted aromatics. An external ligand (MPAA) is crucial for the success of present protocol. Further, the decarboxylation and esterification of the free carboxylic acid group of observed products were carried out.

2,3&#8208;Disubstituted fluorene platforms for the construction of high&#8208;efficiency host materials for green phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Fluorene is a classic three&#8208;membered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and it has been widely used in optoelectronic devices. Here we explore a simple and efficient strategy for the derivatization at the 2&#8208; and 3&#8208; positions in fluorene unit. By introducing different types of substituents, we design two pairs of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene isomers and use them as host materials for phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PHOLEDs). The green PHOLEDs hosted by these fluorene derivatives realize high external quantum efficiencies (EQE) over 20&#8201;% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. Particularly, the devices hosted by 2TRz3TPA and 2TPA3TRz achieve nearly 24&#8201;% EQE and 104&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 power efficiency. These results clearly demonstrate that the 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene platforms are potentially useful for constructing host materials.

         <title>A Shared Prebiotic Formation of Neopterins and Guanine Nucleosides from Pyrimidine Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 39, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plausible prebiotic availability of 6&#8208;aminopyrimidines makes the formation of purine nucleosides by Traube reaction an interesting pathway to explore. However, the formation of a pterin ring is the preferred outcome relative to purine nucleoside synthesis, which requires a high sugar excess to be significant. We show that a urea&#8208;based solvent is a suitable medium for the formylation, synthesis of purine/pterin ring and subsequent phosphorylation.







Abstract
The prebiotic origins of biopolymers and metabolic co&#8208;factors are key questions in Origins of Life studies. In a simple warm&#8208;little&#8208;pond model, using a drying phase to produce a urea&#8208;enriched solution, we present a prebiotic synthetic path for the simultaneous formation of neopterins and tetrahydroneopterins, along with purine nucleosides. We show that, in the presence of ribose and in a formylating environment consisting of urea, ammonium formate, and water (UAFW), the formation of neopterins from pyrimidine precursors is robust, while the simultaneous formation of guanosine requires a significantly higher ribose concentration. Furthermore, these reactions provide a tetrahydropterin&#8211;pterin redox pair. This model suggests a prebiotic link in the origin of purine nucleosides and pterin cofactors that provides a possible deep prebiotic temporal connection for the emergence of nucleic acids and metabolic cofactors.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Modification via Deaminative Photochemical Csp3&#8208;Csp3 Bond Formation Using Katritzky Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 39, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method was developed to convert lysine residues on peptides to Katritzky salts directly on solid support. These salts can then be used for a photochemical deaminative Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond forming Giese reaction. The applicability of the reaction was demonstrated with various resins, all proteinogenic amino acids, and a variety of substrates.







Abstract
Introduction of unnatural amino acids can significantly improve the binding affinity and stability of peptides. Commercial availability of such amino acids is limited, and their synthesis is a long and tedious process. We here describe a method that allows the functionalization of peptides directly on solid&#8208;support by converting lysine residues to Katritzky salts, and subjecting them to a photochemical Giese reaction under mild reaction conditions. The method avoids the need for amino acid synthesis and instead offers a late&#8208;stage modification route for rapid peptide diversification. While numerous modification approaches at the lysine amine have been described, this work provides the first example of deaminative functionalization of peptides at lysine. The two&#8208;step protocol is compatible with various substrates, lysine analogues, resins, and all proteinogenic amino acids. Finally, by leveraging solid&#8208;phase modification, this protocol facilitates the functionalization of longer peptides as was demonstrated using biologically relevant peptides of up to 15 amino acids.

         <title>Chlorine&#8208;Substituted N&#8208;Heteroacene Analogues Acting as Organic Semiconductors for Solution&#8208;Processed n&#8208;type Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

Organic semiconductors: Chlorine&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues are synthesized and the field&#8208;effect transistors based on these compounds show high electron&#8208;transport mobility of up to 0.04&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
High performance solution processable n&#8208;type organic semiconductor is an essential element to realize low&#8208;cost, all organic and flexible composite logic circuits. In the design of n&#8208;type semiconducting materials, tuning the LUMO level of compounds is a key point. As a strong electron withdrawing unit, the introduction of chlorine atom into the chemical structure can increase the electron affinity of the material and reduce the LUMO energy level. Here, a series chlorine substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues of 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (O4Cl), 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thio)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (S4Cl), 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11&#8208;octachloro&#8208;6,13&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;b]phenazine (8Cl) and 12Cl have been synthesized and characterized. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on these four compounds exhibit good electron mobilities of 0.04&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, 0.01&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, 2&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 3&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, under ambient conditions. The results suggest that these chlorine substituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;heteroacene analogues are promising n&#8208;type semiconductors in OFET applications.

In the design of n-type semiconducting materials, tuning the LUMO level of compounds is a key point. As a strong electron withdrawing unit, the introduction of chlorine atom into the chemical structure can increase the electron affinity of the material and reduce the LUMO energy level. Here, a series chlorine substituted N-heteroacene analogues of 6,7,8,9-tetrachloro-4,11-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-b]phenazine (O4Cl), 6,7,8,9-tetrachloro-4,11-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)thio)phenyl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-b]phenazine (S4Cl), 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11-octachloro-6,13-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)quinoxalino[2,3-b]phenazine (8Cl) and 12Cl have been synthesized and characterized. Solution-processed organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on these four compounds exhibit good electron mobilities of 0.04&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.01&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, under ambient conditions. The results suggest that these chlorine substituted &#960;-conjugated N-heteroacene analogues are promising n-type semiconductors in OFET applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring the NIR&#8208;II Photoluminescence of Single Thiolated Au25 Nanoclusters by Selective Binding to Proteins
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 39, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sometimes what glisters is gold: We have succeeded in incorporating a single atomically precise gold nanocluster (Au25) inside bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein. A striking increase in Au25&#8208;BSA NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence is observed compared to that from Au25. The results reveal an intricate role of protein rigidification and the involvement of the surface state in the generation of NIR&#8208;II emissions.







Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters are a fascinating class of nanomaterials that exhibit molecule&#8208;like properties and have outstanding photoluminescence (PL). Their ultrasmall size, molecular chemistry, and biocompatibility make them extremely appealing for selective biomolecule labeling in investigations of biological mechanisms at the cellular and anatomical levels. In this work, we report a simple route to incorporate a preformed Au25 nanocluster into a model bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein. A new approach combining small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and molecular modeling provides a clear localization of a single Au25 within the protein to a cysteine residue on the gold nanocluster surface. Attaching Au25 to BSA strikingly modifies the PL properties with enhancement and a redshift in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. This study paves the way to conrol the design of selective sensitive probes in biomolecules through a ligand&#8208;based strategy to enable the optical detection of biomolecules in a cellular environment by live imaging.

         <title>Engineering PdIr Nanostructures Synergistically Induced by Self&#8208;assembled Surfactants and Halide Ions for Alcohol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 39, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced electrocatalyst engineering: Engineering PdIr nanostructures synergistically induced by self&#8208;assembled surfactants and halide ions were realized to prepare different architectures, including ultrathin nanodendrites (NDs), solid nanosheets (NSs), connected nanorings (NRs), nanoflowers (NFs), and multiply concave nanocubes (MCs). These highly anisotropic structures not only expose rich unsaturated sites, but also protect Pd sites from toxicity and electrical corrosion, which synergistically enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of metallic nanocatalysts with distinct nanostructures and composition is still a noteworthy topic in the electrochemistry field. In this work, we have realized the morphological evolution of PdIr nanostructures in aqueous solution through the synergistic effect of self&#8208;assembled functional surfactants and different halide ions, and achieved precise control of the kinetic and thermodynamic crystalline growth due to the different reduction potential between PdCl42&#8722;, PdBr42&#8722;, and PdI42&#8722;. The actual precursors of PdCl42&#8722; resulted in ultrathin nanodendrites, PdClxBr(4&#8722;x)2&#8722; for nanosheets and fewer branched nanodendrites, PdClxI(4&#8722;x)2&#8722; for nanorings, nanoflowers and multiply concave nanocubes. Owing to the synergistic advantages of structure and composition (alloyed Ir), PdIr nanodendrites exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity, anti&#8208;poisoning ability, and stability toward alcohols (including ethanol, methanol, and glycerol) electrooxidation reactions. The results would be helpful for thoroughly understanding how structure&#8208;directing surfactants and halide ions synergistically determine the production of advanced metallic nanocrystals.

         <title>Direct Participation of Solvent Molecules in the Formation of Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 39, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;matching between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedges and hydrocarbon solvent molecules regulates supramolecular polymerization and gelation. Such non&#8208;trivial solvent effect strongly evokes the possibility of direct participation of solvent molecules in the nucleation by shape&#8208;matching dependent van der Waals interaction and presence of a closely associates solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers similar to first layer of water molecules around the protein surface.







Abstract
This article reports supramolecular polymerization of two bis&#8208;amide functionalized naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) building blocks (NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C) in two solvents, namely n&#8208;heptane (Hep) and methylcyclohexane (MCH). NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C differ only by the peripheral hydrocarbon wedges, consisting of linear C7 chains or cyclic methylcyclohexane rings, respectively. UV/Vis and FTIR spectroscopy studies reveal distinct internal order and H&#8208;bonding pattern for NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C aggregates irrespective of the solvent system, indicating the dominant role of the intrinsic packing parameters of the individual building block, possibly influenced by the peripheral steric crowding. However, NDI&#8722;L produces a significantly stronger gel in Hep compared to MCH as evident from the rheological and thermal properties. In contrast, NDI&#8722;C exhibits a clear preference for MCH, producing gel with moderate strength but in Hep it fails to produce 1D morphology or gelation. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies corroborate with the experimental observation and provide the rationale for the observed solvent&#8208;shape effect by revealing a quantitative estimate regarding the thermodynamics of self&#8208;assembly in these four combinations. Such clear&#8208;cut shape&#8208;matching effect (between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedge and the solvent system) unambiguously support a direct participation of the solvent molecules during supramolecular polymerization and presence of a closely&#8208;adhered solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers, similar to the first layer of water molecules around the protein surface. Solvent induced CD experiments support this hypothesis as induced CD band was observed only from a chiral co&#8208;solvent of matching shape. This is reconfirmed by the higher de&#8208;solvation temperature of the shape&#8208;matching NDI/solvent system combination compared to the shape mis&#8208;match combination in variable temperature UV/Vis experiments, revealing transformation to a different aggregate at higher temperatures rather than disassembly to the monomer for all four combinations.

         <title>HPLC&#8208;Based Automated Synthesis of Glycans in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 39, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new experimental set&#8208;up for a HPLC&#8208;A in solution system includes the following modifications: 4&#8208;way split valve, in&#8208;line molecular sieve cartridge and a fraction collector, which enabled fully automated batch synthesis of multiple oligosaccharides with the single press of a button.







Abstract
As the 21st century unfolds with rapid changes, new challenges in research and development emerge. These new challenges prompted us to repurpose our HPLC&#8722;A platform that was previously used in solid phase glycan synthesis to a solution phase batch synthesis described herein. The modular character of HPLC allows for implementing new attachments. To enable sequential synthesis of multiple oligosaccharides with the single press of a button, we supplemented our system with a four&#8208;way split valve and an automated fraction collector. This enabled the operator to load all reagents and all reactants in the autosampler, press the button to start the repetitive automation sequence, leave the lab, and upon return find products of multiple reactions ready for purification, analysis, and subsequent application.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new experimental set-up for a HPLC-A in solution system&lt;/b&gt; includes the following modifications: 4-way split valve, in-line molecular sieve cartridge and a fraction collector, which enabled fully automated batch synthesis of multiple oligosaccharides with the single press of a button.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century unfolds with rapid changes, new challenges in research and development emerge. These new challenges prompted us to repurpose our HPLC&#8722;A platform that was previously used in solid phase glycan synthesis to a solution phase batch synthesis described herein. The modular character of HPLC allows for implementing new attachments. To enable sequential synthesis of multiple oligosaccharides with the single press of a button, we supplemented our system with a four-way split valve and an automated fraction collector. This enabled the operator to load all reagents and all reactants in the autosampler, press the button to start the repetitive automation sequence, leave the lab, and upon return find products of multiple reactions ready for purification, analysis, and subsequent application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Front Cover: A Shared Prebiotic Formation of Neopterins and Guanine Nucleosides from Pyrimidine Bases (Chem. Eur. J. 39/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 39, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guanosine and pterins are depicted as the constellation Gemini. Guanine nucleosides are one of the immortal survivors of prebiotic chemistry, becoming the focus of many prebiotic reactions. However, like Pollux from Greek mythology, guanosine would not have been born alone&#8212;pterins would have been formed in equal (or, in this case, even in major) parts through prebiotic reactions. Pterins, similar to Castor, would have been equally important for nascent biochemical reactions, paving the way to modern biochemistry. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Menor&#8208;Salv&#225;n, N.&#8197;V. Hud, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200714).

Nanocluster in a jewel case: A single, atomically precise gold nanocluster (Au25) has been incorporated inside bovine serum albumin protein. A striking increase in Au25&#8208;BSA NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence was observed as compared to Au25. The results reveal the intricate role of protein rigidification and the involvement of different excited states in the generation of NIR&#8208;II emissions. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Bona&#269;i&#263;&#8208;Kouteck&#253;, X. Le&#8197;Gu&#233;vel, R. Antoine, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200570).

Abstract
Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) as a major reactive oxygen species plays important roles in cellular signal transduction and homeostatic regulation. Precise detection of ONOO&#8722; in biological systems is vital for exploring its physiological and pathological function. Among numerous detection methods, fluorescence imaging technology using fluorescent probes offers some advantages, including simple operation, high sensitivity and selectivity, as well as real&#8208;time and nondestructive detection. In particular, ratiometric fluorescent probes, in which the built&#8208;in calibration of the two emission bands prevents interference from the biological environment, have been extensively employed to monitor the fluctuation of bioactive species. In this review, we will discuss small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for ONOO&#8722; in live cells or in&#8197;vivo, which involves chemical structures, response mechanisms, and biological applications. Moreover, the challenges and future prospects of ONOO&#8722;&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescent probe are also proposed.

         <title>A Shared Prebiotic Formation of Neopterins and Guanine Nucleosides from Pyrimidine Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 39, July 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Our results provide the first glimpse of a possible common origin of purine nucleosides and pterins, thus suggesting a very deep, common history of enzyme cofactor and RNA synthesis.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202200714).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the groups of C&#233;sar Menor&#8208;Salv&#225;n, Facundo Fern&#225;ndez and Nicholas&#8197;V. Hud at the University of Alcala and the Georgia Institute of Technology. The image depicts the authors contemplating the origin of pterins and guanosine nucleosides from a common precursor, with the art&#8208;gallery setting embodying their feeling that the common synthetic pathways of these molecules in both the prebiotic world and in biochemistry is a natural work of (chemical) art.

         <title>Development of an Enantioselective Allylic Alkylation of Acyclic &#945;&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters for the Asymmetric Synthesis of 3&#8208;Fluoropiperidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first usefully&#8208;enantioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation of &#945;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;ketoesters has been achieved using the Trost family of chiral ligands providing products in up to 92% ee. This work provides new insights that can address the typically modest selectivities associated with acyclic &#945;&#8208;fluoroenolates, and provides experimental evidence that the typically poor levels of enantiocontrol associated with these systems is not necessarily due to the presence of E/Z enolate mixtures. Finally, this methodology allows useful 3&#8208;fluoropiperidine intermediates to be easily prepared, and we demonstrate that these systems are amenable to a range of functionalization reactions leading to new building blocks for the discovery of bioactive products.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexible Alkylene Bridges as a Tool to Engineer Crystal Structures of Distyrylbenzene Enabling Highly Fluorescent Monomeric Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To design ultrabright fluorescent solid dyes, a crystal engineering strategy that enables monomeric emission by blocking intermolecular electronic interactions is required. We introduced propylene moieties to distyrylbenzene (DSB) as bridges between the phenyl rings either side of its C=C bonds. The bridged DSB derivatives formed compact crystals that emit colors similar to those of the same molecules in dilute solution, with high quantum yields. The introduction of flexible seven&#8208;membered rings to the DSB core produced moderate distortion and steric hindrance in the DSB &#960;&#8208;plane. However, owing to this strategy, it was possible to control the molecular arrangement with almost no decrease in the crystal density, and intermolecular electronic interactions were suppressed. The bridged DSB crystal structure differs from other DSB derivative structures; thus, bridging affords access to novel crystalline systems. This design strategy has important implications in many fields and is more effective than the conventional photofunctional molecular crystal design strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrocarbon Soluble Alkali&#8208;Metal&#8208;Aluminium Hydride Surrog[ATES]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of group 1 hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble donor free aluminates [AM(  t  BuDHP)(TMP)Al(  i  Bu)  2  ] (AM = Li, Na, K, Rb) have been synthesised by combining an alkali metal dihydropyridyl unit [(2&#8208;  t  BuC  5  H  5  N)AM)] containing a surrogate hydride (sp  3  C&#8212;H) with [(  i  Bu)  2  Al(TMP)]. These aluminates have been characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. While the lithium aluminate forms a monomer, the heavier alkali metal aluminates exist as polymeric chains propagated by non&#8208;covalent interactions between the alkali metal cations and the alkyldihydropyridinyl units. Solvates [(THF)Li(  t  BuDHP)(TMP)Al(  i  Bu)  2  ] and [(TMEDA)Na(  t  BuDHP)(TMP)Al(  i  Bu)  2  ] have also been crystallographically characterised. Theoretical calculations show how the dispersion forces tend to increase on moving from Li to Rb, as opposed to the electrostatic forces of stabilization, which are orders of magnitude more significant. Having unique structural features, these bimetallic compounds can be considered as starting points for exploring unique reactivity trends as alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;aluminium hydride surrog[ATES].</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report herein a convenient and scalable dearomative hydroacylation reaction of indoles. Employing readily available aldehydes as the acyl source and TBADT as an inexpensive direct HAT photocatalyst, a variety of indoles derivatives were converted into synthetically interesting 2&#8208;acylindolines in good to excellent yields as well as great diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. An asymmetric version of the reaction was successfully developed and an experimental mechanistic investigation was carried out in order to gain further insights on the assumed reaction pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Superacid&#8208;Mediated Late&#8208;Stage Aromatic Polydeuteration of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simpler the better: While most of the recent studies on late&#8208;stage aromatic polydeuteration focus on the design of metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation procedures, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;setup and broadly applicable method based on the use of superacidic TfOD has been developed that opens new perspectives for the preparation of deuterated drugs.







Abstract
The field of medicinal chemistry is currently witnessing a deuterium rush owing to the remarkable properties of this element as bioisoster of hydrogen atom. Aromatic hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) is one of the most studied strategies nowadays as it promises to access deuterium&#8208;modified drugs directly from their non&#8208;labeled parents. While most of the recent studies focus on metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation strategy, the use of superacidic conditions has been largely overlooked. This study shows that the use of TfOD as reaction medium allows the late&#8208;stage polydeuteration of a broad library of pharmaceuticals bearing a wide array of functional groups, complementing existing procedures.

         <title>New Approaches toward Building Csp&#8722;P bond: A Two&#8208;Decade Overview</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of 1&#8208;alkynylphosphorus compounds has seen significant developments. Transition metals proved to be particularly suitable catalysts allowing the transfer of alkynyl units to various phosphorus reagents forming phosphines, phosphine boranes, phosphine oxides and phosphonates. This review also reports metal&#8208;free approaches that use acidic or basic activation, hypervalent iodine reagents and desulfonative reactions.







Abstract
Since the review of Savignac, the past 20&#8197;years have seen significant progresses on the synthesis of alkynylphosphorus compounds considerably expanding the original and rather limited organic toolbox. This comprehensive review explores the latest and potentially greener methodologies using sustainable catalysis or direct metal&#8208;free couplings from stable and easy to handle precursors. Recent progress and mechanistic insights for metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions with a particular emphasis on copper, palladium, nickel and silver catalytic systems, photocatalytic and metal&#8208;free reactions are detailed covering most of the publications related to this field since 2000 until March 2022.

PVC&#8208;based solvent polymeric membranes uploaded on cellulose&#8208;based Color Catcher absorbent sheets were doped with a fluorescent chemosensor containing a polyamine unit decorated with the 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208; naphthyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzoxazole (HNBO) fluorophore to develop user&#8208;friendly disposable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state devices for the selective detection of Mg2+ in real samples of commercial and tap drinking water, without the interference of Ca2+and other Alkali (A) and Alkaline&#8208;Earth (AE) metal ions.







Abstract
A new series of ligands containing the 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208; naphthyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzoxazole (HNBO) fluorophore showed selectivity for Mg2+ ions, without the interference of Ca2+.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Synthesis of Water&#8208;Soluble Gold Nanoparticles Stabilized by N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbenes: From Structural Characterization to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have become attractive ligands for functionalizing gold nanoparticle surfaces with applications ranging from catalysis to biomedicine. Despite their great potential, NHC stabilized gold colloids (NHC@AuNPs) are still scarcely explored and further efforts should be conducted to improve their design and functionalization. Here, the &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; synthesis of two water&#8208;soluble gold nanoparticles (  AuNP&#8208;1  &#160;and&#160;  AuNP&#8208;2  ) stabilized by hydrophilic mono&#8208; and bidentate NHC ligands is reported together with their&#160; characterization by various spectroscopic and analytical methods. The NPs showed key differences likely to be due to the selected NHC ligand systems .&#160;Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed small&#160;  quasi  &#8208;spherical and faceted NHC@AuNPs of similar particle size (  ca  . 2.3 &#8208; 2.6 nm) and narrow particle size distribution, but the colloids featured different ratios of Au(I)/Au(0) by &#160; X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) . &#160; Furthermore,&#160; the NHC@AuNPs  &#160;  were supported  &#160;  on titania and fully characterized. The new NPs were studied for their catalytic activity towards the reduction of nitrophenol substrates, the reduction of resazurin and for&#160;their  &#160;  photothermal efficiency. Initial results on their application in photothermal therapy (PTT)&#160;were obtained in human cancer cells&#160;  in vitro  . The aforementioned reactions represent important model reactions towards waste water remediation, bioorthogonal transformations and cancer treatment</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature Driven Transformation of the Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework DUT&#8208;8(Ni)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DUT&#8208;8(Ni) metal&#8208;organic framework belongs to the family of flexible pillared layer materials. The desolvated framework can be obtained in the open pore form (op) or in the closed pore form (cp), depending on the crystal size regime. In the present work, we report on the behaviour of desolvated DUT&#8208;8(Ni) at elevated temperatures. For both, op and cp variants, heating causes a structural transition, leading to an new, crystalline compound, containing two interpenetrated networks. The state of the framework before transition (op  vs.  cp) influences the transition temperature: the small particles of the op phase transform at significantly lower temperature in comparison to the macroparticles of the cp phase, transforming close to the decomposition temperature. The new compound, confined closed pore phase (ccp), was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and spectroscopic techniques, such as IR, EXAFS, and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). Thermal effects of structural cp to ccp transitions were studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), showing an overall exothermic effect of the process, involving bond breaking and reformation. Theoretical calculations reveal the energetics, driving the observed temperature induced phase transition.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethylene Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (CCTPISA)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Block copolymers based on ethylene (E) and butadiene (B) were prepared using the ansa &#8208;bis(fluorenyl complex {Me 2 Si(C 13 H 8 ) 2 Nd(BH 4 ) 2 Li(THF)} 2 in combination with ( n&#8208; Bu)( n&#8208; Oct)Mg (BOMAG) as a chain transfer agent. The diblock copolymers incorporating a soft poly(ethylene&#8208; co &#8208;butadiene) segment, called EBR for Ethylene Butadiene Rubber, and a hard polyethylene (PE) one were obtained by simply adjusting the different feeds of monomers during the polymerization. The soluble EBR block was formed first by feeding the catalytic system dissolved in toluene at 70 &#176;C with a mixture of ethylene and butadiene (E/B molar ratio = 80/20). Then the feeding was stopped leading to the consumption of a large part of the residual monomers. The reactor was finally fed with ethylene to form the PE block. By varying the molar mass of the latter, it is shown that the resulting soft&#8208; b &#8208;hard block copolymers can self&#8208;assemble simultaneously to the growth of the PE block in agreement with a polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) mechanism. The self&#8208;assembly is discussed considering the reaction conditions, the crystallization of the PE block and the polymerization mechanism involved.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Optical Chirality Sensing with a Sterically Encumbered Aminoborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A sterically encumbered aminoborane sensor is introduced and used for quantitative stereochemical analysis of monoalcohols, diols and amino alcohols. The small&#8208;molecule probe exhibits a rigid ortho&#8208;substituted arene scaffold with a proximate boron binding site and a triarylamine circular dichroism (CD) reporter unit which proved to be crucial for the observed chiroptical signal induction. Coordination of the chiral target molecule produces strong Cotton effects and UV changes that are readily correlated to its absolute configuration, enantiomeric composition and concentration to achieve comprehensive stereochemical analysis within a 5% absolute error margin.

The small-molecule probe exhibits a rigid ortho-substituted arene scaffold with a proximate boron binding site and a triarylamine circular dichroism (CD) reporter unit which proved to be crucial for the observed chiroptical signal induction. Coordination of the chiral target molecule produces strong Cotton effects and UV changes that are readily correlated to its absolute configuration, enantiomeric composition and concentration to achieve comprehensive stereochemical analysis within a 5% absolute error margin. The sensing method was successfully applied in the chromatography-free analysis of less than one milligram of a crude asymmetric reaction mixture and the advantages of this chiroptical sensing approach, which is amenable to high-throughput experimentation equipment and automation, over traditional methods is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescent P&#8208;Hydroxyphosphole for Peptide Labeling through P&#8208;N Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward synthesis of new P&#8208;hydroxyphosphole&#8208;oxide and &#8208;sulfide based fluorophores exhibiting large Stokes shifts, and their coupling to biomolecules through the formation of P&#8722;N bond is presented herein. The fluorescent P&#8208;hydroxybinaphtylphosphole&#8208;oxide was coupled to a ghrelin receptor (GHSR) antagonist and the binding of the conjugates was highlighted by F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).







Abstract
Synthesis of fluorescent P&#8208;hydroxybinaphtylphosphole&#8208;oxide or &#8208;sulfide was achieved by trapping a binaphtyl dianion with methyl dichlorophosphite or P&#8208;(N,N&#8208;diethylamino)dichlorophosphine, followed by oxidation or sulfuration of the P&#8208;center. After saponification or acid hydrolysis, the P&#8208;hydroxyphospholes were coupled to peptides using the coupling agent BOP, under the conditions required for the synthesis in solution or on a solid support. This new method was illustrated by the labeling of the JMV2959, a potent antagonist of the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor type 1a (GHS&#8722;R1a). The labeled conjugates were used to characterize GHSR ligands by competition assays, based on Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Such P&#8208;hydroxyphosphole&#8208;oxide or &#8208;sulfide constitute a promising new class of compact fluorophores with large Stokes shift, for labeling biomolecules by grafting through the phosphorus atom.

         <title>Structural and ITC Characterization of Peptide&#8208;Protein Binding: Thermodynamic Consequences of Cyclization Constraints, a Case Study on Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Does affinity come from constraint ? The thermodynamic and structural analysis of a series of constrained peptide ligands and unconstrained analogues accurately describes the binding process. It highlights how the variation in conformational and vibrational entropies associated with the constraints impacts the affinity.







Abstract
Macrocyclization constraints are widely used in the design of protein ligands to stabilize their bioactive conformation and increase their affinities. However, the resulting changes in binding entropy can be puzzling and uncorrelated to affinity gains. Here, the thermodynamic (Isothermal Titration Calorimetry) and structural (X&#8208;ray, NMR and CD) analysis of a complete series of lactam&#8208;bridged peptide ligands of the vascular endothelial growth factor, and their unconstrained analogs are reported. It is shown that differences in thermodynamics arise mainly from the folding energy of the peptide upon binding. The systematic reduction in conformational entropy penalty due to helix pre&#8208;organization can be counterbalanced by an unfavorable vibrational entropy change if the constraints are too rigid. The gain in configurational entropy partially escapes the enthalpy/entropy compensation and leads to an improvement in affinity. The precision of the analytical ITC method makes this study a possible benchmark for constrained peptides optimization.

         <title>[(CH3)Al(CH2)]12: Methylaluminomethylene (MAM&#8208;12)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The next stage towards the cage: [(CH3)Al(CH2)]12 (MAM&#8208;12) is accessible in high yield through Ga/Al transmetalation with homoleptic gallium methylene [Ga8(CH2)12] and trimethylaluminium. MAM&#8208;12 adopts a cage&#8208;like structure, similar to the structural motifs proposed for the elusive methylaluminoxane [(CH3)Al(O)]n (MAO), featuring three distinct aluminium coordinations. MAM&#8208;12 is insoluble in aliphatic/aromatic solvents and disaggregates to MAM&#8208;3 and [Me2Al&#8208;CH2&#8208;AlMe2] in a coordinating solvent like THF as suggested by a DOSY NMR experiments.







Abstract
The molecular structure of enigmatic &#8220;poly(aluminium&#8208;methyl&#8208;methylene)&#8221; (first reported in 1968) has been unraveled in a transmetalation reaction with gallium methylene [Ga8(CH2)12] and AlMe3. The existence of cage&#8208;like methylaluminomethylene moieties was initially suggested by the reaction of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metallocene complex [Cp*2Lu{(&#956;&#8208;Me)2AlMe2}] with excess AlMe3 affording the deca&#8208;aluminium cluster [Cp*4Lu2(&#956;3&#8208;CH2)12Al10(CH3)8] in low yield (Cp*=C5Me5). Treatment of [Ga8(CH2)12] with excess AlMe3 reproducibly gave the crystalline dodeca&#8208;aluminium complex [(CH3)12Al12(&#956;3&#8208;CH2)12] (MAM&#8208;12). Revisiting a previous approach to &#8220;poly(aluminium&#8208;methyl&#8208;methylene&#8221; by using a (C5H5)2TiCl2/AlMe3 (1&#8201;:&#8201;100) mixture led to amorphous solids displaying solubility behavior and spectroscopic features similar to those of crystalline MAM&#8208;12. The gallium methylene&#8208;derived MAM&#8208;12 was used as an efficient methylene transfer reagent for ketones.

         <title>Carbon Dots for Carbon Dummies: The Quantum and The Molecular Questions Among Some Others</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite almost 20&#8201;years of intensive research on carbon dots (CDs), their actual nature remains obscure. This review aims at summarizing facts and conclusions from literature as well as bringing critical perspectives on the alleged quantum or molecular nature of CDs.







Abstract
Carbon Dots (CDs) are carbon nanoparticles which were discovered in 2004. Despite two decades of intensive work from the scientific community and a colossal amount of gathered experimental data, no definitive consensus exists to date on several key aspects such as the actual definition of CDs and the origin of their emissive properties. This review proposes a critical evaluation of these fundamental questions. Lay persons will also find here an alternative introduction to the CDs domain, including synthetic strategies, photophysical properties, as well as challenges and outlook of this exciting new area.

         <title>Photothermal Oxidation of Cinnamyl Alcohol with Hydrogen Peroxide Catalyzed by Gold Nanoparticle/Antimony&#8208;Doped Tin Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heat is on: Gold/antimony&#8208;doped tin oxide nanocrystals show thermally activated catalytic activity for the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde by hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic activity increases with an increase in the Au particle size (dAu) at 5.3&#8804;dAu&#8804;8.2&#8197;nm. Light irradiation (&#955;ex &gt;660&#8197;nm, &#8764;0.5 sun) of Au/ATO NCs gives rise to an increase in the rate of reaction of more than two times with &#8764;95&#8201;% selectivity due to the photothermal effect of ATO NCs.







Abstract
Gold nanoparticles with different mean sizes were formed on antimony&#8208;doped tin oxide nanocrystals by the temperature&#8208;varied deposition&#8208;precipitation method (Au/ATO NCs). Au/ATO NCs possess strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region due to Drude excitation in addition to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AuNPs around 530&#8197;nm. Au/ATO NCs show thermally activated catalytic activity for the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde by hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic activity increases with a decrease in the mean Au particle size (dAu) at 5.3&#8197;nm&#8804;dAu&#8804;8.2&#8197;nm. Light irradiation (&#955;ex &gt;660&#8197;nm, &#8764;0.5 sun) of Au/ATO NCs increases the rate of reaction by more than twice with &#8764;95&#8201;% selectivity. Kinetic analyses indicated that the striking enhancement of the reaction stems from the rise in the temperature near the catalyst surface of &#8764;30&#8197;K due to the photothermal effect of the ATO NCs.

         <title>Diastereoselectivity is in the Details: Minor Changes Yield Major Improvements to the Synthesis of Bedaquiline
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bedaquiline fumarate is a crucial drug for treatment of multidrug&#8208;resistant tuberculosis. Improvements to the industrial synthesis are reported here that affords racemic bedaquiline in yields twice as high as those reported in patents, presenting an opportunity to dramatically improve the affordability of this drug. Close attention to reaction mechanism informed optimization of this synthesis by providing rationale for operational controls and reaction parameters that influence yield and diastereoselectivity in surprising ways.







Abstract
Bedaquiline is a crucial medicine in the global fight against tuberculosis, yet its high price places it out of reach for many patients. Herein, we describe improvements to the key industrial lithiation&#8208;addition sequence that enable a higher yielding and therefore more economical synthesis of bedaquiline. Prioritization of mechanistic understanding and multi&#8208;lab reproducibility led to optimized reaction conditions that feature an unusual base&#8208;salt pairing and afford a doubling of the yield of racemic bedaquiline. We anticipate that implementation of these improvements on manufacturing scale will be facile, thereby substantially increasing the accessibility of this essential medication.

         <title>1+1&gt;2: Fiber Synergy in Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoscopic aggregate is important to transfer or even amplify the molecular information in macroscopic materials. As an important branch of aggregate science, aggregation&#8208;induced emissive luminogens (AIEgens) often show slight or even no emission in solutions but exhibit bright emission when they aggregate, which open a new avenue for the practical applications. Due to the flexible and rotor structure of AIEgens, the aggregate structure of AIEgens is highly sensitive to the surrounding microenvironment, resulting in adjustable optical properties. Fibers integrated of a multiplicity of functional components are ideal carriers to control the aggregation processes, further assembly of fibers produces large&#8208;scale fabrics with amplified functions and practical values. In this Concept article, we focus on the latest advances on the synergy between &#8220;AIE + Fiber&#8221; for the boosted performance that beyond AIE, and their applications are presented and abstracted out to stimulate new ideas for developing &#8220;AIE + Fiber&#8221; systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Pyridinyl or Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with Tunable Near&#8208;infrared Fluorescence through ICT from 4&#8208;Pyridinyl Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aza&#8208;dipyrromethene boron difluoride (Aza&#8208;BODIPY) dyes have attracted much interest in recent decades. In this manuscript, we provide a facile way to access to pyridine&#8208;substituted pyrroles. A series of 1/7&#8208;pyridinyl and pyridinium NIR Aza&#8208;BODIPYs with/without rigidity were constructed and their spectroscopic properties were extensively investigated. These pyridinyl Aza&#8208;BOIDIPYs displayed slight bathochromic shifts and maintained bright NIR emission. Pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs showed increased bathochromic shift, however, the molar extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields were decreased owing to ICT effect. The impacts followed the order of pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium &gt; pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ium &gt; pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ium, which was in consistence with their ICT strength. MO calculation was performed to provide possible explanation to the red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission, and apparent charge separation in pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;ium Aza&#8208;BODIPYs. The pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY localized in lysosome and potentially avoided harmful "alkalinizing effects" of traditional lysosome&#8208;targeting fluorescent dyes containing amine moiety. We are working on construction of pyridinyl and pyridinium Aza&#8208;BODIPY photosensitizers against microbials or tumors.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with fused&#8208;ring structures have rapidly improved the performance of organic solar cells over the past five years, but they still suffer from large synthetic complexity and thus high materials cost, one of the major obstacles of hindering their commercialization process. Constructing non&#8208;fused ring acceptors (NFRAs) recently have been regarded as a feasible solution due to their facile synthesis and satisfactory device performance. Thus in this concept, we highlight the important progress of NFRAs in recent years, and discuss the key relationship between molecular design strategies and device performance. Finally, we provide some potential molecular insights for the future design of high&#8208;performance NFRAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Exfoliation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Phosphorene Sheets and its Energy Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents concise and crucial studies of the recent and most representative developments in electrochemical exfoliation of two&#8208;dimensional phosphorene sheets, including the relationship between exfoliation philosophy, internal mechanisms, processing techniques, and multiple applications of phosphorene. Finally, we also offer our insight into their future challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Recently, single or few&#8208;layer phosphorene has attracted intense attention due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. To this end, mass production of high&#8208;quality phosphorene nanosheets with specific functionalities represents a pivotal factor for the basic academic studies and practical applications. Among the current synthetic methods, electrochemical exfoliation of black phosphorous is one of the most hopeful ways for mass&#8208;production of phosphorene sheets owing to the uncomplicated apparatus, low cost as well as significant efficiency. Especially, regulating the electrochemical parameters not only induces adjustable phosphorene characteristics but also enables them a promising candidate in energy applications. In this Review, a concise and crucial studies of the recent and most representative developments in this domain was introduced, including the relationship between exfoliation philosophy, internal mechanisms, processing techniques, and multiple applications of phosphorene. At the end, a summary discussion and future perspectives is also provided.

         <title>Inducing Curvature to Pyracylene upon &#960;&#8208;Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curve the flat! A reliable synthetic strategy for the &#960;&#8208;expansion of pyracylene towards boat&#8208;shaped polycyclic scaffolds was established. The evolution of the structural, optoelectronic and redox properties in relation to the progressive &#960;&#8208;expansion was comprehensively studied both in experiment and theory. The results identify the compounds as promising chromophores with multi&#8208;stage amphoteric redox properties.







Abstract
We disclose a successive &#960;&#8208;expansion of pyracylene towards boat&#8208;shaped polycyclic scaffolds. The unique structural features of the resulting compounds were revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Depending on the extent of &#960;&#8208;expansion the compounds display intense bathochromically shifted absorption bands in their UV/Vis spectra and are prone to several redox events as documented by cyclic voltammetry. The experimental observations are in line with the computational studies based on density functional theory, suggesting progressive narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and distinct evolution of the electronic structure and aromaticity.

         <title>Real&#8208;Space Interpretation of Interatomic Charge Transfer and Electron Exchange Effects by Combining Static and Kinetic Potentials and Associated Vector Fields
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenomena of interatomic charge transfer and consequent electron exchange were explained in terms of space gaps between the zero&#8208;flux surfaces of atomic and electrostatic and kinetic potential&#8208;based basins. Behaviour of one&#8208;electron potentials included in the Euler equation for electron density and corresponding gradient force fields in crystals was studied.







Abstract
Intricate behaviour of one&#8208;electron potentials from the Euler equation for electron density and corresponding gradient force fields in crystals was studied. Channels of locally enhanced kinetic potential and corresponding saddle Lagrange points were found between chemically bonded atoms. Superposition of electrostatic 
 and kinetic 
 potentials and electron density 
 allowed partitioning any molecules and crystals into atomic 
&#8208; and potential&#8208;based 
&#8208;basins; 
&#8208;basins explicitly account for the electron exchange effect, which is missed for 
&#8208;ones. Phenomena of interatomic charge transfer and related electron exchange were explained in terms of space gaps between zero&#8208;flux surfaces of 
&#8208; and 
&#8208;basins. The gap between 
&#8208; and 
&#8208;basins represents the charge transfer, while the gap between 
&#8208; and 
&#8208;basins is a real&#8208;space manifestation of sharing the transferred electrons caused by the static exchange and kinetic effects as a response against the electron transfer. The regularity describing relative positions of 
&#8208;, 
&#8208;, and 
&#8208; basin boundaries between interacting atoms was proposed. The position of 
&#8208;boundary between 
&#8208; and 
&#8208;ones within an electron occupier atom determines the extent of transferred electron sharing. The stronger an H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond is, the deeper hydrogen atom's 
&#8208;basin penetrates oxygen atom's 
&#8208;basin, while for covalent bonds a 
&#8208;boundary closely approaches a 
&#8208;one indicating almost complete sharing of the transferred electrons. In the case of ionic bonds, the same region corresponds to electron pairing within the 
&#8208;basin of an electron occupier atom.

         <title>Understanding the Reshaping of Fluorinated Polyester Vitrimers by Kinetic and DFT Studies of the Transesterification Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations and an experimental kinetic study of a transesterification reaction were conducted in order to quantitatively assess the effect of neighbouring fluorinated groups on the reaction rate and provide a molecular model for the observed accelerating effect of proximal fluorinated groups in the reshaping of transesterification vitrimers.







Abstract
Vitrimers are a third class of polymers gathering the mechanical properties and solvent resistance of 3D thermosets and the reprocessability of thermoplastics. This unique behaviour is due to the triggering of certain covalent exchange reactions that allow the network to rearrange upon application of a stimulus. The constitutive feature of vitrimers is the adoption of a glass&#8208;like viscosity during the rearrangement of the network, often due to an associative mechanism for the exchange reaction. Transesterification networks are one of the most studied type of vitrimers that usually require the incorporation of a catalyst, implying the associated drawbacks. Following up on a recent report on catalyst&#8208;free transesterification vitrimers in which the ester functions are particularly reactive thanks to the presence of fluorine atoms in &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;position, parallel DFT calculations and an experimental kinetic study on model molecules are presented in order to quantitatively assess the effect of neighbouring fluorinated groups on the transesterification reaction rate.

Chiral ACPs: The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of alkylidenecyclopropanes from electron&#8208;deficient allenes is described. The methodology, using donor&#8208;acceptor or diacceptor diazo reagents, catalyzed by a chiral rhodium complex furnished the corresponding ACPs in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The first diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective cyclopropanation reactions of electron&#8208;deficient allenes with donor&#8208;acceptor and diacceptor diazo reagents are described. The desired enantioenriched alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs) were obtained in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities in the presence of Rh2((S)&#8208;TCPTAD)4 or Rh2((R)&#8208;BTPCP)4 catalysts (up to 95&#8201;% yield, &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 d.r. and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 e.r.). This methodology gave a direct access to ACPs bearing multiple electron&#8208;deficient substituents and allows to further expand the availability of ACPs chemistry. Interestingly, during the examination of the scope of this reaction, the asymmetric intramolecular C&#8722;H insertion reaction into tert&#8208;butyl group was observed as a side reaction with up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.

         <title>Synthesis of Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amido (CMA) Complexes and Their Use as Precatalysts for the Activator&#8208;Free, Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Addition of Carboxylic Acids to Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable synthetic N&#8722;H metalation route to carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amido (CMA) complexes bearing backbone&#8208;modified (and classical) NHC ligands, carbazole and amines is presented. The CMAs are employed for the first time as precatalysts in the inter&#8208; and intramolecular addition of carboxylic acids to alkynes.







Abstract
A straightforward synthetic protocol leading to carbene&#8211;metal&#8211;amido (CMA) complexes (metal=Au, Cu) using a mild base and an environmentally desirable solvent (EtOH) has been explored, with a focus on complexes bearing backbone&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, including BIAN&#8208;NHCs (BIAN=bis(imino)acenaphthene). The novel CMAs were structurally characterized, and gold&#8208;based CMAs bearing diverse NHCs were screened as simple, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;basic precatalysts. The readily accessible complexes display high catalytic activity in the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrocarboxylation of internal alkynes and alkynoic acids respectively, while the screening reveals the ancillary ligand effect of NHCs in these catalytic systems.

         <title>Cyclic Disulfide Liposomes for Membrane Functionalization and Cellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not just decoration: Cyclic disulfide lipids are reported that enable the convenient decoration of liposomal surfaces with functional molecules; this is demonstrated through biotinylation, which drives microplate immobilization. In addition, these lipids enhance cellular delivery when incorporated into liposomes, as evidenced by dose&#8208;dependent increases detected through fluorescence microscopy.







Abstract
Liposomes are effective therapeutic delivery nanocarriers due to their ability to encapsulate and enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of a wide range of therapeutics. Two primary areas in which improvement is needed for liposomal drug delivery is to enhance the ability to infiltrate cells and to facilitate derivatization of the liposome surface. Herein, we report a liposome platform incorporating a cyclic disulfide lipid (CDL) for the dual purpose of enhancing cell entry and functionalizing the liposome membrane through thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange. In order to accomplish this, CDL&#8208;1 and CDL&#8208;2, composed of lipoic acid (LA) or asparagusic acid (AA) appended to a lipid scaffold, were designed and synthesized. A fluorescence&#8208;based microplate immobilization assay was implemented to show that these compounds enable convenient membrane decoration through reaction with thiol&#8208;functionalized small molecules. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy experiments indicated dramatic enhancements in cellular delivery when CDLs were incorporated within liposomes. These results demonstrate that multifunctional CDLs serve as an exciting liposome system for surface decoration and enhanced cellular delivery.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Supported Potassium Hydride for Efficient Low&#8208;Temperature Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature desulfurization is developed based on graphite&#8208;supported potassium hydride. KH/C efficiently desulfurizes recalcitrant alkyl dibenzothiophenes, provides deoxygenation, denitrogenation and catalytic aromatic hydrogenation reactions. In addition, KH/C enables ultra&#8208;deep desulfurization of sulfur heterocycles (&lt;3&#8197;ppm [S]).







Abstract
The industrial removal of organosulfur impurities from fossil fuels relies on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts in harsh conditions (ca. 400&#8201;&#176;C, up to 100&#8197;bar H2), yet desulfurization (DS) of refractory alkyl dibenzothiophenes (DBTs) remains challenging. Here, we report that carbon&#8208;supported potassium hydride (KH/C) enables efficient DS of DBTs in mild conditions, viz. &gt;97&#8201;% conversion of DBTs is achieved at 165&#8201;&#176;C in 3&#8211;6&#8197;h while the yields of respective biphenyls are 84&#8211;95&#8201;% by using only 15&#8201;% excess of KH per a C&#8722;S bond. In addition, KH/C allows to lower the concentration of 4,6&#8208;Me2DBT in the mesitylene solution from 1000&#8197;ppm to &lt;3&#8197;ppm (165&#8201;&#176;C, 20&#8197;h) and provides deoxygenation, denitrogenation and catalytic aromatic hydrogenation reactions. DS of various sulfur heterocycles by using KH/C, a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free material based on earth abundant elements, is viable at low temperature and has prospects for the further development towards decentralized removal of organosulfur species from fossil fuels.

         <title>Mechanical Bond Enhanced Lithium Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Binding by Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic Rotaxanes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of selective lithium halide recognition by a mechanical bonded heteroditopic host is achieved using a series of halogen and hydrogen bonding [2]rotaxanes. A co&#8208;bound lithium cation switches on halide anion binding which increases greatly with increasing number of halogen bond donors. Ion&#8208;pair binding was not observed with the corresponding heteroditopic macrocycles, highlighting the importance of the mechanical bond effect.







Abstract
A family of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems constructed by active metal template (AMT) methodology, were studied for their ability to cooperatively recognise lithium halide (LiX) ion&#8208;pairs. 1H&#8197;NMR ion&#8208;pair titration experiments in CD3CN:CDCl3 solvent mixtures revealed a notable &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8220; of halide anion binding in the presence of a co&#8208;bound lithium cation, with rotaxane hosts demonstrating selectivity for LiBr over LiI. The strength of halide binding was shown to greatly increase with increasing number of halogen bond donors integrated into the interlocked cavity, where an all&#8208;XB rotaxane was found to be the most potent host for LiBr. DFT calculations corroborated these findings, determining the mode of LiX ion&#8208;pair binding. Notably, ion&#8208;pair binding was not observed with the corresponding XB/HB macrocycles alone, highlighting the cooperative, heteroditopic, rotaxane axle&#8208;macrocycle component mechanical bond effect as an efficient strategy for ion&#8208;pair recognition in general.

&lt;p&gt;A family of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems constructed by active metal template (AMT) methodology, were studied for their ability to cooperatively recognise lithium halide (LiX) ion-pairs. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR ion-pair titration experiments in CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN:CDCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solvent mixtures revealed a notable &#8220;switch-on&#8220; of halide anion binding in the presence of a co-bound lithium cation, with rotaxane hosts demonstrating selectivity for LiBr over LiI. The strength of halide binding was shown to greatly increase with increasing number of halogen bond donors integrated into the interlocked cavity, where an all-XB rotaxane was found to be the most potent host for LiBr. DFT calculations corroborated these findings, determining the mode of LiX ion-pair binding. Notably, ion-pair binding was not observed with the corresponding XB/HB macrocycles alone, highlighting the cooperative, heteroditopic, rotaxane axle-macrocycle component mechanical bond effect as an efficient strategy for ion-pair recognition in general.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of 3,4&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;Pyrroles from Ketones, Aldehydes, and Nitro Alkanes via Hydrogenative Cyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active, selective and reusable nickel catalyst has been developed and employed for the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrroles via hydrogenation and subsequent cyclization of nitro ketones. The catalyst was identified from a library of 24 heterogeneous catalysts. The key to our hydrogenation/cyclization reaction is the tolerance of aldehydes and ketones as functional groups and the ability to hydrogenate aliphatic nitro compounds efficiently.







Abstract
Syntheses of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds that permit a flexible introduction of various substitution patterns by using inexpensive and diversely available starting materials are highly desirable. Easy to handle and reusable catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant metals are especially attractive for these syntheses. We report here on the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrroles via the hydrogenation and cyclization of nitro ketones. The latter are easily accessible from three components: a ketone, an aldehyde and a nitroalkane. Our reaction has a broad scope and 23 of the 33 products synthesized are compounds which have not yet been reported. The key to the general hydrogenation/cyclization reaction is a highly active, selective and reusable nickel catalyst, which was identified from a library of 24 earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts.

         <title>Resolving Atomic&#8208;Scale Defects in Conjugated Polymers On&#8208;Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis not only allows growing nanomaterials that are not achievable by traditional wet chemistry but also, combined with scanning probe techniques, enables the structure and electronic properties to be resolved with atomic resolution. Here, atomic&#8208;scale structural defects are deliberately introduced into an anthracene&#8208;ethynylene &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer, and it is shown that such defects may give rise of &#960;&#8208;magnetism. These results demonstrate the potential of defect engineering strategy for fine&#8208;tuning the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers.







Abstract
Atomic scale defects significantly affect the mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. Here, isolated atomic&#8208;scale defects are deliberately introduced into a prototypical anthracene&#8208;ethynylene &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer, and its local density of states is carefully examined on the atomic scale to show how individual defects modify the inherent electronic and magnetic properties of this one&#8208;dimensional systems. Scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy experiments, supplemented with density functional theory calculations, reveal the existence of a sharp electronic resonance at the Fermi energy around certain defects, which is associated with the formation of a local magnetic moment accompanied by substantial mitigation of the mobility of charge carriers. While defects in traditionally synthesized polymers lead to arbitrary conformations, the presented results clearly reflect the preferential formation of low dimensional defects at specific polymer sites, which may introduce the possibility of engineering macroscopic defects in surface&#8208;synthesized conjugated polymers.

Abstract
Tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and a series of related monorhodaporphyrins have been obtained by tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange in a reaction of tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;ditelluraporphyrin with [RhCl(CO)2]2. These organometallic metallaporphyrins contain rhodium(III) centers embedded in rhodacyclopentadiene rings, incorporated within the porphyrin frames. The skeletons of 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and 21&#8208;rhoda&#8208;23&#8208;telluraporphyrin are strongly deformed in&#8208;plane from the rectangular shape typical for porphyrins, due to rhodium(III) coordination preferences, the large size of the two core atoms, and the porphyrin skeleton constrains. These two metallaporphyrins exhibit fluxional behavior, as studied by 1H NMR and DFT, involving the in&#8208;plane motion and the switch of the rhodium center(s) between two nitrogen donors. A side product detected in the reaction mixture, 21&#8208;oxa&#8208;23&#8208;rhodaporphyrin, results from tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen exchange, occurring in parallel to the tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange. The reaction paths and mechanisms have been analyzed. The title 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin contains a bridged bimetallic unit, Rh2Cl2, in the center of the macrocycle, with two rhodium(III) ions lying approximately in the plane of the porphyrinoid skeleton. The geometry of the implanted Rh2Cl2 unit is affected by macrocyclic constrains.

         <title>Achieving Solution&#8208;Processed Non&#8208;Doped Single&#8208;Emitting&#8208;Layer White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Adjusting Pyrene&#8208;Based Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;emitting&#8208;layer white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SEL&#8208;WOLEDs) have developed rapidly in recent years due to the outstanding advantages of high efficiency, simple device structure, low cost, less phase separation, and stable emission color. Nevertheless, the relatively complicated host&#8208;dopant system is usually essential for most previous SEL&#8208;WOLEDs and the development of simple non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs lags behind. Hence the straightforward synthesis of single&#8208;white&#8208;emitting molecules for non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLEDs still remains a great challengeable task. In this article, we designed and synthesized two new pyrene&#8208;based polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and used them as emitting layer materials in the OLED devices. When the molecules change from the mono&#8208;fused one to bis&#8208;fused one, the emitting light changes from greenish to white color. Further study indicated that the bis&#8208;fused molecule PyD with more twisted and extended backbone packed in neat  Cmca  space group in single crystal system compared with  P2  1  /n  for PyS, which may be favorable to form excimers in the solid state and broaden the emission spectrum in the OLEDs. As a result, a solution&#8208;processed non&#8208;doped SEL&#8208;WOLED with high performance (e.g., a high color rendering index of 66) is reported. The findings will be beneficial not only to further development of simple WOLEDs, but also to other related organic optoelectronic technology.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single-emitting-layer white organic light-emitting diodes (SEL-WOLEDs) have developed rapidly in recent years due to the outstanding advantages of high efficiency, simple device structure, low cost, less phase separation, and stable emission color. Nevertheless, the relatively complicated host-dopant system is usually essential for most previous SEL-WOLEDs and the development of simple non-doped SEL-WOLEDs lags behind. Hence the straightforward synthesis of single-white-emitting molecules for non-doped SEL-WOLEDs still remains a great challengeable task. In this article, we designed and synthesized two new pyrene-based polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and used them as emitting layer materials in the OLED devices. When the molecules change from the mono-fused one to bis-fused one, the emitting light changes from greenish to white color. Further study indicated that the bis-fused molecule PyD with more twisted and extended backbone packed in neat  Cmca  space group in single crystal system compared with  P2  1  /n  for PyS, which may be favorable to form excimers in the solid state and broaden the emission spectrum in the OLEDs.

         <title>G&#8208;quadruplex recognition by DARPIns through epitope/paratope analogy</title>

         <title>Universal Trends between Acid Dissociation Constants in Protic and Aprotic Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>pKa values in nonaqueous solvents are of critical importance in many areas of chemistry. Despite their relevance our knowledge is still limited to the most fundamental properties and few pKa values in the most common solvents. Taking advantage of a recently introduced computationally efficient procedure we computed the pKa values of 182 compounds in 21 solvents. This data set is used to establish for the first time universal trends between all solvents. Our computations indicate, that the total charge of the molecule and the charge of the acidic group combined with the Kamlet&#8208;Taft solvatochromic parameters are sufficient to predict pKa values with at least semiquantitative accuracy. We find, that neutral acids such as alcohols are strongly affected by the solvent properties. This is contrasted by cationic acids like ammonium ions whose pKa is often almost completely independent from the choice of solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer Enabled Homolytic N&#8208;S Bond Cleavage in Vinyl Triflimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl triflimides are a new compound class with unknown reactivity. A computational analysis identified triplet&#8211;triplet energy transfer (EnT) induced homolytic cleavage of the N&#8208;Tf bond as a highly interesting reaction type that may be accessible. A combination of experimental and mechanistic work verified this hypothesis and proved the generated radicals amenable for a radical&#8208;radical coupling reaction. Thereby, vinyl triflimides were transformed into a range&#160;of &#945;&#8208;quaternary, &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylated amines in a 1,2&#8208;difunctionali&#173;za&#173;tion reaction with no need for external CF 3 &#8208;reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved reversible zinc storage achieved in a&#160;constitutionally crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are potential for grid&#8208;scale applications owing to their safety, low price, and available sources. The development of ZIBs cathode with high specific capacity, wide operating voltage window and stable cyclability is urgently needed in next&#8208;generation commercial batteries. Herein, we report a structurally crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO  3  )  2  nanobelts cathode for ZIBs prepared  via  a facile hydrothermal method. The as&#8208;synthesized Mn(VO  3  )  2  exhibited high specific capacity of 350 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 A g  &#8208;1  , and maintained a capacity retention of 92% after 10,000 cycles at 2 A g  &#8208;1  . It also showed good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 600 cycles at 0.2 A g  &#8208;1  under &#8208;20 &#9702;C. The electrochemical tests suggest that Mn(VO  3  )  2  nanobelts impart fast Zn  2+  ions migration, and the introduction of manganese atoms help make the structures more indestructible, leading to a good rate performance and prolonged cycle lifespan.</dc:description>

         <title>New Opportunities for Utilization of the Sulfoximine Group in Medicinal Chemistry from the Drug Designer&#8217;s Perspective</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extension of the medicinal chemistry toolbox is in the vital interest of drug designers. However, the diffusion of an innovation can be a lengthy process. Along these lines, it took almost 70 years before the use of the sulfoximine group reached a critical mass in medicinal chemistry. Even though interest in this versatile functional group has increased exponentially in recent years, there is ample room for further innovative applications. This minireview highlights emerging trends and opportunities for drug designers for the utilization of the sulfoximine group in medicinal chemistry, such as in the construction of complex molecules, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) and novel warheads for covalent inhibition.</dc:description>

         <title>Prussian Blue&#8208;Type Cocatalysts for Enhancing Photocatalytic Water Oxidation Performance of BiVO4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficiency of photocatalytic overall water splitting reaction is usually limited by the high energy barrier and complex multiple electron transfer processes of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Although bismuth vanadate (BiVO  4  ) as the photocatalyst has been developed for enhancing the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction, it still suffers from challenges of fast recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs and poor photocatalytic activity. Herein, six M  II  &#8208;Co  III  Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) cocatalysts are synthesized and deposited on the surface of BiVO  4  for boosting the surface catalytic efficiency and enhancing photogenerated carries separation efficiency of BiVO  4  . Six M  II  &#8208;Co  III  PBAs@BiVO  4  photocatalysts all demonstrate increased photocatalytic water oxidation performance compared to that of BiVO  4  alone. Among them, the Co&#8208;Co PBA@BiVO  4  photocatalyst is employed as a representative research object and is thoroughly characterized by electrochemistry, electronic microscope as well as multiple spectroscopic analyses. Notably, BiVO  4  coupling with Co&#8208;Co PBA cocatalyst could capture more photons than that of pure BiVO  4  , facilitating the transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between BiVO  4  and Co&#8208;Co PBA as well as surface catalytic efficiency of BiVO  4  . Overall, this work would promote the synthesis strategy development for exploring new types of composite photocatalysts for water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Controlled Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Bulky Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fine&#8208;tuning of metal&#8208;phosphine catalyzed reactions relies largely on accessing ever more precisely tuned phosphine ligands via  de novo  synthesis. Late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H functionalization and diversification of commercial phosphines offers rapid access to entire libraries of derivatives based on privileged scaffolds. But existing routes, relying on phosphorous&#8208;directed transformations, only yield functionalization of C  sp  2&#8211;H bonds in a specific position relative to phosphorous. In contrast to phosphorous&#8208;directed strategies, herein we disclose an orthogonal functionalization strategy capable of introducing a range of substituents into previously inaccessible positions on arylphosphines. The strongly coordinating phosphine group acts solely as a bystander in the sterically controlled borylation of bulky phosphines, and the resulting borylated phosphines serve as the supporting ligand for palladium during diversification via phosphine self&#8208;assisted Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrahalidometallate(II) ionic liquids with more than one metal: the effect of bromide vs. chloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fifteen  N  &#8208;butylpyridinium salts, including five monometallic [C  4  Py]  2  [MBr  4  ] and ten bimetallic [C  4  Py]  2  [M  0.5  a  M  0.5  b  Br  4  ] (M = Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn), were synthesized. Their structure and their thermal and electrochemical properties were studied. All compounds are ionic liquids (ILs) with melting points between 64 and 101&#176;C. Powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that all ILs are isostructural. The electrochemical stability windows of the ILs are between 2 and 3 V. The conductivities at room temperature are between 10  &#8208;4  and 10  &#8208;8  S cm  &#8208;1  . At elevated temperatures, the conductivities reach up to 10  &#8208;2  S cm  &#8208;1  at 70&#176;C. The article also compares the structures and properties of the current bromide&#8208;based ILs with previous examples using chloride ligands and illustrates differences and similarities between the two groups of ILs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling Enzymatic Features in a Supramolecular Iridium Catalyst by Computational Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;biological catalysts following the governing principles of enzymes are attractive systems to disclose unprecedented reactivities. Most of those existing catalysts feature an adaptable molecular recognition site for substrate binding that are prone to undergo conformational selection pathways. Herein, we present a non&#8208;biological catalyst able to bind substrates via the induced fit model according to in&#8208;depth computational calculations. The system, which is constituted by an inflexible substrate&#8208;recognition site derived from a zinc&#8208;porphyrin in the second coordination sphere, features destabilization of ground states as well as stabilization of transition states for the relevant iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond borylation of pyridine. In addition, this catalyst appears to be most suited to tightly bind the transition state rather than the substrate. Besides these features, which are reminiscent from the action mode of enzymes, new elementary catalytic steps have been disclosed owing to the unique distortions encountered in the different intermediates and transition states.</dc:description>

         <title>Ferroelasticity&#160;in Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular ferroelastics have received particular attention for potential applications in mechanical switches, shape memory, energy conversion, information processing, and solar cells, by taking advantages of their low&#8208;cost, light&#8208;weight, easy preparation, and mechanical flexibility. The unique structures of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have been considered to be a design platform for symmetry breaking&#8208;associated order&#8208;disorder in lattice, thereby possessing great potential for ferroelastic phase transition. Herein, we review the research progress of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelastics in recent years, focusing on the crystal structures, dimensions, phase transitions and ferroelastic properties. In view of the few reports on molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastics, we look forward to the structural design strategies of molecular ferroelastic materials, as well as the opportunities and challenges faced by molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastic materials in the future. This review will have positive guiding significance for the synthesis and future exploration of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid molecular ferroelastics.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemistry of pentafluorosulfanyl derivatives and related analogs: from synthesis to applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pentafluorosulfanyl (SF  5  )&#8208;containing compounds and corresponding analogs are a highly valuable class of fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks owing to their unique properties. The reason for that is the set of peculiar and tremendously beneficial characteristics they can impart on molecules once introduced onto them. Despite this, their application in distinct scientific fields remains modest, given the extremely harsh reaction conditions needed to access such compounds. The recent synthetic approaches via S&#8211;F, and C&#8211;SF  5  bond formation as well as the use of SF  5  &#8208;containing building blocks embody a &#8220;stairway&#8208;to&#8208;heaven&#8221; loophole in the synthesis of otherwise&#8208;inaccessible chemical scaffolds only a few years ago. Herein, we report and evaluate the properties of the SF  5  group and analogs, by summarizing synthetic methodologies available to access them as well as following applications in material science and medicinal chemistry since 2015.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Antiferromagnets Possessing Extended&#160;0&#8208;, 1&#8208;, 2&#8208;, and 3&#8208;Dimensional Structures</title>

         <dc:description>Layered (2&#8208;D) artificial (or synthetic) antiferromagnets are fabricated via atom deposition techniques and possess very thin, nanometer scale, magnetically ordered layers separated via a very thin nonmagnetic layer that antiferromagnetically couples the magnetic layers. Artificial antiferromagnets were crucial in the discovery of the giant magnetic effect (GMR), which had an incredible impact on the evolution of computer memory and their applications and nucleated the dawn of spintronics (magnetoelectrics). The fundamental structural motif has been more recently achieved using synthetic chemical methods that led to insulating artificial antiferromagnets. Examples of magnetically ordered layers that are antiferromagnetic coupled to form artificial antiferromagnets have been extended to isolated ions (0&#8208;D) as well as extended chain (1&#8208;D) and 3&#8208;D extended network structures, and new phenomena and applications are anticipated as insulating antiferromagnets are more effective at propagating spin currents with respect to dielectric materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Access to diverse polycyclic scaffolds via an efficient calcium catalyzed dehydration&#8208;cyclization strategy is described. This approach provides a range of small molecule fragments bearing a range of medicinally relevant functional groups. Both Lewis and Bronsted acid pathways are in use, with the ability to fine tune the reactivity depending on the choice of solvent.







Abstract
A range of highly functionalized polycyclic fragments have been synthesized, employing a catalytic dehydrative cyclization. A range of nucleophiles are shown to be successful, with the reaction producing numerous high value motifs.

         <title>Synergistic Strategies in Aminocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Come together: Asymmetric aminocatalysis plays a pivotal role on the development in stereoselective transformations, synergistically combined with organo&#8208;, metal, photoredox and electrocatalysis. In this scenario, the HOMO&#8208;raising and LUMO&#8208;lowering activation of carbonyl compounds open new gateways to complex architectures and new sustainable reactivities. Last but not least, this research area will keep driving the development of the whole organocatalysis, toward its synergistic combination with other activation strategies.







Abstract
Synergistic catalysis offers the unique possibility of simultaneous activation of both the nucleophile and the electrophile in a reaction. A requirement for this strategy is the stability of the active species towards the reaction conditions and the two concerted catalytic cycles. Since the beginning of the century, aminocatalysis has been established as a platform for the stereoselective activation of carbonyl compounds through HOMO&#8208;raising or LUMO&#8208;lowering. The burgeoning era of aminocatalysis has been driven by a deep understanding of these activation and stereoinduction modes, thanks to the introduction of versatile and privileged chiral amines. The aim of this review is to cover recent developments in synergistic strategies involving aminocatalysis in combination with organo&#8208;, metal&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electro&#8208;catalysis, focusing on the evolution of privileged aminocatalysts architectures.

         <dc:description>
An entirely new displacement system based on anomeric DNA without toehold was designed and its applicability was demonstrated. Homochiral DNA in &#946;&#8208;D configuration was transformed to heterochiral DNA in &#945;&#8208;D/&#946;&#8208;D configuration and further to homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;D configuration. During displacement strand orientation changed from antiparallel in &#946;&#8208;D DNA to parallel in &#945;/&#946;&#8208;D DNA and back to antiparallel in &#945;/&#945;&#8208;D DNA. Reaction progress was visualized by fluorescence change using the intercalator ethidium bromide as sensor.







Abstract
DNA strand displacement is a technique to exchange one strand of a double stranded DNA by another strand (invader). It is an isothermal, enzyme free method driven by single stranded overhangs (toeholds) and is employed in DNA amplification, mismatch detection and nanotechnology. We discovered that anomeric (&#945;/&#946;) DNA can be used for heterochiral strand displacement. Homochiral DNA in &#946;&#8208;D configuration was transformed to heterochiral DNA in &#945;&#8208;D/&#946;&#8208;D configuration and further to homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;D configuration. Single stranded &#945;&#8208;D DNA acts as invader. Herein, new anomeric displacement systems with and without toeholds were designed. Due to their resistance against enzymatic degradation, the systems are applicable to living cells. The light&#8208;up intercalator ethidium bromide is used as fluorescence sensor to follow the progress of displacement. Anomeric DNA displacement shows benefits over canonical DNA in view of toehold free displacement and simple detection by ethidium bromide.

         <title>Progress in Convergent Paired Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress on convergent paired electrolysis has been summarized in this concept article. Four strategies based upon metal catalysis, persistent radical effects, microfluidic chemistry, and alternating current electrolysis are discussed in relation to their underlying mechanisms.







Abstract
Convergent paired electrolysis combines both anodic and cathodic reactions simultaneously in an electrochemical transformation. It provides a highly energy&#8208;efficient and divergent approach to conventionally challenging and useful structures. However, the physical separation of the two half&#8208;electrode reactions makes it extremely difficult to couple the intermediates arising from the two electrodes. In this concept article, four strategies used in convergent paired electrolysis will be discussed from the perspective of the reaction mechanism: a) metal&#8208;catalyzed convergent paired electrolysis, b) convergent paired electrolysis enabled by persistent radical effects, c) microfluidic chemistry applied to convergent paired electrolysis, and d) alternating current electrolysis.

         <title>Autotuning of Vibrational Strong Coupling for Site&#8208;Selective Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actuatable Fabry&#8211;Perot (FP) cavities allow site&#8208;selective organic reaction under vibrational strong coupling. The piezoelectric actuators with a computer&#8208;controlled feedback loop are installed in the FP cavity, which enables accurate retuning of the cavity mode in response to refractive index changes within the cavity. Thanks to the autotuning of cavity mode, the site&#8208;selective reaction of the aldehyde over the ketone in 4&#8208;acetylbenzaldehyde is achieved, despite the respective reactive carbonyl stretches being energetically close.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective chemistry opens new paths for the synthesis of technologically important molecules. When a reactant is placed inside a Fabry&#8211;Perot (FP) cavity, energy exchange between molecular vibrations and resonant cavity photons results in vibrational strong coupling (VSC). VSC has recently been implicated in modified chemical reactivity at specific reactive sites. However, as a reaction proceeds inside an FP cavity, the refractive index of the reaction solution changes, detuning the cavity mode away from the vibrational mode and weakening the VSC effect. Here we overcome this issue, developing actuatable FP cavities to allow automated tuning of cavity mode energy to maintain maximized VSC during a reaction. As an example, the site&#8208;selective reaction of the aldehyde over the ketone in 4&#8208;acetylbenzaldehyde is achieved by automated cavity tuning to maintain optimal VSC of the ketone carbonyl stretch during the reaction. A nearly 50&#8201;% improvement in site&#8208;selective reactivity is observed compared to an FP cavity with static mirrors, demonstrating the utility of actuatable FP cavities as microreactors for organic chemistry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site-selective chemistry opens new paths for the synthesis of technologically important molecules. When a reactant is placed inside a Fabry&#8211;Perot (FP) cavity, energy exchange between molecular vibrations and resonant cavity photons results in vibrational strong coupling (VSC). VSC has recently been implicated in modified chemical reactivity at specific reactive sites. However, as a reaction proceeds inside an FP cavity, the refractive index of the reaction solution changes, detuning the cavity mode away from the vibrational mode and weakening the VSC effect. Here we overcome this issue, developing actuatable FP cavities to allow automated tuning of cavity mode energy to maintain maximized VSC during a reaction. As an example, the site-selective reaction of the aldehyde over the ketone in 4-acetylbenzaldehyde is achieved by automated cavity tuning to maintain optimal VSC of the ketone carbonyl stretch during the reaction. A nearly 50&#8201;% improvement in site-selective reactivity is observed compared to an FP cavity with static mirrors, demonstrating the utility of actuatable FP cavities as microreactors for organic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemically Laminated 2D Bis(terpyridine)metal Polymer Films: Formation Mechanism at the Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface and Redox Rectification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox rectifiers: Heterolaminated 2D coordination polymer films were synthesized at a liquid&#8208;liquid interface, and the mechanism of film growth was revealed. The bilayer films show unique redox behavior based on the electron transfer mediation in an electrolyte solution and stable rectification characteristics when the film is sandwiched by electrodes in a dry state.







Abstract
Recent studies on molecular 2D materials with high tunability of structure and function have focused mostly on the discovery of new precursors. Here, we demonstrate a facile one&#8208;pot synthesis of laminated 2D coordination polymer films comprising bis(terpyridine)iron and cobalt at a water/dichloromethane interface. Cross&#8208;sectional elemental mapping unveiled the stratum&#8208;like structure of the film and revealed that the second layer grows to the dichloromethane side below the first layer. Cyclic voltammetry clarified that the bottom layer mediates charge transfer between the top layer and the substrate in a narrow potential region of mixed&#8208;valence states. Furthermore, the bilayer film sandwiched by electrodes in a dry condition shows stable rectification character, and the barrier voltage corresponds to the redox potential difference between the two layers. This study introduces a new strategy for polymer design to explore the materials science of molecular 2D materials.

         <title>Recyclable Mn(I) Catalysts for Base&#8208;Free Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Mechanistic, DFT and Catalytic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanistic and DFT studies on a series of recyclable Mn(I) complexes disclosed six vital factors determining their activities along with the existence of different mechanisms for asymmetric direct and transfer hydrogenations. Moreover, Mn(I) complex 2&#8201;b (cat. loading: 0.4&#8208;1&#8197;mol%) performs base&#8208;free transfer hydrogenation of alkyl ketones ketones with enantioselectivity up to 98&#8201;%. More significantly, a novel and simple single&#8208;step process has been discovered for recycling the resting species from the catalytic leftover.







Abstract
We report here a mechanistic, DFT and catalytic study on a series of Mn(I) complexes 1, 2(a&#8211;d), 3, 4. The studies apprehended the requirements for Mn(I) complexes to be active in both asymmetric direct (AH) and transfer hydrogenations (ATH). The investigations disclosed 6 vital factors accelerating the formation of a resting species, which plays a significant role in lowering the activities of the Mn(I) complex 1 in ATH and AH, respectively. In addition, we also report here a base free Mn(I) catalyzed ATH of aryl alkyl ketones with high enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;%&#8197;ee) and improved activity. More significantly, a novel and simple single&#8208;step process for recycling the resting species from the catalytic leftover has been discovered. Notably, the studies provide evidence for the existence of two different temperature dependent mechanisms for AH and ATH, in contrast to previous studies on related systems.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich EDOT Linkers in Tetracationic bis&#8208;Triarylborane Chromophores: Influence on Water Stability, Biomacromolecule Sensing, and Photoinduced Cytotoxicity</title>

         <dc:description>
Tetracationic bis&#8208;triarylboranes with EDOT linkers, show red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission compared to their thiophene&#8208;linked analogues, with one derivative emitting in the NIR. A water&#8208;stable EDOT&#8208;linked tetracation and its bis&#8208;thiophene analogue efficiently photo&#8208;induce 1O2 production. Both bind to ds&#8208;DNA and BSA, enter living human cells, accumulate in several different cytoplasmic organelles with no toxic effect but, under visible light irradiation, exhibit rapid, strong cytotoxic effects.







Abstract
Three novel tetracationic bis&#8208;triarylboranes with 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) linkers, and their neutral precursors, showed significant red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission compared to their thiophene&#8208;containing analogues, with one of the EDOT&#8208;derivatives emitting in the NIR region. Only the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation was stable in aqueous solution, indicating that direct attachment of a thiophene or even 3&#8208;methylthiophene to the boron atom is insufficient to provide hydrolytic stability in aqueous solution. Further comparative analysis of the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation and its bis&#8208;thiophene analogue revealed efficient photo&#8208;induced singlet oxygen production, with the consequent biological implications. Thus, both analogues bind strongly to ds&#8208;DNA and BSA, very efficiently enter living human cells, accumulate in several different cytoplasmic organelles with no toxic effect but, under intense visible light irradiation, they exhibit almost instantaneous and very strong cytotoxic effects, presumably attributed to singlet oxygen production. Thus, both compounds are intriguing theranostic agents, whose intracellular and probably intra&#8208;tissue location can be monitored by strong fluorescence, allowing switching on of the strong bioactivity by well&#8208;focused visible light.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Proteins via a Bio&#8208;Inspired Copper(II)&#8208;Mediated Aldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Pydinecarboxaldehyde derivatives undergoes unique aldol reaction at the N&#8208;terminus of peptides and proteins in the presence of a copper(II) salt under mild conditions. Peptides and proteins are readily modified with useful functional groups or reactive handles in a single step.







Abstract
The chemical modification of proteins is an effective technique for manipulating the properties and functions of proteins, and for creating protein&#8208;based materials. The N&#8208;terminus is a promising target for single&#8208;site modification that provides modified proteins with uniform structures and properties. In this paper, a copper(II)&#8208;mediated aldol reaction with 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2&#8208;PC) derivatives is proposed as an operationally simple method to selectively modify the N&#8208;terminus of peptides and proteins at room temperature and physiological pH. The copper(II) ion activates the N&#8208;terminal amino acids by complexation with an imine of the N&#8208;terminal amino acid and 2&#8208;PCs, realizing the selective formation of the nucleophilic intermediate at the N&#8208;terminus. This results in a stable carbon&#8208;carbon bond between the 2&#8208;PCs and the &#945;&#8208;carbon of various N&#8208;terminal amino acids. The reaction is applied to four different proteins, including biopharmaceuticals such as filgrastim and trastuzumab. The modified trastuzumab retains the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 recognition activity.

         <title>A Route to Lipid ALC&#8208;0315: a Key Component of a COVID&#8208;19 mRNA Vaccine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ALC&#8208;0315 is a key component of the Pfizer&#8208;BioNTech COVID&#8208;19 vaccine and a highly sought&#8208;after lipid for nucleic acid therapeutics research. This paper, a study in reductive amination, describes a synthetic route that more than doubles the overall yield relative to the published one. Key aspects of the work include the use of (i) a protected form of a poorly organic&#8208;soluble aminoalcohol, (ii) a TEMPO/bleach oxidation to produce crucial aldehydes, and (iii) a more organic&#8208;soluble triacyloxyborohydride reagent.







Abstract
This paper describes a synthesis of ALC&#8208;0315 by a sequence that more than doubles the overall yield relative to the published one, and that employs much cleaner reactions, thereby facilitating purifications to a considerable extent

         <title>The Importance of Mg2+&#8208;free State in Nucleotide Exchange of Oncogenic K&#8208;Ras Mutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For efficient targeting of oncogenic K&#8208;Ras interaction sites, a mechanistic picture of the Ras&#8208;cycle is necessary. Herein, we used NMR relaxation techniques and molecular dynamics simulations to decipher the role of slow dynamics in wild&#8208;type and three oncogenic P&#8208;loop mutants of K&#8208;Ras. Our measurements reveal a dominant two&#8208;state conformational exchange on the ms timescale in both GDP&#8208; and GTP&#8208;bound K&#8208;Ras. The identified low&#8208;populated higher energy state in GDP&#8208;loaded K&#8208;Ras has a conformation reminiscent of a nucleotide&#8208;bound/Mg  2+  &#8208;free state characterized by shortened &#946;2/&#946;3&#8208;strands and a partially released switch&#8208;I region preparing K&#8208;Ras for the interaction with the incoming nucleotide exchange factor and subsequent reactivation. By providing insight into mutation&#8208;specific differences in K&#8208;Ras structural dynamics, our systematic analysis improves our understanding of prolonged K&#8208;Ras signaling and may aid the development of allosteric inhibitors targeting nucleotide exchange in K&#8208;Ras.</dc:description>

         <title>Barbier Hyperbranching Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission from an AB&#8208;Type Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent polymers are generally molecularly designed by polymerization of luminescent moieties, in which the polymerization method exbibits limited effect on luminescent properties. In addition, the synthesis of hyperbranched polymers from AB&#8208;type monomer is still challenging. Here, a &#8220;bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional group&#8221; strategy is demonstrated for the molecular design of hyperbranched polymers from AB&#8208;type monomer via Barbier polymerization, resulting in a series of nonconjugated luminescent polymers through polymerization&#8208;induced emission.







Abstract
Luminescent polymer materials have gained considerable research efforts in the past decades and are generally molecular designed by extending the &#960; system of the polymer main chain or by incorporating chromophores into the polymer chain, which suffer from poor solubility, difficult synthesis, or multi&#8208;step procedures. Meanwhile, according to the step&#8208;growth polymerization theory, synthesis of hyperbranched polymers from an AB&#8208;type monomer is still challenging. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of nonconjugated luminescent hyperbranched polymer material via Barbier hyperbranching polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) from an AB&#8208;type monomer. The key step in the realization of the hyperbranched polymer is bi&#8208;functionalization of a mono&#8208;functional group. Through a Barbier reaction between an organohalide and an ester group in one pot, bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional ester is realized through two&#8208;step nucleophilic additions, resulting in hyperbranched polytriphenylmethanols (HPTPM). Attributed to through&#8208;space conjugation and inter&#8208; and intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer effects induced by polymer chain, nonconjugated HPTPMs are PIEgens, which are tunable by monomer structure and polymerization time. When all phenyl groups are rotatable, HPTPM is aggregation&#8208;induced emission type PIEgen. Whereas, it is aggregation&#8208;caused quenching type PIEgen if some phenyl groups are rotation forbidden. Further potential applications of PIEgen are in the fields of explosive detection and artificial light harvesting systems. This work, therefore, expands the monomer library and molecular design library of hyperbranched polymers through &#8220;bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional group&#8221; strategy, which eventually expands the preparation library of nonconjugated luminescent polymer materials through one&#8208;pot PIE from nonemissive monomer.

         <title>Radical Complexes of Nickel(II)/Copper(II) and Redox Non&#8208;innocent MB&#8208;DIPY Ligands: Unusual Stability and Strong Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption at &#955;max &#8764;1300&#8197;nm</title>

         <dc:description>
The preparation of radicals with intense and redox&#8208;switchable absorption beyond 1000&#8197;nm is a long&#8208;standing challenge in the chemistry of functional dyes. We now report a series of unprecedented stable neutral nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes of &#8220;Manitoba&#8208;dipyrromethenes&#8221; (MB&#8208;DIPYs) in which the organic chromophore is present in the anion&#8211;radical state. The new stable radicals have an intense absorption at &#955;max&#8764;1300&#8197;nm and can be either oxidized to a regular [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]+ (M = Cu or Ni) or reduced to [MII(MB&#8208;DIPY)]&#8722; compounds. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Thomas, J. van&#8197;Lierop, V.&#8197;N. Nemykin, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201181).

         <title>A Formylglycine&#8208;Peptide for the Site&#8208;Directed Identification of Phosphotyrosine&#8208;Mimetic Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovery of protein&#8208;binding fragments for precisely defined binding sites is an unmet challenge so far. Here, we investigate formylglycine as a molecular probe for the sensitive detection of fragments binding to a spatially defined protein site. Formylglycine peptide&#160;  3&#160;  was derived from a phosphotyrosine&#8208;containing peptide substrate of protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B by replacing the phosphorylated amino acid with the reactive electrophile. Fragment ligation with formylglycine occurred in&#8208;situ in aqueous physiological buffer. Structures and kinetics were validated by NMR spectroscopy. Screening and hit validation revealed fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated hit fragments being able to replace the native phosphotyrosine residue. The formylglycine probe identified low&#8208;affinity fragments with high spatial resolution as substantiated by molecular modelling. The best fragment hit, 4&#8208;amino&#8208;phenyl&#8208;acetic acid, was converted into a cellularly active, nanomolar inhibitor of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2.</dc:description>

         <title>Intense Molar Circular Dichroism in Fully Conjugated All&#8208;Carbon Macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;Butadiyne Linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]Paracyclophanes</title>

         <dc:description>The synthetic access to macrocyclic molecular topologies with interesting photophysical properties has greatly improved thanks to the successful implementation of organic and inorganic corner units. Based on recent reports, we realized pseudo&#8208;  meta  [2.2]para&#173;cyclo&#173;phanes (PCPs) might serve as optimal corner units for constructing 3D functional materials, owing to their efficient electronic communication, angled substituents and planar chirality. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and optical properties of four novel all&#8208;carbon enantiopure macrocycles bearing three to six pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCPs linked by 1,3&#8208;butadiyne units. The macrocycles were obtained by a single step from enantiopure literature known dialkyne pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCP and were unambiguously identified and characterized by state of the art spectroscopic methods and in part even by x&#8208;ray crystallography. By comparing the optical properties to relevant reference compounds, we show that the pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCP subunit effectively elongates the conjugated system throughout the macrocyclic backbone, such that already the smallest macrocycle consisting of only three subunits reaches an astounding polymer&#8208;like conjugation length. Additionally, we show that the chiral pseudo&#8208;  meta  PCPs induce remarkable chiroptical response in the respective macrocycles, reaching unprecedented high molar dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles of up to 1307 L mol  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>[Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase, the third type of natural hydrogenase, is capable to heterolytically activate hydrogen molecule and transfer the resulting hydride to an unsaturated substrate, making it a promising hydrogenation catalyst. Over the last three decades, fruitful results on this enzyme have been achieved. In this review, we summarized the major progresses about this enzyme including its structural characterisation, catalytic mechanism, cofactor biosynthesis, mimetic model development as well as artificial enzyme construction.

         <title>Reverse Replacement in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 with 1,4&#8208;Dicarboxybenzene for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by the ligands and metal clusters, have been considered as a promising material for photocatalytic water splitting. In this work, a solvent&#8208;assisted ligand exchange (SALE) method has been applied through partial reverse substitution of the ligand in NH  2  &#8208;MIL&#8208;125 (Ti) by 1,4&#8208;dicarboxybenzene (BDC). This modification strategy can optimize the charge transfer dynamics together with the preserved light absorption, resulting in a 3.3 times enhancement of the hydrogen production rate than the pristine material under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This work broadens the pathway of the ligand modifications of MOFs to boost the photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissecting non&#8208;covalent interactions in carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquids exhibiting double and single hydrogens bonds between ions of like charge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show that the carboxyl&#8208;functionalized ionic liquid 1&#8722;(carboxymethyl)pyridinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [HOOC&#8722;CH  2  &#8722;py][NTf  2  ] exhibits three types of hydrogen bonding: The expected single hydrogen bonds between cation and anion, and surprisingly single and double hydrogen bonds between the cations, despite the repulsive Coulomb forces between the ions of like charge. Combining X&#8208;ray crystallography, differential scanning calorimetry, IR spectroscopy, thermodynamic methods and DFT calculations allows analyzing and characterizing all types of hydrogen bonding present in the solid, liquid and gaseous states of the ionic liquid. We find doubly hydrogen bonded cationic dimers (c  +  =c  +  ) in the crystalline phase. With increasing temperature, this binding motif opens in the liquid and is replaced by (c  +  &#8722;c  +  &#8722;a  &#8722;  ) species, with a remaining single cationic hydrogen bond and an additional hydrogen bond between cation and anion. We provide clear evidence that the IL evaporates as hydrogen bonded ion pairs (c  +  &#8722;a  &#8722;  ) into the gas phase. The measured transition enthalpies allow to dissect the non&#8208;covalent interactions and to determine the hydrogen bond strength between ions of like charge.</dc:description>

         <title>Biohybrid Organic Heterostructure Based on Chlorophyll&#8208;Bacteriochlorophyll Aggregates for Ecofriendly Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the fact that hydrogen energy is an abundant, clean, sustainable and environmentally friendly renewable energy source. Therefore, the production of hydrogen by photocatalytically splitting water on semiconductors has been considered in recent years as a promising and sustainable strategy for converting solar energy into chemical energy to replace conventional energy sources and to solve the growing problem of environmental pollution and the global energy crisis. However, highly efficient solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production remains a huge challenge due to the poor visible light response of available photocatalytic materials and the low efficiency of separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. In the present work, organic heterojunction structures based on bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) and chlorophyll (Chl) molecules were introduced and used for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen production from water under visible light. Also, noble metal&#8208;free photocatalyst was successfully constructed on Ti3C2Tx  nanosheets by simple successive deposition of Chl and BChl, which was used for the photocatalytic splitting water to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results show that the optimal BChl@Chl@Ti3C2Tx  composite has a high HER performance with 114 &#956;mol/h/gcat  , which is much higher than the BChl@Ti3C2Tx  and Chl@Ti3C2Tx  composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthesis Conversion of an Unstable Imine Cage to a Stable Cage with Amide Moieties towards Selective Receptor for Fluoride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of robust covalent macrocycles/cages via multiple amide&#8208;bond forming reaction is highly challenging and generally it needs multistep reactions. One&#8208;pot reaction of appropriate di&#8208;/tri&#8208;acyl chloride with a diamine generally results polymers or oligomers instead of discrete architectures. To overcome this limitation, a strategy is reported here using dynamic imine chemistry for facile construction of imine&#8208;based macrocycle and cage upon treatment of a diamine with di&#8208; and tri&#8208;aldehydes respectively, followed by post&#8208;synthesis one&#8208;step conversion of imine bonds to amides to form the desired robust macrocycle and cage containing multiple amide bonds. While the macrocycle was found to form aggregates in DMSO, the cage was intact without any aggregation. Six amide groups in the confined pocket of the cage made it an ideal receptor for selective binding of fluoride with very high selectivity (~3 103 fold) over chloride, and it was silent towards other halides, phosphate, and other oxyanions.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavy Alkali Metal Manganate Complexes: Synthesis, Structures and Solvent&#8208;Induced Dissociation Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rare examples of heavier alkali metal manganates [{(AM)Mn(CH  2  SiMe  3  )(N  `Ar  )  2  }  &#8734;  ] (AM = K, Rb, or Cs) [N  `Ar  = N(SiMe  3  )(Dipp)] have been synthesised with the Rb and Cs examples crystallographically characterised. These heaviest manganates crystallise as polymeric zig&#8208;zag chains propagated by AM&#8943;&#960;&#8208;arene interactions. Key to their preparation is to avoid Lewis base donor solvents. In contrast, using multidentate nitrogen donors encourages ligand scrambling leading to redistribution of these bimetallic manganate compounds into their corresponding homometallic species as witnessed for the complete Li &#8211; Cs series. Adding to the few known crystallographically characterised unsolvated and solvated rubidium and caesium s&#8208;block metal amides, six new derivatives ([{AM(N  `Ar  )}  &#8734;  ], [{AM(N  `Ar  )&#183;TMEDA}  &#8734;  ], and [{AM(N  `Ar  )&#183;PMDETA}  &#8734;  ] where AM = Rb or Cs) have been structurally authenticated. Utilising monodentate diethyl ether as a donor, it was also possible to isolate and crystallographically characterise sodium manganate [(Et  2  O)  2  Na(  n  Bu)Mn[(N  `Ar  )  2  ], a monomeric, dinuclear structure prevented from aggregating by two blocking ether ligands bound to sodium.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Photoinduced Conversion of Unprecedented Norbornadiene&#8208;Based Photoswitches with Redox&#8208;Active Naphthalene Diimide Functionalities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented compound class of functional organic hybrids consisting of a photoswitchable norbornadiene building block and a redoxactive chromophore, namely naphthalene diimide, were designed and synthesized. Within these structures the capability of rylene chromophores to function as a redox active catalyst upon their photoexcitation was utilized to initiate the oxidative back&#8208;conversion of the  in&#8208;situ  formed quadricyclane unit to its norbornadiene analogue. In this way successive photoexcitation at two differenr wavelengths enabled a controlled photoswitching between the two isomerical states of the hybrids.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented compound class of functional organic hybrids consisting of a photoswitchable norbornadiene building block and a redoxactive chromophore, namely naphthalene diimide, were designed and synthesized. Within these structures the capability of rylene chromophores to function as a redox active catalyst upon their photoexcitation was utilized to initiate the oxidative back-conversion of the  in-situ  formed quadricyclane unit to its norbornadiene analogue. In this way successive photoexcitation at two differenr wavelengths enabled a controlled photoswitching between the two isomerical states of the hybrids. Beyond this prove of concept, the dependency of the reaction rate to the intramolecular distance of the two functional molecular building blocks as well as the concentration of the photoexcited sample was monitored.

         <title>Development of Allenyne&#8211;Alkyne [4 + 2] Cycloaddition and Its Application to Total Synthesis of Selaginpulvilin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new [4 + 2] cycloaddition of allenyne&#8211;alkyne is developed. The reaction is believed to proceed with forming an &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene intermediate. This species behaves as a &#963;&#960;&#8208;diradical to react with a hydrogen atom donor, whereas it displays a zwitterionic reactivity toward weak nucleophiles. The efficiency of trapping &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene depends not only on its substituents but also the trapping agents. Notable features of the reaction are the activating role of the extra alkyne of the 1,3&#8208;diyne that reacts with the allenyne moiety and the opposite mode of trapping with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles. Oxygen nucleophiles result in the oxygen&#8208;end incorporation at the benzylic position of the &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene, whereas with amine nucleophiles the nitrogen&#8208;end is incorporated into the aromatic core. Relying on the allenyne&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition as an enabling strategy, a concise total synthesis of phosphodiesterase&#8208;4 inhibitory selaginpulvilin A is realized.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Modulation of Antibiotic Resistance by Photoswitchable Cystobactamids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rise of antibiotic resistance causes a serious health care problem, and its counterfeit demands novel, innovative concepts. The combination of photopharmacology, enabling a light&#8208;controlled reversible modulation of drug activity, with antibiotic drug design has led to first photoswitchable antibiotic compounds derived from established scaffolds. In this study, we converted cystobactamids, gyrase&#8208;inhibiting natural products with an oligoaryl scaffold and highly potent antibacterial activities, into photoswitchable agents by inserting azobenzene in the  N  &#8208;terminal part and/or an acylhydrazone moiety near the  C&#8208;  terminus, yielding twenty analogs that contain mono&#8208; as well as double&#8208;switches. Antibiotic and gyrase inhibition properties could be modulated 3.4&#8208;fold and 5&#8208;fold by light, respectively. Notably, the sensitivity of photoswitchable cystobactamids towards two known resistance factors, the peptidase AlbD and the scavenger protein AlbA, was light&#8208;dependent. While irradiation of an analog with an  N  &#8208;terminal azobenzene with 365 nm light led to less degradation by AlbD, the AlbA&#8208;mediated inactivation was induced. This provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle that resistance towards photoswitchable antibiotics can be optically controlled.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Water&#8208;Soluble Esterase&#8208;Activated CO&#8208;Releasing Molecules Targeting Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the beneficial effects of carbon monoxide (CO) as a cell&#8208;protective and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent, CO&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) offer promising potential applications in medicine. We synthesized a set of acyloxy&#8208;cyclohexadiene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 complexes, all displaying a N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pyridinium triflate moiety in the ester side chain, as mitochondria&#8208;targeting esterase&#8208;triggered CORM prodrugs. While the compounds in which the acyloxy substituent is attached to the 2&#8208;position of the diene&#8208;Fe(CO)3 unit (A series) spontaneously release CO upon dissolution in phosphate buffer,&#160;which is partly suppressed in the presence of porcine liver esterase (PLE), the 1&#8208;substituted isomers (B series) show the expected PLE&#8208;induced release of CO (up to 3 equiv.). The biological activity of  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2  /  3&#8208;B  and their isophorone&#8208;derived analogs  2/3&#8208;A&#8217;  &#160;was assessed using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). While  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;B  were not cytotoxic up to 500 &#181;M (MTT assay),  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;A&#8217;  caused significant toxicity at concentrations above 50 &#181;M. The anti&#8208;inflammatory potential of both Mito&#8208;CORM variants was demonstrated by concentration&#8208;dependent down&#8208;regulation of the pro&#8208;inflammatory markers&#160;as well as induction of HO&#8208;1 in TNF&#945; stimulated HUVEC. Energy phenotyping by Seahorse Real&#8208;Time Cell Metabolic Analysis, revealed opposing shifts&#160;of metabolic potentials (mitochondrial respiration/glycolytic activity)&#160;in cells treated either with  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;B  &#160;or  Mito&#8208;CORMs 2/3&#8208;A&#8217;. Thus, the Mito&#8208;CORMs represent valuable tools for the safe and targeted delivery of CO to mitochondria as a subcellular compartment to induce anti&#8208;inflammatory effects with only minor shifts in cellular energy metabolism. Also, due to their water solubility, these compounds provide&#160;promising options for further pharmacological studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of A Stable Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Zeolite with 15&#215;12&#215;12 Member&#8208;Ring Channels</title>

Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore germanosilicate zeolite NUD&#8208;13 is synthesized by using an easily obtained 1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;propyl&#8208;benzimidazolium as organic structure&#8208;directing agents, which possesses a rare 15&#215;12&#215;12&#8208;ring pore system. The germanium in NUD&#8208;13 can be partially substituted by post&#8208;synthetic modifications to obtain stable high silica and acidic aluminosilicate zeolites.







Abstract
Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites have great application potential in various industrial fields, such as oil refinery, fine chemicals and biomass processing. Herein, we report the synthesis of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore germanosilicate zeolite (named NUD&#8208;13) by using an easily obtained aromatic organic cation 1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;propyl&#8208;benzimidazolium as organic structure&#8208;directing agents. NUD&#8208;13 possesses a rare 15&#8208;member ring extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore channel intersecting with two elliptical 12&#8208;member ring channels, which is isostructural to germanosilicate zeolite GeZA synthesized by using triphenylsulfonium. The germanium in NUD&#8208;13 can be partially substituted by acid treatment to obtain stable high silica zeolite. In addition, aluminium is added into the framework of NUD&#8208;13 during the post&#8208;synthesis treatment process, which provides a foundation for catalytic application.

         <title>H2, B&#8722;H, and Si&#8722;H Bond Activation and Facile Protonolysis Driven by Pt&#8208;Base Metal Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt/Zn and Pt/Ca dimethyl complexes feature various degrees of metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;Me interactions and show Pt/Zn cooperative activation of H2, B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds, observed only when Zn is in close proximity to Pt, as well as facile protonolysis by water, MeOH and C&#8722;H bond of terminal acetylene.







Abstract
We report a series of heterobimetallic Pt/Zn and Pt/Ca complexes to study the effect of proximity of a dicationic base metal on the organometallic Pt species. Varying degrees of Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Zn and Zn interaction with the bridging Me group are achieved, showcasing snapshots of a hypothetical process of retrotransmetalation from Pt to Zn. In contrast, only weak interactions were observed for Ca with a Pt&#8208;bound Me group. Activation of H2, B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds leads to the formation of hydride&#8208;bridged Pt&#8722;H&#8722;Zn complexes, which is not observed in the absence of Zn, pointing out the importance of metal&#8208;metal cooperation. Reactivity of PtMe2/M2+ with terminal acetylene, water and methanol is also studied, leading to facile protonation of one of the Me groups at the Pt center only when Zn is present. This study sheds light on various ways in which the presence of a 2+ metal cation significantly affects the reactivity of a common organoplatinum complex.

         <title>Enhancement of Mass and Charge Transfer during Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction by Enhanced Surface Hydrophobicity without a Barrier Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass transfer of CO2 in aqueous solutions has been enhanced by surface hydrophobic modification. The in&#8208;situ surface fluorination strategy without any organic barrier layer facilitates charge transfer from catalysts to the reactant. With less obstruction to charge transfer, higher CO2 and lower H+ surface concentrations, the rate of generation of methanol from the CRR is elevated to up to 247.15&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) represents a promising route for the clean utilization of renewable resources. But mass&#8208;transfer limitations seriously hinder the forward step. Enhancing the surface hydrophobicity by using polymers has been proved to be one of the most efficient strategies. However, as macromolecular organics, polymers on the surface hinder the transfer of charge carriers from catalysts to reactants. Herein, we describe an in&#8208;situ surface fluorination strategy to enhance the surface hydrophobicity of TiO2 without a barrier layer of organics, thus facilitating the mass transfer of CO2 to catalysts and charge transfer. With less obstruction to charge transfer, a higher CO2, and lower H+ surface concentration, the photocatalytic CRR generation rate of methanol (CH3OH) is greatly enhanced to up to 247.15&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Furthermore, we investigated the overall defects; enhancing the surface hydrophobicity of catalysts provides a general and reliable method to improve the competitiveness of CRR.

         <dc:description>
Record resonance: An anionic seven&#8208;vertex siliconoid cluster with four unsubstituted silicon atoms and a record upfield 29Si NMR chemical shift at &#8722;413.9&#8197;ppm is described. It was analyzed by magnetically induced current&#8208;density calculations.







Abstract
The silanide [Si4{N(SiMe3)Dipp}3]&#8722; (1) transforms into the anionic siliconoid cluster [Si7{N(SiMe3)Dipp}3]&#8722; (2) with four unsubstituted silicon atoms as a contact ion pair with [K([18]crown&#8208;6)] in C6D6 at room temperature within five weeks. Anion 2 was investigated by natural population analysis and visualization of intrinsic atomic orbitals. Magnetically induced current&#8208;density calculations of 2 revealed two distinct strong diatropic vortices that sum up in one direction and create a strongly shielded apical silicon atom in 2.

         <title>A Rationally Designed Bimetallic Platinum (II)&#8208;Ferrocene Antitumor Agent Induces Non&#8208;Apoptotic Cell Death and Exerts in Vivo Efficacy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterobimetallic platinum (II)&#8208;ferrocene hybrid 2 circumvents apoptosis and multifactorial cisplatin resistance, exhibits multi&#8208;pronged action in cancer cells &#8208; promoting necroptosis and paraptosis, and exerts in&#8197;vivo anticancer efficacy in mice xenograft model.







Abstract
Despite phenomenal clinical success, the efficacy of platinum anticancer drugs is often compromised due to inherent and acquired drug resistant phenotypes in cancers. To circumvent this issue, we designed two heterobimetallic platinum (II)&#8208;ferrocene hybrids that display multi&#8208;pronged anticancer action. In cancer cells, our best compound, 2, platinates DNA, produces reactive oxygen species, and has nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum as potential targets. The multi&#8208;modal mechanism of action of these hybrid agents lead to non&#8208;apoptotic cell death induction which enables circumventing apoptosis resistance and significant improvement in platinum cross resistance profile. Finally, in addition to describing detail mechanistic insights, we also assessed its stability in plasma and demonstrate anticancer efficacy in an in&#8197;vivo A2780 xenograft model. Strikingly, compared to oxaliplatin, our compound displays better tolerability, safety profile and efficacy in&#8197;vivo.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A heterobimetallic platinum&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;II&lt;/b&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;ferrocene hybrid 2&lt;/b&gt; circumvents apoptosis and multifactorial cisplatin resistance, exhibits multi-pronged action in cancer cells - promoting necroptosis and paraptosis, and exerts in&#8197;vivo anticancer efficacy in mice xenograft model.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite phenomenal clinical success, the efficacy of platinum anticancer drugs is often compromised due to inherent and acquired drug resistant phenotypes in cancers. To circumvent this issue, we designed two heterobimetallic platinum (II)-ferrocene hybrids that display multi-pronged anticancer action. In cancer cells, our best compound, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, platinates DNA, produces reactive oxygen species, and has nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum as potential targets. The multi-modal mechanism of action of these hybrid agents lead to non-apoptotic cell death induction which enables circumventing apoptosis resistance and significant improvement in platinum cross resistance profile. Finally, in addition to describing detail mechanistic insights, we also assessed its stability in plasma and demonstrate anticancer efficacy in an in&#8197;vivo A2780 xenograft model. Strikingly, compared to oxaliplatin, our compound displays better tolerability, safety profile and efficacy in&#8197;vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Induced Circular Polarized Luminescence in One&#8208;Dimensional Manganese(II) Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly emissive 1D manganese(II) halide hybrid is successfully prepared by self&#8208;assembly of accessible amine acid salt and low&#8208;cost manganese chloride. The known d&#8211;d transition of Mn2+ in octahedral coordination results in strong red emission with PLQY as high as 67.1&#8197;%. The as&#8208;formed 1D manganese(II) hybrids exhibit excellent CD signals in ground state and distinguished CPL activity with dissymmetry factor g as high as 6.3*10&#8722;3 in excited state due to the existence of chiral amine acid salt.







Abstract
Circular polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials attract great attentions owing to their widely applications in 3D optical displays and encrypted transmission. Inspired by the strategies adopted in perovskite based CPL materials, herein, CPL&#8208;active hybrids (D)&#8208; and (L)&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl prolinate)MnCl3 were successfully prepared by assembling chiral D/L tert&#8208;butyl prolinate with manganese (II) chloride. Single crystal structures show the as&#8208;formed hybrids possess one&#8208;dimensional (1D) structure containing linear chains of face&#8208;sharing MnCl6 octahedral surrounded by prolinate cations. The 1D Mn(II) hybrids display strong red emission peaked at 646&#8197;nm with PLQY of 67.1&#8197;% and 57.2&#8197;% for d&#8208;type and l&#8208;type, respectively, representing the highest PLQY for 1D MnII hybrids. Interestingly, the 1D Mn(II) hybrids exhibit prominent circular dichroism (CD) signals and remarkable CPL activity with the dissymmetry factor g of 6.1*10&#8722;3 and &#8722;6.3*10&#8722;3 from 550 to 800&#8197;nm for (D)&#8208; and (L)&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl prolinate)MnCl3, respectively, owing to the existence of chiral cations. It is worthy noted the obtained g represents the highest value for non&#8208;lead organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids.

         <title>Ag Doped Au44 Nanoclusters for Electrocatalytic Conversion of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ag doped Ag4+xAu40&#8208;x(C10H9)28 (x&#8804;6) cluster has been synthesized and the Ag doping positions can be precisely determined. The electrochemical reduction process of CO2 to CO can be promoted by Ag doping into Au cluster, due to the modulated electronic properties and structural reconstruction by Ag doping. The work provides an opportunity for understanding the heteroatom&#8208;doping role in modulating the catalytic properties of metal clusters.







Abstract
A novel Ag doped Au44(C10H9)28 nanocluster (C10H10=1&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;dimethylbenzene) was synthesized, that is, Ag4+xAu40&#8208;x(C10H9)28 (x&#8804;6), where four Ag positions located in the surface staple of the cluster have been determined, while six Au/Ag co&#8208;occupying positions have been found in the metal core of the cluster. The electronic configuration of Au44(C10H9)28 cluster is significantly disturbed by doping Ag atoms, hence promoting the electron transport capability. For the two&#8208;electron conversion reaction of CO2 to CO in electrochemical reduction of CO2, Ag doped Ag4+xAu40&#8208;x(C10H9)28 catalyst exhibited higher effective activity and long&#8208;term stability than its counterpart Au44(C10H9)28 catalyst.

         <title>From Nanoparticle Ensembles to Single Nanoparticles: Techniques for the Investigation of Plasmon Enhanced Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmon enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC), where specific electrochemical reactions are promoted due to the reduced energy barrier of the reaction processes by the light excited &#8220;hot carriers&#8221; of the plasmonic nanoparticles, has aroused tremendous interest in recent years. A deep understanding of the PEEC process becomes a key issue for facilitating PEEC catalyst design and improving PEEC performance. This concept article begins with a brief discussion of the macroscopic electrochemical method of PEEC study of the plasmonic nanoparticle ensembles. Following that, we highlight two electrochemical techniques that may possess single nanoparticle sensitivity,  i.e.  , scanning electrochemical microscope and nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry. The pros and cons of each technique are discussed and an outlook is given. We hope to provide the readers with the current status of PEEC to evoke reflections regarding the reaction mechanisms, performance improvement, and the utilizations to important systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Olefin Metathesis: Recent Theoretical and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#8220;metathesis reaction&#8221; is a straightforward and often metal&#8208;catalyzed chemical reaction that transforms two hydrocarbon molecules to two new hydrocarbons by exchange of molecular fragments. Alkane, alkene and alkyne metathesis have become an important tool in synthetic chemistry and have provided access to complex organic structures. Since the discovery of industrial olefin metathesis in the 1960s, many modifications have been reported; thus, increasing scope and improving reaction selectivity. Olefin metathesis catalysts based on high&#8208;valent group six elements or Ru(IV) have been developed and improved through ligand modifications. In addition, significant effort was invested to realize olefin metathesis with a non&#8208;toxic, bio&#8208;compatible and one of the most abundant elements in the earth's crust; namely, iron. First evidences suggest that low&#8208;valent Fe(II) complexes are active in olefin metathesis. Although the latter has not been unambiguously established, this review summarizes the key advances in the field and aims to guide through the challenges.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a Keggin polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;immobilizing rhodium single&#8208;atom Rh catalyst (MTOA)5[SiW11O39Rh] (MOTA=methyltrioctylammonium cation), which can afford exceptionally high catalytic activity for the hydroformylation of alkenes to produce aldehydes at an ultralow loading of Rh (ca. 3 ppm). For styrene hydroformylation, both the conversion and the yield of the aldehyde can reach almost 99%, and the TOF was obtained as high as 9000 h&#8208;1 without usage of any phosphine ligand in the reaction process. The further characterization by FT&#8208;IR, ICP and ESI&#8208;MS analysis revealed that the Rh single atom was incorporated in the lacunary POM anions. Especially, the bulky IL cation can provide an additional role in stabilizing Rh species and thus prevented from aggregation and leaching of Rh species. The IL catalyst was miscible with n&#8208;hexane under the elevated temperature conditions, which contributed to exceptionally high activity for hydroformylation even at ultra&#8208;low loading of IL catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Oxygenated Sesquiterpenoids Enabled by Combining Metabolic Engineering and Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;Chem collaboration: Escherichia coli fermentation and visible&#8208;light photocatalysis were combined in a complementary way for the first time, to realize the scaffold assembly in a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; fashion and the subsequent diversifications in a &#8220;one&#8208;step&#8221; manner, respectively, enabling the production of six sesquiterpenoids.







Abstract
The diversification of natural products to expand biologically relevant chemical space for drug discovery can be achieved by combining complementary bioprocessing and chemical transformations. Herein, genetically engineered Escherichia coli fermentation to produce amorphadiene and valencene was combined with metal&#8208;free photocatalysis transformations to further access nootkatone, cis&#8208;nootkatol and two hydration derivatives. In fermentation, using a closed, anaerobic condition avoided the use of organic overlay, increased the productivity, and simplified the work&#8208;up process. Metal&#8208;free photocatalysis hydration and allylic C&#8722;H oxidation were designed and implemented to make the whole process greener. It was shown that the anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity of photocatalyzed alkene hydration could be reversed by stereo&#8208;electronic and steric effects existing in complex natural products. The combination of bioprocessing and photocatalysis may provide an efficient and greener way to expand the chemical space for pharmaceutical, flavor and fragrance industry.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Platform for Novel Reaction Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection of new chemical bond formation in high&#8208;throughput synthesis is limited by the efficiency and scalability of reaction product detection, as conventional methods for product isolation from reaction mixtures are time consuming and labor intensive. Here, we report a miniaturizable purification method that enables rapid, high&#8208;throughput isolation of quaternary ammonium&#8208;tagged products from reaction mixtures with excellent purity using inexpensive equipment that can be easily set up in a typical organic chemistry laboratory. This novel purification technique enabled us to establish a high&#8208;throughput reaction discovery platform. We validated this platform in a screen of 1536 reactions, which identified one&#160;previously unreported transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Adipic Esters and Adiponitrile via Photoassisted Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Hydrodimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct hydrodimerization of acrylates and acrylonitrile offers a general streamlined access to industrially important intermediates to nylon 6,6. However, a practical catalytic method for this process has thus far underdeveloped owing to the challenges in regioselectivity and environmental compatibility of applied reagents. Here, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrodimerization of activated alkenes driven by a visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis at ambient temperature, which is applicable to both adipates and adiponitrile synthesis from potentially renewable feedstocks. This protocol utilizes half equivalent of hantzsch ester as a recyclable two&#8208;electron and two&#8208;proton donor with the assistance of catalytic amount of base as a proton shuttle, and has been shown to be highly regioselective and efficient for hydrodimerizing various activated alkenes to 1,4&#8208;difunctionalized butane derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism Insight into Photo&#8208;induced Damages of Unnatural Base Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) are important to maintain the genetic code integrity, and critical for developing healthy semisynthetic organisms. As reported, dTPT3 was less stable upon irradiation, and thus might act as a pervasive photosensitizer to induce oxidative damages within DNA, causing harm to living semi&#8208;synthetic organisms when exposed to UVA radiation. However, there was no knowledge about molecular&#8208;level understanding of this damage process. In this paper, we not only identified four photoproducts of dTPT3, including desulfur&#8208;dTPT3 (dTPT3  H  ), TPT3 sulphinate (TPT3  SO2  ), TPT3 sulphonate (TPT3  SO3  ) and TPT3&#8208;thioTPT3 (TPT3  S  TPT3), but also established a Type II photosensitized oxidation mechanism. In addition, the antioxidant (sodium ascorbate) was able to effectively inhibit the photoproducts formation of dTPT3 and dTPT3 in DNA, suggesting that a reductive environment might protect DNA bearing dTPT3 against UVA oxidation and ameliorate its adverse biological effects. The comprehensive understanding of TPT3&#8217; photochemical stability will give researchers helpful guidance to design more photo&#8208;stable UBPs and construct healthier semisynthetic organisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Sorption Controls Extreme Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single Crystal Molecular Reorganization in Hydrogen Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because hydrogen bonded frameworks are held together by relatively weak interactions, they often form several different frameworks under slightly different synthesis conditions, and respond dynamically to stimuli such as heat and vacuum. However, these dynamic restructuring processes are often poorly understood. In this work, three isoreticular hydrogen bonded organic frameworks assembled through charge&#8208;assisted amidinium&#183;&#183;&#183;carboxylate hydrogen bonds (1C/C, 1Si/C and 1Si/Si) are studied. Three distinct phases for 1C/C and four for 1Si/C and 1Si/Si are fully structurally characterized. The transitions between these phases involve extreme yet recoverable molecular&#8208;level framework reorganization. It is demonstrate that these transformations are related to water content and can be controlled by humidity, and that the non&#8208;porous anhydrous phase of 1C/C shows reversible water sorption through single crystal to crystal restructuring. This mechanistic insight opens the way for the future use of the inherent dynamism present in hydrogen bonded frameworks.</dc:description>
