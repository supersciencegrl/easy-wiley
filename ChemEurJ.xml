         <title>Highly Fluorescent Supramolecular Nanoring Composed of Bent&#8208;Shaped Cyanostilbene Derivatives and Cucurbit[8]urils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) made of organic guest molecule and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in aqueous solution have great potential for diverse applications. Herein, we designed highly fluorescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nano&#8208;ring SOF with CB[8] as a host and novel bent&#8208;shaped cyanostilbene guest. This host&#8208;guest complex successfully formed macrocyclic hexamer and showed significantly enhanced fluorescence (&#934;F = 68%) compared to non&#8208;assembled monomer (&#934;F = 2%). Unlike other SOFs, this 0D SOF could be dispersed uniformly without bundling phenomenon in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Antifreeze Activity through Water: Latent Functions of Sugars of Antifreeze Glycoprotein Revealed by Using Total Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP), which inhibits the freezing of water, is highly O&#8208;glycosylated with a disaccharide,&#160;D&#8208;Gal&#946;1&#8208;3&#8208;D&#8208;GalNAc&#945; (GalGalNAc). To elucidate the function of the sugar residues for antifreeze activity at the molecular level, we conducted a total chemical synthesis of partially sugar deleted AFGP derivatives, and&#160;unnatural forms of&#160;AFGPs incorporating glucose (Glc)&#8208;type sugars instead of galactose (Gal)&#8208;type sugars. These elaborated AFGP derivatives demonstrated that the stereochemistry of each sugar residues on AFGPs precisely correlates with the antifreeze activity. A hydrogen&#8211;deuterium exchange experiment using synthetic AFGPs revealed a different dynamic behaviour of water around sugar residues depending on the sugar structures. These results indicate that sugar residues on AFGP form a unique dynamic water phase that disturbs the absorbance of water molecules onto the ice surface, thereby inhibiting freezing.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of 2D Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Linkage Chemistry to Interlayer Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilizing methodology: Emerging strategies, such as linkage transformation strategy, bond protection strategy, and interlayer interaction engineering, have recently been developed to regulate the stability of 2D imine&#8208;linked COFs. This provides a facile solution to the instability of imine&#8208;linked COFs while simultaneously conserving their structural crystallinity and functionality.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (imine&#8208;COFs) represent the most sought&#8208;after class of COFs due to their broad monomer scope and ease of synthesis. Owing to the reversible nature of imine linkages, however, the chemical stability of most imine&#8208;COFs is still far from adequate. In this context, emerging strategies, ranging from linkage chemistry to interlayer interaction, have been employed to construct stable imine&#8208;COFs for their applications in electronics, sensing, and energy storage devices. This Concept article summarizes the latest advances aimed at tuning the structural stability of imine&#8208;COFs. Furthermore, this Concept provides a prospective for the precise design of stable imine&#8208;COFs based on the characteristics of structure, physical properties, and chemical functions, as well as the mechanism of structure locking and stabilization during crystal growth.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this&#160;work,&#160;nitrogen&#8208;annulated perylene (NP)&#160;was dimerized into one framework connected by two nitrogen atoms, generating the target molecule of&#160;DNP&#8208;DA. Owing to the substructure of 1,6&#8208;diazecine ten&#8208;membered ring,&#160;DNP&#8208;DAillustrates helical chirality with moderate dissymmetry factor, elevated molecular levels, expanded conjugation and supramolecular interactions with acceptors etc.&#160;Notably,&#160;DNP&#8208;DA&#160;represents a limited example of nitrogen&#8208;perylene&#160;based CPL emitter with glum&#160;around 6 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Intrigued by the facile fabrication via a simple amination&#8208;cross coupling sequence and other above advancing features, this work demonstrates the potential generality of utilizing 1,6&#8208;diazecine as a chiral unit to build CPL&#8208;active&#160;materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Four&#8208;Step Synthesis of the Potato Alkaloid Demissidine from the Common Sapogenin Tigogenin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple synthesis method of solanidane alkaloids from common steroidal sapogenins was developed. Previously described multi&#8208;step transformations of tigogenin to demissidine (8&#8209;12 steps) were shortened to four steps only. The key&#8208;step of the present synthesis was the epimerization at C25 of the lactam intermediate. Different approaches to this reaction, i.e., a classical one via enolate, and a chemoselective umpolung transformation, were thoroughly investigated. The epimerization step is unnecessary if the starting sapogenin has the same configuration at C25 as the target alkaloid because the configuration at C25 (either R or S) remains intact throughout the synthesis. Thus, the related solanidane alkaloids, 12&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;25&#8208;epi&#8208;demissidine and 5&#8208;epi&#8208;demissidine, were synthesized in the three&#8208;step procedure with retention of configuration at this stereogenic center from rockogenin (25R&#8208;5&#945;&#8208;sapogenin) or sarsasapogenin (25S&#8208;5&#946;&#8208;sapogenin), respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Design of A&#8722;D&#8722;A Electron Acceptors Towards Low Energy Loss for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;vibration coupling is an important factor affecting the energy loss of organic solar cells. Enhancing molecular planarity and rigidity, adopting angular fusion mode, and tuning electron&#8208;deficient core can effectively decrease the electron&#8208;vibration couplings of A&#8722;D&#8722;A electron acceptors to achieve efficient charge generation and low energy loss for organic photovoltaics.







Abstract
Low energy loss is a prerequisite for organic solar cells to achieve high photovoltaic efficiency. Electron&#8208;vibration coupling (i.&#8201;e., intramolecular reorganization energy) plays a crucial role in the photoelectrical conversion and energy loss processes. In this Concept article, we summarize our recent theoretical advances on revealing the energy loss mechanisms at the molecular level of A&#8722;D&#8722;A electron acceptors. We underline the importance of electron&#8208;vibration couplings on reducing the energy loss and describe the effective molecular design strategies towards low energy loss through decreasing the electron&#8208;vibration couplings.

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity of Hyper&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linked Polymers Toward Amines Oxidation Coupled with H2O2 Generation through Extending Monomer's Conjugation Degree</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the monomer's conjugation degree of HCPs photocatalysts could significantly promote the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated carriers. QP&#8208;HCPs bring out the best photocatalytic activity for amines oxidation coupled with H2O2 generation due to its maximum monomer's conjugation degree and excellent O2 adsorption capacity.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven amines oxidation coupled with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation is a promising way to convert solar energy to chemical energy. Herein, a series of hyper&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymers (HCPs) photocatalysts with different arenes monomers, including benzene (BE), diphenyl (DP), p&#8208;terphenyl (TP), or p&#8208;quaterphenyl (QP), were synthesized by simple Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reaction. Owing to the maximum monomer's conjunction degree and excellent oxygen (O2) adsorption capacity, QP&#8208;HCPs exhibited highest photocatalytic activity for benzylamine oxidation coupled with H2O2 generation under the irradiation of 455&#8197;nm Blue LED lamp. More than 99&#8201;% of benzylamine could be converted to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine within 60&#8197;min. In addition, nearly stoichiometric H2O2 was synchronously obtained with a high production rate of 9.3&#8197;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Our work not only demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of HCPs photocatalysts significantly depends on monomer's conjunction degree, but also provided a new strategy for converting solar energy to chemical energy.

         <title>The Chelate Effect Rationalizes Observed Rate Acceleration and Enantioselectivity in BINOL&#8208;Catalyzed Petasis Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,1&#8242;&#8208;Bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) induces high enantiomeric excess of Petasis reaction by forming cyclic B(IV)BINOL intermediates. The chelate formation results in an extraordinary reaction rate acceleration and in the diminishment of the racemic background reaction. An unusual iminium C&#8722;H and O&#8208;BINOL hydrogen bond is responsible for the stereoselectivity. Formation of a cyclic trigonal B(III)BINOL byproduct accompanying the product enables the BINOL catalyst turnover.







Abstract
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations afforded insight into the origin of the experimentally observed reaction rate acceleration (&#8805;500 fold) and enantioselectivity (&#8805;99&#8201;% ee) of 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol&#8208; (BINOL&#8208;) catalyzed three&#8208;component Petasis reactions . BINOL accelerates the rate determining step by forming a BIV chelate, which involves the loss of water from the hemiaminal moiety to generate an iminium intermediate. Subsequent vinyl group transfer from BIV to the iminium carbon affords the enantiomerically enriched product and a cyclic trigonal B(III)BINOL complex, which rapidly releases the BINOL allowing it to re&#8208;enter the catalytic cycle. In the transition state of the vinyl transfer step, C&#8722;H&#8722;O hydrogen bonding between the iminium C&#8722;H and O of (R)&#8208;BINOL directs the vinyl group addition to the Re&#8208;face of the iminium carbon. This mechanism explains both the rate acceleration and high enantioselectivity of the stereo determining step.

         <title>AAZTA&#8208;like ligands bearing phenolate arms as efficient chelators for 68Ga labelling in vitro and in vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of a phenolate pendant arm in place of an acetate on AAZTA&#8208; and DATA&#8208;like ligands resulted in hepta&#8208; and hexadentate chelators able to form Ga(III) complexes with thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness higher than that of other Ga(III) complexes based on the parent 6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;methylperhydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazepine scaffold. In particular, the heptadentate AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB with a phenolate arm on an endocyclic N&#8208;atom shows a logKGaL of 27.35 and a remarkable resistance to hydroxide coordination up to basic pH (pH &gt; 9). This behaviour allows to also improve the kinetic inertness of the complex showing a dissociation half&#8208;life (t&#189;) at pH 7.4 of 76 h. Although also the hexadentate AAZ2A&#8208;exoHB chelator forms a stable (logKGaL = 24.69) and inert (t&#189; = 33 h at pH 7.4) Ga(III) complex, the 68Ga labelling showed a better radiochemical yield with AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB, especially at room temperature. Thus, a bifunctional chelator of AAZ3A&#8208;endoHB was synthesized bearing an isothiocyanate group that was conjugated to the N&#8208;terminus of a c(RGD) peptide for integrin receptor targeting. Finally, the conjugate was successfully labelled with 68Ga isotope, and the resulting radiotracer tested for its stability in human serum and then in vivo for targeting B16&#8208;F10 tumours with miniPET imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies on the Reduction of V2O5 and WO3 using Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of metal oxides with hydrogen is widely used for the production of fine chemicals and metals both at laboratory and industry scale. In situ methods can help to elucidate reaction pathways and to gain control over such synthesis reactions. In this study, the reduction of WO3 and V2O5 with hydrogen has been investigated with in situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction with regard to intermediates and influences of heating rates and hydrogen flow rates. Mixtures of V4O9, V6O13 as well as VO2 in two modifications are identified as intermediates on the way to phase pure V2O3. None of the intermediates are encountered isolated and can therefore not be prepared this way. In contrast, the intermediates of the WO3 reduction, H0.23WO3 and W10O29, appear consecutively and can be isolated. For both reactions, heating rate and flow rate have little influence on the formation of intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Directed Photooxidation Induced Conversion of Pyrrole&#8208;based Styryl Coumarins Dual&#8208;Color Photoconverters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;emissive photoconvertible fluorophores (DPCFs) are powerful tools in bioimaging to unambiguously track labelled cells in bioimaging. We recently introduced a new rational mechanism called directed photooxidation induced conversion (DPIC) enabling to obtain efficient DPCFs by conjugating a coumarin to aromatic singlet oxygen reactive moieties (ASORMs). Pyrrole was found to be a suitable ASORM as it provided a high hypsochromic shift along with a fast and efficient conversion. By synthesizing various pyrrole&#8208;based styryl coumarin dyes, we herein show that the photoconversion properties, including the quantum yield of photoconversion and the chemical yield of conversion can be tuned by chemical modification of the pyrrole. These modifications led to an improved dual emissive converter, SCP&#8208;Boc, which displayed a high brightness and an enhanced photoconversion yield of 63%. SCP&#8208;Boc was successfully used to sequentially photoconvert cells by laser scanning confocal microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Carbon&#8208;Boron Bond Formation via Heterogeneous Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Enallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient regio&#8208; and stereoselective heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of enallenes was developed. &#160;Nanopalladium immobilized on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was success&#173;fully employed as an efficient catalyst for the enallene hydro&#173;boration reaction. The nanopalladium particles were shown by HAADF&#8208;STEM to have an average size of 2.4 nm. &#160;The cellulose&#8208;supported palladium catalyst exhibits high stability and provides vinyl boron products in good to high isolated yields (up to 90%). The nanopalladium catalyst can be efficiently recycled and it was demonstrated that the catalyst ca be used in 7 runs with a maintained high yield (&gt;80%). The vinylboron compounds prepared from enallenes are important synthetic intermediates that can be used in various organic synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Principle for Complex Disordered Tetrahedral Frameworks in Quenched High&#8208;pressure Phases of Phosphorus Oxide Nitrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crystal structures of the new phosphorus oxide nitrides P40O31N46 and P74O59N84, which were synthesized from amorphous phosphorus oxide nitride imide, exhibit complex frameworks built up from P(O,N)4 tetrahedra. The latter form various chain&#8208;like building units of various branchedness. These modular units can be combined and arranged in different ways, which leads to closely related structures and several disordered configurations in each compound. As the material was obtained by high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis, the disorder is most likely a consequence of quenching a high&#8208;pressure phase with P(O,N)5 trigonal bipyramids. Under ambient conditions, P atoms are expected to relax by moving to the centers of the face&#8208;sharing tetrahedra that constitute the bipyramid. Diffraction patterns acquired with microfocused synchrotron radiation reveal that domains of both compounds are intergrown with H3P8O8N9, whose tetrahedral framework represents a cutout of the structures of both P40O31N46 and P74O59N84. Powder diffraction patterns do not indicate any further phases.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Silanols: Strategies and Tactics for Their Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silanols, as the silicon analogues of alcohols, are valuable and important compounds, which have found widespread applications in the field of materials science, synthetic chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. This concept intends to highlight recent advances in the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols, and hope to inspire chemists to continue contributing to the development of novel synthetic methods toward chiral silanols.







Abstract
Silanols are valuable and important compounds, which have found widespread applications in the field of materials science, synthetic chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. Although a handful of approaches have been developed for the synthesis of various silanols, access to enantioenriched silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols remains underdeveloped. This Concept article intends to summarize and highlight recent advances in the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols and endeavors to encourage further research in this area.

         <title>Intermolecular Covalent Interactions: Nature and Directionality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is a hole in the model! The directionality of intermolecular pnictogen, chalcogen, and halogen bonds comes forth from minimizing closed&#8208;shell Pauli repulsion between bond donor and acceptor. The &#963;&#8208;hole model lacks the fundamental physics behind intermolecular electrostatic interactions and consequently attributes their directionality erroneously to maximizing the electrostatic attraction.







Abstract
Quantum chemical methods were employed to analyze the nature and the origin of the directionality of pnictogen (PnB), chalcogen (ChB), and halogen bonds (XB) in archetypal FmZ&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722; complexes (Z=Pn, Ch, X), using relativistic density functional theory (DFT) at ZORA&#8208;M06/QZ4P. Quantitative Kohn&#8208;Sham MO and energy decomposition analyses (EDA) show that all these intermolecular interactions have in common that covalence, that is, HOMO&#8722;LUMO interactions, provide a crucial contribution to the bond energy, besides electrostatic attraction. Strikingly, all these bonds are directional (i.e., F&#8722;Z&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722; is approximately linear) despite, and not because of, the electrostatic interactions which, in fact, favor bending. This constitutes a breakdown of the &#963;&#8208;hole model. It was shown how the &#963;&#8208;hole model fails by neglecting both, the essential physics behind the electrostatic interaction and that behind the directionality of electron&#8208;rich intermolecular interactions. Our findings are general and extend to the neutral, weaker ClI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NH3, HClTe&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NH3, and H2ClSb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NH3 complexes.

Very radical: The recent advances of glycosyl radical&#8208;based C&#8208;glycosylation modification of amino acids and peptides are summarized, and perspectives for the further study of radical C&#8208;glycosylation reactions are presented.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;based reactions usually exhibit excellent functional&#8208;group compatibilities due to their mild initiation conditions. Glycosyl radical involved C&#8208;glycosylation modifications are important strategies to achieve highly regio&#8208; and chemoselective constructions of C&#8208;glycosidic bonds or C&#8208;glycoside linkages of peptides and proteins. In this Concept, we cover recent developments in glycosyl radical&#8208;based synthesis of unnatural amino acids and late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and proteins, and provide a preliminary outlook on the possible development of this direction in the future.

         <title>Detection of the Dark States in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Process of Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads: Insights from Optical Transient Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads type of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, the energy level matching of charge transfer singlet and triplet excited state (1CT and 3CT) and locally triplet excited state (3LE) is crucial for occurrence of TADF. Transient absorption spectroscopy is a useful method to study the dark states (3CT and 3LE) involved in TADF process.







Abstract
The photophysical processes involved in the electron donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are complicated and controversial. The recent consensus is that at least three states are involved, i.&#8201;e. the singlet charge transfer state (1CT), the triplet localized excited state (3LE) and the triplet CT state (3CT). It is clear the very often used steady state and time&#8208;resolved luminescence spectroscopic methods are unable to present direct evidence for the dark states, i.&#8201;e. the 3LE and 3CT states, as well as the interconversion of these states. Concerning this aspect, the femtosecond&#8208;nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopic methods are in particular interests. Both the emissive state and the dark state can be detected in these spectra, and interconversion of the states involved in TADF process can be also revealed. This review article focuses on the recent development of using the transient absorption spectra to study the photophysics of the TADF emitters.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Expanding Rearrangement of Benzo&#8208;Fused Tris&#8208;Cycloheptenylenes towards Nonplanar Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a benzannulated tris&#8208;tropone, a hexabrominated precursor containing three heptagons connected by a benzene ring was accessible in one step. Subsequent &#960;&#8208;extension afforded four negatively curved and overcrowded PAHs consisting of two heptagons and one octagon as a consequence of a ring&#8208;expanding 1,2&#8208;rearragement during the Suzuki couplings.







Abstract
A strongly twisted benzo&#8208;fused tris&#8208;cycloheptenylene, containing three dibenzosuberenone units fused to a common benzene ring, was subjected to Ramirez olefination and subsequent palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with 4&#8208;substituted phenylboronic acids. The high steric demand within the overcrowded, benzene&#8208;rich benzo&#8208;fused tris&#8208;cycloheptenylenes enforced an unprecedented 1,2&#8208;rearrangement upon &#960;&#8208;extension during the Suzuki coupling reaction. According to crystal structure analysis, the resulting negatively curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons consist of two heptagons and one octagon surrounding a central benzene ring as a result of strain release. In the solid state, the materials exhibit a blue to blue&#8208;green fluorescence with increased quantum yields and a hypsochromic shift of the emission maxima compared to their respective solutions.

         <title>Intramolecular Ferromagnetism in Di&#8208;Nuclear 3&#8201;d&#8208;Transition&#8208;Metal Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets by Pseudo&#8208;Serial Arrangement</title>

Single&#8208;molecule magnets: This work demonstrated the creation of ferromagnetic SMMs by magnetic dipole engineering of di&#8208;nuclear metal ion centers, which represents a new insight to create ferromagnetic 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal SMMs.







Abstract
Di&#8208;nuclear citrate complexes, [CH6N3]2[M2(citH)2(H2O)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (citH4=citric acid; M=FeII (Fe&#8208;2), CoII (Co&#8208;2), and NiII (Ni&#8208;2)), are synthesized. The ligand, citH3&#8722;, is deprotonated only at the three carboxy groups, which is different from the previously reported tetra&#8208;nuclear structures with cit4&#8722; ligands. Magnetic measurements reveal that these complexes have intramolecular ferromagnetism with J=&#8764;0&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (Ni&#8208;2), 0.02&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (Co&#8208;2), and 0.04&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (Fe&#8208;2). Co&#8208;2 and Fe&#8208;2 show slow magnetic relaxation, and are field&#8208;induced SMMs with activation energy of spin&#8208;reversal Ueff=27&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (Co&#8208;2) and 4.2&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (Fe&#8208;2). Density functional theory calculations indicate that the uniaxial anisotropy along the z&#8208;axis of each metal ion center forms the pseudo&#8208;serial arrangement, leading to intramolecular ferromagnetism via the magnetic dipole interaction. This work demonstrates the creation of ferromagnetic SMMs by the magnetic dipole engineering of 3d di&#8208;nuclear metal ion centers.

         <title>Alcohols as Efficient Intermolecular Initiators for a Highly Stereoselective Polyene Cyclisation Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereoselective polyene cyclisation cascade was enabled by using HFIP as a solvent. The process is triggered by a cation generated from an alcohol in situ and leads to the formation of three new C&#8208;C bonds and up to five new stereocenters as a single diastereomer. The cyclised products can be derivatised to obtain steroidal analogues in a single step.







Abstract
The use of benzylic and allylic alcohols in HFIP solvent together with Ti(OiPr)4 has been shown to trigger a highly stereoselective polyene cyclisation cascade. Three new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds are made during the process and complete stereocontrol of up to five new stereogenic centers is observed. The reaction is efficient, has high functional group tolerance and is atom&#8208;economic generating water as a stoichiometric by&#8208;product. A new polyene substrate&#8208;class is employed, and subsequent mechanistic studies indicate a stereoconvergent mechanism. The products of this reaction can be used to synthesize steroid&#8208;analogues in a single step.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Methane to Oxygenates using Oxygen via Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates using low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly molecular oxygen (O2) under mild reaction conditions is a promising strategy but still remains grand challenge. This Concept article highlights the main strategies employed to transform methane to oxygenates with O2 as oxidant coupling with in&#8197;situ generation of H2O2.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates using low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly molecular oxygen (O2) under mild reaction conditions is a promising strategy but still remains grand challenge. It is of great importance to accelerate the activation of O2 to generate highly active oxygen species, such as hydroxyl peroxide and hydroxyl species to improve catalytic performance for selective oxidation of methane. Selective oxidation of methane using O2 by coupling with in&#8197;situ generation of hydrogen peroxide via tandem catalysis ensures the easy formation of active oxygen species for methane activation, leading to high oxygenates productivity under mild conditions. In this concept, we summarized the recent progresses for selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates using O2 based on tandem catalysis by coupling with in&#8197;situ generation of hydrogen peroxide. The remaining challenges and future perspectives for selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates via tandem catalysis were also proposed.

         <title>Tweezer&#8208;Based C&#8722;H Oxidation Catalysts Overriding the Intrinsic Reactivity of Aliphatic Ammonium Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New supramolecular tweezer catalysts capable of oxidizing strongly deactivated C3/C4 positions of aliphatic ammonium salts were synthesized. The best performing catalyst Fe(pdp)Twe was explored in the oxidation of new substrates.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H oxygenation of alkyl chains as well as deactivated positions remains a great challenge for chemists. Here, we report the synthesis and application of four new supramolecular tweezer&#8208;based oxidation catalysts. They consist of the well&#8208;explored M(pdp/mcp) oxidation moiety and a molecular tweezer capable of binding ammonium salts. All catalysts display preferential oxidation of the strongly deactivated C3/C4 positions, however to different degrees. Furthermore, the best performing catalyst Fe(pdp)Twe was explored with an expanded substrate scope. It was demonstrated that the deactivated positions C3/C4 are also preferentially oxidized in these cases.

         <title>Inorganic Drugs as a Tool for Protein Structure Solving and Studies on Conformational Changes</title>

Metallodrugs application: We delineate the main features of an experimental&#8208;theoretical integrated approach based on the use of metallodrugs to solve protein structures.







Abstract
Inorganic drugs are capable of tight interactions with proteins through coordination towards aminoacidic residues, and this feature is recognized as a key aspect for their pharmacological action. However, the &#8220;protein metalation process&#8221; is exploitable for solving the phase problem and structural resolution. In fact, the use of inorganic drugs bearing specific metal centers and ligands capable to drive the binding towards the desired portions of the protein target could represent a very intriguing and fruitful strategy. In this context, a theoretical approach may further contribute to solve protein structures and their refinement. Here, we delineate the main features of a reliable experimental&#8208;theoretical integrated approach, based on the use of metallodrugs, for protein structure solving.

From the old, comes the new. The venerable m&#8208;CPBA reagent is shown as a large tree that has had a long history of bearing beautiful flowers. In this depiction, Ca(PA)2 streams up the tree from the earth to interact with the m&#8208;CPBA and substrates to yield new flowers that represent the new chiral hydroxylated products. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;C. Antilla and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203720).

         <title>Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O, the First Barium Nitridoalumotantalate with BCT&#8208;Zeolite Type Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel compound Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O:Eu2+ was synthesized by a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction in a tantalum ampule. The network in the structure of Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O is build up from AlN4 and TaN4 tetrahedra, which form a three&#8208;dimensional network corresponding to the BCT&#8208;zeolite type structure. The new compound is homeotypic to Li2Sr4Al2Ta2N8O and Li2Sr4Si4N8O but, additionally, it could be successfully doped with the activator ion Eu2+ exhibiting interesting luminescence properties. Characterization was done utilizing single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and luminescence spectroscopy.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystals of Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O:Eu2+ were synthesized from Ba3N2, Al2O3, Li3N, Eu2O3, and lithium metal by a high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction in a weld shut tantalum ampule. The crystal structure of Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O was determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and it crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnnm (no. 58) with the lattice parameters a=1006.71(3), b=1026.58(3), c=607.10(2) pm, and a volume of V=0.62742(3) nm3. The compound is built up from AlN4 and TaN4 tetrahedra, which form a three&#8208;dimensional network corresponding to the BCT&#8208;zeolite type structure. Li2Ba4Al2Ta2N8O is homeotypic to Li2Sr4Si4N8O and Li2Sr4Al2Ta2N8O but, additionally, it could be successfully doped with the activator ion Eu2+ and hence features an experimental observed overall emission at &#955;max=565&#8197;nm (fwhm=89&#8197;nm) consisting of a superposition of two adjusted emission bands at &#955;max=557&#8197;nm (fwhm=69&#8197;nm) and at &#955;max=604&#8197;nm (fwhm=102&#8197;nm).

         <title>Spontaneous Formation of Heterostructured Perovskite Films for Photovoltaic Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing components and structures of heterostructured perovskite films is an efficient strategy to yield highly stable and efficient photovoltaic devices. In this concept, we have highlighted the progress in research on spontaneous formation behavior in perovskite composite layers and provided a perspective on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art and future challenges and opportunities for perovskite heterostructural materials.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the one of most promising photovoltaic technologies that can be achieved by a simple solution process. At the current stage, the key issues concern further improvements in efficiency and operational lifetime. Constructing a self&#8208;assembled perovskite structure with manipulated chemical and physical properties is a useful and effective strategy to solve these problems. Herein, we review the basic principles of and recent progress in the spontaneous formation behavior of heterostructured perovskite thin films. This concept provides insightful clues for the design and fabrication of stable and efficient PSCs for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics.

         <title>Electrostatic CH&#8722;&#960; Interactions Can Override Fluorine Gauche Effects To Exert Conformational Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Are the fluorine gauche effects in fluoroethyl systems controlled electrostatically or by hyperconjugation? This experimental study shows that electrostatic forces from CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions (between polar CH2F protons and an adjacent aromatic ring) can override an inherent fluorine gauche effect to exert conformational control over fluoroethyl systems.







Abstract
Fluorine gauche effects are conformational properties of 2&#8208;fluoroethanes often applied in modern molecular designs. However, the physical origins of fluorine gauche effects are not well understood, with the consensus favoring the established hyperconjugation theory over an emerging electrostatic model. Using a series of model systems, we show that a shift to fluorine gauche effects can be influenced by intramolecular CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; aromatic interactions, a through&#8208;space event. Modulating the &#960;&#8208;ring (forming the aromatic interaction) with substituent groups resulted in a linear Hammett relationship, thus indicating that the CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction has electrostatic features. For instance, attaching a nitro group (an electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent) to the &#960;&#8208;ring weakened the CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction and led to a gauche preference, whereas an anti conformer is preferred with amine as substituent. The experimental results performed by using proton NMR spectroscopy are corroborated by gas&#8208;phase DFT calculations and solid&#8208;state X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Overclocking Nitronyl Nitroxide Gold Derivatives in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study resolved a problem in Pd&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling of metalloorganic derivatives of nitronyl nitroxide with bromoarenes. The finding opens a new pathway to various in&#8208;demand nitronyl nitroxides for different fields of research such as creation of high&#8208;spin systems, molecule&#8208;based magnets and molecular units for spintronics.







Abstract
Nitronyl nitroxides are functional building blocks in cutting&#8208;edge research fields, such as the design of molecular magnets, the development of redox and photoswitchable molecular systems and the creation of redox&#8208;active components for organic and hybrid batteries. The key importance of the nitronyl nitroxide function is to translate molecular&#8208;level&#8208;optimized structures into nano&#8208;scale devices and new technologies. In spite of great importance, efficient and versatile synthetic approaches to these compounds still represent a challenge. Particularly, methods for the direct introduction of a nitronyl nitroxide moiety into aromatic systems possess many limitations. Here, we report gold derivatives of nitronyl nitroxide that can enter Pd(0)&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with various aryl bromides, affording the corresponding functionalized nitronyl nitroxides. Based on the high thermal stability and enhanced reactivity in catalytic transformation, a new reagent is suggested for the synthesis of radical systems via a universal cross&#8208;coupling approach.

         <title>A Plausible Prebiotic Path to Nucleosides: Ribosides and Related Aldosides Generated from Ribulose, Fructose, and Similar Abiotic Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple sugars like glyceraldehyde readily form ketoses in plausible prebiotic reactions. These ketoses isomerize to form aldoses. It is shown here that fructose, a ketose, spontaneously isomerizes and forms ribosides with barbituric acid, a noncanonical nucleobase. Also, a one&#8208;pot reaction is demonstrated whereby glyceraldehyde and barbituric acid form glucosides via fructose.A Plausible Prebiotic Path to Nucleosides: Ribosides and Related Aldosides Generated from Ribulose, Fructose, and Similar Abiotic Precursors (Hud et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
The prebiotic origins of ribose, nucleosides, and eventually RNA are enduring questions whose answers are central to the RNA world hypothesis. The abiotic synthesis of sugars was first demonstrated over a century ago, but no known prebiotic reaction produces ribose (an aldose sugar) selectively and in good yield. In contrast, ribulose, and fructose (ketose sugars) and other monosaccharides are formed in high yield by several robust abiotic reactions. It is reported here that ketose sugars &#8208; both ketopentoses and ketohexoes &#8208; serve as precursors for the formation of ribosides and other aldosides, as demonstrated by glycoside&#8208;forming reactions involving barbituric acid, a plausibly prebiotic nucleobase. Moreover, a one&#8208;pot reaction of glyceraldehyde and barbituric acid was discovered which under mild conditions, and without special minerals or other catalysts, results in the formation of glycosides. These results reveal that an exclusive or high&#8208;yielding generation of free ribose was not required for its incorporation into processes that provided the foundations for life.

         <title>Readily Accessible Strained Difunctionalized trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes with Fast Click and Release Capabilities
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel strained difunctionalized trans&#8208;cyclooctene in only four high&#8208;yielding steps is presented and the releasing capabilities of functionalized derivatives were evaluated upon tetrazine activation. This method presents a major step forward in the ease and efficiency of synthesizing releasing difunctionalized trans&#8208;cyclooctenes.







Abstract
The click reaction between a functionalized trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and a tetrazine (Tz) is a compelling method for bioorthogonal conjugation in combination with payload releasing capabilities. However, the synthesis of difunctionalized TCOs remains challenging. As a result, these compounds are poorly accessible, which impedes the development of novel applications. In this work, the scalable and accessible synthesis of a new bioorthogonal difunctionalized TCO is reported in only four single selective high yielding steps starting from commercially available compounds. The TCO&#8208;Tz click reaction was assessed and revealed excellent kinetic rates and subsequently payload release was shown with various functionalized derivatives. Tetrazine triggered release of carbonate and carbamate payloads was demonstrated up to 100&#8201;% release efficiency and local drug release was shown in a cellular toxicity study which revealed a &gt;20&#8208;fold increase in cytotoxicity.

         <title>Effective Formation of New C(sp2)&#8722;S Bonds via Photoactivation of Alkylamine&#8208;based Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach for the direct thiolation of five&#8208;membered heteroarenes involving visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing EDA complexes is reported. The reaction takes place from an EDA complex between an alkylamine and the heteroarene halide. Selective photolysis to the EDA complex has allowed to generate the heteroarene radical that is suitably trapped by disulfide derivatives, providing a potent synthetic versatility.

A novel visible light promoted formation of CAryl&#8208;S bonds through electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes of alkylamines with 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered (hetero)arene halides is presented. This represents the first EDA&#8208;based thiolation method not relying on &#960;&#8208;&#960; or a thiolate&#8208;anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and provides a facile access to heteroarene radicals, which can be suitably trapped by disulfide derivatives to form the corresponding versatile arylsulfides. Mechanistic investigations on the aspects of the whole process were conducted by spectroscopic measurements, demonstrating the hypothesized EDA complex formation. Moreover, the strength of this method has been proven by a gram&#8208;scale synthesis of thiolated products and the late&#8208;stage derivatization of an anticoagulant drug.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An effective approach&lt;/b&gt; for the direct thiolation of five-membered heteroarenes involving visible-light-absorbing EDA complexes is reported. The reaction takes place from an EDA complex between an alkylamine and the heteroarene halide. Selective photolysis to the EDA complex has allowed to generate the heteroarene radical that is suitably trapped by disulfide derivatives, providing a potent synthetic versatility.

         <title>Quest for the Most Aromatic Pathway in Charged Expanded Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>

Choosing the right path: We show that the search for the most aromatic pathway in charged expanded porphyrins is a more puzzling quest than for their neutral analogue structures. Among the most popular aromatic indices, AVmin turns out to be the most useful tool for seeking the most aromatic path.







Abstract
Despite the central role of aromaticity in the chemistry of expanded porphyrins, the evaluation of aromaticity remains difficult for these extended macrocycles. The presence of multiple conjugation pathways and different planar and nonplanar &#960;&#8208;conjugation topologies makes the quantification of global and local aromaticity even more challenging. In neutral expanded porphyrins, the predominance of the aromatic conjugation pathway passing through the imine&#8208;type nitrogens and circumventing the amino NH groups is established. However, for charged macrocycles, the question about the main conjugation circuit remains open. Accordingly, different conjugation pathways in a set of neutral, anionic, and cationic expanded porphyrins were investigated by means of several aromaticity indices rooted in the structural, magnetic, and electronic criteria. Overall, our results reveal the predominance of the conjugation pathway that passes through all nitrogen atoms to describe the aromaticity of deprotonated expanded porphyrins, while the outer pathway through the perimeter carbon atoms becomes the most aromatic in protonated macrocycles. In nonplanar and charged macrocycles, a discrepancy between electronic and magnetic descriptors is observed. Nevertheless, our work demonstrates AVmin remains the best tool to determine the main conjugation pathway of expanded porphyrins.

         <title>Identification of Isonitrile&#8208;Containing Natural Products in Complex Biological Matrices through Ligation with Chlorooximes</title>

A trifunctional probe consisting of a chlorooxime, a bromine mass tag, and a UV tag facilitated the detection, isolation, and structure elucidation of isonitrile&#8208;containing natural products in microgram quantities in cyanobacteria and a rare marine sponge.







Abstract
Isonitrile&#8208;containing natural products have garnered attention for their manifold bioactivities but are difficult to detect and isolate due to the chemical lability of the isonitrile functional group. Here, we used the isonitrile&#8208;chlorooxime ligation (INC) in a reactivity&#8208;based screening (RBS) protocol for the detection and isolation of alkaloid and terpene isonitriles in the cyanobacterium Fischerella ambigua and a marine sponge of the order Bubarida, respectively. A trifunctional probe bearing a chlorooxime moiety, a UV active aromatic moiety, and a bromine label facilitated the chemoselective reaction with isonitriles, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic detection, and mass spectrometric analysis. The INC&#8208;based RBS allowed for the detection, isolation, and structural elucidation of isonitriles in microgram quantities.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Borylation and Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Stereospecific Cross&#8208;Coupling to Give Aryl C&#8208;Glycosides</title>

One step! Cu&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective one&#8208;step borylation of glycosyl bromides to &#946;&#8208;glycosyl borates has been developed. In addition, Pd&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling of thus&#8208;obtained &#946;&#8208;glycosyl borates with aryl bromides to various aryl &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides have been achieved.







Abstract
Metabolically stable C&#8208;glycosides are an essential family of compounds in bioactive natural products, therapeutic agents, and biological probes. For their application, development of synthetic methods by connecting glycosides and aglycons with strict stereocontrol at the anomeric carbon, as well as with high functional&#8208;group compatibility and environmental compatibility is a pivotal issue. Although Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura&#8208;type C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling using glycosyl boronates is a potential candidate for the construction of C&#8208;glycosides, neither the cross&#8208;coupling itself nor the facile synthesis of the coupling precursor, glycosyl boronates, have been achieved to date. Herein, it was succeeded to develop a copper&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective one&#8208;step borylation of glycosyl bromides to glycosyl boronates and palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereospecific cross&#8208;coupling of &#946;&#8208;glycosyl borates with aryl bromides to give aryl &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides, in which the &#946;&#8208;configuration of the anomeric carbon of the glycosyl trifluoroborates is stereoretentively transferred to that of the resulting aryl C&#8208;glycosides.

         <title>Propeller, Linear, Cruciform and Stellate Spiro&#8208;bicarbazolium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A common synthetic intermediate approach has enabled the development of two new series of arylbicarbazolium salts, and the formal synthesis of several other classes simplified. These derivatives are recognized as cognates of the neutral spirobifluorene and anionic borate systems, defining a complementary set of ionic/neutral building blocks for chiral reagents, porous materials, and optoelectrically active polymers.







Abstract
A general synthetic approach to halogenated tetraaryl&#8208;ammonium salts has been developed and illustrated crystallographically. Bromide ammonium salts used as common synthetic intermediates together with Suzuki coupling of these bromides to a family of boronic acids provided a simplified strategy for arylation. Resolution of the C2 subset of spiro&#8208;bicarbazolium derivatives led to the first examples of enantiopure spiro&#8208;bicarbazoliums and the assignment of their absolute configuration by comparison of computational and experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. An ECD comparison with Prelog's spirobifluorenes is provided. The absolute configuration of the meta&#8208;bromide spiro&#8208;bicarbazolium salt was confirmed by anomalous scattering. Cruciform and stellate tetra&#8208;substituted salts provide a test of the limits of the methodology, and their structures suggest them to be candidates for MOF building blocks.

         <title>Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Nanographenes with Excellent Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Properties: The Synergy of B/N and Azulene</title>

The synergy between electron&#8208;deficient B, electron&#8208;rich N, and polar azulene with a proper arrangement endows these butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographenes with strong second&#8208;order NLO responses.







Abstract
Azulene, a simple polar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with connected electron donor and acceptor (DA), ignites the hope of designing second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) molecular materials from pure nonpolar carbon nanomaterials. In this work, a butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographene (&#960;&#8722;DA&#8722;&#960;) was designed by incorporating azulene between two coronenes. One more electron in a N atom or one electron fewer in a B atom with respect to a C atom can polarize charge distribution in carbon nanomaterials, and further doping of B and N in the designed butterfly&#8208;shaped nanographene changes the system from &#960;&#8722;DA&#8722;&#960; to D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A, leading to strong NLO responses. For example, the largest static first hyperpolarizability even reaches 173.89&#215;10&#8722;30&#8197;esu per heavy atom. The synergetic role of B, N and azulene in the nanographene is scrutinized, and such a doping strategy is found to provide an effective means for the design of carbon&#8208;based functional materials. The strong second&#8208;order NLO responses of these butterfly&#8208;shaped carbon&#8208;based nanographenes under external fields, for example, sum frequency generation and difference frequency generation, could inspire future experimental exploration.

         <title>Ionic &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) Nanocrystal Stabilized by Small Isopolymolybdate Clusters as Reactive Core for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dare to be bare &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH): While the iron catalysts are susceptible to hydrolytic dissociation to insoluble bulk iron&#8208;oxide, [MoxOy]n&#8722; cluster ions, in&#8197;situ derived from a small isolable {31} atom containing Anderson polyoxometalate ([Mo7O24]6&#8722;), protect a &lt;10&#8197;nm iron&#8208;oxide nanocore in water. The POM clusters prevent the spontaneous aggregation of the iron oxy&#8208;hydroxide nanocore making the core highly reactive for electrochemical water&#8208;oxidation.







Abstract
At near neutral to basic pH, hydrolysis&#8208;induced aggregation to insoluble bulk iron&#8208;oxide is often regarded as the pitfalls of molecular iron clusters. Iron&#8208;oxide nanocrystals are encouragingly active over the molecular clusters and/or bulk oxides albeit, stabilizing such nanostructures in aqueous pH and under turnover condition remain a perdurable challenge. Herein, an Anderson&#8208;type [Mo7O24]6&#8722; isopolyanion, a small (dimension ca. 0.85&#8197;nm) isolable polyoxometalate (POM) possessing only {31} atoms, has been introduced for the first time as a covalent linker to stabilize an infinitely stable and aqueous&#8208;soluble &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore. During the hydrothermal isolation of the material, a partial dissociation of the parent [Mo7O24]6&#8722; may lead to the in&#8197;situ generation of few analogous [MoxOy]n&#8722; clusters, proved by Raman study, which can also participate in stabilizing the &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore, MoxOy@FeO(OH). However, due to high ionic charge on {Mo=O} terminals of the [MoxOy]n&#8722;, they are covalently linked via MoVI&#8208;&#956;2O&#8208;FeIII bridging to &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) core in MoxOy@FeO(OH), established by numerous spectroscopic and microscopic evidence. Such bonding mode is more likely as precedent from the coordination motif documented in the transition metal clusters stabilized by this POM. The &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) nanocore of MoxOy@FeO(OH) behaves as potent active center for electrochemical water oxidation with a overpotential, 263&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, lower than that observed for bare &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH). Despite of some molybdenum dissolution from the POM ligands to the electrolyte, residual anionic POM fragments covalently bound to the OER active &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH) core of the MoxOy@FeO(OH) makes the surface predominantly ionic that results in an ordered electrical double layer to promote a better charge transport across the electrode&#8208;electrolyte junction, less likely in bulk &#947;&#8208;FeO(OH).

         <title>Confused&#8208;Prism[5]arene: a Conformationally Adaptive Host by Stereoselective Opening of the 1,4&#8208;Bridged Naphthalene Flap</title>

         <dc:description>
All change, all together: The confused&#8208;prism[5]arene host changes its planar chirality upon the complexation of ammonium guests, adopting the homochiral all&#8208;pR (or all&#8208;pS) conformation. Stereoselective directional threading was also observed in the presence of directional ammonium axles, resulting in the formation of pseudorotaxanes in which the prismarene wheel adopts homochiral all&#8208;pR (all&#8208;pS) conformation.







Abstract
The confused&#8208;prism[5]arene macrocycle (c&#8208;PrS[5]Me) shows conformational adaptive behavior in the presence of ammonium guests. Upon guest inclusion, the 1,4&#8208;bridged naphthalene flap reverses its planar chirality from pS to pR (with reference to the pS(pR)4 enantiomer). Stereoselective directional threading is also observed in the presence of directional axles, in which up/down stereoisomers of homochiral (pR)5&#8208;c&#8208;PrS[5]Me pseudorotaxanes are formed.

         <title>Modulating the G&#8208;Quadruplex and Duplex DNA Binding by Controlling the Charge of Fluorescent Molecules</title>

Two fluorescent and non&#8208;toxic spirobifluorene molecules being either positive (Spiro&#8208;NMe3) or negative (Spiro&#8208;SO3) charged have been investigated as DNA binders. Both molecules show a moderate binding to G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA structures whereas the interaction is governed by the overall charge of the ligands.







Abstract
Two fluorescent and non&#8208;toxic spirobifluorene molecules bearing either positive (Spiro&#8208;NMe3) or negative (Spiro&#8208;SO3) charged moieties attached to the same aromatic structure have been investigated as binders for DNA. The novel Spiro&#8208;NMe3 containing four alkylammonium substituents interacts with G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures and shows preference for G4s over duplex by means of FRET melting and fluorescence experiments. The interaction is governed by the charged substituents of the ligands as deduced from the lower binding of the sulfonate analogue (Spiro&#8208;SO3). On the contrary, Spiro&#8208;SO3 exhibits higher binding affinity to duplex DNA structure than to G4. Both molecules show a moderate quenching of the fluorescence upon DNA binding. The confocal microscopy evaluation shows the internalization of both molecules in HeLa cells and their lysosomal accumulation.

The asymmetric oxidative C&#8722;C homocoupling reaction of diarylamines using air as final oxidant is catalyzed by a hexadecafluorinated iron&#8208;phthalocyanine complex and an axially chiral biaryl phosphoric acid. A radical cation&#8208;chiral phosphate anion pair is proposed as key intermediate responsible for the asymmetric induction.







Abstract
We describe an iron&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric oxidative C&#8722;C coupling of diarylamines which proceeds at room temperature with air as final oxidant. Using hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8208;iron(II) as catalyst in the presence of catalytic amounts of an axially chiral biaryl phosphoric acid, the resulting chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biaryls are obtained in up to 90&#8201;% ee as confirmed by chiral HPLC. A detailed mechanism has been proposed with a radical cation&#8208;chiral phosphate ion pair as key intermediate leading to the observed asymmetric induction.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a Ferrocene&#8208;Based Diol Library and Application in the Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a library of ferrocenyl diols, establishing a fundamental structure&#8211;activity relationship through a modular three&#8208;to&#8208;four&#8208;step synthesis is described. These diols are prepared with complete enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity across seven chiral elements (2 planes, 2 centres, and 3 axes) and are catalytically active in the hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. Characterization by X&#8208;ray crystallography shows intricate inter&#8208; and intramolecular hydrogen bonding, as well as uncommon bifurcated hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
Diol scaffolds have been utilized as highly effective catalysts and ligands in a wide range of catalytic asymmetric transformations. For scaffolds to be successful as broadly used motifs, they should be prepared cheaply through facile routes and be easily handled. Herein, the synthesis of a family of planar chiral diols based on a modular and robust three&#8208;step route is described, which yields catalytically active diols in &gt;99&#8201;% de and &gt;99&#8201;% ee, with up to seven different chiral elements. These diols have been characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which provides clear evidence for the likely transition state when applied in the asymmetric hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. Without altering the stereochemistry of the catalyst backbone, it is possible to access both enantiomers of the product by varying the substitution of the catalyst at the &#945;&#8208;position.

         <title>Stereodivergent Total Syntheses of (+)&#8208;Mycaperoxides C, D, G Methyl Ester and (&#8722;)&#8208;Mycaperoxide B
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Totally expanded. (+)&#8208;Mycaperoxides D, C, G methyl ester, and (&#8722;)&#8208;mycaperoxide B were synthesized in 11 to 15 steps for the first time. A stereodivergent approach from sclareol was adopted, highlighting ring expansion of strain cyclobutanol into 1,2&#8208;dioxane, and Mukaiyama aldol reaction on peroxycarbenium species to install the propionic acid subunit.







Abstract
Mycaperoxides are natural endoperoxides isolated from different Mycale genus sponges, showing significant antiviral or antibacterial activities. We report herein the first total syntheses of representative congeners of this family from sclareol using a stereodivergent approach. Thus, an innovative oxidative ring expansion of cyclobutanol was used to bring the 1,2&#8208;dioxane subunit, and a Mukaiyama aldol reaction on peroxycarbenium species was utilized to install the propionic acid subunit. During the study toward (+)&#8208;mycaperoxide D methyl ester (2), the isolation of the eight possible diastereomers under their ethyl thioester form allowed to build a pertinent database for further NMR assignment studies. Thus, we completed the total syntheses of (+)&#8208;mycaperoxides D, C, G methyl ester, and (&#8722;)&#8208;mycaperoxide B in 11 to 15 steps, confirming their original assignment.

         <title>Hijacking the Peptidoglycan Recycling Pathway of Escherichia coli to Produce Muropeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>

A straightforward access to Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides was developed by a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy based on metabolically engineered E.coli cells.







Abstract
Soluble fragments of peptidoglycan called muropeptides are released from the cell wall of bacteria as part of their metabolism or as a result of biological stresses. These compounds trigger immune responses in mammals and plants. In bacteria, they play a major role in the induction of antibiotic resistance. The development of efficient methods to produce muropeptides is, therefore, desirable both to address their mechanism of action and to design new antibacterial and immunostimulant agents. Herein, we engineered the peptidoglycan recycling pathway of Escherichia coli to produce N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucosaminyl&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;1,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;muramic acid (GlcNAc&#8208;anhMurNAc), a common precursor of Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides. Inactivation of the hexosaminidase nagZ gene allowed the efficient production of this key disaccharide, providing access to Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides through subsequent chemical peptide conjugation. E. coli strains deficient in both NagZ hexosaminidase and amidase activities further enabled the in&#8197;vivo production of Gram&#8208;negative muropeptides containing meso&#8208;diaminopimelic acid, a rarely available amino acid.

         <title>Palladium(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Anti&#8208;Selective Addition&#8208;Cyclizations of Alkynyl Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze anti&#8208;selective arylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. Remarkably, the regioselectivity in the cyclization of conjugated diyne&#8208;aldehydes can be controlled by a choice of the phosphine ligand, with triphenylphosphine and tricyclohexylphosphine leading to the exclusive formation of 2&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;cyclopentanol and 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol derivatives, respectively.







Abstract
Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze anti&#8208;selective alkylative, arylative, and alkynylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. The remarkable anti&#8208;selectivity results from novel oxidative addition, that is, the nucleophilic attack of electron&#8208;rich palladium(0) on the electrophile across the alkyne followed by transmetalation and reductive elimination (&#8220;anti&#8208;Wacker&#8221;&#8208;type cyclization). With regard to 5&#8208;alkynals, triphenylphosphine (PPh3)&#8208;ligated palladium(0) catalyzes the cyclization of terminal alkynes and conjugated alkenyl&#8208; or alkynyl&#8208;substituted ones to afford 2&#8208;cyclohexen&#8208;1&#8208;ol and 2&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;cyclopentanol derivatives, respectively. For 6&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkynals, the cyclization does not proceed with the palladium/PPh3 catalyst; however, it does proceed with palladium/tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy3), to yield the former products predominantly. Remarkably, the latter catalyst completely switches the regioselectivity in the cyclization of the conjugated diyne&#8208;aldehydes. Notably, palladium/PPh3&#8208;catalyzed cyclizations also proceed with other organometallics or even without them.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes&lt;/b&gt; catalyze &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-selective arylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. Remarkably, the regioselectivity in the cyclization of conjugated diyne-aldehydes can be controlled by a choice of the phosphine ligand, with triphenylphosphine and tricyclohexylphosphine leading to the exclusive formation of 2-alkylidene-cyclopentanol and 2-cyclohexen-1-ol derivatives, respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palladium(0)/monophosphine complexes catalyze &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-selective alkylative, arylative, and alkynylative cyclizations of alkynyl electrophiles with organometallic reagents. The remarkable &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-selectivity results from novel oxidative addition, that is, the nucleophilic attack of electron-rich palladium(0) on the electrophile across the alkyne followed by transmetalation and reductive elimination (&#8220;anti-Wacker&#8221;-type cyclization). With regard to 5-alkynals, triphenylphosphine (PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-ligated palladium(0) catalyzes the cyclization of terminal alkynes and conjugated alkenyl- or alkynyl-substituted ones to afford 2-cyclohexen-1-ol and 2-alkylidene-cyclopentanol derivatives, respectively. For 6-alkyl- or 6-aryl-5-alkynals, the cyclization does not proceed with the palladium/PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst; however, it does proceed with palladium/tricyclohexylphosphine (PCy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), to yield the former products predominantly. Remarkably, the latter catalyst completely switches the regioselectivity in the cyclization of the conjugated diyne-aldehydes. Notably, palladium/PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed cyclizations also proceed with other organometallics or even without them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetra(peri&#8208;naphthylene)anthracene: A Near&#8208;IR Fluorophore with Four&#8208;Stage Amphoteric Redox Properties</title>

Towards the red&#8208;light area. A reliable synthesis of a new tetra(peri&#8208;naphthylene)anthracene derivative decorated with triisopropylsilylethynyl moieties has been established. The soluble compound features strongly bathochromically shifted absorption and emission bands reaching into the near&#8208;IR region and is prone to four facilitated redox steps. The experimental results, corroborated by theoretical studies, identified the &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycyclic scaffold as a particularly promising candidate for the development of redox&#8208;active near&#8208;IR fluorophores.







Abstract
A novel, benign synthetic strategy towards soluble tetra(peri&#8208;naphthylene)anthracene (TPNA) decorated with triisopropylsilylethynyl substituents has been established. The compound is perfectly stable under ambient conditions in air and features intense and strongly bathochromically shifted UV/vis absorption and emission bands reaching to near&#8208;IR region beyond 900&#8197;nm. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed four facilitated reversible redox events comprising two oxidations and two reductions. These remarkable experimental findings were corroborated by theoretical studies to identify the TPNA platform a particularly useful candidate for the development of functional near&#8208;IR fluorophores upon appropriate functionalization.

         <title>Bimetallic CuSbSe2: A Potential Anode Material for Sodium and Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with High&#8208;Rate Capability and Long&#8208;Term Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic CuSbSe2 are successfully synthesis and evaluated in sodium&#8208; and lithium&#8208; ion batteries. The CuSbSe2 anode exhibits superior rate behavior and cyclic performance. The excellent electrochemical property is attributed to the synergistic effect and the high electric conductivity of the material.







Abstract
Bimetallic transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) materials have emerged as attractive anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) because of the high intrinsic electronic conductivity, rich redox sites and unique reaction mechanism. In this work, we report the synthesis and electrochemical properties of a novel bimetallic TMCs material CuSbSe2. The as&#8208;prepared anode delivers a high reversible capacity of 545.6&#8197;&#8201;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 for SIBs and 592.6&#8197;&#8201;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 for LIBs at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and an excellent rate capability of 425.9&#8197;&#8201;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for SIBs and 226.0&#8197;&#8201;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for LIBs without any common&#8208;used surface modification or carbonaceous compositing. In addition, ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveal a combined conversion&#8208;alloying reaction mechanism of LIBs and NIBs. Our findings suggest bimetallic CuSbSe2 could be a potential anode material for both SIBs and LIBs.

         <title>Finding a Deep&#8208;UV Borate BaZnB4O8 with Edge&#8208;sharing [BO4] Tetrahedra and Strong Optical Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a new congruently melting polyborate with extremely large birefringence (&#916;n(001)=0.14@589.3&#8197;nm) and band gap (6.89&#8197;eV) is discovered as a high performance birefringent crystal, which breaks the current deadlock of deep&#8208;UV polyborates that usually show small birefringence.







Abstract
The polarization modulation of deep&#8208;UV light is an important process that incorporates functionality to selectively respond to light&#8208;mater interaction. Typically, optical anisotropy is foremost to the use efficiency of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals. Herein, a new congruently melting polyborate with extremely large birefringence (&#916;n(001)=0.14@589.3&#8197;nm) and band gap (6.89&#8197;eV) is discovered as a high performance birefringent crystal, which breaks the current deadlock of deep&#8208;UV polyborates that usually show small birefringence. The rigid tetrahedra, including [ZnO4] and edge&#8208;sharing [BO4] tetrahedra, make all the planar [BO3] triangles in the lattice adopt preferential arrangement and thereby lead to an extraordinary large birefringence that is larger than all the deep&#8208;UV borates with experimentally measured values. Structural analyses with the additional theoretical calculations were used to study the origin of strong optical anisotropy in BaZnB4O8.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Driven Programmable Chiral Self&#8208;Sorting in Metal&#8208;Organic Cages and Structural Transformations between Heterochiral and Homochiral Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tunable selectivity in chiral self&#8208;sorting is achieved in the formation of Pd2L4 cages. Anions encapsulation dictates the outcome of diastereomer selectivity, either meso&#8208;cage or racemic mixture of homochiral cages, through chiral social or narcissistic self&#8208;sorting, respectively. Bulky non&#8208;encapsulating anion resulted in no selective chiral self&#8208;sorting. Post&#8208;synthetic anion&#8208;exchange facilitates interconversion between the diastereomers in a desired manner.







Abstract
When a racemic mixture of chiral building blocks self&#8208;assembles to form discrete molecular or supramolecular cages, the system can adopt either social or narcissistic chiral self&#8208;sorting. However, control over such chiral self&#8208;sorting is hard to achieve with a desired choice of outcome. Herein, we report anion templated high&#8208;fidelity chiral self&#8208;sorting during the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of [Pd2L4] metal&#8208;organic cages, with a racemic mixture of an axially chiral ligand. Upon varying the counter&#8208;anions, the outcome of the choice of chiral self&#8208;sorting, whether social or narcissistic, leading to kinetically favored heterochiral or thermodynamically favored homochiral cages, can be controlled through specific anion encapsulation. Non&#8208;encapsulating anion afforded a mixture of all possible diastereomers. Anion exchange enabled structural transformations between the diastereomers and the conversion of the mixture of diastereomers into homochiral diastereomers.

     alt="Anion-Driven Programmable Chiral Self-Sorting in Metal-Organic Cages and Structural Transformations between Heterochiral and Homochiral Cages"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An unprecedented&lt;/b&gt; tunable selectivity in chiral self-sorting is achieved in the formation of Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cages. Anions encapsulation dictates the outcome of diastereomer selectivity, either meso-cage or racemic mixture of homochiral cages, through chiral social or narcissistic self-sorting, respectively. Bulky non-encapsulating anion resulted in no selective chiral self-sorting. Post-synthetic anion-exchange facilitates interconversion between the diastereomers in a desired manner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a racemic mixture of chiral building blocks self-assembles to form discrete molecular or supramolecular cages, the system can adopt either social or narcissistic chiral self-sorting. However, control over such chiral self-sorting is hard to achieve with a desired choice of outcome. Herein, we report anion templated high-fidelity chiral self-sorting during the coordination-driven self-assembly of [Pd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] metal-organic cages, with a racemic mixture of an axially chiral ligand. Upon varying the counter-anions, the outcome of the choice of chiral self-sorting, whether social or narcissistic, leading to kinetically favored heterochiral or thermodynamically favored homochiral cages, can be controlled through specific anion encapsulation. Non-encapsulating anion afforded a mixture of all possible diastereomers. Anion exchange enabled structural transformations between the diastereomers and the conversion of the mixture of diastereomers into homochiral diastereomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Pink and blue electrical cords represent bond formation that gives the endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;adducts, respectively, shown on the light bulbs. The electrical plugs highlight the alkyne carbons attacked by the palladium catalyst, which then undergoes transmetalation with the arylboronic acid. Typical combinations of the ligand and alkyne substituent to give endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;adducts are shown on the boxes at the end of the outlets. Methanol as solvent not only activates the carbonyl oxygen, but also promotes transmetalation with the arylboronic acid. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Tsukamoto and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203068).

         <title>Cover Feature: Quest for the Most Aromatic Pathway in Charged Expanded Porphyrins (Chem. Eur. J. 6/2023)</title>

         <dc:description>
The aromaticity of charged expanded porphyrins turns out to be much more complex to study than that of their planar neutral analogues. In particular, identifying the most conjugated circuit is no longer straightforward. In addition to planarity, the protonation and deprotonation of porphyrinoids play an important role in determining their aromaticity. We have demonstrated that the largest charged porphyrins do not present a clear main conjugation pathway. Among the preferred aromatic indices, AVmin ends up being the most useful tool for recognizing the most aromatic path. We can relate the difficulty of finding the most conjugated path of a porphyrin to the number of pieces in a puzzle. Thus, the neutral state of the [36]octaphyrin is represented as a puzzle with few pieces; the protonated and deprotonated states are presented as puzzles with more pieces to indicate that they are more difficult to complete. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Torrent&#8208;Sucarrat, E. Matito, M. Alonso, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202264).

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer an opportunity for complex structural design and specific functional development, facilitating, for example, the applications of multi&#8208;valent metal ion batteries (Zn2+, Mg2+, Al3+). This comprehensive review describes COF synthesis and applications, provides advances in topology design and synthetic reactions, surveys the application of COFs in multi&#8208;valent ion batteries, discusses the key issues of COF electrodes, and predicts future applications.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received increased interest in recent years as an advanced class of materials. By virtue of the available monomers, multiple conformations and various linkages, COFs offer a wide range of opportunities for complex structural design and specific functional development of materials, which has facilitated the widespread application in many fields, including multi&#8208;valent metal ion batteries (MVMIBs), described as the attractive candidate replacing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With their robust skeletons, diverse pores, flexible structures and abundant functional groups, COFs are expected to help realize a high performance MVMIBs. In this review, we present an overview of COFs, describe advances in topology design and synthetic reactions, and study the application of COFs in MVMIBs, as well as discuss challenges and solutions in the preparation of COFs electrodes, in the hope of providing constructive insights into the future direction of COFs.

         <title>Bridging Chemical Knowledge and Machine Learning for Performance Prediction of Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 6, January 27, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Predicting organic transformations is one of the most critical challenges in molecular syntheses. The synergy between machine learning and chemical knowledge provides a distinctive and powerful strategy for syntheses predictions. This Minireview summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art embedding approaches and model designs for developing synthesis&#8208;sensitive machine learning models to allow for robust yield and selectivity predictions in molecular syntheses.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed a boom of machine learning (ML) applications in chemistry, which reveals the potential of data&#8208;driven prediction of synthesis performance. Digitalization and ML modelling are the key strategies to fully exploit the unique potential within the synergistic interplay between experimental data and the robust prediction of performance and selectivity. A series of exciting studies have demonstrated the importance of chemical knowledge implementation in ML, which improves the model's capability for making predictions that are challenging and often go beyond the abilities of human beings. This Minireview summarizes the cutting&#8208;edge embedding techniques and model designs in synthetic performance prediction, elaborating how chemical knowledge can be incorporated into machine learning until June 2022. By merging organic synthesis tactics and chemical informatics, we hope this Review can provide a guide map and intrigue chemists to revisit the digitalization and computerization of organic chemistry principles.

         <title>Plenates: Anion&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly of the Pyrrole Cage Encapsulating Silver(I) Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cages full of silver: The self&#8208;assembly of diformylpyrrole, tren amine, and silver(I) halides yielded cascade complexes incorporating the [Ag2F]+ unit or the Ag2Cl2 ion pair. Exploitation of silver(I) triflate, incorporating a bulky anion, resulted in the formation of plenates, that is, cryptates incorporating Agnn+ clusters. The latter transformed into cascade cryptates upon reaction with tetrabutylammonium halides.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine, and silver(I) yielded, depending on the size and basicity of the anion, new cascade complexes or plenates, that is, cryptates incorporating Agnn+ clusters. The nature of the product was counterion&#8208;dependent, and its formation was either driven by cascade anion binding or by argentophilic interactions stabilizing the cluster within the cavity. The reaction of plenates with tetrabutylammonium halides resulted in the protonation&#8208;coupled replacement of the Ag33+ with anion(s), yielding cascade cryptates.

         <title>Quest for a Rational Molecular Design of Alkyl&#8211;Distyrylbenzene Liquid by Substitution Pattern Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkyl&#8208;&#960; functional molecular liquids (FMLs) are of interest for fabricating soft electronic devices due to their fluidic nature and innate optoelectronic functions from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety. However, predictable development of alkyl&#8208;&#960; FMLs with the desired liquid and optoelectronic properties is challenging. A series of alkyl&#8211;distyrylbenzene (DSB) liquids was studied in terms of the substituent position effect by attaching 2&#8208;octyldodecyl chains at (2,4&#8208;), (2,5&#8208;), (2,6&#8208;), and (3,5&#8208;). The effect of the alkyl chain length was investigated by attaching 2&#8208;hexyldecyl, 2&#8208;decyltetradecyl (C10C14), and 2&#8208;dodecylhexadecyl at the (2,5&#8208;) substituent position. The 2,5C10C14 substituent pattern constructed a superior alkyl&#8211;DSB liquid with a lower viscosity, intrinsic optical properties, and high thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stabilities. The discovered 2,5&#8208;C10C14 was applied to dicyanostyrylbenzene and comparable liquid physical and optical superiorities were confirmed. This molecular design is useful for creating alkyl&#8208;&#960; FMLs with the aforementioned advantages, which are applicable for deformable and flowable optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoreactivity Driven by Excited State Aromaticity Gain or Antiaromaticity Relief</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gain of aromaticity or relief of antiaromaticity along a reaction path are important factors to consider in mechanism studies. Analysis of such changes along potential energy surfaces has historically focused on reactions in the electronic ground state (S0) but can also be utilized for excited states. In the lowest &#960;&#960;* states the electron counts for aromaticity and antiaromaticity follow Baird&#8217;s rule where 4n &#960;&#8208;electrons indicate aromaticity and 4n+2 &#960;&#8208;electrons antiaromaticity. Yet, there are also cases where H&#252;ckel&#8217;s rule plays a role in the excited state. The electron count reversals of Baird&#8217;s rule compared to H&#252;ckel&#8217;s rule explain many altered physicochemical properties upon excitation of (hetero)annulene derivatives. Here we illustrate how gain of excited state aromaticity (ESA) and relief of excited state antiaromaticity (ESAA) impact on photoreactivity and photostability. Emphasis is placed on recent findings supported by results of quantum chemical calculations, and photoreactions in a wide variety of areas are covered.</dc:description>

To enable crosslinking of the cages and subsequent network formation, we used homodifunctionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains terminally substituted with bipyridines as ligands for the Pd6L4 corners. The encapsulation of guest molecules into supramolecular self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels, as well as ultrasound&#8208;induced disassembly of the cages with release of their cargo, is presented in addition to their characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, rheology, and comprehensive small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. The constrained geometries simulating external force (CoGEF) method and barriers using a force&#8208;modified potential energy surface (FMPES) suggest that the cage&#8208;opening mechanism starts with the dissociation of one pyridine ligand at around 0.5 nN. We show the efficient sonochemical activation of the hydrogels HG1&#8208;6, increasing the non&#8208;covalent guest&#8208;loading of completely unmodified drugs available for release by a factor of ten in comparison to non&#8208;crosslinked, star&#8208;shaped assemblies in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>N2 Reduction versus H2 Evolution in a Molybdenum&#8208; or Tungsten&#8208;Based Small&#8208;Molecule Model System of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity between the reduction of dinitrogen (N2RR) and the evolution of hydrogen (HER) is investigated experimentally and by DFT calculations based on Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;based model systems. Moreover, possible reaction mechanisms for N2RR, as well as for HER, are determined and discussed in detail.







Abstract
Molybdenum dinitrogen complexes have played a major role as catalytic model systems of nitrogenase. In comparison, analogous tungsten complexes have in most cases found to be catalytically inactive. Herein, a tungsten complex was shown to be supported by a pentadentate tetrapodal (pentaPod) phosphine ligand, under conditions of N2 fixation, primarily catalyzes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in contrast to its Mo analogue, which catalytically mediates the nitrogen&#8208;reduction reaction (N2RR). DFT calculations were employed to evaluate possible mechanisms and identify the most likely pathways of N2RR and HER activities exhibited by Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;pentaPod complexes. Two mechanisms for N2RR by PCET are considered, starting from neutral (M(0) cycle) and cationic (M(I) cycle) dinitrogen complexes (M=Mo, W). The latter was found to be energetically more favorable. For HER three scenarios are treated; that is, through bimolecular reactions of early M&#8208;NxHy intermediates, pure hydride intermediates or mixed M(H)(NxHy) species.

         <title>Stable Organic Radicals Participation in Charge Transfer: A New Strategy toward Molecular Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable organic radicals can serve as ideal building blocks for the construction of molecular functional materials due to their unique open&#8208;shell structures. In this Concept, both recent experimental progress and design strategies of stable organic radicals participating in charge transfer as open&#8208;shell donors, acceptors, and dimers to construct functional materials are discussed.







Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer (CT) engineering with inter&#8208;/intramolecular CT interactions by simple compositions has emerged as a universal and efficient way to construct organic functional materials. Stable organic radicals with unique physicochemical properties that cannot be realized in closed&#8208;shell molecules, have been widely demonstrated to be ideal building blocks to construct versatile organic CT materials. This concept article provides a brief overview of the advances in the design, structure and property of stable organic radicals&#8208;based CT molecular functional materials, and the strategy for the generation of these materials is also highlighted. First, radicals are introduced as open&#8208;shell donors or acceptors, with a focus on their importance and uniqueness in improving electrical, magnetic and optical properties of CT functional materials. Additionally, CT interactions in stable radical dimers and trimers are further discussed systematically. Finally, the challenges are summarized and perspectives for future development of stable organic radicals&#8208;based CT functional materials are provided.

         <title>Divergent Construction of N&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Indole as the&#160;Nitrogen Source Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An Ag/Au catalyzed divergent cascade reaction of alkyne embedded diazoketones with indoles has been described. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction goes through a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of an in situ formed isobenzopyrylium intermediate with indole, followed by a sequential retro&#8208;Michael addition/carbene N&#8208;H insertion process to give the benzo[i]phenanthridines products with gold catalysis; whereas a dearomatization/rearomatization sequence occurs favourably when the reaction is catalyzed by a silver catalyst, delivering benzo[b]carbazoles in generally high to excellent yields. Notably, this is a rare example of using indole as the dienophile for cycloaddition with the isobenzopyrylium species, providing a concise and practical approach for the selective construction of N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with structural diversity and broad functional group compatibility.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The relationship between the overall electronic structure of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and the arrangement of their constituent elements is of fundamental importance. Establishing rational design guidelines for conjugated hydrocarbons with narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps is useful to develop near&#8208;infrared (NIR) responsive dyes and redox&#8208;active materials. Here, we describe the synthesis and properties of three conjugated hydrocarbons, i.e., an indenonaphthoperylene, an indenoterrylene, and a diindenoterrylene. These molecules exhibit NIR absorption despite the absence of significant antiaromaticity and diradical character. Notably, the indenonaphthoperylene exhibits red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emission in the 620&#8211;850 nm region. The indenoterrylene and the diindenoterrylene exhibit NIR absorption tailing to 870 and 940 nm, respectively. Moreover, the effect of the &#960;&#8208;extension of indenoperylene is disclosed in order to propose guidelines for achieving a narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap with negligible antiaromaticity and diradical character.</dc:description>

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Evolution Control and Luminescence Regulation in Multiple&#8208;Site Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have shown great potential in separation, sensing and host&#8208;guest chemistry, however, the pre&#8208;design of HOFs remains challenging due to the uncertainty of solvents' participation in framework formation. Herein, the polarity&#8208;evolution&#8208;controlled framework/luminescence regulation was firstly demonstrated based on multiple&#8208;site hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks. Several distinct HOFs were prepared by changing bonding modes of building units via the evolution of electrostatic forces induced by various solvent polarities. High&#8208;polar solvents with strong electrostatic attraction to surrounding units showed the tendency to form cage structures, while low&#8208;polar solvents with weak electrostatic attraction only occupy hydrogen&#8208;bond sites, conducive to the channel formation. Furthermore, the conformation of optical building unit can be adjusted by affecting the solvent polarity, generating different luminescence outputs.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have shown great potential in separation, sensing and host-guest chemistry, however, the pre-design of HOFs remains challenging due to the uncertainty of solvents' participation in framework formation. Herein, the polarity-evolution-controlled framework/luminescence regulation was firstly demonstrated based on multiple-site hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks. Several distinct HOFs were prepared by changing bonding modes of building units via the evolution of electrostatic forces induced by various solvent polarities. High-polar solvents with strong electrostatic attraction to surrounding units showed the tendency to form cage structures, while low-polar solvents with weak electrostatic attraction only occupy hydrogen-bond sites, conducive to the channel formation. Furthermore, the conformation of optical building unit can be adjusted by affecting the solvent polarity, generating different luminescence outputs. These results pave ways for the rational design of ideal HOFs with on-demand framework regulation and luminescence properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bifunctional Ru&#8208;Cluster&#8208;Decorated Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2 Hybrid Catalyst Synergistically Promotes NaBH4 Hydrolysis and Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic synergy: A well&#8208;dispersed Ru&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;decorated Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2 hybrid catalyst is constructed by steps of electroless plating, calcination and chemical reduction methods. The resulting catalyst exhibits excellent NaBH4 hydrolysis and electrocatalytic HER activity, which is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Ru clusters with Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2, and the large surface area exposed more active sites.







Abstract
Developing a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst for hydrolysis of metal hydrides and spontaneous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is essential for substituting conventional fuels for H2 production. Herein, Ru&#8208;cluster&#8208;modified Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2 supported on nickel foam (Ru/Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2@NF) is constructed by electroless deposition, calcination and chemical reduction. The catalyst exhibits an excellent hydrogen generation rate (HGR) of 4989&#8197;mL&#8201;min&#8722;1 
 and good reusability, superior to most previously reported catalysts. Besides, Ru/Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2@NF displays a prominent hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic capability with a low overpotential of 153.0&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (50.5&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a small Tafel slope of 40.0&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term stability (100&#8197;h@10&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in 1.0&#8197;M KOH. The excellent catalytic H2 generation capacity benefits from the rapid charge transfer promoted by metallic Co3B, the synergistic catalytic effect of Co3B&#8722;Co(OH)2 and Ru clusters, and the unique composite structure favorable for solute transport and gas emission.

         <title>Azatriseptanes: Strained Framework Analogs of [7,7,7]Circulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain on the properties: A [7,7,7]circulene analog, azatriseptane, has been synthesized, and its highly strained structure confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and computational studies. The distortion of the typical propeller&#8208;like conformation that is observed for triarylamine significantly affects the &#960;&#8208;electronics as well as the inherent self&#8208;assembly properties of these bridged systems.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of heptagon&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic compounds are essential for understanding the effect of negative curvature on carbon allotropes such as fullerenes and graphenes that have applications in functional organic materials. However, owing to the synthetic difficulties in functionalizing and embedding seven&#8208;membered rings, these strain&#8208;challenged structures are relatively unexplored. We report here the synthesis, characterization, and properties of a triarylamine core bridged with ethano chains at the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;positions. In doing so, we provide access to the first heterocycle containing three fused heptagon rings with a nitrogen at its core (BATA&#8208;NHAc). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and DFT calculations revealed a remarkably strained structure wherein two of the bridged aryl units approach coplanarity, while the third ring is twisted out of plane at 70&#176;. UV&#8208;vis and emission spectroscopies identify red&#8208;shifted absorption and concentration&#8208;dependent emission profiles, respectively, as a result of the unique conformation and self&#8208;assembly properties of BATA&#8208;NHAc. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry shows a decrease in the oxidation potential for BATA&#8208;NHAc in comparison to the non&#8208;bridged analog. This study opens new avenues in understanding the structure&#8211;property relationships of curved &#960;&#8208;aromatics and the construction of &#960;&#8208;frameworks of increasing complexity.

Driven by renewable solar energy, photocatalytic CO hydrogenation offers a promising way to synthesize valuable hydrocarbon chemicals. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202891), M. Zhong and co&#8208;workers show that an efficient photochemical and photothermal synergy between the nearby catalytic and plasmonic centers can accelerate the reaction. By using Co&#8722;Fe5C2 on a TiC photocatalyst, a 59&#8201;% C2+ selectivity and a 30&#8201;% CO conversion were obtained at the high GHSV of 12&#8201;000&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Synthesis of Efficient and Stable Tetrabutylammonium Copper Halides with Dual Emissions for Warm White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A warm welcome for a WLED: The synthesis of single&#8208;component phosphor, tetrabutylammonium copper halides, with dual broad&#8208;band emission (494 and 654&#8197;nm), high photoluminescent (PL) quantum yield (93.7&#8201;%) and large Stokes shift (150&#8197;nm) is reported. The resulting diodes emitted white light with a high color rendering index of 89 and correlated color temperature (CCT) of 4516&#8197;K.







Abstract
In order to achieve a high color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) and low correlated color temperature (CCT) indoor lighting, single&#8208;component phosphors with broad&#8208;band dual emission are in high demand for white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, phosphors with such fluorescent properties are rare at present. Herein, we report a facile solid&#8208;state chemical method for the synthesis of single&#8208;component phosphor with broad&#8208;band emission and a large Stokes shift that can meet the requirements of future white&#8208;light sources. These new tetrabutylammonium copper halides phosphors have excellent warm white emission characteristics, and their luminescence peaks are located at 494 and 654&#8197;nm. The optimized photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield can reach 93.7&#8201;%. The typical CIE coordinate of the as&#8208;fabricated WLED is at (0.3620, 0.3731) with a CRI of 89 and low CCT of 4516&#8197;K.

Isocyanide&#8208;based Multicomponent Reactions in a new light! A review about challenges, potentialities, new trends, and future directions of exploiting isocyanide unique reactivity features under visible light irradiation.







Abstract
Isocyanide&#8208;based multicomponent reactions claim a one century&#8208;old history of flourishing developments. On the other hand, the enormous impact of recent progresses in visible light photocatalysis has boosted the identification of new straightforward and green approaches to both new and known chemical entities. In this context, the application of visible light photocatalytic conditions to multicomponent processes has been promoting key stimulating advancements. Spanning from radical&#8208;polar crossover pathways, to photoinduced and self&#8208;catalyzed transformations, to reactions involving the generation of imidoyl radical species, the present literature analysis would provide a general and critical overview about the potentialities and challenges of exploiting isocyanides in visible light photocatalytic multicomponent reactions.

Primary resource: Hypervalent iodine&#8208;based aminating reagents containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group can be used for the &#945;&#8208;amination of simple carbonyl compounds such as esters, amides, and ketones in the presence of a lithium base. The (diarylmethylene)amino groups of the products can be readily modified, thus providing access to primary amines and diarylmethylamines.

Experimental mechanistic investigations indicate that this amination proceeds through a unique radical coupling of an &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical with an iminyl radical; they are generated through a single&#8208;electron transfer between a lithium enolate and the hypervalent iodine reagent.

         <title>Yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C Nanocomposites as a Heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like Catalyst for Organic Dye Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MB and PMS are absorbed by the Fe3O4/C shell and subsequently diffuse into the interior cavity of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites. PMS enter the catalyst and interact with active sites on the shell and in the core. Co2+ and Fe2+ in the catalyst can activate PMS to generate SO4&#8901;&#8722;. Meanwhile, OH&#8722;/H2O will be oxidized by SO4&#8901;&#8722; to &#8901;OH, generating H+ while consuming OH&#8722;. SO4&#8901;&#8722;, &#8901;OH and 
, resulting from a typical chain reaction, will interact with MB and breakdown it to intermediates CO2 and H2O.







Abstract
The yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites with Co3O4 as the core, Fe3O4/C as the shell, and a cavity structure were synthesized by the hard template method. The physical and chemical properties of the composites were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, TGA, XPS, BET, and VSM. The specific surface area of yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites is 175.9&#8197;m2&#8197;g&#8722;1, showing superparamagnetic properties. The yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites were used as heterogeneous Fenton catalysts to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade MB, which showed high catalytic degradation performance. The degradation rate of MB reached 100&#8201;% within 30&#8197;min under the circumstances of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites dosage of 0.1&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1, the PMS dosage of 1.0&#8197;g&#8201;L&#8722;1, the initial MB concentration of 100&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1, an initial pH of 5.5, and a temperature of 30&#177;2&#8201;&#176;C. The enhanced catalytic performance of the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the two catalytically active materials and the middle cavity. The effects of different operating parameters and co&#8208;existing anion species on MB degradation were also investigated. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis and quenching experiments confirmed that the formation of SO4&#8901;&#8722; in the yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C/PMS system contributes to MB degradation. In addition, yolk&#8208;shell Co3O4@Fe3O4/C nanocomposites can be easily separated from the pollutant solution under the action of an external magnetic field, and the degradation rate of MB can still reach 98&#8201;% after five cycles, indicating that it has good stability and reusability and has broad application prospects in the field of water purification.

         <title>Confinement of Assemblies of Peptides by Chemical Reactions in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confinement of peptide assemblies by chemical reactions in a specific location of living cells is a big challenge. This article introduces the peptide self&#8208;assembly triggered by chemical factors inside cancer cells, which could be helpful in designing functional materials selectively for cancer therapy, drug delivery, and biological imaging.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of peptides plays an important role in optics, catalysis, medicine, and disease treatment. In recent years, peptide&#8208;based materials have exhibited great potential for cancer therapy and disease imaging due to their excellent biocompatibility, structural tenability, and ease of functionality. Peptides could self&#8208;assemble into diverse nanostructures in&#8197;vivo triggered by endogenous stimuli, which initiated chemical reactions and self&#8208;assembled to achieve desired biological functions in the tumor microenvironment. This concept introduces the utilization of endogenous triggers to construct functional nanostructures in&#8197;vivo and their corresponding biological applications. After briefly discussing the representative example of chemical reactions induced self&#8208;assembly of peptides in the living system, we describe the several stimuli triggered self&#8208;assembly for constructing therapeutic assemblies and serving as an imaging probe. Finally, we give a brief outlook to discuss the future direction of this exciting new field.

         <title>Ability of Azathiacyclen Ligands To Stop Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Induced Production of Reactive Oxygen Species: [3N1S] Is the Right Donor Set</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Speedy silencer: Five 12&#8208;membered macrocycles ranging from the [4N] to the [1N3S] binding set were challenged for their ability to stop and prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species induced by the Cu(A&#946;) complex, where A&#946; is the Alzheimer&#8208;related peptide. The most appropriate ligand was [3N1S], which combines redox silencing of the copper ion with the speed of Cu removal from A&#946;.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that leads to the progressive and irreversible loss of mental functions. The amyloid beta (A&#946;) peptide involved in the disease is responsible for the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) when bound to Cu ions. A therapeutic approach that consists of removing Cu ions from A&#946; to alter this deleterious interaction is currently being developed. In this context, we report the ability of five different 12&#8208;membered thiaazacyclen ligands to capture Cu from A&#946; and to redox silence it. We propose that the presence of a sole sulfur atom in the ligand increases the rate of Cu capture and removal from A&#946;, while the kinetic aspect of the chelation was an issue encountered with the 4N parent ligand. The best ligand for removing Cu from A&#946; and inhibiting the associated ROS production is the 1&#8208;thia&#8208;4,7,10&#8208;triazacyclododecane [3N1S]. Indeed the replacement of more N by S atoms makes the corresponding Cu complexes easier to reduce and thus able to produce ROS on their own. In addition, the ligand with three sulfur atoms has a weaker affinity for CuII than A&#946;, and is thus unable to remove Cu from CuA&#946;.

     alt="Ability of Azathiacyclen Ligands To Stop Cu(A&#946;)-Induced Production of Reactive Oxygen Species: [3N1S] Is the Right Donor Set"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speedy silencer&lt;/b&gt;: Five 12-membered macrocycles ranging from the [4N] to the [1N3S] binding set were challenged for their ability to stop and prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species induced by the Cu(A&#946;) complex, where A&#946; is the Alzheimer-related peptide. The most appropriate ligand was [3N1S], which combines redox silencing of the copper ion with the speed of Cu removal from A&#946;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that leads to the progressive and irreversible loss of mental functions. The amyloid beta (A&#946;) peptide involved in the disease is responsible for the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) when bound to Cu ions. A therapeutic approach that consists of removing Cu ions from A&#946; to alter this deleterious interaction is currently being developed. In this context, we report the ability of five different 12-membered thiaazacyclen ligands to capture Cu from A&#946; and to redox silence it. We propose that the presence of a sole sulfur atom in the ligand increases the rate of Cu capture and removal from A&#946;, while the kinetic aspect of the chelation was an issue encountered with the 4N parent ligand. The best ligand for removing Cu from A&#946; and inhibiting the associated ROS production is the 1-thia-4,7,10-triazacyclododecane [3N1S]. Indeed the replacement of more N by S atoms makes the corresponding Cu complexes easier to reduce and thus able to produce ROS on their own. In addition, the ligand with three sulfur atoms has a weaker affinity for Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; than A&#946;, and is thus unable to remove Cu from CuA&#946;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Four &#960;&#8208;extended phosphindolizine derivatives have been newly synthesized and characterized. We express these compounds as four hayabusa (falcons) that are taking off from a nest (shown lower right), which indicates the dibenzo[b,e]phosphindolizines reported previously. We also describe the weak luminescence of one compound (shown upper left) as shining under the sun. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Tsurusaki, K.

         <title>Promoting Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction by Tuning the Properties of Cocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR) is an effective strategy because it affords the conversion of CO2 into useful carbon feedstocks by using sunlight and water. The Review by Y. Negishi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203387) summarizes recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CRR. This review could serve as a general guideline to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.

         <title>Dispersibility of TiO2 Nanoparticles in Less Polar Solvents: Role of Ligand Tail Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover feature shows a schematic impression of our study on the dispersibility of TiO2 nanoparticles in less polar solvents. For ligand tail structures, there is a huge gap between saturated stearyl groups (depicted as waxes) and unsaturated oleyl groups (depicted as olives), even though there is very little difference in their molecular structures. In this study, we have synthesized two different ligands to bridge shores that are close yet far apart. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Okada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203608).

         <title>The Effect of Mesogenic Coronas on the Type and Anisotropy of Gold Nanoparticle Superlattices: When Can the Tail Wag the Dog?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticles coated with forked rod&#8208;like bimesogen ligands formed two close&#8208;packed 3D lattices, HCP and FCC. The former had partially oriented nematic&#8208;like mesogens. Geometric analysis of these and other superlattice structures produced rules to help design nanoparticle coronas giving rise to desired isotropic and anisotropic plasmonic superlattices.







Abstract
The correlation between the size of nanoparticles, the structure and shape of mesogenic ligands and the ensuing assembly behaviour is not really understood. Closer inspection shows very surprising features. Here, 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;nm gold nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized, and grafted with a forked ligand containing two rod&#8208;like mesogens in its branches: one cholesterol, the other with azobenzene. The 4&#8208;nm NPs also contained n&#8208;hexylthiol as co&#8208;ligand. They were found to form a FCC cubic superlattice, whereas the 2&#8208;nm NPs form hexagonal HCP with weak birefringence, hence with partially oriented ligands. The structures were compared with those of related systems containing a range of different azobenzene&#8208;to&#8208;cholesterol ratios, all giving body&#8208;centred tetragonal superlattices with various degrees of anisotropy. Geometric analysis is presented in terms of the asphericity of the NPs&#8217; surroundings, requirement for space&#8208;filling and structural anisotropy. Some general rules are derived to help design the soft corona around the NPs in order to obtain superlattices with the desired structure and anisotropy.

         <title>Triple Thorpe&#8211;Ingold Effect in the Synthesis of 18&#8208;Membered C3 Symmetric Lactams Stacking as Endless Supramolecular Tubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon slow injection of the linear H&#8722;[NH&#8722;CHR&#8722;CH2&#8722;CH=CH&#8722;CO]3&#8722;OPfp TFA salt precursors to a solution of NMM at room temperature, the corresponding macrocycles are formed in moderate to excellent yields when the R groups are hydrogen or larger substituents respectively. The resulting symmetric macrolactams stack as endless parallel nanotubes in crystals even when the R groups are increasingly bulky.







Abstract
Three C3 symmetric macrolactams were very efficiently cyclized from their linear precursors. Adequately located substituents are responsible for the enhancement of reactivity that is not observed in the unsubstituted parent. DFT calculations show that the properly folded cyclization precursor, the reactive conformer, is more populated than other conformers, leading to a decrease of free energy of activation. The crystal structure of the ring substituted with three very bulky esters indicates that tubular stacking is preserved.

         <title>Controlled Hydrolysis of Phosphate Esters: A Route to Calixarene&#8208;Supported Rare&#8208;Earth Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ln&#8208;based controlled hydrolysis in a phosphorylated&#8208;calix[4]arene results in the cleavage of three out of the eight P&#8722;OEt bonds, forming a hydrolyzed phosphoryl&#8208;calix[4]arene ligand (H3LHPO). The chelating nature of H3LHPO traps the LnIII species in the form of [LnIII(LHPO)((EtO)2P(O)OH)]2 (Ln=La, Dy, Tb, Gd), with the Dy derivative showing slow relaxation of the magnetization.

Phosphate ester bonds are widely present in nature (e.&#8201;g. DNA/RNA) and can be extremely stable against hydrolysis without the help of catalysts. Previously, we showed how the combination of phosphoryl and calix[4]arene moieties in the same organic framework (LPO) allows isolation of single lanthanide (Ln) metal ions as [LnIII(LPO)2](O3SCF3)3. Here we report how by controlling the reaction conditions a new hydrolyzed phosphoryl&#8208;calix[4]arene ligand (H3LHPO) is formed as a result of LnIII&#8208;mediated P&#8211;OEt bond cleavage in three out of the eight possible sites in LPO. The chelating nature of H3LHPO traps the LnIII species in the form of [LnIII(LHPO)((EtO)2P(O)OH)]2 dimers (Ln=La, Dy, Tb, Gd), where the Dy derivative shows slow magnetization relaxation. The strategy presented herein could be extended to access a broader library of hydrolyzed platforms (HxLHPO; x=1&#8211;8) that may represent mimics of nuclease enzymes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ln-based controlled hydrolysis&lt;/b&gt; in a phosphorylated-calix[4]arene results in the cleavage of three out of the eight P&#8722;OEt bonds, forming a hydrolyzed phosphoryl-calix[4]arene ligand (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;HPO&lt;/sub&gt;). The chelating nature of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;HPO&lt;/sub&gt; traps the Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; species in the form of [Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;HPO&lt;/sub&gt;)((EtO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P(O)OH)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ln=La, Dy, Tb, Gd), with the Dy derivative showing slow relaxation of the magnetization.

         <title>AuNP&#8208;Modulated qPCR: An Optimized System for Detecting MIR Biophotons Released in DNA Replication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATP, the cell energy currency mostly produced by mitochondria, is conventionally regarded as releasing heat to drive biological reactions and processes. By employing dNTPs (i.&#8201;e., energy molecules that have an identical way of storing/releasing energy to ATP), we demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis can release photons with a specific mid&#8208;infrared frequency to efficiently drive DNA replication. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Jiang, B. Song, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203513).

         <title>Dioxygen Binding is Controlled by the Protein Environment in Non&#8208;Heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate Oxygenases &#8211; A Study on Histone Demethylase PHF8 and an Ethylene Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigates dioxygen binding and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) coordination by two model non&#8208;heme Fe(II)/2OG enzymes: a class 7 histone demethylase (PHF8) that catalyzes the hydroxylation of its H3K9me2 histone substrate leading to demethylation reactivity and the ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE) that catalyzes two competing reactions of ethylene generation and substrate L&#8208;Arg hydroxylation. Although both enzymes initially bind 2OG using an off&#8208;line 2OG coordination mode, in PHF8, the substrate oxidation requires a transition to an in&#8208;line mode, whereas EFE is catalytically productive for ethylene production from 2OG via the off&#8208;line mode. We utilized classical molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) MD and QM/MM metadynamics simulations to reveal that it is the dioxygen binding process and, ultimately, the protein environment that control the formation of the in&#8208;line Fe(III)&#8208;OO&#8208;. intermediate in PHF8 and the off&#8208;line Fe(III)&#8208;OO&#8208;. intermediate in EFE.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Hydrogen Bonds with Different Binding Modes: the Acceptor &#8220;Rules&#8221; but the Donor &#8220;Chooses&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This computational work studies the different hydrogen bond (HB) binding modes that can be established between neighbouring HB donors and acceptors in structures with relevance in catalysis and biology. To analyse the electronic effect on the s&#8208;hole, HB donors unsubstituted and with two different substituents, an electron withdrawing (EWG), and an electron donating (EDG) group, were studied. Upon complexation, three different binding modes were observed: bifurcated, parallel, and zigzag. It was found that, as a general trend, HBs within parallel pattern are the strongest followed by those within bifurcated and zigzag binding modes, leading to a &#8216;competition&#8217; between the last two. &#160;Similar patterns and trends have been found in experimental structures found in a search within the CSCD. In conclusion, even though the HB acceptors &#8220;rule&#8221; the pattern and strength of the HB interactions within the dimers, when there is an option for different binding modes within a particular dimer, the HB donors &#8220;choose&#8221; the type of binding established.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The management of persistent postoperative pain still remains a clinical challenge currently. Although ropivacaine (RVC) is widely used for postoperative analgesia as a local anesthetic, the short half&#8208;life makes it difficult to achieve the desired duration of analgesia.&#160;Herein, a novel RVC sustained&#8208;release microspheres encapsulated by zeolite imidazole framework&#8208;8 (RVC@ZIF&#8208;8) was synthesized for the first time, which prolonged the sustained&#8208;release of RVC and decreased the resulting drug toxicity.&#160;RVC can continuously release in vitro for at least 96 h with high drug loading of 30.6% and RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 had excellent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity.&#160;In sciatic nerve block model, the sensory block time of RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 was significantly prolonged&#160;compared with RVC,&#160;achieving more than 72 h post injection and no inflammation or lesion were found. Based on high drug loading, ideal sustained&#8208;release and superior biological safety, RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 will be a novel delivery material for local anesthetic with potential application.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Chelation of the Exotic Meitner&#8208;Auger Emitter Mercury&#8208;197m/g with Sulfur&#8208;rich Macrocyclic Ligands: Towards the Future of Theranostic Radiopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mercury&#8208;197m/g are a promising pair of radioactive isomers for incorporation into a theranostic as they can be used as a diagnostic agent using SPECT imaging and a therapeutic via Meitner&#8208;Auger electron emissions. However, the current absence of ligands able to stably coordinate 197m/gHg to a tumour&#8208;targeting vector precludes their use in vivo. To address this, we report herein a series of sulfur&#8208;rich chelators capable of incorporating 197m/gHg into a radiopharmaceutical. 1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecane (NS4) and its derivatives, (2&#8208;(1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecan&#8208;13&#8208;yl)acetic acid (NS4&#8208;CA) and N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecan&#8208;13&#8208;yl)acetamide (NS4&#8208;BA), were designed, synthesized and analyzed for their ability to coordinate Hg2+ through a combination of theoretical (DFT) and experimental coordination chemistry studies (NMR and mass spectrometry) as well as 197m/gHg radiolabeling studies and in vitro stability assays. The development of stable ligands for 197m/gHg reported herein is extremely impactful as it would enable its use for in vivo imaging and therapy, leading to personalized treatments for cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Conversion of Ketones into Blue&#8208;emitting Electron&#8208;deficient Benzofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel heavy metal&#8208;free and safe synthetic methodology enabling one&#8208;step conversion of ketones into corresponding 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrafluorobenzofurans (F4BFs) has been developed. The presented approach has numerous advantageous qualities, including utilization of readily available substrates, broad scope, scalability, and good reaction yields. Importantly, some of the benzofurans prepared by this method were heretofore inaccessible by any other known transformation. Importantly, furo[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines and heretofore unexplored difuro[2,3&#8208;c:3',2'&#8208;e]pyridazine can be prepared using this strategy. Spectroscopic studies reveal that for simple systems, absorption and fluorescence maxima fall within the UV spectral range, while &#960;&#8208;electron system expansion red&#8208;shifts both spectra. Moreover, the good fluorescence quantum yields observed in solution, up to 96%, are also maintained in the solid state. Experimental results are supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The presented methodology, combined with the spectroscopic characteristics, suggest the possibility of using F4BFs in the optoelectronic industry (i.e. Organic Light Emitting Devices (OLED), Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors (OFET), Organic Photovoltaics (OPV)) as inexpensive and readily available emissive or semiconductor materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of zigzag&#8208;edged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Z1&#8208;Z3) were synthesized from 2,12&#8208;dibromo&#8208;7,14&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;benzo[m]tetraphene (9) as a versatile building block. Their structures were unambiguously confirmed by laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, 1H NMR, Raman, and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies as well as scanning tunneling microscopy. The fingerprint vibrational modes were elucidated with theoretical support. The edge&#8208; and size&#8208;dependent optical properties were characterized by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Moreover, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy revealed distinct modulation of the photophysical properties upon &#960;&#8208;extension from Z1 to Z2, the latter having a gulf edge.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and characterization of a masked terminal nickel&#8208;oxide complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In exploring terminal nickel&#8208;oxo complexes, postulated to be the active oxidant in natural and non&#8208;natural oxidation reactions, we report the synthesis of the pseudo&#8208;trigonal bipyramidal NiII complexes (K)[NiII(LPh)(DMF)] (1[DMF]) and (NMe4)2[NiII(LPh)(OAc)] (1[OAc]) (LPh = 2,2',2''&#8208;nitrilo&#8208;tris&#8208;(N&#8208;phenylacetamide; DMF = N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide; &#8211;OAc = acetate)). Both complexes were characterized using NMR, FT&#8208;IR, ESI&#8208;MS, and X&#8208;ray crystallography, showing the LPh ligand to bind in a tetradentate fashion, together with an ancillary donor. The reaction of 1[OAc] with peroxyphenyl acetic acid (PPAA) resulted in the formation of [(LPh)NiIII&#8211;O&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;OAc]2&#8211;, 2, that displays many of the characteristics of a terminal Ni=O species. 2 was characterized by UV&#8208;Vis, EPR, and XAS spectroscopies and ESI&#8208;MS. 2 decayed to yield a NiII&#8208;phenolate complex 3 (through aromatic electrophilic substitution) that was characterized by NMR, FT&#8208;IR, ESI&#8208;MS, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. 2 was capable of hydroxylation of hydrocarbons and epoxidation of olefins, as well as oxygen atom transfer oxidation of phosphines at exceptional rates. While the oxo&#8208;wall remains standing, this complex represents an excellent example of a masked metal&#8208;oxide that displays all of the properties expected of the ever elusive terminal M=O beyond the oxo&#8208;wall.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Desymmetric Conjugate Addition of Cyclobutanone: An Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of [6,5,4]&#8208;Fused Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first organocatalytic, non&#8208;destructive desymmetrisation of 3&#8208;substituted cyclobutanone followed by intramolecular cyclisation has been described.

         <title>Progresses of in situ H2O2 generation and corresponding pollutant removal applications: a review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation from oxygen and water enables a sustainable environment to operate in an effective and green energy&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion way, which has attracted increasing interest in the fields of energy production and environment treatment. In light of this, tremendous progresses and developments have been made during the past decades in catalytic H2O2 production for pollutant removal from three perspectives including photocatalysis, electrocatalysis or chemical activation. Herein, we critically review the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments over various procedures of H2O2 generation and its further application, with the existence of photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, and catalysts, respectively. Benefiting from extensively experimental and theoretical investigations, the performance and stability of H2O2 generation and its utilization can be maneuvered by devising catalytic platform based on numerous catalysts with predominant electronic, chemical and physical properties, which endow the catalysts with efficient electrons transportation, abundant active sites, and sufficient oxygen adsorption for H2O2 generation. Furthermore, this review also discusses the formation mechanism of H2O2 by 2e&#8208;ORR and 2e&#8208;WOR, as well as its functional process of activating and removing pollutants, and summarizes the design principles of various catalysts by focusing on the formation of H2O2. We finally highlight the specific challenges and prospects related to the utilization of catalysts and envision the possible future development trends in the fields of pollutant removal.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;healable and stretchable elastomeric material is essential for the development of flexible electronics devices to ensure their stable performance. In this study, a strain sensor (PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT) composed of self&#8208;repairable crosslinked elastomer substrate (PIH2T1&#8208;tri, containing multiple reversible repairing sites such as disulfide, imine, and hydrogen bonds) and conductive layer (carbon nanotube, CNT) was prepared. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri elastomer had excellent self&#8208;healing ability (healing efficiency = 91%). It exhibited good mechanical integrity in terms of elongation at break (672%), tensile strength (1.41 MPa). The Young&#8217;s modulus (0.39 MPa) was close to that of human skin. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT sensor also demonstrated effective self&#8208;healing function for electrical conduction and sensing property. Meanwhile, it had high sensitivity (gauge factor (GF) = 24.1), short response time (120 ms), and long&#8208;term durability (4000 cycles). This study offers a novel self&#8208;healable elastomer platform with carbon based conductive components to develop flexible strain sensors towards high performance soft electronics.</dc:description>

With RGD peptidomimetics straight to the target: Improving the conjugation strategy of small molecular integrin ligands increases cancer targeting and cytotoxicity of small molecule drug conjugates addressing integrin &#945;V&#946;3 expressing melanoma cells.







Abstract
Small molecule&#8208;drug conjugates (SMDCs) mimicking the RGD sequence (&#8208;Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;) with a non&#8208;peptide moiety require a pharmacophore&#8208;independent attachment site. A library of 36 sulfonamide&#8208;modified RGD mimetics with nM to pM affinity for integrin &#945;V&#946;3 was synthesized and analysed via DAD mapping. The best structure of the conjugable RGD mimetic was used and a linker was attached to an aromatic ring by Negishi cross&#8208;coupling. The product retained high affinity and selectivity for integrin &#945;V&#946;3. The conjugable RGD mimetic was then attached to an enzymatically cleavable GKGEVA linker equipped with a self&#8208;immolative PABC and the antimitotic drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The resulting SMDC preferred binding to integrin &#945;V&#946;3 over &#945;5&#946;1 in a ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;4519 (ELISA) and showed selectivity for &#945;V&#946;3&#8208;positive WM115 cells over &#945;V&#946;3&#8208;negative M21&#8208;L cells in the in&#8197;vitro cell adhesion assay as well as in cell viability assays with a targeting index of 134 (M21&#8208;L/WM115).

         <title>New Fields, New Opportunities and New Challenges: Circularly Polarized Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy, namely CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF, is proposed to generate organic emitters with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), and narrowband emission, by merging the CPL optical property and multiple resonance (MR) induced TADF characteristic into one molecule. This approach is propitious to the direct realization of 3D and wide color gamut display applications in the future.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials that concurrently exhibit high efficiency and narrowband emission are extremely promising applications in 3D and wide color gamut display. By merging the CPL optical property and multiple resonance (MR) induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristic into one molecule, a new strategy, namely CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF, is proposed to generate organic emitters with CPL activity, TADF and narrowband emission. High&#8208;performance red, green and blue CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF emitters have been developed following this strategy. Herein, the present status and progress of CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF materials in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is summarized. Finally, for this rapidly growing new research field, the future opportunities are forecasted and the present challenges are discussed.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Multifunctional Bioreducible Polymers for mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring opening polymerization of active ester&#8208;containing lipoic acid monomers generated poly(active ester)disulfide polymers. Mild and controlled aminolysis of poly(active ester)disulfides yields multifunctional polymers bearing cationic, ionizable, and hydrophobic derivatives. Combining multifunctional polymers with mRNA yields distinct nanoparticles that are capable delivering EGFP and OVA mRNA to dendritic cells in&#8197;vitro.







Abstract
Bioreducible polymeric mRNA carriers are an emerging family of vectors for gene delivery and vaccine development. A few bioreducible systems have been generated through aqueous&#8208;phase ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lipoic acid derivatives, however this methodology limits hydrophobic group incorporation and functionality into resulting polymers. Herein, a poly(active ester)disulfide polymer is synthesized that can undergo facile aminolysis with amine&#8208;containing substrates under stoichiometric control and mild reaction conditions to yield a library of multifunctional polydisulfide polymers. Functionalized polydisulfide polymer species form stable mRNA&#8208;polymer nanoparticles for intracellular delivery of mRNAs in&#8197;vitro. Alkyl&#8208;functionalized polydisulfide&#8208;RNA nanoparticles demonstrate rapid cellular uptake and excellent biodegradability when delivering EGFP and OVA mRNAs to cells in&#8197;vitro. This streamlined polydisulfide synthesis provides a new facile methodology for accessing multifunctional bioreducible polymers as biomaterials for RNA delivery and other applications.

         <title>TEMPO&#8208;Modified Polymethacrylates as Mediators in Electrosynthesis: Influence of the Molecular Weight on Redox Properties and Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polymeric electrosynthesis mediators: Polymediators are soluble redox&#8208;active polymers applicable as catalysts in electrosynthesis. Their difference in size relative to typical product molecules enables recovery by dialysis or membrane filtration. Using anodic alcohol oxidation as an example, the relationship between the molecular weight of TEMPO&#8208;modified polymethacrylates and their catalytic properties was elaborated using cyclic voltammetry and preparative&#8208;scale electrolysis.







Abstract
Homogeneous catalysts (&#8220;mediators&#8221;) are frequently employed in organic electrosynthesis to control selectivity. Despite their advantages, they can have a negative influence on the overall energy and mass balance if used only once or recycled inefficiently. Polymediators are soluble redox&#8208;active polymers applicable as electrocatalysts, enabling recovery by dialysis or membrane filtration. Using anodic alcohol oxidation as an example, we have demonstrated that TEMPO&#8208;modified polymethacrylates (TPMA) can act as efficient and recyclable catalysts. In the present work, the influence of the molecular size on the redox properties and the catalytic activity was carefully elaborated using a series of TPMAs with well&#8208;defined molecular weight distributions. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the polymer chain length has a pronounced impact on the key&#8208;properties. Together with preparative&#8208;scale electrolysis experiments, an optimum size range was identified for polymediator&#8208;guided sustainable reaction control.

         <title>Synthesis and Crystal Structure of a New RTH&#8208;Type Precursor and Its Interlayer Expanded Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new RTH layer zeolite L was synthesized and converted into RTH topology upon calcination. The IEZ&#8208;RTH zeolite was formed by modification with the silylation agent diethoxydimethylsilane under acidic conditions. The new zeolites have a large specific surface area of 552&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 188&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Two dimensional zeolites have drawn a lot of attention due to their structural diversity and chemical composition, which can be used to obtain 3D zeolites, for which there is no direct synthesis. Here, a new layer silicate zeolite L was synthesized using the N, N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;(2&#8208;methyl)&#8208;benzimidazolium as the organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) in the presence of fluoride. Structure determination by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the pure silica precursor with five&#8208;ring pores in the crystalline sheets is composed of the rth layer stacking along the (001) direction in an &#8230;AAAA&#8230; sequence with SDA+ cations and F&#8722; residing within the interlayer spaces. Variable temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) results showed that the new layer could transform into a 3D RTH topology structure at 350&#8201;&#176;C via 2D&#8208;3D topotactic transformation. Furthermore, a new 3D zeolite material is obtained by treating the original layer with a diethoxydimethylsilane agent under hydrochloric acid condition (HCl&#8722;DEDMS). Based on the PXRD results and the original layer structure, the new 3D zeolite structure expanding the rth layer with another Si atom is constructed, which possesses a 10&#215;8&#215;6 channel system. It displays a high BET surface area of 188&#8197;cm3/g with an external surface area of 130&#8197;cm3/g. The structure and textural properties pave a way for potential catalytic applications. The research not only provides a new layered zeolite, broadening the 2D zeolite framework types, but also allows for the discovery of a new stable 3D zeolite expanding the RTH structure with Si atom, which hasn't been reported yet.

         <title>Diastereoselectivity Switch During Alkene Reductions: Diastereodivergent Syntheses of Molecular Fossils via MHAT or Homogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sixteen geosteranes were synthesized in up to 57% overall yields in four steps harnessing the olefin cross&#8208;metathesis (OCM) and Metal hydride H atom transfer (MHAT) or homogeneous hydrogenation reactions as key steps. Drawing on this strategy, the diastereomeric ratio (d.r.) reached up to 24:1 for the thermodynamic isomer and 7:1 for the other isomer in the hydrogenation step. In a geological sample from northeast Brazil, we confirmed the putative structures previously assumed as methyl 2&#8208;(3&#945;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)acetate (3Aa), methyl 2&#8208;(3&#946;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)acetate (3Ba), and methyl 6&#8208;(3&#946;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)hexanoate (3Bc), as well three new molecular fossils of approximately 120 million years old. We also proved the migration marking ability of those geosteranes during an oil migration event, which suggests their aptitudes as molecular odometers. Our approach demonstrated swiftness and effectiveness in preparing a molecular library of geological biomarkers would also be appropriate to generate stereochemical diversity in molecular libraries for medicinal chemistry and natural product anticipation.</dc:description>

         <title>C vs. O Protonation in Zincate Anions: A Simple Gas&#8208;Phase Model for the Surprising Kinetic Stability of Organometallics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For better understanding the intrinsic reactivity of organozinc reagents, we have examined the protolysis of the isolated zincate ions Et3Zn&#8722;, Et2Zn(OH)&#8722;, and Et2Zn(OH)2Li&#8722; by 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol in the gas phase. The protonation of the hydroxy groups and the release of water proceed much more efficiently than the protonation of the ethyl groups and the liberation of ethane. Quantum&#8208;chemical computations and statistical&#8208;rate theory calculations fully reproduce the experimental findings and attribute the lower reactivity of the more basic ethyl moiety to higher intrinsic barriers, which override the thermodynamic preference for its protonation. Thus, our minimalistic gas&#8208;phase model provides evidence for the intrinsically low reactivity of organozinc reagents toward proton donors and helps to explain their remarkable kinetic stability against moisture and even protic media.</dc:description>

         <title>Columnar Liquid Crystalline Glasses by Combining Configurational Flexibility with Moderate Deviation from Planarity: Extended Triaryltriazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triply phenanthryl&#8208; and [4]helicenyl&#8208;substituted triazine&#8208;hexaalkyl esters with short alkyl chains show glass transitions conveniently above room temperature within the hexagonal columnar liquid crystalline state, resulting in a solid columnar order at room temperature. As the hexagonal columnar mesophase is easily aligned with the director perpendicular to a solid substrate, such glassy columnar liquid matrices are aimed at for the orientation of guest emitters, to obtain anisotropic emission. A condition for face&#8208;on alignment on substrates are attainable melting and clearing temperatures, which is achieved with the moderately nonplanar [4]helicenyl derivatives in spite of their short alkyl periphery. An unusual phase transition between two columnar mesophases of same hexagonal symmetry, but very different long&#8208;distance regularity of the column lattice, is found in one phenanthryl homolog.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Electron Transfer Dynamics of Organic Polymer Nanoparticles with Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

We demonstrated that GO/RGO could improve the ordering and planarity of p3ht chains as well as the formation of p3ht NPs, and confirmed the effects of GO/RGO on the fluorescence and carrier transport dynamics of p3ht NPs by using femtosecond fluorescence upconversion and transient absorption (TA) techniques.

Efficient electron transfer may promote the applications of p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO composites in organic polymer solar cells and photocatalysis. Moreover, RGO had stronger interfacial interactions and more matched conduction band energy levels with p3ht NPs than GO did, which implied that p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO might have greater application values than p3ht NPs&#8208;GO.</dc:description>

         <title>Melt Castable Derivatives of Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the search for high&#8208;performance and environmentally friendly energetic materials, derivatization of known materials is an often&#8208;applied concept to fulfill modern day demands. It is surprising that the long know pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) has only been derivatized to a limited extent. PETN shows a brought application in energetic materials or in pharmaceutics. In this work the PETN backbone is modified by introducing nitramine, ionic nitramine, amine, ionic amine and tetrazole functionalities. The obtained and structural similar compounds allow good comparability and insights into functional group effects on sensitivity, thermal behavior and performance. The functionalization is resulting in melting points in the range of 64 to 126 &#176;C. Some compounds are therefore potential candidates to replace toxic TNT.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysical Characterization of Isoguanine in a Prebiotic&#8208;Like Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is intriguing how a mixture of organic molecules survived the prebiotic UV fluxes and evolved into the actual genetic building blocks. Scientists are trying to shed light on this issue by synthesizing nucleic acid monomers and their analogues under prebiotic Era&#8208;like conditions and by exploring their excited state dynamics. To further add to this important body of knowledge, here we disclose new insights into the photophysical properties of protonated isoguanine, an isomorph of guanine, using steady&#8208;state and femtosecond broadband transient absorption spectroscopies, and quantum mechanical calculations. Protonated isoguanine decays in ultrafast time scales following 292 nm excitation, consistently with the barrierless paths connecting the bright S1 (&#960;&#960;*) state with different internal conversion funnels. Complementary calculations for neutral isoguanine predict similar photophysical properties. Our results demonstrate that protonated isoguanine can be considered photostable in contrast to protonated guanine, which exhibits 40&#8208;fold longer excited state lifetimes.</dc:description>

         <title>Induced CPL&#8208;active Materials based on Chiral Supramolecular Co&#8208;assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted much interest due to its potential applications on chiral photonic techniques and optoelectronic materials science. As known, dissymmetry factor (gem) of CPL is one essential factor for evaluating the features of CPL&#8208;active materials. Much attention has focused on how to increase the gem value, which is one of the most important issues for CPL practical applications. Recently, more and more works have demonstrated that chiral supramolecular could provide the significant strategy to improve the gem value through the orderly helical superstructure of chiral building blocks. Normally, this kind of chiral supramolecular assembly process can be accompanied by chirality transfer and induction mechanism, which can promote the amplification effect on the induced CPL of achiral dyes. In this review, we fully summarized recent advances on the induced CPL&#8208;active materials of chiral supramolecular co&#8208;assemblies, their applications in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) and current challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures and Supramolecular Properties of Inclusion Complexes of Anthracene&#8208;Triptycene Nanocages with Fullerene Guests and Their Dynamic Motion as Molecular Gyroscopes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of anthracene&#8208;triptycene nanocages having various peripheral substituents formed inclusion complexes with fullerene guests via multipoint CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis provided the first direct structural evidence of the inclusion complex formation and the unique dynamic behavior of the included C60 molecule in the cage cavity, and showed that the complex behaved as a supramolecular gyroscope.







Abstract
Three derivatives of macrocyclic cage compounds consisting of diarylanthracene and triptycene units were synthesized. These nanocages formed host&#8208;guest complexes with C60 and other fullerene guests as confirmed by 1H NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy. The association constant of the mesityl and 2,4,6&#8208;tributoxyphenyl derivatives with C60 was determined to be 2.2 &#215; 104&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1, which was larger than that of the pentafluorophenyl derivative. Direct experimental evidence of the complexation was obtained by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis: the guest C60 molecule was included in the cavity via multipoint CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. Dynamic disorders of the included C60 molecule in variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray analysis indicated uniaxial motion, such as gyroscopic motion. The unique dynamic behavior of the spherical C60 rotor anchored by the cage stator via CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in the crystal, as well as substituent effects on the association properties, are discussed with the aid of DFT calculations.

         <title>Development of Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Organogelators from Cyclic &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid: Effect of Stereochemistry and their Application on Visual Chiral Recognition of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low molecular weight organogelators derived from chiral cyclic &#946;&#8208;amino acids were developed and the effect of their stereochemistry on gelation behavior was investigated. After characterization of the gelators and resultant xerogels, the prepared chiral gel was further applied to the visual chiral recognition of two enantiomers of amines.







Abstract
This study reports the formation of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators based on carboxylic acids derived from chiral cyclic&#946;&#8208;amino acids. The effect of their stereochemistry on the gelation of organic solvents was investigated, and their assemblies with the intermolecular interactions in the xerogels were proposed via infrared spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and crystallographic details of the related model compounds. The effect of the alkyl chain length on the gelators was studied, and they were applied to the chiral recognition of amines. Only one diastereomeric salt with amines afforded gels, whereas the others resulted in precipitates. Chiral recognition was also achieved in the gel state, and the appearance of the as&#8208;prepared gel changed upon the addition of each amine enantiomer, thus enabling the visual detection of their chirality.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH heterostructure has been constructed through a facile MOF&#8208;engaged strategy, and it exhibits significantly boosted electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is widely explored in supercapacitors on account of its high capacity, adjustable composition and easy synthesis process. Unfortunately, solitary LDH still has great limitations as an electrode material due to its shortcomings, such as poor conductivity and easy agglomeration. Herein, nanoflakes assembled NiCo&#8208;LDH hollow nanocages derived from a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) precursor are strung by CuO nanorods formed from etching and oxidation of copper foam (CF), forming hierarchical CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH heterostructures. The as&#8208;synthesized CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF shows a large capacitance (5607&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), superior rate performance (88.3&#8201;% retention at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and impressive cycling durability (93.1&#8201;% capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles), which is significantly superior to control CuO/CF, CuO@ZIF&#8208;67/CF, NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF and Cu(OH)2@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF electrodes. Besides, an asymmetrical supercapacitor consists of CuO@NiCo&#8208;LDH/CF and activated carbon displays a maximum energy density of 47.3&#8197;Wh kg&#8722;1, and its capacitance only declines by 6.8&#8201;% after 10000 cycles, demonstrating remarkable cycling durability. The advantages of highly conductive and robust CuO nanorods, MOF&#8208;derived hollow structure and the core&#8208;shell heterostructure contribute to the outstanding electrochemical performance. This synthesis strategy can be extended to design various core&#8208;shell heterostructures adopted in versatile electrochemical energy storage applications.

         <title>Long&#8208;Acting Insulin&#8208;Zwitterionic Polymer Conjugate Mitigates Hypoglycemia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the discovery of insulin has radically improved the treatment and prognosis of diabetes, bringing it from an incurable disease to a manageable chronic disease, it faces problems of the short half&#8208;life and poor stability during its clinical use. Zwitterionic polymer shows unique properties of antifouling and low immunogenicity. By conjugation with zwitterionic polymer, stabilily and pharmacokinetics of insulin are both improved greatly. Most importantly, this insulin&#8208;zwitterionic polymer conjugate significantly decreases the incidence of hypoglycemia.







Abstract
Insulin, a main medication to control glycemia of type&#8197;1 and advanced type&#8197;2 diabetes, faces problems of a short half&#8208;life and poor stability during its clinical use. Zwitterionic polymer shows unique properties of antifouling and low immunogenicity. Here, we have synthesized a new insulin&#8208;zwitterionic polymer conjugate (INS&#8208;PMPC) through grafting&#8208;from strategy by controlled radical polymerization. Apart from showing excellent stability upon mechanical agitation, the resulting INS&#8208;PMPC conjugate provided over 20&#8197;h of glycemic control due to improved pharmacokinetics in diabetic mice with one single subcutaneous injection. Most importantly, this insulin&#8208;zwitterionic polymer conjugate significantly decreases the incidence of hypoglycemia.

         <dc:description>
A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed interrupted domino reaction of 2&#8208;azido sulfoximines with 1&#8208;iodoalkynes affords fused triazolyl&#8208;containing benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides in good to excellent yields. The substrate scope is broad and the functional group tolerance high. Mechanistic studies suggest a reaction pathway via copper &#960;&#8208;complexes and a consecutive oxidative coupling of a relevant iodinated triazole as intermediate.







Abstract
Copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed domino reactions of 2&#8208;azido sulfoximines with 1&#8208;iodoalkynes yield fused triazolyl&#8208;containing benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides. The protocol features the synthesis of two fused heterocyclic rings in one step with good to excellent yields and a broad functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic investigations indicate that a copper &#960;&#8208;complex initiates a cycloaddition and oxidative C&#8722;N coupling reaction sequence. The results suggest an interrupted domino process involving an iodinated triazole as a key intermediate.

A riot of color: We have developed eight D&#8208;D&#8208;A type carbazole derivatives capable of exhibiting full&#8208;color solid&#8208;state emission. Notably, this is the first time that a dicyano&#8208;functionalized triphenylamine&#8208;modified carbazole derivative has not only displayed noteworthy aggregation&#8208;induced near&#8208;infrared emission, but also achieved the rare red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared mechano&#8208;fluorochromism with high contrast beyond 100&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the red&#8208;emissive luminophore has potential applications in cell imaging and photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The preparation of multifunctionalized luminophores with full&#8208;color emission based on an identical core skeleton is a significative but challenging research topic. In this work, eight donor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;D&#8208;A)&#8208;type luminogens based on a central carbazole core bearing a C6 hydrocarbon chain were designed by using different kinds of donor and acceptor units on the left and right, and synthesized in good yields. These D&#8208;D&#8208;A carbazole derivatives display deep&#8208;blue, sky&#8208;blue, cyan, green, yellow&#8208;green, yellow, orange and red fluorescence in the solid state, achieving full&#8208;color emission covering the whole visible light range under UV light illumination. Notably, the dicyano&#8208;functionalized triphenylamine&#8208;containing carbazole derivative exhibits rare aggregation&#8208;induced near&#8208;infrared emission and red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared mechano&#8208;fluorochromism with high contrast beyond 100&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the red&#8208;emissive luminogen can serve as a potential candidate for cell imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT). This work not only provides reference for the construction of full&#8208;color emissive systems but also opens a new avenue to the preparation of multifunctionalized luminophores capable of simultaneous application in near&#8208;Infrared mechanical&#8208;force sensors and PDT fields.

         <title>N,N&#8208;Diphenyl Dihydrophenazines: Using &#960;&#8208;Extension to Access Dicationic Multifunctional Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended dihydrophenazines represents a new promising pathway for the stabilization of the radical and dicationic states of these molecules. This could in turn open for brand new applications of this class of molecules in many different fields, from molecular actuators to electrochromic devices.







Abstract
Dihydrophenazines are receiving increasing attention due to applications in numerous fields of chemistry, from light emission to organo&#8208;photocatalysis. Despite this growing interest and numerous works involving the preparation of radical cations based on this scaffold, the isolation and study of the aromatic dications obtained by 2 electron oxidation of dihydrophenazines is still mostly unexplored. From this point of view, along with the substitution at the N atoms generally used to tune dihydrophenazine properties, the &#960;&#8208;extension of the phenazine core could play a crucial role in making dicationic states accessible. This could result in an extension of the knowledge on these elusive dications and in potentially highly interesting applications ranging from material science to molecular actuators.

         <title>Zinc Substituted Myoglobin&#8210;Albumin Fusion Protein: A&#160;Photosensitizer for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Myoglobin combined with human serum albumin (Mb&#8208;HSA) can be produced using yeast Pichia pastoris as a host strain, with secretion into the culture medium. This Mb&#8208;HSA fusion protein possesses identical O2 binding affinity to that of naked Mb. The Mb unit is reconstituted with a zinc(II) protoporphyrin IX, yielding (zinc substituted Mb)&#8208;HSA, ZnMb&#8208;HSA. The photophysical property and singlet O2 generation ability of ZnMb&#8208;HSA are equivalent to those of ZnMb. In vitro cell experiments revealed that ZnMb&#8208;HSA acts as a superior photosensitizer for photodynamic cancer therapy. It is noteworthy that ZnMb&#8208;HSA shows long circulation lifetime in vivo.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (Cp* = &#951;5&#8209;C5Me5) (A), Cp&#8217;&#8217; = &#951;5&#8208;C5H3tBu2&#8208;1,3 (B)) are excellent building blocks for polymeric assemblies in supramolecular chemistry in combination with coinage metal salts of weakly coordinating anions such as AgSbF6. Adding rigid aromatic dinitriles ortho/meta/para&#8208;(NC)2C6H4 in a one&#8208;pot reaction between [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] and AgSbF6 leads to various coordination polymers (CPs) by a three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly. The sterical demand of the differently substituted cyclopentadiene ligands as well as the rigid constitution of the isomeric dinitriles (NC)2C6H4 play a key role in the formation of the isolated CPs. All CPs were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the horizon of bio&#8208;inspired catalyst design with tactical incorporation of drug molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of potent H2 production catalysts is a key aspect in our journey toward the establishment of a sustainable carbon&#8208;neutral power infrastructure. Hydrogenase enzymes provide the blueprint for designing efficient catalysts by the rational combination of central metal core and protein scaffold&#8208;based outer coordination sphere (OCS). Traditionally, a biomimetic catalyst is crafted by including natural amino acids as OCS features around a synthetic metal motif to functionally imitate the metalloenzyme activity. Here, we have pursued an unconventional approach and implanted two distinct drug molecules (isoniazid and nicotine hydrazide) at the axial position of a cobalt core to create a new genre of synthetic catalysts. The resultant cobalt complexes are active for both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic H2 production in near&#8208;neutral water, where they significantly enhance the catalytic performance of the unfunctionalized parent cobalt complex. The drug molecules showcased a dual effect as they influence the catalytic HER by improving the surrounding proton relay along and exerting subtle electronic effects. The isoniazid&#8208;ligated catalyst C1 outperformed the nicotine hydrazide&#8208;bound complex C2, as it produced H2 from water (pH 6.0) at a rate of 3960 s&#8208;1 while exhibiting Faradaic efficiency of about 90%. This strategy opens up newer avenues of bio&#8208;inspired catalyst design beyond amino acid&#8208;based OCS features.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>For decades there were many attempts to dispense with stoichiometric amounts of metal reagents for the synthesis of secondary alcohols. In 2021, the synthetic results of Newman and collaborators pioneered a synthesis still with metals, but not as reactants, but as catalytic engines. Here is a description by means of Density Functional Theory calculations of how this process can occur, and an attempt is made to shed light on the mechanism that facilitates the attainment of secondary alcohols, emphasizing the eternal cross&#8208;coupling debate of whether the catalytically active species is Ni(0) or they are really taking shortcuts following the course of Ni(II). Effective Orbital analyses give a clear picture. In addition, this paper gives insight into not only the nature of the ligands of the metal catalyst, but also the role of the base.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanochemical Fries Rearrangement: Manipulating Isomer Ratios in the Synthesis of p&#8208;Hydroxyacetophenone at Different Scales</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we present the first mechanochemical Fries rearrangement for the industrially important synthesis of para hydroxyacetophenone, inside a ball mill and a twin&#8208;screw extruder. Our approach leads to a yield of 62&#160;% in as little as 90 minutes while liquid&#8208;assisted grinding can shift the isomer ratio resulting in an excess of the desired para product. The multigram scale&#8208;up via extrusion leads to 61&#160;% yield in only three minutes while completely avoiding solvents.

Our approach leads to a yield of 62&#160;% in as little as 90 minutes while liquid-assisted grinding can shift the isomer ratio resulting in an excess of the desired para product. The multigram scale-up via extrusion leads to 61&#160;% yield in only three minutes while completely avoiding solvents. The extrusion temperature can even further be reduced by combining extrusion with a subsequent ageing step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling long&#8208;lived polymeric room temperature phosphorescence material in&#160;abominable&#160;solvent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long&#8208;lived RTP&#160;materials have drawn more attention due to their convenient preparation process and equally efficient phosphorescence performance in recent years. As the polymer matrix is sensitive to air and humidity, some non&#8208;covalent interactions in the matrix are easily decomposed in water or air, which means that it is difficult for this material to be stored stably for a long time in the atmospheric environment or under harsh conditions. In this work, polymer powder mBPipQ contains aromatic and piperidine rings that are designed and synthesized successfully. Then the polymer is uniformly dispersed into epoxy resin matrix to form long&#8208;lived polymeric RTP material with efficient afterglow&#160;properties. The stiff backbone structure of mBPip and dense molecular arrangement of epoxy resin provide a rigid environment to stabilize triplet excitons, the RTP performance is greatly enhanced. The lifetime of mBPipQ in epoxy resin is 2 times higher than that of small molecule chromophore in that one. Interestingly, after soaking in strong acid or alkali solution for 10 days, the material can still emit stable and efficient long&#8208;lived phosphorescence. It is thanks to the hard matrix after full curing, which can provide a protective layer to prevent external quenchers from interfering with phosphorescence emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoactive organo&#8208;sulfur polymers for hydrogen generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of photoactive polymeric organo&#8208;sulfur (POS) materials. These polymers absorb light in the ultraviolet/visible and near&#8208;infrared region of the solar spectrum, and upon irradiation, they reduce water to hydrogen (H2). The decoration of POS materials with nitrile (&#8208;CN) groups is found to be the critical factor for enhanced interactions with the co&#8208;catalyst, Ni2P, leading to greater H2 evolution rates compared to the nitrile&#8208;free POS material.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Natural machinery such as proteins and enzymes can bind substrates and perform intricate functions on these molecules. This behavior is mediated by highly ordered but conformationally flexible structures dictated through favorable intra&#8208; and intermolecular interactions. Metallosupramolecular architectures (MSAs) function as synthetic machinery that are responsive to their environment, and display similar, but less impressive, abilities to their biological counterparts. Natural and synthetic systems share the properties of molecular recognition and catalysis facilitated through the often complex structures of these architectures.

         <title>Cooperative Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation of Electron&#8208;Deficient Arenes via Catalyst Activation with Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes with aldehydes through ''catalyst activation'' is presented. Through hydrogen bonding interactions, the solvent 1,1,1,3,3,3, &#8208;hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) interacted with the added Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst pTSA.H2O, increasing its acidity. This activated catalyst enabled the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of electron&#8208;neutral as well as electron&#8211;deficient arenes. Strongly electron withdrawing arenes including arenes with multiple halogen atoms, NO2, CHO, CO2R, and CN, groups acted as efficient nucleophiles in this reaction. DFT studies reveal multiple roles of solvent HFIP viz; increasing the Br&#248;nsted acidity of the catalyst pTSA&#8226;H2O, and stabilization of the transition states through a concerted pathway enabling the challenging reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Acetals and Ketals from Aldehydes and Silylenolethers without the Use of Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use light instead of acids: Silylenolethers derived from aldehydes and ketones as well as aldehydes themselves react efficiently to give acetals in good to excellent yields. The substrate range with respect to both aldehydes and alcohols is broad, and acid&#8208; and hydrogen&#8208;labile protecting groups are tolerated.







Abstract
Acetals and ketals are among the most important protecting groups for carbonyl compounds. A new method for acetalization and ketalization by means of photoredox catalysis has been developed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use light instead of acids&lt;/b&gt;: Silylenolethers derived from aldehydes and ketones as well as aldehydes themselves react efficiently to give acetals in good to excellent yields. The substrate range with respect to both aldehydes and alcohols is broad, and acid- and hydrogen-labile protecting groups are tolerated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetals and ketals are among the most important protecting groups for carbonyl compounds. A new method for acetalization and ketalization by means of photoredox catalysis has been developed. A biscyanolated perylene bisimide is used as an electron-poor photocatalyst, together with green light (525&#8197;nm LED). Silylenolethers derived from aldehydes react efficiently to give acetals in good to excellent yields. A broad substrate range was shown with respect to both the aldehydes and the alcohols. The functional group tolerance is high; in particular, acid- and hydrogen-labile protecting groups are tolerated. Aldehydes can also be directly and selectively converted into the respective acetals. Only ketones must be converted to their silylenolethers before ketalization. This photocatalytic method works without any use of acids or photoacids, and does not need any additives or H-atom transfer reagents. Hence, it broadens the substrate scope and repertoire of photoredox catalysis with respect to carbonyl chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light Thiyl Radical&#8208;Mediated Desilylation of Arylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commercially available and cheap disulfides proved to be excellent thiyl&#8208;radical sources for the mild desilylation of arylsilanes under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This method relying in a radical chain mechanism shows a broad applicability and functional group tolerance, allowing for the effective reaction of simple arylsilanes, as well as complex structures and therapeutic derivatives.







Abstract
A straightforward, visible&#8208;light triggered desilylation of arylsilanes by thiyl radicals is presented. Silyl groups are often used to block a reactive position in multi&#8208;step organic synthesis, for which a mild cleavage at a late&#8208;stage will provide new possibilities and disconnection routes by CAr&#8722;Si cleavage/deprotection. In this work, commercially available and cheap disulfides are employed for the first time in this type of C(sp2)&#8208;Si bond cleavage reactions. Thus, upon irradiation with visible&#8208;light, homolytic cleavage of the disulfide give rise to the corresponding thiyl radical that allows for a radical chain mechanism. This methodology represents a mild, fast and simple approach suitable for a broad variety of simply substituted arylsilanes. Moreover, the procedure could be easily extended to natural products and therapeutic derivatives, showing its robustness and synthetic application potential.

         <title>Disentangling the Effect of Pressure and Mixing on a Mechanochemical Bromination Reaction by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical bromination of a heterocyclic sulfoximine is studied by ex&#8208; and in&#8197;situ solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. A selective and fast reaction is observed in a mixer mill, which can alternatively be induced either using the centrifugal pressure of magic&#8208;angle spinning or by solely magnetic stirring the solid entities.







Abstract
Mechanical forces, including compressive stresses, have a significant impact on chemical reactions. Besides the preparative opportunities, mechanochemical conditions benefit from the absence of any organic solvent, the possibility of a significant synthetic acceleration and unique reaction pathways. Together with an accurate characterization of ball&#8208;milling products, the development of a deeper mechanistic understanding of the occurring transformations at a molecular level is critical for fully grasping the potential of organic mechanosynthesis. We herein studied a bromination of a cyclic sulfoximine in a mixer mill and used solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for structural characterization of the reaction products. Magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) was applied for elucidating the product mixtures taken from the milling jar without introducing any further post&#8208;processing on the sample. Ex situ 13C&#8208;detected NMR spectra of ball&#8208;milling products showed the formation of a crystalline solid phase with the regioselective bromination of the S&#8208;aryl group of the heterocycle in position 4. Completion is reached in less than 30&#8197;minutes as deduced from the NMR spectra. The bromination can also be achieved by magnetic stirring, but then, a longer reaction time is required. Mixing the solid educts in the NMR rotor allows to get in&#8197;situ insights into the reaction and enables the detection of a reaction intermediate. The pressure alone induced in the rotor by MAS is not sufficient to lead to full conversion and the reaction occurs on slower time scales than in the ball mill, which is crucial for analysing mixtures taken from the milling jar by solid&#8208;state NMR. Our data suggest that on top of centrifugal forces, an efficient mixing of the starting materials is required for reaching a complete reaction.

         <title>Construction of TiO2/SrTiO3 Heterojunction Derived from Monolayer Ti3C2 MXene for Efficient Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile hydrothermal method has been applied for the in situ fabrication of TiO2/SrTiO3 heterojunction, using the monolayer Ti3C2 MXene as the template and reactant. It demonstrates that the optimization of half&#8208;reaction and overall water splitting reaction is dependent on the hydrothermal reaction time respectively.







Abstract
Construction of heterojunction at the atomic scale to ensure efficient charge separation for improvement of photocatalytic water splitting is challenging. Herein, a facile hydrothermal method has been applied for the in&#8197;situ fabrication of TiO2/SrTiO3 heterojunction, using the monolayer Ti3C2 MXene as the template and reactant. It is found that the sample with the hydrothermal reaction time of 60&#8197;min exhibits the highest H2 evolution rate with the sacrificial reagent, due to the efficient charge separation of TiO2/SrTiO3 heterojunction as Ti3C2 derivative. In addition, the sample shows the best overall water splitting performance at a hydrothermal reaction time of 120&#8197;min, where TiO2 is nearly converted to SrTiO3, due to the fast kinetic process and low structural defects of SrTiO3. This work not only provides a simple strategy for the fabrication of heterojunction photocatalysts but also demonstrates the difference in optimization of half&#8208;reaction and overall water splitting reaction.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclizative Borylation of Allenyl Ketones through Carbene Boryl Migratory Insertion: Access to Densely Substituted Furyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclizative borylation reaction of allenyl ketones has been developed. The transformation is based on carbene boryl migratory insertion using starting materials that are modularly assembled from raw building blocks. This borylation reaction is a reliable method to synthesize various borylated furans, from which previously hard&#8208;to&#8208;obtain tetra&#8208;substituted furans can be readily obtained.







Abstract
Herein the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclizative borylation of allenyl ketones with diboron compounds is reported which involves the carbene boryl migratory insertion as the key step. This reaction features mild conditions, good functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Thus, it represents an efficient methodology for the assembly of diverse tri&#8208;substituted furyl boronates. In addition, a series of transformations of the resultant multi&#8208;substituted furyl boronates were conducted to provide various densely substituted furan derivatives in good yields, further illustrating the potential synthetic utility of this methodology.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedent intermolecular n&#8594;&#960;* interactions with a designer multicarbonyl&#8208;containing macrocycle were revealed. The integrated cooperative C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions can drive self&#8208;assembly formation of functional nanotubes as demonstrated allowing for single&#8208;crystal chromatography separation of moving dyes.







Abstract
Towards unexplored intermolecular n&#8594;&#960;* interactions, presented herein are the synthesis, structure, self&#8208;assembly and function of a multicarbonyl&#8208;containing macrocycle calix[2]arene[2]barbiturate 1. X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction reveals the presence of Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions in CH2Cl2&#8834;1 host&#8208;guest complex and multiple intermolecular C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions between molecules 1 in crystalline state. The intermolecular C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions as attractive driving force led to unprecedented self&#8208;assembly of nanotube with diameter around 1.4&#8197;nm and inner surface engineered by aromatic rings. SEM and TEM images of the self&#8208;assembly of 1 demonstrated temperature&#8208;dependent morphologies which allows the observation of spheres at 25&#8201;&#176;C and rods at 0&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. XRD analysis indicated consistent hexagonal patterns in the self&#8208;assembly and single crystal lattice, indicating the nanotubes driven by C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions constitute the basic structural architectures of both aggregates. The nanoscopic tubes (pores) formed in the rodlike single crystal engendering the separation of moving dyes were preliminarily investigated by a single&#8208;crystal chromatography and crystal&#8208;packed column chromatography.

&lt;p&gt;The unprecedent intermolecular n&#8594;&#960;* interactions with a designer multicarbonyl-containing macrocycle were revealed. The integrated cooperative C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O interactions can drive self-assembly formation of functional nanotubes as demonstrated allowing for single-crystal chromatography separation of moving dyes.

         <title>Isomerically Pure Oxindole&#8208;Terminated Quinoids for n&#8208;Type Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistors Enabled by the Chlorination of Quinoidal Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of incorporating Cl atoms in the quinoidal core has been developed to control the configuration of quinoidal compounds. Unlike the reported configurational locking approaches, this strategy can simultaneously maintain low&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ensure favorable intermolecular packing. As a result, isomerically pure quinoids with high electron mobility can be obtained.







Abstract
Quinoidal compounds have great potential utility as high&#8208;performance organic semiconducting materials because of their rigid planar structures and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. However, the existence of E and Z isomers adversely affects the charge&#8208;transport properties of quinoidal compounds. In this study, three isomerically pure oxindole&#8208;terminated quinoids were developed by introducing chlorine atoms in the quinoidal core. The synthesized quinoids were confirmed to have a Z,Z configuration by means of 1H NMR spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Importantly, the strategy of chlorination allowed to maintain low&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital energy levels and ensure favorable intermolecular packing. Consequently, all three quinoidal compounds showed n&#8208;type transport characteristics in organic thin&#8208;film transistors, with electron mobilities up to 0.35&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which is the highest value reported to date for oxindole&#8208;terminated quinoids. Our study can provide new guidelines for the design of isomerically pure quinoids with high electron mobilities.

         <title>Green&#8208;Emissive Copper Nanocluster with Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced Emission for Selective Detection of Al3+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green&#8208;emissive copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) were synthesized at a relatively high reaction temperature (80&#8201;&#176;C) and an extended reaction time to 144&#8197;h. The photoluminescence of Cu NCs could be selectively enhanced by adding Al3+, attributed to their aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission features.







Abstract
Selective detection of Al3+ is of great significance both for the benefit of human health and environmental safety considerations. In this work, a sensitive and selective fluorescence assay for Al3+ was proposed based on the green&#8208;emissive Cu nanoclusters (Cu NCs). Different from the commonly reported works, the green emissive Cu NCs showed dual emission bands at 450 and 510&#8197;nm, attributed to the reaction product between polyvinyl pyrrolidone and ascorbic acid and the Cu core, respectively. Al3+ could induce the aggregation of Cu NCs by forming covalent bonds, which results in the enhancement of photoluminescence intensity. This enhancement phenomenon is rather selective to Al3+, which endows the detection in real samples. These results provide new insights for the fluorescence mechanisms of metal NCs, which also provided a functional luminescent material for various applications, such as chemical sensing, bioimaging and photoelectric devices.

H+ that exists in its thermodynamically metastable state is reported. The key to success was to employ a metal&#8208;complex&#8208;based scaffold with a small cavity within its structure. By sterically isolating Br&#248;nsted acid/base sites, anomalous behaviors of H+ were observed. In addition, the unique physical and chemical properties of the isolated sites were clarified.

         <title>A Cu+/Thiourea Dendrimer Achieves Excellent Cytosolic Protein Delivery via Enhanced Cell Uptake and Endosome Escape</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intracellular protein delivery has attracted considerable attentions in the development of protein&#8208;based therapeutics, however, the design of highly efficient materials for robust delivery of native proteins remains challenging. Here, we proposed a Cu+ &#8208;based coordination polymer for cytosolic protein delivery with high efficacy and robustness. The phenylthiourea grafted dendrimer was coordinated with cuprous ions to prepare the polymeric carrier, which efficiently bind cargo proteins via a combination of coordination, ionic and hydrophobic interactions. The incorporation of Cu+ ions in the polymer greatly improves its cellular uptake and endosomal escape. The cuprous&#8208;based coordination polymer successfully delivered a variety of structurally diverse proteins into various cell lines with reserved bioactivities. This study provides a new type of coordination polymers for cytosolic delivery of biomacromolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Widening the landscape of small molecule activation with gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes: a systematic study of E&#8208;H (E=O,N) bond, SO2 and N2O activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic features of gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes have been thoroughly explored. Their similarity with Group 14 dimetallenes and other metal&#8208;aluminyl complexes suggests that their reactivity with small molecules beyond carbon dioxide could be accessed. In this work, the reactivity of the [tBu3PAuAl(NON)] complex towards water, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide is computationally explored. The reaction mechanisms computed for each substrate strongly suggest that all activation processes are in principle experimentally feasible. Electronic structure analysis highlights that, in all cases, the reactivity is driven by the presence of the poorly polarized electron&#8208;sharing gold&#8208;aluminyl bond, which induces a radical&#8208;like reactivity of the complex towards all the substrates. A flat topology of the potential energy surface (PES) has been found for the reaction with N2O, where two almost isoenergetic transition states can be located along the same reaction coordinate with different geometries, suggesting that the N2O binding mode may not be a good indicator of the nature of N2O activation in a cooperative bimetallic reactivity. In addition, the catalytic potentialities of these complexes have been explored in the framework of nitrous oxide reduction and oxygen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer catalysis. The study reveals that the [tBu3PAuAl(NON)] complex might be an efficient catalyst towards oxidation of phosphines (and boranes) via N2O reduction. These findings underline recurring trends in the novel chemistry of gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes and call for experimental feedbacks.

The study reveals that the [tBu3PAuAl(NON)] complex might be an efficient catalyst towards oxidation of phosphines (and boranes) via N2O reduction. These findings underline recurring trends in the novel chemistry of gold-aluminyl complexes and call for experimental feedbacks.

         <title>A Bioactive Synthetic Outer&#8208;core Oligosaccharide Derived from a&#160;Klebsiella pneumonia Lipopolysaccharide for Bacteria Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is an urgent need for new treatment options for carbapenem&#8208;resistant&#160;Klebsiella pneumoniae&#160;(K. pneumoniae), which is a common cause of life&#8208;threatening&#160;hospital&#8208; and community&#8208;acquired infections. Prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination may offer an approach to control these infections, however, none has yet been approved for human use. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of an outer core tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharide derived from the lipopolysaccharide of&#160;K. pneumoniae. The oligosaccharides were equipped with an aminopentyl linker, which facilitated conjugation to the carrier proteins CRM197&#160;and BSA. Mice immunized with the glycoconjugate vaccine candidates elicited antibodies that recognized isolated LPS as well as various strains of&#160;K. pneumoniae.&#160;The successful preparation of the oligosaccharides relied on the selection of monosaccharide building blocks equipped with orthogonal hydroxyl and amino protecting groups. It allowed the differentiation of three types of amines of the target compounds and the installation of&#160;a crowded 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Dependent Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission of Janus Emulsion Surfactants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a novel stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescent material platform that relies on an evocation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) from tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based surfactants localized at one hemisphere of biphasic micro&#8208;scale Janus emulsion droplets. Dynamic alterations in the available interfacial area were evoked via surfactant&#8208;induced dynamic changes of the internal droplet morphology that can be modulated as a function of the balance of interfacial tensions of the droplet constituent phases. Thus, by analogy to a Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett trough that enables selective concentration of surfactants at a liquid&#8208;gas interface, we demonstrate here a method for a controllable modulation of the available interfacial area of surfactant&#8208;functionalized liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces. We show that a morphology&#8208;dependent alteration of the interfacial area can be used to evoke an optical signal, by selectively assembling synthesized TPE&#8208;based surfactants to the respective droplet interfaces. A trigger&#8208;induced increase in the concentration of TPE&#8208;based surfactants at the liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces results in an evocation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), inducing an up to 3.9&#8208;fold increase in the measured emission intensity of the droplets.</dc:description>

         <title>B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Ring Opening of Cyclic Amines with Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong boron Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 in combination with phenylsilane enables the regioselective cleavage of one out of two or three carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds in cyclic secondary and tertiary amines, respectively. This amine deconstruction extends to large saturated nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and the functional&#8208;group tolerance is good.







Abstract
Opening the ring of cyclic amines by regioselective fission of one of the carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds greatly expands the repertoire of available nitrogen&#8208;containing skeletons. Unlike approaches starting from cyclic tertiary amines, methods that can directly open secondary amines are still scarce. The present work discloses an efficient reductive ring opening of either of these cyclic amines using PhSiH3 under B(C6F5)3 catalysis. By this, the direct transformation of unstrained cyclic amines into the corresponding acyclic amines is achieved in a simple one&#8208;pot operation. A stepwise mechanism proceeding through the intermediacy of silylammonium ions followed by reductive cleavage of a carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond was experimentally verified.

         <title>Photoredox Catalyzed Single C&#8722;F Bond Activation of Trifluoromethyl Ketones: A Solvent Controlled Divergent Access of gem&#8208;Difluoromethylene Containing Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single and selective C&#8722;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones using visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis is achieved in a divergent fashion. Trapping of photo&#8208;catalytically generated difluoromethyl radical to various styrene derivatives benefitted with the formation of two essential classes of difluoromethyl&#8208;containing tetrahydrofuran&#8208;ring and linear ketones in a divergent fashion. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations strongly support the proposed mechanistic pathway for this novel transformation.







Abstract
Selective defluorinative functionalization of trifluoromethyl ketones is a long&#8208;standing challenge owing to the exhaustive mode of the process. To meet the demands for the installation of the gem&#8208;difluoromethylene unit for the construction of the molecular architectures of well&#8208;known pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, a distinct pathway is thereby highly desirable. Here, a protocol is introduced that allows the divergent synthesis of gem&#8208;difluoromethylene group containing tetrahydrofuran derivatives and linear ketones via single C&#8722;F bond activation of trifluoromethyl ketones using visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis in the presence of suitable olefins as trapping partner. The choice of appropriate solvent and catalyst plays a significant role in controlling the divergent behavior of this protocol. Highly reducing photo&#8208;excited catalysts are found to be responsible for the generation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl ketone (DFMK) radicals as the key intermediate via a SET process. This protocol also results in a high diastereoselectivity towards the formation of partially fluorinated cyclic ketal derivatives with simultaneous construction of one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;O bonds. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT calculations are performed to address the origin of diastereoselectivity as well as the divergence of this protocol.

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyridinium Salts via Annulation of Enamines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and facile synthesis of highly substituted pyridinium salts through the annulation of enamines with alkynes is reported herein. A Ag2CO3/HNTf2 synergistically acting catalyst system was developed and used in a condensation reaction between carbonyl substrates and propargylamine to afford structurally diverse pyridinium salts. A mechanistic investigation shows that this one&#8208;pot transformation proceeded via selective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of the in situ generated propargylenamine and protonolysis of the resulting vinyl&#8211;silver intermediate. The reaction conditions are mild, and the substrate scope is broad. During the cyclization, an unusual inversion of the normal reactivity of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Uniaxially Oriented Sub&#8208;5 nm Line Patterns of Hybrid Liquid Crystals Constructed by Perylene Diimide and Oligo(Dimethylsiloxane)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of sub&#8208;5 nm long&#8208;range ordered structures through self&#8208;assembly has received increasing attention. Herein, a series of ODMS&#8208;based thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs) containing perylene diimide (PDI) were designed and synthesized. These LCs can form ordered nanostructures with periodic sizes around 5 nm including smectic J (SmJ), oblique columnar (Colob), and hexagonal columnar (Colh) phases with change in the volume fraction of ODMS, where the layer spacing of the SmJ phase is less than 5 nm. Thin films with parallel oriented nanolines with line width less than 5 nm can be obtained on PDMS&#8208;modified silicon substrates by spin&#8208;casting and simple thermal annealing processes. Moreover, owing to the strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between PDI cores, these nanolines are long&#8208;range ordered with uniaxial orientation in relatively large areas (1.5&#215;1.5 &#956;m2) with over 300 continuous microdomains without pre&#8208;patterning. These nanostructures provide the possibility of preparing nanotemplates by oxygen plasma etching.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Construction of sub-5 nm long-range ordered structures through self-assembly has received increasing attention. Herein, a series of ODMS-based thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs) containing perylene diimide (PDI) were designed and synthesized. These LCs can form ordered nanostructures with periodic sizes around 5 nm including smectic J (SmJ), oblique columnar (Colob), and hexagonal columnar (Colh) phases with change in the volume fraction of ODMS, where the layer spacing of the SmJ phase is less than 5 nm. Thin films with parallel oriented nanolines with line width less than 5 nm can be obtained on PDMS-modified silicon substrates by spin-casting and simple thermal annealing processes. Moreover, owing to the strong &#960;-&#960; interaction between PDI cores, these nanolines are long-range ordered with uniaxial orientation in relatively large areas (1.5&#215;1.5 &#956;m2) with over 300 continuous microdomains without pre-patterning. These nanostructures provide the possibility of preparing nanotemplates by oxygen plasma etching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile synthesis of bis&#8208;pentafluoroarylated anthracene derivatives for n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistor applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diphenylanthracene (DPA) and its derivatives are promising semiconducting materials for p&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). In this study, to develop n&#8208;type semiconducting materials with an anthracene core, pentafluorobenzene was introduced into anthracene via C&#8211;H direct arylation, enabling the synthesis of various bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene (DPA&#8208;F) derivatives. The high reactivity of the pentafluorobenzene C&#8211;H bond allows direct arylation for synthesizing DPA&#8208;F derivatives in a single step. The introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing pentafluorophenyl groups provides the anthracene derivatives with n&#8208;type semiconducting properties, in contrast to the p&#8208;type properties of the parent DPAs. Among the synthesized compounds, 2,6&#8208;bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene shows a high electron mobility of 0.12 &#177; 0.02 cm2/Vs and an on/off ratio &gt;106 in OFETs. The high crystallinity results in the smooth electron transport. This study provides a facile synthetic method for n&#8208;type semiconducting materials and insights into the molecular design of the positional effects of aromatic substituents on anthracene.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal chemistry involves selective biocompatible reactions between functional groups that are not normally present in biology. It has been used to probe biomolecules in living systems, and has advanced biomedical strategies such as diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, challenges and opportunities encountered when translating in vitro bioorthogonal approaches to in vivo settings are presented with a focus on methods to deliver the bioorthogonal reaction components. These methods include metabolic bioengineering, active targeting, passive targeting, and simultaneously used strategies. The suitability of bioorthogonal ligation reactions and bond cleavage reactions for in vivo applications is critically appraised, and practical considerations such as the optimum scheduling regimen in pretargeting approach are discussed. Finally, we present our own perspectives for this area and identify what, in our view, are the key challenges that must be overcome to maximize the impact of these approaches</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Dynamics Determine Metal&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of metal&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex formation from imidazolium
salts in the presence of weak bases was investigated through theoretical methods. Quantum
chemical calculations revealed that the two bases considered here, sodium acetate and
trimethylamine, exhibiting similar pK a values, both facilitate the complex formation.
However, in contrast to experiments, these calculations show a slightly lower barrier with the
amine. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the ionic nature of the [AuCl2]&#8722; and
imidazolium ions, as well as the sodium acetate base keeps these species associated in
solution through ion pairing. This pre&#8208;association of the components produces those clusters
that are essential for the metal complex formation. The neutral amine, however, remains
mostly separated from the other reaction partners, making it a significantly less effective
base.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;triggered Modulation of Supramolecular Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamically controlling the supramolecular chirality is of great significance in development of functional chiral materials, which is thus essential for the specific function implementation. As an external energy input, light is remote and accurate for modulating chiral assemblies. In non&#8208;polarized light control, some photochemically reactive units (e.g., azobenzene, &#593;&#8208;cyanostilbene, spiropyran, anthracene, molecular motor, etc.) were designed to drive chiral transfer or amplification. Besides, photoexcitation induced assembly based physical approach was also explored recently to regulate supramolecular chirality beyond photochemical reactions. In addition, circularly polarized light (CPL) was applied to induce asymmetric arrangement of organic molecules and asymmetric photochemical synthesis of inorganic metallic nanostructures, in which both wavelength and handedness of CPL have effects on the induced supramolecular chirality. Although light&#8208;triggered chiral assemblies have been widely applied in photoelectric materials, biomedical fields, soft actuator, chiral catalysis and chiral sensing, there is a lack of systematic review on this topic. In this review, we summarized the recent studies and perspectives in the constructions and applications of light&#8208;responsive chiral assembled systems, aiming to provide better knowledge for the development of multifunctional chiral nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient methods for labeling aryl trifluoromethyl groups to provide novel radiotracers for use in biomedical research with positron emission tomography (PET) are keenly sought. We report a broad&#8208;scope method for labeling trifluoromethylarenes with either carbon&#8208;11 (t1/2 = 20.4 min) or fluorine&#8208;18 (t1/2 =109.8 min) from readily accessible aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts. In this method, the aryl(mesityl)iodonium salt is treated rapidly with no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [11C]CuCF3 or [18F]CuCF3. The mesityl group acts as a spectator allowing radiolabeled trifluoromethylarenes to be obtained with very high chemoselectivity. Radiochemical yields from aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts bearing either electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at meta&#8208; or para&#8208; position are good to excellent (67&#8211;96%). Ortho&#8208;substituted and otherwise sterically hindered trifluoromethylarenes still give good yields (15&#8211;34%). Substituted heteroaryl(mesityl)iodonium salts are also viable substrates. The broad scope of this method was further exemplified by labeling a previously inaccessible target, [11C]p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl boronic acid, as a potentially helpful labeling synthon. In addition, fluoxetine, leflunomide, and 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;4&#8208;aminopyridine, as examples of small drug&#8208;like molecules and candidate PET radioligands, were successfully labeled in high yields (69&#8211;81%).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Controlling aspects of the &#956;2&#8208;X&#8208; bridging anion in the metal&#8208;organic framework Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 [GaX(bdc)] (X&#8208; = (OH)&#8208; or F&#8208;, bdc2&#8208; = 1, 4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate) is shown to direct the temperature at which thermally induced breathing transitions of this framework occur. In&#8208;situ single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies reveal that substituting 20 % of (OH)&#8208; in [Ga(OH)(bdc)] (1) for F&#8208; to produce [Ga(OH)0.8F0.2(bdc)] (2) stabilises the large pore (lp) form relative to the narrow pore (np) form, causing a well&#8208;defined decrease in the onset of the lp to np transition at higher temperatures, and the adsorption/ desorption of nitrogen at lower temperatures through np to lp to intermediate (int) pore transitions. These in&#8208;situ diffraction studies have also yielded a more plausible crystal structure of the int&#8208;[GaX(bdc)]&#183;H2O phases and shown that increasing the heating rate to a flash heating regime can enable the int&#8208;[GaX(bdc)]&#183;H2O to lp&#8208;[GaX(bdc)] transition to occur at a lower temperature than np&#8208;[GaX(bdc)] via an unreported pathway.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Controlling aspects of the &#956;2-X- bridging anion in the metal-organic framework Ga-MIL-53 [GaX(bdc)] (X- = (OH)- or F-, bdc2- = 1, 4-benzenedicarboxylate) is shown to direct the temperature at which thermally induced breathing transitions of this framework occur.
