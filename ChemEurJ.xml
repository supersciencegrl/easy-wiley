         <title>Boosting the Oxygen Evolution Activity of FeNi Oxides/Hydroxides by Molecular and Atomic Engineering</title>

NiFe materials are the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for water oxidation, therefore, fine tuning their properties is the cornerstone to achieving more active and efficient catalysts. In this concept, we will review the recently emerged strategies to engineer them molecularly and atomically by introducing different vacancies, incorporating single atoms or by ligand functionalization.







Abstract
FeNi oxides/hydroxides are the best performing catalysts for oxidizing water at basic pH. Consequently, their improvement is the cornerstone to develop more efficient artificial photosynthetic systems. During the last 5&#8197;years different reports have demonstrated an enhancement of their activity by engineering their structures via: (1)&#8197;modulation of the number of oxygen, iron and nickel vacancies; (2)&#8197;single atoms (SAs) doping with metals such as Au, Ir, Ru and Pt; and (3)&#8197;modification of their surface using organic ligands. All these strategies have led to more active and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution rection (OER). In this Concept, we critically analyze these strategies using the most relevant examples.

         <title>Glycerol Oligomerization over Titania&#8208;Based Catalyst Compositions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modification of TiO2 with sulfonic groups causes the appearance of catalytic activity with the formation of a wide range of polyglycerides. Fabrication of a composite of sulfated titania with carbon nanotubes limits the spectrum of products with short&#8208;chain linear glycerides. Thus, it gives a promising way to obtain a selective catalyst for the processing of glycerol into short&#8208;chain polyglycerides.







Abstract
The possibility of using TiO2&#8208;based compositions: individual and sulfated titania, and their composites with carbon nanotubes as catalysts for glycerol oligomerization has been displayed. The effect of modification of TiO2 with sulfur and carbon nanotubes on acid&#8208;base and catalytic characteristics in the glycerol conversion was investigated. The activation of glycerol on the catalysts has been studied using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy. Only the samples based on sulfated titania are active over glycerol transformation, showing up to 58.7&#8201;% conversion. This is explained by the presence of strong base sites. Glycerides up to pentaglycerides, both linear and nonlinear structure are formed by glycerol oligomerization over TiO2&#8722;S. The addition of nanotubes to the catalyst reduces both the glycerol conversion (up to 10.5&#8201;%) and the yield of glycerides. However, the spectrum of the resulting products is significantly narrowed, increasing the selectivity for short&#8208;chain glycerides: the portion of diglycerides reaches 72&#8201;%, and triglycerides 21&#8201;%. Herewith, glycerides of a linear structure only formed.

         <title>Elucidating the Electronic Nature of Rh&#8208;based Paddlewheel Catalysts from 103Rh NMR Chemical Shifts: Insights from Quantum Mechanical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For heteroleptic dirhodium paddlewheel complexes, the NMR shifts of the two chemically different Rh are more than 1000&#8197;ppm apart. In line with symmetry considerations, the shielding tensor responds only to the donor ability of the equatorial ligands along the perpendicular principal axis. Axial ligands, in contrast, have no direct effect on shielding but may come into play via the electronic cis&#8208;effect onto the neighboring equatorial sites.







Abstract
The tremendous importance of dirhodium paddlewheel complexes for asymmetric catalysis is largely the result of an empirical optimization of the chiral ligand sphere about the bimetallic core. It was only recently that a H(C)Rh triple resonance 103Rh NMR experiment provided the long&#8208;awaited opportunity to examine &#8211; with previously inconceivable accuracy &#8211; how variation of the ligands impacts on the electronic structure of such catalysts. The recorded effects are dramatic: formal replacement of only one out of eight O&#8208;atoms surrounding the metal centers in a dirhodium tetracarboxylate by an N&#8208;atom results in a shielding of the corresponding Rh&#8208;site of no less than 1000&#8197;ppm. The current paper provides the theoretical framework that allows this and related experimental observations made with a set of 19 representative rhodium complexes to be interpreted. In line with symmetry considerations, it is shown that the shielding tensor responds only to the donor ability of the equatorial ligands along the perpendicular principal axis. Axial ligands, in contrast, have no direct effect on shielding but may come into play via the electronic 
&#8208;effect that they exert onto the neighboring equatorial sites. On top of these fundamental interactions, charge redistribution within the core as well as the electronic 
&#8208;effect of ligands of different donor strengths is reflected in the recorded 103Rh NMR shifts.

         <title>Collective Effects of Multiple Fluorine Atoms Causing &#960;&#8208;philic Characteristic within a Caged Polyoxometalate Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>

The polyanionic Mo132O372 architecture with perfluorinated interior surface favors capturing small non&#8208;aromatic guests carrying &#960;&#8208;bonds in water, which contrasts to the behavior of the non&#8208;fluorinated counterparts. Through systematic and control studies, it is revealed that collective effects of multiple C&#8722;F bonds, rather than the polarity of the individual C&#8722;F bonds, are responsible for the facile guest encapsulation.







Abstract
Perfluorination brings about distinctive properties arising from the unusual nature of the F element, which have been extensively developed in materials science and chemistry. Herein we report that the construction of F&#8208;rich inner space within a hollowed Mo132O372 cage ([Mo132O372(OCOR)30(H2O)72]42&#8722;) leads to the emergence of unique guest binding activities in encapsulation. Prominently, the trifluoroacetate&#8208;modified cage (R=CF3, 2) having as many as 90 F groups inside favors trapping cyclopentadiene (Cp), which is hardly trapped by the non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart (R=CH3, 1). Systematic studies using related hydrocarbons show that the amount of the encapsulated guest is correlated with the unsaturation degree of the guests, implying the involvement of the attractive interaction of the CF3&#8208;modified interior wall with the guest &#960;&#8208;electron clouds. Control experiments using the semi&#8208;fluorinated analogues (R=CF2H, CFH2) reveal that the perfluorination is a critical factor to facilitate the Cp encapsulation by 2, indicating that collective effects of polar C&#8722;F bonds spreading over the interior surface, rather than the polarity of the individual C&#8722;F bonds, are responsible. We also provide a successful example of the physical molecular confinement within the cage through the &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between trapped diene and dienophile.

Efficient hydrogenations of terminal alkenes with molecular hydrogen catalyzed by well&#8208;defined bench stable Mn(I) complexes containing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based PCP pincer ligand are described.







Abstract
Efficient hydrogenations of terminal alkenes with molecular hydrogen catalyzed by well&#8208;defined bench stable Mn(I) complexes containing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based PCP pincer ligand are described. These reactions are environmentally benign and atom economic, implementing an inexpensive, earth abundant non&#8208;precious metal catalyst. A range of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes were efficiently converted into alkanes in good to excellent yields. The hydrogenation proceeds at 100&#8201;&#176;C with catalyst loadings of 0.25&#8211;0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%, 2.5&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% base (KOtBu) and a hydrogen pressure of 20&#8197;bar. Mechanistic insight into the catalytic reaction is provided by means of DFT calculations.

         <title>Molecular Adhesion of a Pilus&#8208;Derived Peptide Involved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation on Non&#8208;Polar ZnO&#8208;Surfaces</title>

PAK(128&#8211;144)&#8208;peptide adsorption revealed high affinity towards etched single&#8208;crystalline ZnO(11
0) surfaces with adhesion forces ranging up to 600&#8197;pN, measured by Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy (SMFS). With the application of the Bell&#8208;Evans theory and complementary peptide adsorption studies, we decipher possible adhesion mechanisms to originate from coordination&#8208; and hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces are initiated by the adhesion of peptides and proteins. Understanding the adhesion of such peptides and proteins at a molecular level thus represents an important step toward controlling and suppressing biofilm formation on technological and medical materials. This study investigates the molecular adhesion of a pilus&#8208;derived peptide that facilitates biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug&#8208;resistant opportunistic pathogen frequently encountered in healthcare settings. Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) was performed on chemically etched ZnO
 surfaces to gather insights about peptide adsorption force and its kinetics. Metal&#8208;free click chemistry for the fabrication of peptide&#8208;terminated SMFS cantilevers was performed on amine&#8208;terminated gold cantilevers and verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and polarization&#8208;modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM&#8208;IRRAS). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and XPS analyses reveal stable topographies and surface chemistries of the substrates that are not affected by SMFS. Rupture events described by the worm&#8208;like chain model (WLC) up to 600&#8197;pN were detected for the non&#8208;polar ZnO surfaces. The dissociation barrier energy at zero force &#916;G(0), the transition state distance xb and bound&#8208;unbound dissociation rate at zero force koff(0) for the single crystalline substrate indicate that coordination and hydrogen bonds dominate the peptide/surface interaction.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Metal in the Biointeraction of Metallacarboranes with C. elegans Embryos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have transitioned from performing chemical scale studies involving the interaction of metallabis(dicarbollides) with biomolecules in a round&#8208;bottom flask, to now conducting in&#8197;vivo experiments using C. elegans. Results suggest metal (Fe or Co) plays a crucial role in C. elegans at the L4 stage and in embryos, and shows a stronger interaction with ferra compared to cobaltabis(dicarbollides).







Abstract
Cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ferrabis(dicarbollide), and their halogenated derivatives are the most studied metallacarboranes with great medical potential. These versatile compounds and their iodinated derivatives can be used in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, particle therapy, and bioimaging when isotopes are used. These metallacarboranes have been evaluated in&#8197;vitro and recently in&#8197;vivo with complex animal models. Lately, these studies have been complemented using the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a nematode largely used in toxicology. When evaluated at the L4 stage, cobaltabis(dicarbollides), ([o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;), exhibited a higher mean lethal dose (LD50) than ferrabis(dicarbollides) ([o&#8208;FESAN]&#8722; and [8,8&#8217;&#8208;I2&#8208;o&#8208;FESAN]&#8722;). In this work, we used the C. elegans embryos since they are a complex biological barrier with concentric layers of polysaccharides and proteins that protect them from the environment. We assessed if the metal atom changes their biointeraction with the C. elegans embryos. First, we assessed the effects on embryo development for metallacarboranes and their di&#8208;iodinated derivatives. We observed changes in color and in their surface structure. An exhaustive physicochemical characterization was performed to understand better this interaction, revealing a stronger interaction of ferrabis(dicarbollide) compounds with C. elegans embryos than the cobaltabis(dicarbollide) molecules. Unveiling the biological interaction of these compounds is of great interest for their future biomedical applications.

         <title>Reductive Release from a Hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS during the Biosynthesis of Pyrichalasin H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reductive release of cytochalasin intermediates was studied in&#8197;vitro, showing that the R&#8208;domain requires a T&#8208;domain tethered substrate, but has low selectivity for the amino acid and polyketide moieties. Direct 2&#8208;electron reduction is the preferred mode of release, followed by rapid Knoevenagel cyclisation of the released aldehyde.







Abstract
Three central steps during the biosynthesis of cytochalasan precursors, including reductive release, Knoevenagel cyclisation and Diels Alder cyclisation are not yet understood at a detailed molecular level. In this work we investigated the reductive release step catalysed by a hybrid polyketide synthase non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS&#8208;NRPS) from the pyrichalasin H pathway. Synthetic thiolesters were used as substrate mimics for in&#8197;vitro studies with the isolated reduction (R) and holo&#8208;thiolation (T) domains of the PKS&#8208;NRPS hybrid PyiS. These assays demonstrate that the PyiS R&#8208;domain mainly catalyses an NADPH&#8208;dependent reductive release of an aldehyde intermediate that quickly undergoes spontaneous Knoevenagel cyclisation. The R&#8208;domain can only process substrates that are covalently bound to the phosphopantetheine thiol of the upstream T&#8208;domain, but it shows little selectivity for the polyketide.

By choosing a polar and flexible organic cation trans&#8208;4&#8208;methylcyclohexylamine (4&#8208;MCHA+) to assemble with the inorganic perchloric acid, we obtained a new metal&#8208;free organic ferroelectric molecular material (4&#8208;MCHA)ClO4 (1). Remarkably, the ferroelectric phase transition (Pmn21&#8594;Pmmn) arises from the joint contribution of symmetry breaking and unusual anti&#8208;conformational reversal of organic cations.







Abstract
Organic ferroelectrics have received a great deal of interest due to their exclusive properties. However, organic ferroelectrics have not been fully explored, which hinders their practical application. Here, we presented a novel metal&#8208;free organic molecular ferroelectric [4&#8208;MCHA][ClO4] (1) (4&#8208;MCHA=trans&#8208;4&#8208;methylcyclohexylamine), which exhibits an above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature of 328&#8197;K. Strikingly, the single crystal structure analysis of 1 shows that the driving force of phase transition is related to the interesting chair&#8208;boat conformation change of 4&#8208;MCHA cation, in addition to the order&#8208;disorder transition of ClO4&#8722; anion. Using piezoelectric response force microscopy (PFM), the presence of domains and the implemented polarization switching were clearly observed, which explicitly determined the presence of room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity of 1. As far as we know, the ferroelectric phase transition mechanism attributed to the conformational change in a trans isomeric cation is very rare. This research enriched the path of designing ferroelectric materials and smart materials.

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Flexible Rare&#8208;Earth Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Control of Structural Dynamics and Sorption Properties Through Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control of the dynamic effects in flexible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical towards engineering custom responsive materials. In this work, two novel families of flexible MOFs based on rare&#8208;earth metals were developed. The breathing capabilities and the eventual sorption properties change drastically by slight changes in the organic ligand, leading also to the emergence of unique gas and vapor sorption properties, including rare gas trapping phenomena.







Abstract
An exciting direction in metal&#8208;organic frameworks involves the design and synthesis of flexible structures which can reversibly adapt their structure when triggered by external stimuli. Controlling the extent and nature of response in such solids is critical in order to develop custom dynamic materials for advanced applications. Towards this, it is highly important to expand the diversity of existing flexible MOFs, generating novel materials and gain an in&#8208;depth understanding of the associated dynamic phenomena, eventually unlocking key structure&#8208;property relationships. In the present work, we successfully utilized reticular chemistry for the construction of two novel series of highly crystalline, flexible rare&#8208;earth MOFs, RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1. Extensive single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal structural analyses coupled with detailed gas and vapor sorption studies, shed light onto the unique responsive behavior. The development of these series is related to the reported RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 solids which were found to display a unique continuous breathing and gas&#8208;trapping property. The synthesis of RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 materials represents an important milestone as they provide important insights into the key factors that control the responsive properties of this fascinating family of flexible materials and demonstrates that it is possible to control their dynamic behavior and the associated gas and vapor sorption properties.

         <title>Improving In Vivo Tumor Accumulation and Efficacy of Platinum Antitumor Agents by Electronic Tuning of the Kinetic Lability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This systemic study highlights the profound but contrasting impact of kinetic lability on in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antitumor potencies of platinum complexes comprising of &#8216;O&#708;O&#8217; leaving ligand, in addition to demonstrating that along with other physicochemical properties, kinetic lability tuning is crucial for improving in&#8197;vivo tumor accumulation and efficacy of newly designed functional Pt antitumor agents.







Abstract
The impact of kinetic lability or reactivity on in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity, stability in plasma, in&#8197;vivo tumor and tissue accumulation, and antitumor efficacy of functional platinum(II) (Pt) anticancer agents containing a O&#708;O &#946;&#8208;diketonate leaving ligand remain largely unexplored. To investigate this, we synthesized Pt complexes [(NH3)2Pt(L1&#8208;H)]NO3 and [(DACH)Pt(L1&#8208;H)]NO3 (L1=4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;ferrocenylbutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, DACH=1R,2R&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine) containing an electron deficient [L1&#8208;H]&#8211; O&#708;O leaving ligand and [(NH3)2Pt(L2&#8208;H)]NO3 and [(DACH)Pt(L2&#8208;H)]NO3 (L2=1&#8208;ferrocenylbutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione) containing an electron&#8208;rich [L2&#8208;H]&#8211; O&#708;O leaving ligand. While all four complexes have comparable lipophilicity, the presence of the electron&#8208;withdrawing CF3 group was found to dramatically enhance the reactivity of these complexes toward nucleophilic biomolecules. In vitro cellular assays revealed that the more reactive complexes have higher cellular uptake and higher anticancer potency as compared to their less reactive analogs. But the scenario is opposite in&#8197;vivo, where the less reactive complex showed improved tissue and tumor accumulation and better anticancer efficacy in mice bearing ovarian xenograft when compared to its more reactive analog. Finally, in addition to demonstrating the profound but contrasting impact of kinetic lability on in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo antitumor potencies, we also described the impact of kinetic lability on the mechanism of action of this class of promising antitumor agents.

         <title>Altering the Localization of an Unpaired Spin in a Formal Ni(V) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fate of unpaired spin localization on a formal Ni(V) species: This work broadens the scope of the previously reported a Ni(III) bisphenoxyl diradical species by revealing how modest adjustments to the ligand field and temperature can determine the fate of localization of an unpaired spin on a previously unknown three oxidized equivalent species.







Abstract
The participation of both ligand and the metal center in the redox events has been recognized as one of the ways to attain the formal high valent complexes for the late 3d metals, such as Ni and Cu. Such an approach has been employed successfully to stabilize a Ni(III) bisphenoxyl diradical species in which there exist an equilibrium between the ligand and the Ni localized resultant spin. The present work, however, broadens the scope of the previously reported three oxidized equivalent species by conveying the approaches that tend to affect the reported equilibrium in CH3CN at 233&#8197;K. Various spectroscopic characterization revealed that employing exogenous N&#8208;donor ligands like 1&#8208;methyl imidazole and pyridine favors the formation of the Ni centered localized spin though axial binding. In contrast, due to its steric hinderance, quinoline favors an exclusive ligand localized radical species. DFT studies shed light on the novel intermediates&#8242; complex electronic structure. Further, the three oxidized equivalent species with the Ni centered spin was examined for its hydrogen atom abstraction ability stressing their key role in alike reactions.

         <title>Regular Arrays of Rod&#8208;Shaped Molecular Photoswitches: Synthesis, Preparation, Characterization, and Selective Photoswitching within Mono&#8208; and Bilayer Systems</title>

Regular two&#8208;dimensional arrays made of stimuli&#8208;responsive molecules represent a unique class of smart materials with a wide range of applications. We assembled photoresponsive mono&#8208; and bilayer systems with well&#8208;defined properties from rod&#8208;shaped molecules equipped with different photoswitches. Using properly chosen chromophores, we then selectively targeted layers made of the same types of photoswitches using appropriate monochromatic light.







Abstract
We assembled photoresponsive mono&#8208; and bilayer systems with well&#8208;defined properties from rod&#8208;shaped molecules equipped with different photoswitches. Using properly chosen chromophores (diarylethene&#8208;based switch and unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motor), we then selectively targeted layers made of the same types of photoswitches using appropriate monochromatic light. UV&#8208;vis analysis confirmed smooth and unrestricted photoisomerization. To achieve this, we synthesized a new class of triptycene&#8208;based molecular pedestals adept at forming sturdy Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett films on a water&#8208;air interface. The films were smoothly transferred to gold and quartz surfaces. Repeated deposition afforded bilayer systems: one layer containing diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitches and the other a unidirectional light&#8208;driven molecular motor. Structural analysis of both mono&#8208; and bilayer systems revealed the molecules to be tilted with carboxylic functions pointing to the surface. At least two different polymorphs differing in monolayer thickness and tilt angle (~40&#176; and ~60&#176;) were identified on the gold surface.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Manganese (I)&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidant&#8208;Controlled Divergent Functionalization of 2&#8208;Arylindazoles</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, we have reported a one&#8208;pot oxidant&#8208;controlled synthesis of C&#8208;2&#8242; formyl 2H&#8208;indazoles, along with two rare heterocycles viz. indazoloindazolediones and indazolobenzoxazines from 2&#8208;arylindazoles through Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H functionalization followed by oxidation with varying the amount of DDQ and switching from DDQ to selectfluor, with broad range of substrates scope.







Abstract
The oxidant&#8208;controlled divergent synthesis of C&#8208;2&#8242; formyl 2H&#8208;indazoles and indazoloindazolediones has been developed through Mn(I)&#8208; catalyzed ortho C&#8722;H functionalization of 2H&#8208;indazoles with para&#8208;formaldehyde to afford C&#8208;2&#8242; hydroxymethylated 2H&#8208;indazoles and subsequently oxidation with varying the amount of DDQ in one&#8208;pot. By employing selectfluor as the oxidant instead of DDQ, this reaction exclusively provided indazolebenzoxazine derivatives. This strategy delivered unsymmetrical indazoloindazoledione and indazolobenzoxazine with varied functional group tolerance in moderate to good yields.

         <title>Organic Photothermal Materials Obtained Using Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Design Principles</title>

There's a twist! Organic photothermal materials based on the anilino&#8208;naphthalenediimide (ANDI) acceptor are rationally designed using sterically hindered donors with a large dihedral angle to reduce radiative processes. The ANDI materials demonstrate near&#8208;infrared absorbance and high photothermal conversion efficiencies upon encapsulation into nanoparticles.







Abstract
Organic small molecules with high photothermal conversion efficiencies that absorb near&#8208;infrared light are desirable for photothermal therapy due to their improved biocompatibility compared to inorganic materials and their ability to absorb light in the biological transparency window (650&#8211;1350&#8197;nm). Here we report three donor&#8208;acceptor organic materials DM&#8208;ANDI, O&#8208;ANDI, and S&#8208;ANDI that show high photothermal conversion efficiencies of 46&#8211;68&#8201;% with near&#8208;infrared absorption. The design of these molecules is based on the rational modification of a thermally activated delayed fluorescence material to favour a low photoluminescence quantum yield by reducing HOMO&#8208;LUMO overlap. Encapsulating these materials into either neat nanoparticles or aggregated organic dots modulates their photothermal conversion efficiencies, and also facilitates dispersion in water.

         <title>Extremely Slow Thermally&#8208;Induced Spin Crossover in the Two&#8208;Dimensional Network [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>

The changed phase&#8208;transition order causes an extremely slow spin transition in a 2D coordination polymer [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 regarded so far as a thermally&#8208;induced spin crossover inactive compound.







Abstract
Cooling [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 (bbtr=1,4&#8208;di(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)butane) triggers very slow spin crossover below 80&#8197;K (T1/2&#8595;=76&#8197;K). The spin crossover (SCO) is accompanied by a hysteresis loop (T1/2&#8593;=89&#8197;K). In contrast to isostructural perchlorate analogue [Fe(bbtr)3](ClO4)2 in which spin crossover during cooling is preceded by phase transition at TPT=126&#8197;K in tetrafluoroborate phase transition does not occur to the beginning of spin crossover (80&#8197;K). Studies of mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2(1&#8208;x)(ClO4)2x (0.5&#8804;x&#8804;0.9) showed that a phase transition precedes spin crossover, however, for x&#8773;0.46 intersection of T1/2(x) and TPT(x) dependencies takes place. The application of pressure of 1&#8197;GPa shifts the spin crossover in [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 to a temperature above 270&#8197;K. High&#8208;pressure studies of neat tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate, as well as mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2(1&#8208;x)(ClO4)2x (0.1&#8804;x&#8804;0.9), revealed that at 295&#8197;K P1/2 value changes linearly with x indicating similar mechanism of spin crossover under elevated pressure in all systems under investigation. Variable pressure single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies confirmed that in contrast to thermally induced spin crossover undergoing differently in tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate an application of high pressure removes this differentiation leading to a similar mechanism depending at first on start spin crossover and then P&#8208;3&#8594;P&#8208;1 phase transition occurs. In this report we have shown that 2D coordination polymer [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 (bbtr=1,4&#8208;di(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)butane) treated to date as spin crossover silent shows thermally induced spin crossover phenomenon. Spin crossover in tetrafluoroborate is extremely slow. Determination of the spin crossover curve required carrying measurement in the settle mode&#8208;cooling from 85 to 70&#8197;K took about 600&#8197;h (average velocity of change of temperature ca. 0.0004&#8197;K/min).

         <dc:description>
Herein, the preparation of bipyrimidine&#8208;based chromophores presenting alkoxystyryl donor groups carrying aliphatic achiral and chiral chains on the 4 position is described. Symmetry breaking by judicious functionalization of 3D organic octupoles allows the emergence of multifunctional liquid crystalline or crystalline chromophores, which can easily be processed into large, flexible, thin and self&#8208;oriented films presenting second harmonic generation response.







Abstract
New synthesized bipyrimidine&#8208;based chromophores presenting alkoxystyryl donor groups carrying aliphatic achiral and chiral chains in the 4 position, connected to electron&#8208;accepting 2,2&#8208;bipyrimidine cores have been synthesized. Their linear and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were investigated as well as their mesomorphic properties by various techniques (light&#8208;transmission measurements, polarized&#8208;light optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry measurements and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence). The derivatives with achiral linear carbon chains were found to exhibit liquid&#8208;crystal properties with the formation smectic phases over large temperature ranges, which were confirmed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis via stacking models. The nonlinear optical properties in the solid state for derivatives with C14 and the citronellol chains have been studied by wide&#8208;field second&#8208;harmonic generation and multi&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging, confirming centrosymmetry for these achiral mesogens and their excellent third&#8208;order nonlinearity whereas the chiral compound exhibits non&#8208;centrosymmetric organization resulting in a strong Second Harmonic Generation at the crystal state.

         <title>Chiral Benzene Triimide (BTI) Radical Anions for Probing the Interplay of Unpaired Electron Spin and Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel chiral Benzene triimide (BTI) radical anions are reported. The interplay between the unpaired electron spin and chiral substituents is revealed by NIR circularly polarized light absorptions that arise from the unpaired electron spin transition. The modulation is attributed to chiral substitutes regulated transition dipole moments of the unpaired electron spin participated transition.







Abstract
Herein a series of chiral BTI radical anions bearing different chiral substituents were efficiently prepared by chemical reduction. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed finely&#8208;tuned packing and helix assemblies of the radicals by the size of chiral substituents in crystalline state. In accordance with the crystalline&#8208;state packing, the powder ESR spectra indicate that 4&#8201;a&#8722;&#8901;CoCp2+ and 4&#8201;c&#8722;&#8901;CoCp2+ &#960;&#8208;dimers exhibit thermally excited triplet states arising from strong spin&#8208;spin interactions, while discrete 4&#8201;b&#8722;&#8901;CoCp2+ shows a broad doublet&#8208;state signal reflecting weak spin&#8208;spin interactions. The interplay between the unpaired electron spin and chiral substituents was studied by UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectra, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and TD DFT calculations. Different NIR absorptions of the radicals attributing to isolated SOMO&#8594;LUMO+1 (~889&#8197;nm) transitions were recorded. The emergence of Cotton effects (CEs) at the NIR region for 4&#8201;c&#8722;&#8901;CoCp2+ radical enantiomers suggest the interplay between chirality and unpaired electron spin. The origin of the different circularly polarized light absorptions regarding SOMO derived transitions (around 880&#8197;nm) was attributed to chiral substitutes regulated electric and magnetic transition dipole moments of the unpaired electron participated transition.

         <title>Doubly Bridged Anthracenes: Blue Emitters for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bridged anthracenes was synthesized and their photostabilities were accessed. While the length of the bridges only plays a minor role, introduction of electron withdrawing ester&#8208;based linkers retards photooxidation most. Those esters bridged anthracenes could be prepared in reasonable yields and &#8220;proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle&#8221; organic light emitting diodes with deep blue emission were built, demonstrating their potential as emitters.







Abstract
The photooxidative stability of a series of doubly bridged anthracenes was evaluated after their preparation via twofold macrocyclization of a bis(resorcinyl)anthracene. Lightfastness correlates with the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), resulting in superior stability of the tetraesters compared to the tetraethers. The lengths and steric demand of the linker only plays a minor role for the ester&#8208;based compounds, which can be prepared in reasonable yields and thus tested in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Double ester&#8208;bridging allows deep blue electro&#8208;luminescence, highlighting the importance of the choice of the functional groups used for macrocyclization.

A new series of unsymmetrical phenyl tellurides derived from 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide has been synthesized by copper&#8208;catalyzed method using diaryl ditelluride.

Abstract
A new series of unsymmetrical phenyl tellurides derived from 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl) benzamide ligand has been synthesized in a practical manner by the copper&#8208;catalyzed method by using diaryl ditelluride and Mg as a reductant at room temperature. In order to augment the Lewis acidity of these newly formed unsymmetrical monotellurides, these have been transformed into corresponding unsymmetrical 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurium cations. Subsequently, these Lewis acidic tellurium cations were used as chalcogen bonding catalysts, enabling the synthesis of various substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines by activating ketones with anilines under mild conditions. Moreover, the synthesized 2&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide phenyl tellurium cation has also catalyzed the formation of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols in high regioselectivity by effectively activating epoxides at room temperature. Mechanistic insight by 1H and 19F NMR study, electrostatic surface potential (ESP map), control reaction in which tellurium cation reacted explosively with epoxide, suggested that the enhanced Lewis acidity of tellurium center seems responsible for efficient catalytic activities under mild conditions enabling &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols with excellent regioselectivity and 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines with trifluoromethyl, nitro, and pyridylsubstitution, which were difficult to access.

BODIPY dyes, extensively used as triplet chromophores, have unique electronic structure with strong interactions of spin, electronic and vibrational dynamics. In this experimental and computational study, we explain the control of intersystem crossing of BODIPY triplet chromophores by spin&#8208;vibronic coupling. We rationalize the site&#8208;specific effect of heavy atom substitution by extending El&#8208;Sayed rules beyond their traditional applications.







Abstract
4,4&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;borata&#8208;3a&#8208;azonia&#8208;4a&#8208;aza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) dyes are extensively used in various applications of their triplet states, ranging from photoredox catalysis, through triplet sensitization to photodynamic therapy. However, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores by ab initio modelling is limited by their strong interactions of spin, electronic and vibrational dynamics. In particular, spin&#8208;vibronic coupling is often overlooked when estimating intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. In this study, a combined experimental and theoretical approach using spin&#8208;vibronic coupling to correctly describe ISC in BODIPY dyes was developed. For this purpose, seven &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY derivatives with iodine atoms in different positions were examined. It was found that the heavy&#8208;atom effect of iodine atoms is site specific, causing high triplet yields in only some positions. This site&#8208;specific ISC was explained by El&#8208;Sayed rules, so both the contribution and character of the molecular orbitals involved in the excitation must be considered when predicting the ISC rates. Overall, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores requires using (i)&#8197;the high&#8208;quality electronic structure theory, including both static and dynamical correlations; and (ii)&#8197;the two&#8208;component wave function Hamiltonian, and rationalizing; and (iii)&#8197;ISC based on the character of the molecular orbitals of heavy atoms involved in the excitation, expanding El&#8208;Sayed rules beyond their traditional applications.

         <title>Cyano Decoration of &#960;&#8208;Bridge to Boost Photoluminescence and Electroluminescence Quantum Yields of Triazine/Carbazole Based Blue TADF Emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>

Incorporating less bulky cyano group to replace methyl on &#960; bridge of donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecule instead strengthened the thermally activated delayed fluorescence feature through enhancing intramolecular charge transfer, and boosted photoluminescence quantum yield from 40&#8201;% to 94&#8201;% by increasing HOMO&#8208;LUMO overlap, finally led to an EQE of 14&#8201;% in blue OLED.







Abstract
In general, a large donor&#8208;acceptor dihedral angle is required to guarantee sufficient frontier molecular orbitals separation for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, which is intrinsically unfavorable for the radiative transition. We present a molecular design method favoring both reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and radiative transitions even at a moderate D&#8722;A angle. A blue TADF emitter TrzBuCz&#8208;CN was designed with triazine/tert&#8208;butylcarbazole as donor/acceptor and cyano (CN) incorporated on the phenylene bridge. In comparison with the methyl decoration in similar way (TrzBuCz&#8722;Me), CN decoration reduced the D&#8722;A dihedral angle from 70&#176; to 60&#176;, which is intrinsically not favorable for sufficient FMO separation, but unexpectedly reduced the singlet and triplet energy gap (&#916;EST) and thus facilitated TADF feature by pulling down the lowest singlet state energy. While the reduced distorsion instead improved the HOMO&#8208;LUMO overlap and boosted the fluorescence quantum yield from 41&#8201;% to 94&#8201;%. The blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode of TrzBuCz&#8208;CN exhibited an external quantum efficiency of 13.7&#8201;% with emission peak at 466&#8197;nm, greatly superior to 6.0&#8201;% of TrzBuCz&#8722;Me. The result provides a feasible design strategy to facilitate both RISC and radiation processes by CN decoration of the linking bridge of TADF emitters.

         <title>Unraveling the Push&#8208;Pull Effect in Acenes, Polyenes and Polyynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of the charge of the substituent active region allowed us to reveal how electron withdrawing and donating properties of polyene, polyyne and acene spacers change with their length. It is also shown how the substituent effect strength between two groups diminishes with distance. The effect of substituent on electron delocalization can be extracted using EDDB (Electron Density of Delocalized Bonds) differential maps.







Abstract
Substituent effects (SEs) are fundamental for predicting molecular reactivity, while polyene, polyyne and acene derivatives are precursors to compounds with diverse applications. Computations were performed for Y&#8208;R&#8208;X systems, where reaction sites Y=NO2 and O&#8722;, substituents X=NO2, CN, Cl, H, OH, NH2, and spacers R=polyene, polyyne (n=1&#8208;5, 10 repeating units) and acene (up to tetracene). The cSAR (charge of the substituent active region) approach allowed to present, for the first time, quantitative relations describing the spacer's electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing properties as a function of n and the spacer type. The electronic properties of the X substituents depend on the type of spacer, its length and the Y group, which is an example of the reverse SE. To describe how the SE between Y and X weakens with n, two approaches were compared: cSAR and SESE (SE stabilization energy). The EDDB (electron density of delocalized bonds) characterize changes in electron delocalization in spacers due to the SE. A new approach &#8211; EDDB differential maps &#8211; allow to extract the effect of X substitution on the electron delocalization. The charges at spacer's C atoms correlate with cSAR; changes in the slopes confirm the charge transfer by resonance.

Synthesis strategy to obtain double [4]&#8208; and [6]&#8208;azahelicene structures with central 1,8&#8208;naphthyrinde core is described. Synthesis method allows four bond formation in one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step reaction with easy diversification of substituents. Experimental data of optical and electrochemical properties, as well as theoretical calculations of selected product examples, are presented.







Abstract
This report describes a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step procedure to obtain double azahelicenes via nucleophilic fluorine substitution of 2,2&#8208;di(2&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroalkenes and palladium&#8208;catalysed ring closing reaction. The developed synthesis approach allows easy diversification of substituents at all four fragments of the obtained X&#8208;shaped aza[4,6]helicene entity. Yields range from 20&#8201;% to 60&#8201;% among 12 product examples. X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis reveals formation of (P,P) and (M,M) enantiomer mixture of products. Optical and electrochemical properties of selected products were studied by performing UV/Vis absorption, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry measurements. Experimental results are supported by (TD)&#8208;DFT, NICS and NICS2BC calculations.

         <title>Porous Carbon Foam with Carbon Nanotubes as Cathode for Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbon foam with carbon nanotubes were elaborately designed and fabricated by using cobalt as the catalyst and utilized as cathode for Li&#8722;CO2 battery. The unique structure can enhance the decomposition rate of lithium carbonate, and thus improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;CO2 battery.







Abstract
With the extensive use of fossil fuels, the ever&#8208;increasing greenhouse gas of mainly carbon dioxide emissions will result in global climate change. It is of utmost importance to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and its utilization. Li&#8722;CO2 batteries can convert carbon dioxide into electrochemical energy. However, developing efficient catalysts for the decomposition of Li2CO3 as the discharge product represents a challenge in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Porous carbon foam with carbon nanotubes were elaborately designed and fabricated by using cobalt as the catalyst and utilized as cathode for Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery. The unique structure can enhance the decomposition rate of lithium carbonate, and thus improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the extensive use of fossil fuels, the ever-increasing greenhouse gas of mainly carbon dioxide emissions will result in global climate change. It is of utmost importance to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and its utilization. Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries can convert carbon dioxide into electrochemical energy. However, developing efficient catalysts for the decomposition of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the discharge product represents a challenge in Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. Herein, we demonstrate a carbon foam composite with growing carbon nanotube by using cobalt as the catalyst, showing the ability to enhance the decomposition rate of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. Benefiting from its abundant pore structure and catalytic sites, the as-assembled Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery exhibits a desirable overpotential of 1.67&#8197;V after 50&#8197;cycles.

These results provide a new avenue for the development of efficient catalysts for Li&#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deciphering Iron&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Amination with Organic Azides: N2 Cleavage from a Stable Organoazide Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elucidating the mechanism of C&#8722;H amination with organic azides: a stable iron &#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complex that is in fast equilibrium between the free and coordinated state undergoes gradual N2 loss, demonstrated by NMR kinetics, M&#246;ssbauer measurements, photo&#8208;crystallography, and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Catalytic C&#8722;N bond formation by direct activation of C&#8722;H bonds offers wide synthetic potential. En route to C&#8722;H amination, complexes with organic azides are critical precursors towards the reactive nitrene intermediate. Despite their relevance, &#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complexes are scarce in general, and elusive with iron, although iron complexes are by far the most active catalysts for C&#8722;H amination with organoazides. Herein, we report the synthesis of a stable iron &#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complex from [Fe(N(SiMe3)2)2] and AdN3 (Ad=1&#8208;adamantyl) and its crystallographic, IR, NMR and zero&#8208;field 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopic characterization. These analyses revealed that the organoazide is in fast equilibrium between the free and coordinated state (Keq=62). Photo&#8208;crystallography experiments showed gradual dissociation of N2, which imparted an Fe&#8722;N bond shortening and correspond to structural snapshots of the formation of an iron imido/nitrene complex. Reactivity of the organoazide complex in solution showed complete loss of N2, and subsequent formation of a C&#8722;H aminated product via nitrene insertion into a C&#8722;H bond of the N(SiMe3)2 ligand. Monitoring this reaction by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy indicates the transient formation of the imido/nitrene intermediate, which was supported by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy in frozen solution.

         <title>Lanthanide Mimicking by Magnesium for Oxazolidinone Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monomeric magnesium compound was employed as a catalyst for the cascade cyclization of propargylic alcohol and isocyanate, resulting in the formation of pharmaceutically significant oxazolidinone derivatives. This transformation, previously attributed solely to transition metals or lanthanides, signifies a noteworthy advancement.







Abstract
In the last decade, magnesium complexes have emerged as a viable alternative to transition&#8208;metal catalysts for the hydrofunctionalization of unsaturated bonds. However, their potential for advanced catalytic reactions has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, we have developed a novel magnesium amide compound (3) using a PNP framework that is both bulky and flexible. Our research demonstrates that compound 3 can effectively catalyze the synthesis of biologically significant oxazolidinone derivatives. This synthesis involves a tandem reaction of hydroalkoxylation and cyclohydroamination of isocyanate using propargyl alcohol. Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive theoretical calculations to gain insights into the reaction mechanism. It is important to note that these types of transformations have not been reported for magnesium and would significantly enhance the catalytic portfolio of the 7th most abundant element.

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of a Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Containing [2]Rotaxane with Pentafluorophenyl Ester Stoppers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pillar[5]arene as a protecting group. Selective mono&#8208;functionalization of a rotaxane building block is very efficient owing to steric effects limiting the access of the nucleophilic reagents to the second reactive carbonyl group. Introduction of a second stopper is then possible to generate dissymmetrical rotaxanes or axles in high yields.







Abstract
Detailed investigations into the stepwise bis&#8208;functionalization of a pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing rotaxane building block have been carried out. Upon a first stopper exchange, the pillar[5]arene moiety of the mono&#8208;acylated product is preferentially located close to its reactive pentafluorophenyl ester stopper, thus limiting the accessibility to the reactive carbonyl group by the nucleophilic reagents. Selective mono&#8208;functionalization is thus very efficient. Introduction of a second stopper is then possible to generate dissymmetrical rotaxanes with different amide stoppers. Moreover, when dethreading is possible upon the second acylation, the pillar[5]arene plays the role of a protecting group allowing the synthesis of dissymmetrical axles that are particularly difficult to prepare under statistical conditions. Finally, detailed conformation analysis of the rotaxanes revealed that the position of the pillar[5]arene moiety on its axle subunit is mainly governed by polar interactions in nonpolar organic solvents, whereas solvophobic effects play a major role in polar solvents.

         <title>Robust Spin Liquidity in 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Cu3 (HHTP)2 with S=1/2 Kagome Lattice</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique synthetic approach is implemented to crystallize a Cu(II)&#8208;based 2D MOF, Cu3(HHTP)2 onto reduced graphene oxide (rGO) leading to electron doping via chemical interaction between two sublattices, magnetic and electronic, resulting in the 200&#8208;fold increase in electrical conductivity along with the presence of robust spin liquidity.







Abstract
On one hand electron or hole doping of quantum spin liquid (QSL) may unlock high&#8208;temperature superconductivity and on the other hand it can disrupt the spin liquidity, giving rise to a magnetically ordered ground state. Recently, a 2D MOF, Cu3(HHTP)2 (HHTP &#8208; 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene), containing Cu(II) S=
 frustrated spins in the Kagome lattice is emerging as a promising QSL candidate. Herein, we present an elegant in&#8197;situ redox&#8208;chemistry strategy of anchoring Cu3(HHTP)2 crystallites onto diamagnetic reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, resulting in the formation of electron&#8208;doped Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite which exhibited a characteristic semiconducting behavior (5&#8197;K to 300&#8197;K) with high electrical conductivity of 70&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;1 and a carrier density of ~1.1&#215;1018&#8197;cm&#8722;3 at 300&#8197;K. Remarkably, no magnetic transition in the Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite was observed down to 1.5&#8197;K endorsing the robust spin liquidity of the 2D MOF Cu3(HHTP)2. Specific heat capacity measurements led to the estimation of the residual entropy values of 28&#8201;% and 34&#8201;% of the theoretically expected value for the pristine Cu3(HHTP)2 and Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;rGO composite, establishing the presence of strong quantum fluctuations down to 1.5&#8197;K (two times smaller than the value of the exchange interaction J).

Herein, we present an elegant in&#8197;situ redox-chemistry strategy of anchoring Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystallites onto diamagnetic reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, resulting in the formation of electron-doped Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rGO composite which exhibited a characteristic semiconducting behavior (5&#8197;K to 300&#8197;K) with high electrical conductivity of 70&#8197;S&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a carrier density of ~1.1&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 300&#8197;K. Remarkably, no magnetic transition in the Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rGO composite was observed down to 1.5&#8197;K endorsing the robust spin liquidity of the 2D MOF Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Specific heat capacity measurements led to the estimation of the residual entropy values of 28&#8201;% and 34&#8201;% of the theoretically expected value for the pristine Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rGO composite, establishing the presence of strong quantum fluctuations down to 1.5&#8197;K (two times smaller than the value of the exchange interaction &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reticular chemistry was successfully applied in highly flexible rare&#8208;earth MOFs to gain control over structural dynamics and gas/vapor sorption properties. The reported materials display a rare continuous&#8208;breathing behaviour and an unprecedented gas/vapor trapping property, resembling the function of Venus&#8208;flytrap, and could be used for the selective removal of harmful gases and volatile organic compounds. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#8197;N. Trikalitis and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302709).

         <title>Front Cover: Stepwise Functionalization of a Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Containing [2]Rotaxane with Pentafluorophenyl Ester Stoppers (Chem. Eur. J. 4/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pillar[5]arene acts as an umbrella to protect the axle of the rotaxane from nucleophiles. Indeed, reaction of a nucleophile with the first activated ester stopper of a symmetrical rotaxane building block affords a mono&#8208;acylated intermediate in which the pillar[5]arene moiety is preferentially located close to the remaining pentafluorophenyl ester stopper. As a result, the accessibility of the second reactive carbonyl group by the nucleophilic reagent is limited, and selective mono&#8208;functionalization is very efficient. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Nierengarten, J.&#8208;F. Nierengarten and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303501).

         <title>Chemistry and Biology of Podophyllotoxins: An Update</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Podophyllotoxin is a natural product with interesting medicinal and agricultural values. Herein, new podophyllotoxin analogues with new skeletons isolated from plants are listed, as well as the total synthesis, structural modifications, biological activity and structure&#8211;activity relationships of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives. Hopefully, this review will serve as a reference for further research on podophyllotoxin and its derivatives.







Abstract
Podophyllotoxin is an aryltetralin lignan lactone derived from different plants of Podophyllum. It consists of five rings with four chiral centers, one trans&#8208;lactone and one aryl tetrahydronaphthalene skeleton with multiple modification sites. Moreover, podophyllotoxin and its derivatives showed lots of bioactivities, including anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, antiviral, and insecticidal properties. The demand for podophyllotoxin and its derivatives is rising as a result of their high efficacy. As a continuation of our previous review (Chem. Eur. J., 2017, 23, 4467&#8211;4526), herein, total synthesis, biotransformation, structural modifications, bioactivities, and structure&#8211;activity relationships of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives from 2017 to 2022 are summarized. Meanwhile, a piece of update information on the origin of new podophyllotoxin analogues from plants from 2014 to 2022 was compiled. We hope that this review will provide a reference for future high value&#8211;added applications of podophyllotoxin and its analogues in the pharmaceutical and agricultural fields.

         <title>Direct Lithium Extraction Using Intercalation Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 4, January 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalation materials have shown promise for ion selective recovery of lithium from aqueous resources. These materials have demonstrated high ion selectivity, excellent adsorption capacity, relatively low chemical consumption and waste generation, and scale&#8208;up possibilities. Lithium extraction techniques involving intercalation materials are reviewed, as well as the adsorption kinetics associated with those techniques.







Abstract
Worldwide lithium demand has surged in recent years due to increased production of Li&#8208;ion batteries for electric vehicles and stationary storage. Li supply and production will need to increase such that the transition towards increased electrification in the energy sector does not become cost prohibitive. Many countries have taken policy steps such as listing Li as a critical mineral. Current commercial Li mining is mostly from dedicated mine sources, including ores, clays, and brines. The conventional ways to extract Li+ from those resources are through chemical processing and includes steps of calcination, leaching, precipitation, and purification. The environmental and economic sustainability of conventional Li processing has recently received increased scrutiny. Routes such as direct Li+ extraction may provide advantages relative to conventional Li+ extraction technologies, and one possible route to direct Li+ extraction includes leveraging intercalation materials. Intercalation material processing has recently demonstrated high selectivity towards Li+ as opposed to other cations. Reviews and reports of direct Li+ extraction with intercalation materials are limited, even as this technology has started to show promise in smaller&#8208;scale demonstrations. This paper will review selective Li+ extraction via intercalation materials, including both electrochemical and chemical methods to drive Li+ in and out, and efforts to characterize the Li+ insertion/deinsertion processes.

         <title>Total Synthesis of GanodermaMeroterpenoids Cochlearol B and Its Congeners Driven by Structural Similarity and Biological Homology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Secondary metabolites that have the same biological origin must share some relationship in their biosynthesis. Exploring this relationship has always been a significant task for synthetic biologists. However, from the perspective of synthetic chemists, it is equally important to propose, prove, or refute potential biosynthetic pathways in order to elucidate and understand the biosynthesis of homologous secondary metabolites. In this study, driven by the high structural similarity between the homologous Ganoderma meroterpenoids cochlearol B and ganocin B, two chemically synthetic strategies were designed and investigated sequentially for the synthesis of cochlearol B from ganocin B. These strategies include intramolecular metal catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and intramolecular photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. The aim was to reveal their potential biosynthetic conversion relationship using chemical synthesis methods. As a result, a highly efficient total synthesis of cochlearol B, cochlearol T, cochlearol F, as well as the formal total synthesis of ganocins A&#8208;B, and ganocochlearins C&#8208;D, has been achieved. Additionally, a novel synthetic approach for the synthesis of 6,6&#8208;disubstituted 6H&#8208;dibenzo[b,d]pyran and its analogues has been developed through palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type/cross coupling cascade reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Photochemical Preparation of CdS/Poly(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;MAA) Composite with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper presents a one&#8208;step photochemical method for the preparation of CdS/Poly(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;MAA) composite&#160;photocatalyst, based on the concept of simultaneous photocatalytic polymerization of organic monomers during UV&#8208;light induced formation of CdS. The preparation is carried out in an aqueous solution of Na2S2O3, CdSO4, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA), under a UV lamp. The continuously formed CdS particles with photocatalytic activity act the role of initiator to directly initiate the copolymerization of MMA and MAA, resulting in the in situ formation of the composite and full contact of the CdS particles with the oxygen&#8208;containing groups in the polymer. Taking the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue as a case study, the composite exhibited significantly higher activity under simulated solar light compared to the pure CdS. By analysis on various data, the enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption, and especially the high electron&#8208;hole separation efficiency caused by the electrostatic interaction between photogenerated holes and carbonyl oxygen atoms with negatively charged features. Furthermore, the composite displays excellent sunlight activity and recyclability, suggesting its potential for practical applications. Such a one&#8208;step construction strategy relying only on photo&#8208;energy is green, low&#8208;cost and promising in obtaining high&#8208;performance semiconductor/polymer composite photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a selective method for the synthesis of N&#8208;alkylimidazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxides in high yields. And also, a new family of molecular heterospin complexes was obtained by the reaction of new nitroxides and Cu(hfac)2.







Abstract
A novel synthetic approach has been employed to synthesize a series of new nitronyl nitroxides: 2&#8208;(1&#8208;propyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208; (Ln&#8722;Pr), 2&#8208;(1&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208; (Li&#8722;Pr) and 2&#8208;(1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;3&#8208;oxide&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (Ln&#8722;Bu). The reaction of Cu(hfac)2 with LR in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio yields mononuclear heterospin complexes [Cu(hfac)2(LR)2] (LR=Ln&#8208;Pr, Li&#8208;Pr, Ln&#8208;Bu), which have a similar crystal structure to the &#8220;jumping&#8221; crystals [Cu(hfac)2(LMe)2] that exhibit chemomechanical activity. It was shown that an increase in the alkyl substituent R leads to changes in the crystal packing of the molecules and the absence of chemomechanical activity. Furthermore, it was found that two polymorph modifications of the heterospin complex [Cu(hfac)2(Ln&#8722;Pr)2] can be obtained, and magnetic properties of [Cu(hfac)2(Ln&#8722;Pr)2] strongly depend on the angle between the planes of the paramagnetic fragment O&#8226;&#8211;N&#8208;C=N&#8594;O and the imidazole ring in Ln&#8722;Pr.

         <dc:description>
The manifestation of the &#8220;buttressing effect&#8221; &#8211; an indirect interaction between two substituents issued by the presence of a third group &#8211; and its influence on the ease and selectivity of the bromine&#8208;lithium exchange and the reactivity of formed aryllithiums is presented. In naphthalene substrates bearing two bromines, the impact on regioselectivity of the reaction is demonstrated.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions such as coordination of an organolithium reagent by a directing group and steric repulsion of substituents strongly affect the halogen&#8208;lithium exchange process. Here we present the manifestation of the &#8220;buttressing effect&#8221; &#8211; an indirect interaction between two substituents issued by the presence of a third group &#8211; and its influence on the ease and selectivity of the bromine&#8208;lithium exchange and the reactivity of formed aryllithiums. The increase of the size of the &#8220;buttressing&#8221; substituent strongly affects the conformation of a NMe2 group, forcing it to hinder ortho&#8208;bromine and thus slowing down the exchange. In naphthalene substrates bearing two bromines, this suppresses regioselectivity of the reaction. The &#8220;buttressing effect&#8221; forces formed aryllithiums to deaggregate, thus boosting their reactivity. This facilitates the decomposition via protolisys by ethereal solvents even at low temperatures and in some cases initiates fast Wurtz&#8208;Fittig coupling.

         <title>Nickel Carbide Nanoparticle Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Nitriles to Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates selective hydrogenation of nitriles to produce primary amines using a well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline nickel carbide (nano&#8208;Ni3C) catalyst. The aluminum&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported nano&#8208;Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3) showed high catalytic activity and broad substrate scope, with various (hetero)aromatic and aliphatic nitriles affording the corresponding primary amines, even under 1&#8197;bar of H2.







Abstract
Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported nano&#8208;Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1&#8197;bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram&#8208;scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano&#8208;Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano&#8208;Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid&#8208;phase organic reactions.

         <title>Giant Star&#8208;shaped meso&#8208;substituted Fluorescent Porphyrins with Fluorenyl&#8208;containing Arms Designed for Two&#8208;photon Oxygen Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Starburst porphyrins possessing up to twenty conjugated fluorenyl units have been synthesized. Their detailed oxygen&#8208;photosensitizing ability, their fluorescence and their two&#8208;photon absorption properties are discussed







Abstract
In the continuation of previous studies on carbon&#8208;rich meso&#8208;tetraarylporphyrins featuring 2,7&#8208;fluorene units at their periphery, the effect of changing the peripheral dendritic arms for linear arms on their oxygen&#8208;photosensitizing ability, their fluorescence and their two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) properties is now analyzed. Thus, starburst porphyrins possessing up to twenty conjugated fluorenyl units were isolated and studied. More precisely, a series of five new free&#8208;base porphyrins featuring fully conjugated arms incorporating an increasing number of fluorenyl groups connected via 1,2&#8208;alkenyl spacers were synthesized, along with their Zn(II) complexes. Upon excitation in the arm&#8208;centred &#960;&#8208;&#960;* absorption band, an efficient energy transfer takes place from the peripheral fluorenyl units to the central porphyrin core, leading to intense red&#8208;light emission and oxygen photosensitization by the latter. More interestingly, while the linear optical properties of these porphyrins were only slightly improved compared to those of their dendrimer analogues for photodynamic therapy (PDT) or fluorescence imaging, their 2PA cross&#8208;sections were much more significantly boosted, evidencing the key role played by different structures on nonlinear optical properties. Finally, by comparison with other porphyrin&#8208;based two&#8208;photon photosensitizers reported in the literature, we show that these new &#8220;semi&#8208;disconnected&#8221; starburst systems exhibit a remarkable trade&#8208;off between intrinsic 2PA, fluorescence and oxygen photosensitization.

         <title>Anthraquinodimethane&#8208;Based Molecular Switches Tethered by Four&#8208;Arm Star&#8208;like Polymers</title>

         <dc:description>
Anthraquinodimethane&#8208;based molecular switches tethered by four&#8208;arm polymers of poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) or poly(D,L&#8208;lactide) show slower dynamics of the conformational switching between the folded and the twisted conformations, enhanced photoluminescence and thermally accessible triplets in solid states.







Abstract
Molecular switches that reversibly change their structures and physical properties are important for applications such as sensing and information processing at molecular scales. In order to avoid the intermolecular aggregation that is often detrimental to the stimuli&#8208;responses of molecular switches, previous studies of molecular switches have been often conducted in dilute solutions which are difficult for applications in solid&#8208;state devices. Here we report molecular design and synthesis that integrates anthraquinodimethane as molecular switching units into polymers with amenable processibility in solid states. Optical and electron spin resonance characterizations indicate that the four&#8208;arm polymers of poly(&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) or poly(D,L&#8208;lactide) tethered from anthraquinodimethane slow down the dynamics of the conformational switching between the folded and the twisted conformations, enhance the photoluminescence in solid states and impart materials with a small energy gap from singlet ground state to thermally accessible triplet state.

         <title>Synthesis of Bench&#8208;stable Polycyclic Organophosphorus Heterocycles via Staudinger&#8208;type Annulations of ortho&#8208;Azidophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most penta&#8208;coordinated organophosphorus compounds are not bench&#8208;stable. To stabilize penta&#8208;coordinated P(V) species, phosphorus&#8208;containing polycyclic structures have been introduced. Herein, we report two novel bench&#8208;stable polycyclic P(V) heterocycles, benzo&#8208;benzo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;thiazaphospholo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;oxazaphosphole (B&#8208;B&#8208;TAP&#8208;OAP) and benzo&#8208;benzo&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaphospholo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;oxazaphosphol&#8208;12&#8208;one (B&#8208;B&#8208;AP&#8208;OAP), that can be prepared via Staudinger&#8208;type annulations of ortho&#8208;azidophenols with either ortho&#8208;phosphinoarenesulfonyl fluorides or ortho&#8208;phosphinobenzoic acid methyl esters.







Abstract
The formation of a five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered ring is known to stabilize unstable molecular structures such as hemiacetals. This idea can also be extended to stabilize other high&#8208;coordinated p&#8208;block element species. Herein, we synthesized two novel polycyclic organophosphorus heterocycles via Staudinger&#8208;type annulations. Reactions of either ortho&#8208;phosphinoarenesulfonyl fluorides 1 or ortho&#8208;phosphinobenzoic acid methyl esters 4 with ortho&#8208;azidophenols 2 gave rise to penta&#8208;coordinated P(V) heterocycles, benzo&#8208;benzo&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;thiazaphospholo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;oxazaphosphole (B&#8208;B&#8208;TAP&#8208;OAP) 3 and benzo&#8208;benzo&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaphospholo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;oxazaphosphol&#8208;12&#8208;one (B&#8208;B&#8208;AP&#8208;OAP) 5 in satisfactory yields. It is remarkable that heterocycles 3 and 5 are both bench&#8208;stable and exhibit considerable stability in a 10&#8201;% aqueous tetrahydrofuran solution. Preliminary computational studies disclosed that the formation of nitrogen gas is the key driving force for the annulations. In addition, the formation of a strong Si&#8722;F bond is another contributor to the annulation of 1 and 2.

     alt="Synthesis of Bench-stable Polycyclic Organophosphorus Heterocycles via Staudinger-type Annulations of ortho-Azidophenols"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most penta-coordinated organophosphorus compounds are not bench-stable. To stabilize penta-coordinated P(V) species, phosphorus-containing polycyclic structures have been introduced. Herein, we report two novel bench-stable polycyclic P(V) heterocycles, benzo-benzo-1,2,3-thiazaphospholo-1,3,2-oxazaphosphole (&lt;b&gt;B-B-TAP-OAP&lt;/b&gt;) and benzo-benzo-1,2-azaphospholo-1,3,2-oxazaphosphol-12-one (&lt;b&gt;B-B-AP-OAP&lt;/b&gt;), that can be prepared via Staudinger-type annulations of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-azidophenols with either &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-phosphinoarenesulfonyl fluorides or &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-phosphinobenzoic acid methyl esters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of a five- or six-membered ring is known to stabilize unstable molecular structures such as hemiacetals. This idea can also be extended to stabilize other high-coordinated p-block element species. Herein, we synthesized two novel polycyclic organophosphorus heterocycles via Staudinger-type annulations. Reactions of either &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-phosphinoarenesulfonyl fluorides &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-phosphinobenzoic acid methyl esters &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-azidophenols &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; gave rise to penta-coordinated P(V) heterocycles, benzo-benzo-1,2,3-thiazaphospholo-1,3,2-oxazaphosphole (&lt;b&gt;B-B-TAP-OAP&lt;/b&gt;) &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and benzo-benzo-1,2-azaphospholo-1,3,2-oxazaphosphol-12-one (&lt;b&gt;B-B-AP-OAP&lt;/b&gt;) &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; in satisfactory yields. It is remarkable that heterocycles &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; are both bench-stable and exhibit considerable stability in a 10&#8201;% aqueous tetrahydrofuran solution. Preliminary computational studies disclosed that the formation of nitrogen gas is the key driving force for the annulations. In addition, the formation of a strong Si&#8722;F bond is another contributor to the annulation of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing oxygen exchange between UiO&#8208;66(Zr) MOF and water using 17O solid&#8208;state NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 17O labeled terephtalic acid ligand has been used for the synthesis of 17O enriched UiO&#8208;66 compound. High&#8208;field 17O solid&#8208;state NMR experiments show an overall transfer of oxygen in the structure.







Abstract
The Zr&#8208;based Metal Organic Framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;66(Zr) is widely employed owing to its good thermal and chemical stabilities. Although the long&#8208;range structure of this MOF is preserved in the presence of water during several days, little is known about the formation of defects, which cannot be detected using diffraction techniques. We apply here 17O solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy at 18.8&#8197;T to investigate the reactivity of UiO&#8208;66, through the exchange of oxygen atoms between the different sites of the MOF and water. For that purpose, we have selectively enriched in 17O isotope the carboxylate groups of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) by using it with 17O&#8208;labeled terephthalic acid prepared using mechanochemistry. In the presence of water at 50&#8201;&#176;C and a following dehydration at 150&#8201;&#176;C, we observe an overall exchange of O atoms between COO&#8722; and &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722; sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the three distinct oxygen sites, &#956;3&#8208;OH, &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722; and COO&#8722;, of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) MOF can be enriched in 17O isotope by post&#8208;synthetic hydrothermal treatment in the presence of 17O&#8208;enriched water. These results demonstrate the lability of Zr&#8722;O bonds and the reactivity of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) with water.

         <title>A Two&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as Promising Cathode for Advanced Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional calcium anthraquinone 2,3&#8208;dicarboxy metal&#8208;organic framework (2D CaAQDC MOFs) was synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method, which is firstly used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries and exhibits well cyclic stability. The synthesis of 2D MOFs can well inhibit the dissolution of anthraquinone electrode in the organic electrolyte.







Abstract
Anthraquinone electrode materials are promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to the abundance of anthraquinone and the high theoretical capacity, and good reversibility of the anthraquinone electrodes. However, the active anthraquinone materials are soluble in organic electrolytes, resulting in a sharp decay of capacity during the charge and discharge processes. Herein, we report on a two&#8208;dimensional calcium anthraquinone 2,3&#8208;dicarboxy metal&#8208;organic framework (2D CaAQDC MOF) fabricated using a simple hydrothermal method. The 2D CaAQDC MOF not only effectively inhibits the dissolution of active electrode substances into the electrolyte, but also promotes the diffusion of lithium ion into the pores of the MOF. When used as a cathode for the LIBs, the resulting CaAQDC electrode delivers a high specific capacity of ~100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles, demonstrating its good cycle stability. Even at a high current density of 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, the CaAQDC electrode exhibits a specific capacity of ~60&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The fabricated 2D coordination polymers effectively restrains the dissolution of anthraquinone into the organic electrolyte and enhances the structural stability, which greatly improves the electrochemical performance of anthraquinone. These research results offer a rational molecular design strategy to address the dissolution of this and other active organic electrode materials.

         <title>Enhanced Orientation of Liquid Crystals Inside Micropores of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Having Thermoresponsivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The composite material LC@MOF was synthesized by incorporating liquid crystals (LCs) into the pores of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The LCs were aligned within the pores of the MOFs, even when heated beyond their isotropic phase transition temperature. As the temperature changed, the LCs underwent a change in orientation, resulting in a thermoresponsive birefringence. The LC@MOF is a novel type useful stimuli&#8208;responsive material with potential applications in various fields.







Abstract
With the aim of controlling the orientation of liquid crystals (LCs) toward realizing external stimuli&#8211;responsive materials with tunable functionalities, we synthesized a composite of LCs and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by filling LCs into the pores of MOFs (LC@MOFs) for the first time. The included LCs interact with the MOFs through coordination bonds between the cyano groups of the LCs and the metal ions of the MOFs, enabling the orientation of the LC molecules inside the pores of the MOFs and the realization of birefringence of LC@MOFs. The three&#8208;dimensional nanometer interstice frameworks maintained the LC orientation even at temperatures much higher than the isotropic phase transition temperature of bulk LCs. Furthermore, the orientational state changed upon heating or cooling, inducing temperature&#8208;dependent birefringence. This study provides a new approach to the development of stimuli&#8211;responsive optical materials and stimuli&#8211;responsive MOFs.

         <title>Enhancing Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells with Ionic Liquids: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids (ILs), with their unique combination of high ionic conductivity, oxygen solubility, low volatility, and customizable chemical characteristics, serve as versatile tools to enhance various PEMFC components, from membranes and catalysts to electrodes.







Abstract
Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) represent a promising clean energy solution. However, their widespread adoption faces hurdles related to component optimization. This review explores the pivotal role of ionic liquids (ILs) in enhancing PEMFC performance, focusing on their role in polymer electrolyte membranes, catalyst modification, and other components. By addressing key obstacles, including proton conductivity, catalyst stability, and fuel crossover, ILs provide a pathway towards the widespread commercialization of PEMFCs. In the realm of PEMFC membranes, ILs have shown great potential in improving proton conductivity, mechanical strength, and thermal stability. Additionally, the utilization of ILs as catalyst modifiers has shown promise in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of electrodes by serving as an effective stabilizer to promote the dispersion of metal nanoparticles, and reduce their agglomeration, thereby augmenting catalytic performance. Furthermore, ILs can be tailored to optimize the catalyst&#8208;support interaction, ultimately enhancing the overall fuel cell efficiency. Their unique properties, such as high oxygen solubility and low volatility, offer advantages in terms of reducing mass transport and water management issues. This review not only underscores the promising advancements achieved thus far but also outlines the challenges that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of ILs in PEMFC technology, offering a valuable resource for researchers and engineers working toward the realization of efficient and durable PEMFCs.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalysed Direct Arylation of Distyrylbenzene: Strong Dual&#8208;state Fluorescence and Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distyrylbenzenes (DSBs) are well&#8208;known for their strong multicolour fluorescence. Fluorescence tuning of DSB via further functionalization/arylation, on the other hand, is uncommon. This paper reports a Pd&#8208;catalysed direct arylation approach for introducing different aryl groups onto fluorobenzene&#8208;containing DSB moiety (7) in high yields (67&#8208;72%). The versatile methodology allows the substitution of neutral, electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich aryl groups. The electron&#8208;deficient aryls render mono&#8208;substitution, while the electron&#8208;rich counterparts promote di&#8208;substitution. The compounds (1&#8208;6) show blue, green, and yellow fluorescence in both the solution and solid states; the fluorescence quantum yields reach 100% and the peak maxima span from 425 to 560 nm. The mono&#8208;carbazole DSB(5) exhibit white light emission(WLM) in polar solvents (acetone, DMF, CH3CN, DMSO and NMP) with very high fluorescence quantum yields(&#981;f) of 60&#8208;80%. For WLM, such high efficiency (&#981;f) is somewhat uncommon. Moreover, visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR reversible electrochromism is demonstrated by the TPA&#8208;integrated DSB(6). The colour of 6 changes from pristine light yellow to orange, and the absorption maxima shifts from 372 to 1500 nm when a positive potential of 1.0 V vs Ag/Ag+ is applied. Moreover, the system shows high colouration efficiency in the NIR region with fast switching speeds for colouration and decolouration as fast as 0.98s and 1.05s.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented non&#8208;AAIPEX protocol has been developed to access diverse monosubstituted cationic polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds (cPHACs) from the readily available azolium salts and phenacyl bromides via Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem annulation cum aromatization. This atom&#8208;economic protocol executes a range of intermediate steps e.g. double C&#8208;H activation, nucleophilic addition, annulation, and dehydration cum aromatization in one&#8208;pot manner under the generation of H2O as the sole byproduct. Moreover, the systematic tunability of photo&#8208;physical and electrochemical properties of these new class of cPHACs can be authenticated from the DFT calculated frontier molecular orbital energies that might be beneficial for their potential applications in optoelectronics and DNA intercalation.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the Reactions of Aliphatic Imines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the context of a project aiming at the replacement of the 3&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;lactam ring in classical &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics by an N(3)&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazetidinone moiety, we have investigated the reaction of isocyanates with imines derived from allyl glycinate and differently substituted propionaldehydes. Imines of aromatic aldehydes with anilines have been reported to react with acyl isocyanates to give 1,3&#8208;diazetidinones or 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, via [2+2] or [4+2] cycloaddition, respectively. However, neither of these products was formed with imines derived from allyl glycinate and 2&#8208;(mono)methyl propionaldehydes. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dimethylation of the imine enabled the [4+2] cycloaddition pathway, but the desired 1,3&#8208;diazetidinone products were not observed. Surprisingly, the imines obtained from thioesters of 2,2&#8208;dimethyl 3&#8208;oxo propionic acid reacted with aryl isocyanates or with benzyl isocyanate to give 5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;dioxo&#8208;6&#8208;(aryl&#8208;/alkylthio)tetrahydropyrimidines, via thiol displacement and re&#8208;addition to a putative six&#8208;membered iminium intermediate. These experimental results obtained for the reactions could be rationalized by DFT calculations. In addition, we have shown that N(3)&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazetidinone and 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one products can be distinguished based on experimental IR data in combination with theoretical reference spectra employing the IR spectra alignment (IRSA) algorithm.

         <title>Hydroamination of Triisopropylsilyl Acetylene Sulfur Pentafluoride &#8211; a Bench&#8208;top Route to Pentafluorosulfanylated Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pentafluorosulfanyl group has been proposed as a valuable addition to the toolbox of organofluorine chemistry. Here, we introduce commercially available (triisopropylsilyl)acetylene sulfur pentafluoride (TASP) as a versatile reagent that provides very low&#8208;risk access to the elusive class of &#945;&#8208;SF5 aldehyde enamines under benchtop conditions. This approach allowed these precious building blocks to be accessed and fully characterized for the first time.







Abstract
Synthetic access to a variety of aliphatic and vinylic pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks remains a major challenge in contemporary organofluorine chemistry hampering its investigation in the context of medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and functional materials. Herein, we report a bench&#8208;top protocol to access the virtually unknown class of &#945;&#8208;SF5&#8208;enamines under mild reaction conditions in good to excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;%). This reaction combines the protodesilylation of the commercially available precursor TASP with the in&#8197;situ hydroamination of HC&#8801;C&#8722;SF5. The on&#8208;site use of highly toxic gases or corrosive reagents is avoided, making access to this motif applicable to a wide chemical audience. The excellent E&#8208;diastereoselectivity of this two&#8208;step cascade reaction is suggested to be the result of the convergence of the fast Z&#8208;/E&#8208; isomerization of a vinyl anion as well as the isomerization of the iminium ion. The remarkable thermal stability of these SF5&#8208;enamines encourages further studies of their synthetic utility.

         <title>A Rational Design of Electrochemically and Photophysically Tunable Triarylamine Luminophores by Consecutive (Pseudo&#8209;)Four&#8208;Component Syntheses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The concatenation of Suzuki coupling and two&#8208;fold Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination in sequentially palladium&#8208;catalyzed consecutive multicomponent syntheses paves a concise, convergent route to diversely functionalized para&#8208;biaryl&#8208;substituted triarylamines (p&#8208;bTAAs) from simple, readily available starting materials. An extensive library of p&#8208;bTAAs permits comprehensive investigations of their electronic properties by absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and quantum chemical calculations, which contribute to a deep understanding of their electronic structure. The synthesized p&#8208;bTAAs exhibit tunable fluorescence from blue to yellow upon photonic excitation with quantum yields up to 98% in solution and 92% in the solid state. Furthermore, a pronounced bathochromic shift of the emission maxima by increasing solvent polarity indicates positive emission solvatochromism. Aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/water mixtures causes the formation of intensely blue fluorescent aggregates. Cyclic voltammetry shows reversible first and second oxidations of p&#8208;bTAAs at low potentials, which are tunable by variation of the introduced para substituents. 3D Hammett plots resulting from the correlation of oxidation potentials and emission maxima with electronic substituent parameters emphasize the rational design of tailored p&#8208;bTAAs with predictable electrochemical and photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The generation of open&#8208;shell intermediates under mild conditions has opened broad synthetic opportunities during this century. However, these reactive species require a tailored tuning of experimental parameters in order to efficiently convert substrates into products. This time&#8208;consuming process is often case&#8208;specific and requires an iteration for each new method. We report a general approach that can overcome these ubiquitous limitations for several visible&#8208;light promoted energy&#8208;transfer processes. The use of either naphthalene (5&#8208;20 equiv.) or simple binaphthyl derivatives (10&#8208;30 mol%) greatly increases their efficiency, giving rise to a new strategy for catalysis. The trend is consistent among different media, photocatalysts, light sources and substrates, allowing one to improve existing methods, to more easily optimize conditions for new ones, and, moreover, to disclose otherwise inaccessible reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of quasi solid electrolytes in organic based electrochromic devices: A mini review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interest in all solid organic based electrochromic devices (ECDs) is on the increase. This is because these devices offer the applicability of electrochromic materials in products such as smart sensors, smart windows, flexible wearables and energy storage devices. The use of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes for the construction of these ECDs is attractive because of their ease of preparation, availability, low cost, improve electrochromic performance, good ionic conductivity and prevention of leakages in ECDs. Hence, in this review, a detailed discussion is presented on the progress in the development of semi&#8208;solid electrolytes for ECDs fabrication. The preparation of the most common electrolytes that have been applied for organic based ECDs are summarized. Particular attention is given to efforts and strategies that have been adopted to improve the efficiency of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes. Importantly, knowledge gaps that warrant further research are clearly identified and recommendations for future works are suggested. This review will be very beneficial for both established and new researchers in the field of electrochromic devices and material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Crystalline Nanoparticles via Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: Morphology Evolution and Function Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarized the morphology evolution, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and potential application of liquid crystalline (LC) nanoassemblies by polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly(PISA). Under the regulation of LC ordering and PISA process, LC nanoassemblies showed abundant morphologies and specific formation evolution. According to the LC mesogen, the studies were divided into fluoro&#8208;containing, azobenzene, poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) and others to be introduced respectively.







Abstract
Liquid crystalline nanoparticles (LC NPs) are a kind of polymer NPs with LC mesogens, which can form special anisotropic morphologies due to the influence of LC ordering. Owing to the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of the LC blocks, LC NPs show abundant morphology evolution behaviors in response to external regulation. LC NPs have great application potential in nano&#8208;devices, drug delivery, special fibers and other fields. Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) method can synthesize LC NPs at high solid content, reducing the harsh demand for reaction solvent of the LC polymers, being a better choice for large&#8208;scale production. In this review, we introduced recent research progress of PISA&#8208;LC NPs by dividing them into several parts according to the LC mesogen, and discussed the improvement of experimental conditions and the potential application of these polymers.

         <title>Enhancing Intrinsic Magnetic Hardness by Modulating Antagonistic Interactions in the Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Free Magnetic Solid Solution Hf2Fe1&#8722;&#948;Ru5&#8722;xIrx+&#948;B2</title>

Experimental and computational investigations of the solid solution Hf2Fe1&#8722;&#948;Ru5&#8722;xIrx+&#948;B2 show that modulating antagonistic magnetic interactions enables the realization of permanent magnets at room temperature.







Abstract
The quinary members in the solid solution Hf2Fe1&#8722;&#948;Ru5&#8722;xIrx+&#948;B2 (x=1&#8211;4, VE=63&#8211;66) have been investigated experimentally and computationally. They were synthesized via arc&#8208;melting and analyzed by EDX and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted a preference for magnetic ordering in all members, but with a strong competition between ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetism arising from interchain Fe&#8722;Fe interactions. The spin exchange and magnetic anisotropy energies predicted the lowest magnetic hardness for x=1 and 3 and the highest for x=2. Magnetization measurements confirm the DFT predictions and demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic ordering (TN=55&#8211;70&#8197;K) found at low magnetic fields changed to ferromagnetic (TC=150&#8211;750&#8197;K) at higher fields, suggesting metamagnetic behavior for all samples. As predicted, Hf2FeRu3Ir2B2 has the highest intrinsic coercivity (Hc=74&#8197;kA/m) reported to date for Ti3Co5B2&#8208;type phases. Furthermore, all coercivities outperform that of ferromagnetic Hf2FeIr5B2, indicating the importance of AFM interactions in enhancing magnetic anisotropy in these materials. Importantly, two members (x=1 and 4) maintain intrinsic coercivities in the semi&#8208;hard range at room temperature. This study opens an avenue for controlling magnetic hardness by modulating antagonistic AFM and FM interactions in low&#8208;dimensional rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free magnetic materials.

         <title>Proton transfer and regulation across chemical interfaces by small&#8208;molecule assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study proton transport across a membrane mimic composed of the liquid&#8208;liquid interface between an aqueous solution and an organic solution. The proton transport across this membrane mimic can be quantified and analyzed by impedance spectroscopy. We show that the interfacial proton movement is controlled by the pH of the aqueous phase and cross&#8208;membrane proton transfer rate is higher at lower pHs. We utilize proton transporters found in the electron transport chain such as ubiquinols and 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenol to further influence the rate of proton shuttling. The ubiquinols are effective in transporting protons across the membrane when paired with a reducing agent that activates their high rate cross&#8208;membrane proton movement. 2,4&#8208;Dinitrophenol's acts as a pH activated proton transporter only active at pH&gt;4.







Abstract
We report on measurements and control of proton gradient across interfaces of water and dichloroethane. Such interfaces are interesting as mimics of biological membranes. We use impedance spectroscopy to quantify interfacial proton gradient and identify proton transfer modes. We quantify proton movement using reciprocal of time constant (&#964;&#8722;1) acquired from electrochemical impedance modeling. We show that proton gradient across interfaces of water/dichloroethane and &#964;&#8722;1 correlate with the aqueous phase pH, changing from ca. 1&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;1 to 0.2&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;7. &#964;&#8722;1 changes in the presence of proton shuttling fat&#8208;soluble molecules. Dinitrophenol acts as a pH activated proton coupler which is active at around neutral pH and inert at pH &lt;4. However, quinone type cofactors change the interfacial proton transport when activated by redox reactions with ferrocene type molecules, such as decamethyl ferrocence (DMFc). Quinone type cofactors show distinct features in their impedance response assigned to a proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, different from the uncoupled proton transfer activity of dinitrophenol. The observed PCET reaction significantly changes &#964;&#8722;1. We use &#964;&#8722;1 as a proton transport descriptor. In particular, CoQ10&#8208;DMFc shows a &#964;&#8722;1 of 3.5&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;7, indicating how small&#8208;molecule assemblies change proton availability.

2&#8208;Mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines reveal remarkable bonding preference in linear bis&#8208;coordinate silver(I) and halogen(I) complexes investigated in 15&#8197;N NMR solution spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and Density Functional Theory.







Abstract
The coordination nature of 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with electron&#8208;withdrawing halogen and electron&#8208;donating methyl groups for [N&#8722;X&#8722;N]+ (X=I, Br) complexations have been studied using 15N NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The 15N NMR chemical shifts reveal iodine(I) and bromine(I) prefer to form complexes with 2&#8208;substituted pyridines and only 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine. The crystalline halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;substituted pyridines were characterized by using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, but 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines were unable to form stable crystalline halogen(I) complexes due to the lower nucleophilicity of the pyridinic nitrogen. In contrast, the halogen(I) complexes of 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine, which has a more basic nitrogen, are characterized by X&#8208;crystallography, which complements the 15N NMR studies. DFT calculations reveal that the bond energies for iodine(I) complexes vary between &#8722;291 and &#8722;351&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and for bromine between &#8722;370 and &#8722;427 kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The bond energies of halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;halopyridines with more nucleophilic nitrogen are 66&#8208;76&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 larger than those of analogous 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines with less nucleophilic nitrogen. The experimental and DFT results show that the electronic influence of ortho&#8208;halogen substituents on pyridinic nitrogen leads to a completely different preference for the coordination bonding of halogen(I) ions, providing new insights into bonding in halogen(I) chemistry.

         <title>Mn(III) O^N^O Complexes as Water&#8208;tolerant and Environmentally Benign Catalysts for Polyurethane Foam Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salicaldimine&#8208;based O^N^O&#8208;pincer complexes of Mn(III) and Fe(III) serve as excellent, environmentally benign catalysts for the preparation of polyurethane foams. These compounds show high activities, stability in aqueous environments and are non&#8208;volatile, and are therefore suitable alternatives to Sn&#8208; or amine&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Polyurethanes are synthesized on industrial scale by the reaction of diisocyanates with diols in the presence of catalysts which are commonly based on tin complexes and amines. However, due to the toxicity and volatility of these tin catalysts and amines, there is the need to develop new catalysts that are more environmentally benign. Herein, we report the synthesis of O^N^O pincer&#8208;ligated Mn(III) and Fe(III) complexes that serve as suitable catalysts for urethane formation and are stable to hydrolysis as predicted by computations and observed experimentally. The O^N^O pincer scaffold is vital to the activity of these catalysts, simultaneously ensuring increased solubility in the reaction medium as well as providing a stable framework upon dissociation of co&#8208;ligands in the catalytic cycle. In silico mechanistic investigations for urethane formation show that the stabilization of active species in square&#8208;planar geometries enabled by these O^N^O ligands permit the simultaneous coordination of alcohol and isocyanate in suitable configuration at the metal center.

         <title>H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;B(C6F5)3&#8208;Catalyzed para&#8208;Alkylation of Anilines with Alkenes Applied to Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Non&#8208;Steroidal Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Drugs</title>

         <dc:description>
We describe a new method for the selective para&#8208;alkylation of anilines. The approach has been applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and has allowed the identification of new structures with improved anti&#8208;inflammatory properties.







Abstract
Anilines are core motifs in a variety of important molecules including medicines, materials and agrochemicals. We report a straightforward procedure that allows access to new chemical space of anilines via their para&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation. The method utilizes commercially available catalytic H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;B(C6F5)3 and is highly selective for para&#8208;C&#8208;alkylation (over N&#8208;alkylation and ortho&#8208;C&#8208;alkylation) of anilines, with a wide scope in both the aniline substrates and alkene coupling partners. Readily available alkenes are used, and include new classes of alkene for the first time. The mild reaction conditions have allowed the procedure to be applied to the late&#8208;stage&#8208;functionalization of non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including fenamic acids and diclofenac. The formed novel NSAID derivatives display improved anti&#8208;inflammatory properties over the parent NSAID structure.

         <title>Short&#8208;Process Regeneration of Highly Stable Spherical LiCoO2 Cathode Materials from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries through Carbonate Precipitation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A creative co&#8208;precipitation strategy to synthesize spherical Al doped precursors and cathode materials with ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) as precipitant from sulfuric acid leaching has been demonstrated by optimal parameters. And the cell with as&#8208;regenerated Al&#8208;doped LiCoO2 cathode material delivers excellent cyclic stability and rate performance, realizing the high&#8208;efficiency recycling and utilization of high&#8208;value Li and Co.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficacy recycling of spent lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) batteries is one of the key tasks in realizing a global resource security strategy due to the rareness of lithium (Li) and cobalt (Co) resources. However, it is of great significance to develop the innovative recycle methods for spent LiCoO2, simultaneously realizing the efficient recovery of valuable elements and the regeneration of high&#8208;performance LiCoO2. Herein, a novel strategy of regenerating LiCoO2 cathode is proposed, which involves the preparation of micro&#8208;spherical aluminum (Al)&#8208;doped lithium&#8208;lacked precursor (Li2xCo1&#8722;x&#8722;yAl2/3yCO3, remarked as &#8220;PLCAC&#8221;) via ammonium bicarbonate coprecipitation. The comprehensive conditions affecting particle growth kinetics, morphology and particle size the has been investigated in detail by physical characterizations and electrochemical measurements. And the optimized Al&#8208;doped LiCoO2 materials with high&#8208;density sphericity (LiCo1&#8722;zAlzO2, remarked as &#8220;LCAO&#8221;) shows a high initial specific capacity of 161&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and excellent capacity retention of 99.5&#8201;% within 100 cycles at 1&#8197;C in the voltage range of 2.8 to 4.3&#8197;V. Our work provides valuable insights into the featured design of LiCoO2 precursors and cathode materials from spent LiCoO2 batteries, potentially guaranteeing the high&#8208;efficacy recycling and utilization of strategic resources.

         <title>Metal Activation Produces Different Reaction Environments for Intermediates during Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Widely used metal pretreatment&#8211;activation methods create different environments experienced by oxidative&#8208;addition intermediates, during the synthesis of organozinc reagents from organohalides and zinc metal. A developed fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) method reveals these differences.







Abstract
Commercial zinc metal powder requires activation for consistent and reliable use as a reductant in the formation of organozinc reagents from organohalides, and for the avoidance of supplier and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability. However, the impact of activation methods on the reaction environments of subsequent intermediates has been unknown. Herein, a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) method is developed to bridge this knowledge gap, by imaging and examining reaction intermediates on zinc metal that has been activated by pretreatment through different common methods (i.&#8201;e., by chemical activation with TMSCl, dibromoethane, or HCl; or by mechanical activation). The group of chemical activating agents, previously thought to act similarly by removing oxide layers, are here shown to produce markedly different reaction environments experienced by subsequent oxidative&#8208;addition intermediates from organohalides &#8211; data uniquely available through FLIM's ability to detect small quantities of intermediates in&#8197;situ coupled with its microenvironmental sensitivity. These different microenvironments potentially give rise to different rates of formation, subsequent solubilization, and reactivity, despite the shared &#8220;[RZnX]&#8221; molecular structure of these intermediates. This information revises models for methods development for oxidative addition to currently sluggish metals beyond zinc by establishing diverse outcomes for pretreatment activation methods that were previously considered similar.

         <title>Anthraquinone&#8208;Modified Silica Nanoparticles as Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for the Oxidative Hydroxylation of Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of a heterogeneous photocatalyst based on surface&#8208;modified spherical silica nanoparticles with anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid are presented. The nanomaterial was successfully applied in the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to produce phenols in high yields with low catalyst loading and was reused at least five. This heterogeneous system demonstrated promising catalytic activity for conducting organic transformations under sustainable conditions.







Abstract
In this work, the synthesis and characterization of a heterogeneous photocatalyst based on spherical silica nanoparticles superficially modified with anthraquinone 2&#8208;carboxylic acid (AQ&#8722;COOH) are presented. The nanomaterial was characterized by TEM, SEM, FT&#8208;IR, diffuse reflectance, fluorescence, NMR, DLS, XRD and XPS. These analyses confirm the covalent linking of AQ&#8722;COOH with the NH2 functionality in the nanomaterial and, more importantly, the photocatalyst retains its photophysical properties once bound. The heterogeneous photocatalyst was successfully employed in the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols under sustainable reaction conditions. Phenols were obtained in high yields (up to 100&#8201;%) with low catalyst loading (3.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), reaching TOF values of 3.7&#8197;h&#8722;1. Using 2&#8208;propanol as solvent at room temperature, the visible light photocatalysis produced H2O2 as a key intermediate to promote the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. The heterogeneous photocatalyst was reused at least 5 times, without modification of the nanomaterial structure and morphology. This simple heterogeneous system showed great catalytic activity under sustainable reaction conditions.

         <title>Thermochromic Afterglow from Benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic Acid&#8208;doped Co&#8208;crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The afterglow color of benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acid (BDBA)&#8208;doped co&#8208;crystals with trimethylolpropane (TMP) varied from bluish to greenish color towards an increase of temperature from &#8722;132 to 40&#8201;&#176;C. Based on the photophysical properties of co&#8208;crystals and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, the molecular distortions at the singlet excited states enhanced the spin&#8208;orbit coupling to improve the intersystem crossing rate of BDBA ester.







Abstract
The accurate thermosensing requires a minimum impact of autofluorescence and light scattering from the samples. In this study, we discovered that commercially available benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acid (BDBA) doped co&#8208;crystals with trimethylolpropane (TMP) exhibit excellent thermochromic dual phosphorescence properties over a wide temperature range from &#8722;132 to 40&#8201;&#176;C, despite its simple structure that does not have any donor&#8208;acceptor linkage. The dual phosphorescence was consisted of monomeric benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronate (BDBA ester) and aggregation&#8208;stabilized species. With an increase in temperature, the emission intensity from the monomeric state significantly decreased, whereas that originating from the aggregated state remained almost constant owing to the difference in their thermal stabilities. Further investigation revealed that molecular distortions in singlet excited states enable efficient intersystem crossing, causing efficient phosphorescence from the monomeric state of BDBA ester.

         <title>A Powerful P&#8722;N Connection: Preparative Approaches, Reactivity, and Applications of P&#8208;Stereogenic Aminophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New catalytic possibilities in the synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine chalcogenides and boranes serve as an expansion in addition to established methods based on chiral auxiliaries. Stereoselective transformations into valuable building blocks facilitate catalyst design for use in organocatalytic and transition metal&#8208;based applications. Here, we present the main achievements of the last decades regarding synthesis, stereocontrolled reactivities, and catalytic applications of P&#8208;stereogenic P&#8722;N&#8208;based compounds.







Abstract
For more than five decades, P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine chalcogenides and boranes have attracted scientific attention and are still in the focus of ongoing research. In the last years, novel transition metal&#8208;based synthesis methods have been discovered, in addition to the long&#8208;known use of chiral auxiliaries. Enantiomerically pure compounds with N&#8722;P+&#8722;X&#8722; (X=O, S, BH3) motifs served as valuable reactive building blocks to provide new classes of organophosphorus derivatives, thereby preserving the stereochemical information at the phosphorus atom. Over the years, intriguing applications in organocatalysis and transition metal catalysis have been reported for some representatives. Asymmetric reductions of C=C, C=N, and C=O double bonds were feasible with selected P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine oxides in the presence of hydrogen transfer reagents. P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine boranes could be easily deprotected and used as ligands for various transition metals to enable catalytic asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins and imines. This review traces the emergence of a synthetically and catalytically powerful functional compound class with phosphorus&#8208;centered chirality in its main lines, starting from classical approaches to modern synthesis methods to current applications.

         <title>Dimerization and Crowding in the Binding of Interleukin 8 to Dendritic Glycosaminoglycans as Artificial Proteoglycans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrimers bind proteins more strongly, but not too many: Under physiological conditions, the pro&#8208;inflammatory protein interleukin&#8208;8 is found in an equilibrium of a monomer and a dimeric form. We find that synthetic GAG dendrimers, constructed of highly sulfated GAG&#8208;tetrasaccharides, bind protein monomers with increased affinity, thereby promoting protein dimerization. Thus, dendritic GAG are useful models for branched GAG structures found in&#8208;vivo such as proteoglycans. However, as space is limited in dendritic GAG, crowding reduces protein affinities.







Abstract
The interactions of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) with proteins of the extracellular matrix govern and regulate complex physiological functions including cellular growth, immune response, and inflammation. Repetitive presentation of GAG binding motifs, as found in native proteoglycans, might enhance GAG&#8208;protein binding through multivalent interactions. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of dendritic GAG oligomers constructed of nonasulfated hyaluronan tetrasaccharides for investigating the binding of the protein chemokine interleukin 8 (IL&#8208;8) to artificial, well&#8208;defined proteoglycan architectures. Binding of mutant monomeric and native dimerizable IL&#8208;8 was investigated by NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Dendritic oligomerization of GAG increased the binding affinity of both monomeric and dimeric IL&#8208;8. Monomeric IL&#8208;8 bound to monomeric and dimeric GAG with KD values of 7.3 and 0.108&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. The effect was less pronounced for dimerizable wild&#8208;type IL&#8208;8, for which GAG dimerization improved the affinity from 34 to 5&#8197;nM. Binding of dimeric IL&#8208;8 to oligomeric GAG was limited by steric crowding effects, strongly reducing the affinity of subsequent binding events. In conclusion, the strongest effect of GAG oligomerization was the amplified binding of IL&#8208;8 monomers, which might concentrate monomeric protein in the extracellular matrix and thus promote protein dimerization under physiological conditions.

The effect was less pronounced for dimerizable wild-type IL-8, for which GAG dimerization improved the affinity from 34 to 5&#8197;nM. Binding of dimeric IL-8 to oligomeric GAG was limited by steric crowding effects, strongly reducing the affinity of subsequent binding events. In conclusion, the strongest effect of GAG oligomerization was the amplified binding of IL-8 monomers, which might concentrate monomeric protein in the extracellular matrix and thus promote protein dimerization under physiological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mono(Lewis Base)&#8208;Stabilized Gallium Iodide: An Unexplored Class of Promising Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculations suggest that Lewis base stabilized GaI (LB&#8594;GaI) complexes exhibit promising ligand properties and are capable of displaying metallomimetic behavior.







Abstract
Quantum&#8208;chemical (DFT) calculations on hitherto unknown base(carbene)&#8208;stabilized gallium monoiodides (LB&#8594;GaI) suggest that these systems feature one lone pair of electrons and a formally vacant p&#8208;orbital &#8211; both centered at the central gallium atom &#8211; and exhibit metallomimetic behavior. The calculated reaction free energies as well as bond dissociation energies suggest that these LB&#8594;GaI systems are capable of forming stable donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with group 13 trichlorides. Examination of the ligand exchange reactions with iron and nickel complexes indicates their potential use as ligands in transition metal chemistry. In addition, it is found that the title compounds are also able to activate various enthalpically robust bonds. Further, a detailed mechanistic investigation of these small molecule activation processes reveals the non&#8208;innocent behavior of the carbene (base) moiety attached to the GaI fragment, thereby indicating the cooperative nature of these bond activation processes. The energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and activation strain model (ASM) of reactivity were also employed to quantitatively understand and rationalize the different activation processes.

         <title>Kinetic and Thermodynamic Control of Supramolecular Aggregation of Near Infrared Pyrrolopyrrole Cyanine Fluorophores Confined in Colloidal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the kinetic and thermodynamic control of the supramolecular aggregation of a cyanine dye and its derivatives confined within colloidal nanoparticles. The aggregation number, aggregation states, and optical properties of the chromophores can be manipulated by optimizing the alkyl and polymer chains attached, as well as adjusting the effective dye concentration and surfactants.







Abstract
Control of the intermolecular aggregation of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules as chromophores is crucial for tuning their physical properties such as light absorption/emission, and energy and charge transfer. Lots of advances have been achieved in control of intermolecular aggregation of organic chromophores in solid states where an indefinitely large number of molecules are involved. However, much less understanding has been gained at a mesoscale of aggregates formed by well&#8208;defined organization of a deterministic number of chromophores, which has been realized in natural photosynthetic systems but still remains rare in manmade materials. Here, we report both the kinetic and the thermodynamic control of the supramolecular aggregation of a near&#8208;infrared cyanine dye, PPcy, and its derivatives confined in colloidal nanoparticles stabilized by surfactants in aqueous media. Our results demonstrate that both the aggregation number, the aggregation state and the optical properties of the PPcy chromophores are controllable through optimization of the alkyl and polymer chains tethered from PPcy, the effective concentration of the chromophore inside each particle, and the surfactants utilized to stabilize the colloids in water.

         <title>Modeling Amine Methylation in Methyl Ester Cavitand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding and methylation reaction of eight amines in a resorcinarene&#8208;based methyl ester cavitand are studied computationally using a combination of molecular dynamics and density functional theory techniques. The origins of the experimentally&#8208;observed rate acceleration compared to the solution reactions are analyzed.







Abstract
Methylation of amines inside an introverted resorcinarene&#8208;based deep methyl ester cavitand is investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations. Experimentally, the cavitand has been shown to bind a number of amines and accelerate the methylation reaction by more than four orders of magnitude for some of them. Eight different amines are considered in the present study, and the geometries and energies of their binding to the cavitand are first characterized and analyzed. Next, the methyl transfer reactions are investigated and the calculated barriers are found to be in generally good agreement with experimental results. In particular, the experimentally&#8208;observed rate acceleration in the cavitand as compared to the solution reaction is well reproduced by the calculations. The origins of this rate acceleration are analyzed by computational modifications made to the structure of the cavitand, and the role of the solvent is discussed.

         <title>The Fluoride Method: Access to Silver(III) NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unfolding novel metal carbenes: Silver(III) carbene complexes with square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometries are reported. These unprecedented organosilver(III) compounds exhibit remarkable stability: In the solid state they evolve into mixed&#8208;valence Ag(I)/Ag(III) compounds only at high temperatures (&gt;185&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
We have synthesized the first silver(III) carbene complexes, (CF3)3Ag(NHC), by direct reaction of the silver(III) fluoride precursor complex [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] with different imidazolium salts. This novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. The silver(III) carbene complexes thus prepared are unprecedented and show remarkable thermal stabilities. They display square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometry. Following our calculations, the electronic structure of a model representative complex exhibits Inverse Ligand Field (ILF). The compounds reported herein are synthetic analogues of the elusive difluorocarbene and carbonyl species proposed as intermediates in the acidic decomposition of [Ag(CF3)4]&#8722;. The synthetic procedure reported is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition&#8208;metals in high oxidation states.

         <title>Starfruit&#8208;Shaped Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: From 3D Intermediates to 2D Nanosheet Petals with Enhanced Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel starfruit&#8208;shaped metal&#8211;organic framework (SMOF) composed of zirconium and tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine linkers has been fabricated. The unique morphology of the SMOF, characterized by 2D nanosheet petals grown through edge&#8208;sharing, arises from 3D PCN&#8208;222 MOF intermediates. The distinct morphology of the SMOF leads to superior catalytic activity in detoxifying G&#8208;type nerve agent and blister agent simulants, surpassing that of its 3D counterparts. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8208;a. Tao, J. Wang, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302835).

         <dc:description>Proteases are involved in many essential biological processes. Dysregulation of their activity underlies a wide variety of human diseases. Photopharmacology, as applied on various classes of proteins, has the potential to assist protease research by enabling spatiotemporal control of protease activity. Moreover, it may be used to decrease side&#8208;effects of protease&#8208;targeting drugs. In this review, we discuss the current status of the chemical design of photoactivatable proteases inhibitors and their biological application.

         <title>Mapping the Catalytic&#8208;Space for the Reactivity of Metal&#8208;free Boron Nitride with O2 for H2O&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Methane to HCHO and CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal based catalysts have been widely employed to catalyze partial oxidation of light alkanes. Recently, metal&#8208;free hexagonal&#8208;boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has emerged as a promising catalyst for the oxidation of CH4 to HCHO and CO; however, the intricate catalytic surface of h&#8208;BN at molecular and electronic levels remains inadequately understood. Key questions include how electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms in h&#8208;BN reduce O2, and whether the partial oxidation of methane over h&#8208;BN exhibits similarities to traditional transition&#8208;metal catalysts. In our study, we computationally&#8208;mapped in&#8208;detail the surface catalytic&#8208;space of h&#8208;BN for methane oxidation. We considered different structures of h&#8208;BN and show that these structures contain numerous sites for O2 binding and therefore various routes for methane oxidation are possible. The activation barriers for methane oxidation via various paths vary from ~83 to ~123 kcal mol&#8722;1. To comprehend the differences in activation barriers, we employed geometrical, orbital and distortion/interaction analysis (DIA). Orbital analysis reveals that methane activation over h&#8208;BN in presence of dioxygen follows a standard hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. It is also shown that water plays an intriguing role in reducing the barrier for HCHO and CO formation by acting as a bridge.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconstructing Best&#8208;in&#8208;Class Neoglycoclusters as a Tool for Dissecting Key Multivalent Processes in Glycosidase Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalency represents an appealing option to modulate selectivity in enzyme inhibition and transform moderate glycosidase inhibitors into highly potent ones. The rational design of multivalent inhibitors is however challenging because global affinity enhancement relies on several interconnected local mechanistic events, whose relative impact is unknown. So far, the largest multivalent effects ever reported for a non&#8208;polymeric glycosidase inhibitor have been obtained with cyclopeptoid&#8208;based inhibitors of Jack bean &#945;&#8208;mannosidase (JB&#945;&#8208;man). Here, we report a structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) study based on the top&#8208;down deconstruction of best&#8208;in&#8208;class multivalent inhibitors. This approach provides a valuable tool to understand the complex interdependent mechanisms underpinning the inhibitory multivalent effect. Combining SAR experiments, binding stoichiometry assessments, thermodynamic modelling and atomistic simulations allowed us to establish the significant contribution of statistical rebinding mechanisms and the importance of several key parameters, including inhitope accessibility, topological restrictions, and electrostatic interactions. Our findings indicate that strong chelate&#8208;binding, resulting from the formation of a cross&#8208;linked complex between a multivalent inhibitor and two dimeric JB&#945;&#8208;man molecules, is not a sufficient condition to reach high levels of affinity enhancements. The deconstruction approach thus offers unique opportunities to better understand multivalent binding and provides important guidelines for the design of potent and selective multiheaded inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Influence on Cyaphide&#8208;Azide 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions: Aromaticity and Activation Strain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The factors governing 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions involving C[[EQUATION]]P&#8208;containing compounds are computationally explored in detail using quantum chemical tools. To this end, the parent process involving tBuN3 and tBuCP is analyzed and compared to the analogous reaction involving organometallic cyaphide complexes (metal = Ag, Pt, Ge, Mg), in order to understand the role of the metal fragment in such transformations. It is found that while the metal fragment does not significantly influence the aromaticity of the corresponding concerted transition states or the regioselectivity of the transformation, it may modify the reactivity of the cyaphide complexes (i.e. Ge and Mg cyaphide complexes are comparatively more reactive). The computed reactivity trends and the factors behind the regioselectivity of the cycloaddition reaction are quantitatively analyzed with the help of the activation strain model in combination with the energy decomposition analysis method.</dc:description>

These compounds, [Zn(&#954;2&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3))Br2] (R = Me, 1; R = H, 2), were shown to be capable of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 at &#8208;2.3 V vs. Fc+/0 to selectively yield CO in mixed water/acetonitrile solutions. These complexes also electrocatalytically generate H2 from water in acetonitrile solutions, at the same potential, with Faradaic efficiencies of up to 90%. DFT computations support a proposed mechanism involving the first reduction of 1 or 2 occurring at the PN3P ligand. Furthermore, computational analysis suggested a mechanism involving metal&#8208;ligand cooperation of a Lewis acidic Zn(II) and a basic ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategies towards Advanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts at Large Current Densities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen (H2), produced by water electrolysis with the electricity from renewable sources, is an ideal energy carrier for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral and sustainable society. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the cathodic half&#8208;reaction of water electrolysis, which requires active and robust electrocatalysts to reduce the energy consumption for H2 generation. Despite numerous electrocatalysts have been reported by the academia for HER, most of them were only tested under relatively small current densities for a short period, which cannot meet the requirements for industrial water electrolysis. To bridge the gap between academia and industry, it is crucial to develop highly active HER electrocatalysts which can operate at large current densities for a long time. In this review, the mechanisms of HER in acidic and alkaline electrolytes are firstly introduced. Then, design strategies towards high&#8208;performance large&#8208;current&#8208;density HER electrocatalysts from five aspects including number of active sites, intrinsic activity of each site, charge transfer, mass transfer, and stability are discussed via featured examples. Finally, our own insights about the challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorogenic Rhodamine Probes with Pyrrole Substitution Enables STED and Lifetime Imaging of Lysosomes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorogenic dyes with high brightness, large turn&#8208;on ratios, excellent photostability, favorable specificity, low cytotoxicity, and high membrane permeability are essential for high&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging in live cells. In this study, we endowed these desirable properties to a rhodamine derivative by simply replacing the N, N&#8208;diethyl group with a pyrrole substituent. The resulting dye, Rh&#8208;NH, exhibited doubled Stokes shifts (54 nm) and a red&#8208;shift of more than 50 nm in fluorescence spectra compared to Rhodamine B. Rh&#8208;NH preferentially exists in a non&#8208;emissive but highly permeable spirolactone form. Upon binding to lysosomes, the collective effects of low pH, low polarity, and high viscosity endow Rh&#8208;NH with significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on, making it a suitable candidate for wash&#8208;free, high&#8208;contrast lysosome tracking. Consequently, Rh&#8208;NH enabled us to successfully explore stimulated emission depletion (STED) super&#8208;resolution imaging of lysosome dynamics, as well as fluorescence lifetime imaging of lysosomes in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of 2&#8208;Pyridone Fluorophores for Brighter Emissions at Longer Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent discovery of blue fluorophores with high quantum yields based on pyridone structures inspired the development of new low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluorophores with bright emissions at tunable wavelengths, which are highly attractive for various applications. In this study, we propose a rational design strategy for 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;based fluorophores with bright emissions at long wavelengths. With a detailed understanding of the positional substitution effects on each carbon atom of the 2&#8208;pyridone core, we developed a bright blue fluorophore (&#955;abs = 377 nm; &#955;em = 433 nm; &#949; = 13,200 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1; &#632;F = 88%) through C3&#8208;aryl and C4&#8208;ester substitutions followed by cyclization. Furthermore, by applying the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) principle, we invented a bright green fluorophore through C3&#8208; and C4&#8208;diester and C6&#8208;aryl substitutions. The ICT fluorophore based on the pyridone structure shows large molar absorptivity (&#949; = 20,100 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1), longer emission wavelength (&#955;em = 539 nm), high emission quantum yield (&#632;F = 74%), and large Stokes shift (&#916;v = 5720 cm&#8722;1), which are comparable to those of practical&#160; fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;activity Relationship Study to Develop Peptide Amphiphiles as Species&#8208;Specific Antimicrobials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial peptide amphiphiles (PAs) are a promising class of molecules that can disrupt the bacterial membrane or act as drug nanocarriers. In this study, we prepared 33 PAs to establish supramolecular structure&#8208;activity relationships. We studied the morphology and activity of the nanostructures against different Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains (such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii). Next, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the key contributors to activity. We found that for S. aureus, the zeta potential was the major contributor to the activity while Gram&#8208;negative bacteria were more influenced by the partition coefficient (LogP) with the following order P. aeruginosa &gt; E. coli &gt; A. baumannii. We also performed a study of the mechanism of action of selected PAs on the bacterial membrane assessing the membrane permeability and depolarization, changes in zeta potential and overall integrity. We studied the toxicity of the nanostructures against mammalian cells. Finally, we performed an in vivo study using the wax moth larvae to determine the therapeutic efficacy of the active PAs. This study shows cationic PA nanostructures can be an intriguing platform for the development of nanoantibacterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Catalytic Efficiency of D&#8208;lactonohydrolase through the Synergy of Tunnel Engineering, Evolutionary Analysis, and Force&#8208;Field Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Computational design advances enzyme evolution and their use in biocatalysis in a faster and more efficient manner. In this study, a synergistic approach integrating tunnel engineering, evolutionary analysis, and force&#8208;field calculations has been employed to enhance the catalytic activity of D&#8208;lactonohydrolase (D&#8208;Lac), which is a pivotal enzyme involved in the resolution of racemic pantolactone during the production of vitamin B5. The best mutant, N96S/A271E/F274Y/F308G (M3), was obtained and its catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) was nearly 23&#8208;fold higher than that of the wild&#8208;type. The M3 whole&#8208;cell converted 20% of DL&#8208;pantolactone into D&#8208;pantoic acid (D&#8208;PA, &gt;99% e.e.) with a conversion rate of 47% and&#160;space&#8208;time&#160;yield&#160;of&#160;107.1&#160;g L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, demonstrating its great potential for industrial&#8208;scale D&#8208;pantothenic acid production. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the reduction in the steric hindrance within the substrate tunnel and conformational reconstruction of the distal loop resulted in a more favourable"catalytic" conformation, making it easier for the substrate and enzyme to enter their pre&#8208;reaction state. This study illustrates the potential of the distal residue on the pivotal loop at the entrance of the D&#8208;Lac substrate tunnel as a novel modification hotspot capable of reshaping energy patterns and consequently influencing the enzymatic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct growth control of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria using visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive novel photoswitchable antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In addition to the discovery of new (modified) potent antibiotics to combat antibiotic resistance, there is a critical need to develop novel strategies that would restrict their off&#8208;target effects and unnecessary exposure to bacteria in our body and environment. We report a set of new photoswitchable arylazopyrazole&#8208;modified norfloxacin antibiotics that present a high degree of bidirectional photoisomerization, impressive fatigue resistance and reasonably high cis half&#8208;lives. The irradiated isomers of most compounds were found to exhibit nearly equal or higher antibacterial activity than norfloxacin against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Notably, against norfloxacin&#8208;resistant S. aureus bacteria, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive p&#8208;SMe&#8208;substituted derivative showed remarkably high antimicrobial potency (MIC of 0.25 &#181;g/mL) in the irradiated state, while the potency was reduced by 24&#8208;fold in case of its non&#8208;irradiated state. The potency was estimated to be retained for more than 7 hours. This is the first report to demonstrate direct photochemical control of the growth of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria and to show the highest activity difference between irradiated and non&#8208;irradiated states of a photoswitchable antibiotic. Additionally, both isomers were found to be non&#8208;harmful to human cells. Molecular modellings were performed to identify the underlying reason behind the high&#8208;affinity binding of the irradiated isomer to topoisomerase IV enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Is Simultaneous Binding to DNA and Gyrase Important for the Antibacterial Activity of Cystobactamids?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cystobacamids are aromatic oligoamides that exert their natural antibacterial properties by inhibition of bacterial gyrases. Such aromatic oligoamides were proposed to inhibit a&#8208;helix&#8208;mediated protein&#8208;protein interactions and may serve for specific recognition of DNA. Based on this suggestion, we designed new derivatives that have duplicated cystobactamid triarene units as model systems to decipher the specific binding mode of cystobactamids to double stranded DNA. Solution NMR analyses revealed that natural cystobactamids as well as their elongated analogues show an overall bent shape at their central aliphatic unit, with an average CX&#8208;CY&#8208;CZ angle of ~110 degrees. Our finding is corroborated by the target&#8208;bound structure of close analogues, as established by cryo&#8208;EM very recently. Cystobactamid CN&#8208;861&#8208;2 binds directly to the bacterial gyrase with an affinity of 9 &#181;M, and also exhibits DNA&#8208;binding properties with specificity for AT&#8208;rich DNA. Elongation/dimerization of the triarene subunit of native cystobactamids is demonstrated to lead to an increase in DNA binding affinity. This implies that cystobactamids&#8217; gyrase inhibitory activity necessitates not just interaction with the gyrase itself, but also with DNA via their triarene unit.</dc:description>

Cystobactamid CN-861-2 binds directly to the bacterial gyrase with an affinity of 9 &#181;M, and also exhibits DNA-binding properties with specificity for AT-rich DNA. Elongation/dimerization of the triarene subunit of native cystobactamids is demonstrated to lead to an increase in DNA binding affinity. This implies that cystobactamids&#8217; gyrase inhibitory activity necessitates not just interaction with the gyrase itself, but also with DNA via their triarene unit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dextrans, Pullulan and Lentinan, New Scaffold Materials for Use as Hydrogels in Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of hydrogels based on dextrans, pullulan and lentinan to be used in biomedical applications including tissue engineering is reported. Despite the fact that selected polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid are well established, little is known, how these polysaccharides can be chemically modified to create hydrogels under controlled conditions. In this study we present a small library of chemically modified polysaccharides which are used for a divergent approach to achieve biomedical relevant hydrogels. In this case the crosslinking is based on thio ether formation between thiol modified donor and vinylsulfone or maleimide modified acceptor components. Successful synthesis of the linker systems and coupling at the polysaccharides, hydrogel formation takes place under physiological conditions. We extended the study by coupling small molecules like adhesion factors for increasing&#160;  cell compatibility  as well as a dye for further studies. The different hydrogels were studied to their rheological properties, water uptake, their permeability, biodegrability and their cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The direct observation of reactive intermediates is an important issue for organic synthesis. However, intermediates with an extreme instability are hard to be monitored by common spectroscopic methods such as FTIR. We have developed synthetic method utilizing flow microreactors, which enables a generation and reactions of unstable intermediates. Herein we report that, based on our flowmicro techniques, we developed an in&#8208;line analysis method for reactive intermediates in increments of milliseconds. We demonstrated the direct observation of the living and dead species of the anionic polymerization of alkyl methacrylates. The direct information of the living species enabled the anionic polymerization and copolymerization of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylates, which is the important but difficult reaction in the conventional method.</dc:description>

         <title>Epoxide&#8208;Mediated Trans&#8208;Thioglycosylation and Application to the Synthesis of Oligosaccharides Related to the Capsular Polysaccharides of C. Jejuni HS:4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enzyme&#8208;resistant thioglycosides are highly valuable immunogens because of their enhanced metabolic stability. We report the first synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides related to the capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4 for potential use in conjugate vaccines. The native CPS structures of the pathogen consist of a challenging repeating disaccharide formed with &#946;(1&#224;4)&#8208;linked 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine; the rare 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl backbone and &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration of the former monosaccharide makes the synthesis of this family of antigens extremely challenging.&#160; So far, no synthesis of the thioanalogs of the CPS antigens have been reported. The unprecedented and elegant synthesis presented in this work is built on an elegant approach by using &#946;&#8208;glycosylthiolate as a glycosyl donor to open the 2,3&#8208;epoxide functionality of pre&#8208;designed 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;talo&#8208;heptopyranosides. Our results illustrated that this key trans&#8208;thioglycosylation can be designed in a modular and highly regio and stereo&#8208;selective manner. Built on the success of this novel approach, we succeed the synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides including a thiohexasaccharide which is considered to be the desired antigen length and complexity for immunizations. We also report the first direct conversion of base&#8208;stable but acid&#8208;labile 2&#8208;trimethylsilylethyl glycosides to glycosyl&#8208;1&#8208;thioacetates in a one&#8208;pot manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral NHC Ligands for Enantioselective Gold(I) Catalysis Under Aerobic Conditions: the Importance of Conformational Flexibility and Steric Hindrance of NHC Ligand on Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterically hindered yet active: A new family of chiral NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;Cl complexes, bearing sterically encumbered NHC ligands, has been accessed by merging anilines with commercially available chiral aminoalcohols and amines. Evaluation of the catalytic activity in enantioselective allenol cyclization has pointed out the importance of the steric hindrance and conformational flexibility of the NHC core for reactivity. Ion metathesis between NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;Cl and AgOTs, required for the activation of the gold complex, appeared to be very slow in commonly used MeNO2, in contrast to DCM.







Abstract
Gold(I) catalysis has been recognized as a valuable tool for the unique transformation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Enantioselective &#960;&#8208;catalysis based on gold(I) complexes is, however, still underdeveloped due to lack of privileged ligands. Herein, we present an accessible method to a new family of stable yet catalytically active chiral NHC&#8722;Au(I)&#8722;Cl complexes. The key to preserving a simultaneous fine balance between reactivity and stability in this newly developed family appears to be sterically hindered, but conformationally flexible NHC ligands. These could be easily accessed on a multigram scale by merging sterically hindered anilines with commercially available amino alcohols and amines via a four&#8208;steps synthetic sequence without the need for chromatographic purification. Further investigations of the catalytic activity of NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;Cl complexes identified the OH functionality incorporated into the NHC core as crucial for the level of enantioselectivity as well as the TsO&#8722; anion responsible for the activation of NHC&#8722;Au(I)&#8722;Cl. Finally, NMR studies and X&#8208;ray investigations revealed for the first time that the widely accepted ion metathesis (NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;Cl to NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;OSO2R) responsible for the activation of NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;Cl complexes does not take place (or it is very slow) in commonly used MeNO2 in contrast to DCM.

Further investigations of the catalytic activity of NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;Cl complexes identified the OH functionality incorporated into the NHC core as crucial for the level of enantioselectivity as well as the TsO&#8722; anion responsible for the activation of NHC&#8722;Au(I)&#8722;Cl. Finally, NMR studies and X-ray investigations revealed for the first time that the widely accepted ion metathesis (NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;Cl to NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;OSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) responsible for the activation of NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;Cl complexes does not take place (or it is very slow) in commonly used MeNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in contrast to DCM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidation&#8208;state sensitive light&#8208;induced dynamics of Ruthenium&#8208;4H&#8208;Imidazole complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient absorption spectro&#8208;electrochemistry allows for a more thorough understanding of excited state dynamics of intermediates in solar energy conversion processes. In this study it is reported, that the lifetime of the deactivation pathway of short&#8208;lived excited states of oxidized Ruthenium(II) 4H&#8208;imidazole photosensitizers can be varied by two orders of magnitude by the presence and type of multi&#8208; or monodentate ligands.







Abstract
Oxidized molecular states are key intermediates in photo&#8208;induced redox reactions, e.&#8201;g., intermolecular charge transfer between photosensitizer and catalyst in photoredox catalysis. The stability and longevity of the oxidized photosensitizer is an important factor in optimizing the respective light&#8208;driven reaction pathways. In this work the oxidized states of ruthenium(II)&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazole dyes are studied. The ruthenium complexes constitute benchmark photosensitizers in solar energy interconversion processes with exceptional chemical stability, strong visible light absorption, and favourable redox properties. To rationalize the light&#8208;induced reaction in the oxidized ruthenium(III) systems, we combine UV&#8208;vis absorption, resonance Raman, and transient absorption spectroelectrochemistry (SEC) with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Three complexes are compared, which vary with respect to their coordination environment, i.&#8201;e., combining an 4H&#8208;imidazole with either 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) or 2,2&#8242;;6&#8242;2&#8220;&#8208;terpyridine (tpy) coligands, and chloride or isothiocyanate ligands. While all oxidized complexes have similar steady state absorption properties, their excited state kinetics differ significantly; the study thus opens the doorway to study the light&#8208;driven reactivity of oxidized molecular intermediates in intermolecular charge transfer cascades.

         <title>Hydride&#8208;Containing Pt&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;rich Nanoclusters: Synthesis, Structure, and Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To optimize the HER performance, the size, composition, and structure of bimetallic PtH&#8722;Cu NCs are controlled with atomic precision. The addition of CF3COOH to cluster 1 resulted in the structural change from a bicapped icosahedral Cu14 cage encapsulating a linear PtH2 unit (HER&#8208;inactive cluster) to a vertex&#8208;missing Cu11 cuboctahedron encaging a PtH moiety in cluster 2 (HER&#8208;active cluster) and distorted 3,3,4,4,4&#8208;pentacapped trigonal prismatic Cu11 cage enclosing a PtH2 unit in cluster 3. Cluster 2 reveals the highest HER activity among the bimetallic NC catalysts with a near&#8208;zero onset potential (&#951;) of &#8722;0.03&#8197;V (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
A structurally precise hydride&#8208;containing Pt&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;rich nanocluster [PtH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)6] (1) has been synthesized. It consists of a bicapped icosahedral Cu14 cage that encapsulates a linear PtH2 unit. Upon the addition of two equivalents of CF3COOH to 1, two hydrido clusters are isolated. These clusters are [PtHCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)4] (2), which is a vertex&#8208;missing Cu11 cuboctahedron encaging a PtH moiety, and [PtH2Cu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)3] (3), a distorted 3,3,4,4,4&#8208;pentacapped trigonal prismatic Cu11 cage enclosing a PtH2 unit. The electronic structure of 2, analyzed by Density Functional Theory, is a 2e superatom. The electrocatalytic activities of 1&#8211;3 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were compared. Notably, Cluster 2 exhibited an exceptionally excellent HER activity within metal nanoclusters, with an onset potential of &#8722;0.03&#8197;V (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a Tafel slope of 39&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and consistent HER activity throughout 3000&#8197;cycles in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4. Our study suggests that the accessible central Pt site plays a crucial role in the remarkable HER activity and may provide valuable insights for establishing correlations between catalyst structure and HER activity.

         <title>The Effect of Conformational Freedom vs Restriction on the Rate in Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Monohydrogenation of Dienones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was found that the conformation of an unsaturated carbonyl is extremely important for the reactivity in iridium catalyzed hydrogenation. This reactivity difference is used for a novel type of regioselective hydrogenation of dienes in which the (s)&#8208;cis configured olefin is preferentially hydrogenated. The regiodiscrimination overrules the conventional reactivity order in substitution pattern in iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of olefins.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation constitutes an efficient strategy for the preparation of chiral molecules. When dienes are subjected to hydrogenation, control over regioselectivity still presents a large challenge and the fully saturated alkane is often yielded. A few successful monohydrogenations of dienes have been reported, but hitherto these are only efficient for dienes comprised of two distinctly different olefins. Herein, the reactivity of a conjugated carbonyl compound as a function of their conformational freedom is studied, based on a combined experimental and theoretical approach. It was found that alkenes in the (s)&#8208;cis conformation experience a large rate acceleration while (s)&#8208;trans restrained alkenes undergo hydrogenation slowly. Ultimately, this reactivity aspect was exploited in a novel method for the monohydrogenation of dienes based on conformational restriction ((s)&#8208;cis vs (s)&#8208;trans). This mode of discrimination conceptually differs from existing monohydrogenations and dienones constructed of two olefins similar in nature could efficiently be hydrogenated to the chiral alkene (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The extent of regioselection is even powerful enough to overcome the conventional reactivity order of substituted olefins (di&gt;tri&gt;tetra). This high yielding and atom&#8208;economical protocol provides an interesting opportunity to instal a stereogenic center on a carbocycle, while leaving a synthetically useful alkene untouched.

         <title>Investigation of the Chemisorption&#8208;Catalysis Behavior of Sulfur Species on the Electrocatalysts Designed by Co&#8208;regulation Strategy of Anions and Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical research has demonstrated that co&#8208;regulation strategy of anions and cations is an effective approach to tune the electronic structure and physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts. FeCo2Se4 and CuCo2Se4 combined appropriate affinity with superior electronic conductivity and catalytic capacity have been rapidly and economically discovered as novel electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries.







Abstract
Li&#8208;S batteries possess high energy density and have been one of the most promising energy storage systems. For sulfur cathodes, the electrochemical performance is still seriously hindered by the polysulfide shuttling and sluggish conversion kinetics. It has been demonstrated to be one effective strategy to address the above issues via designing electrocatalysts with robust affinity and catalytic capacity towards polysulfides. However, it is still a great challenge to rapidly and economically discover high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Herein, using density functional theory calculation, we studied the chemisorption&#8208;catalysis behavior of sulfur species on a series of electrocatalysts (MCo2X4, M=Co, Zn, Cu, Ni, Fe, and Mn, X=O, S, and Se) to assess the effect of the anions and cations co&#8208;regulation on their electronic structure, chemisorption behavior, and catalytic property. FeCo2Se4 and CuCo2Se4 combined appropriate chemisorption with superior electronic conductivity and sulfur reduction catalytic capacity have been predicted as novel electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries. This study gives theoretical guidance for rapid discovery of high&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst to boost the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathodes.

     alt="Investigation of the Chemisorption-Catalysis Behavior of Sulfur Species on the Electrocatalysts Designed by Co-regulation Strategy of Anions and Cations"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretical research has demonstrated that co-regulation strategy of anions and cations is an effective approach to tune the electronic structure and physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts. FeCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CuCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; combined appropriate affinity with superior electronic conductivity and catalytic capacity have been rapidly and economically discovered as novel electrocatalysts for high-performance Li-S batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li-S batteries possess high energy density and have been one of the most promising energy storage systems. For sulfur cathodes, the electrochemical performance is still seriously hindered by the polysulfide shuttling and sluggish conversion kinetics. It has been demonstrated to be one effective strategy to address the above issues via designing electrocatalysts with robust affinity and catalytic capacity towards polysulfides. However, it is still a great challenge to rapidly and economically discover high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, using density functional theory calculation, we studied the chemisorption-catalysis behavior of sulfur species on a series of electrocatalysts (MCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, M=Co, Zn, Cu, Ni, Fe, and Mn, X=O, S, and Se) to assess the effect of the anions and cations co-regulation on their electronic structure, chemisorption behavior, and catalytic property. FeCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CuCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; combined appropriate chemisorption with superior electronic conductivity and sulfur reduction catalytic capacity have been predicted as novel electrocatalysts for high-performance Li-S batteries. This study gives theoretical guidance for rapid discovery of high-efficient electrocatalyst to boost the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Efficient red thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials consisting of cyano&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;diphenyldipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine acceptors and triphenylamine donors are reported, and the significant influence of cyano substituents on photophysical property and electroluminescence performance are elucidated. High&#8208;performance red OLEDs are achieved, providing excellent external quantum efficiencies of 28.8&#8201;% at 616&#8197;nm and 20.2&#8201;% at 648&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Red luminescent materials are essential components for full color display and white lightening based on organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology, but the extension of emission color towards red or deep red region generally leads to decreased photoluminescence and electroluminescence efficiencies. Herein, we wish to report two new luminescent molecules (2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA) consisting of cyano&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;diphenyldipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine acceptors and triphenylamine donors. As the increase of cyano substituents, the emission wavelength is greatly red&#8208;shifted and the reverse intersystem crossing process is promoted, resulting in strong red delayed fluorescence. Meanwhile, due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the molecular structures become rigidified and planarized, which brings about large horizontal dipole ratios. As a result, 2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA can perform as emitters efficiently in OLEDs, furnishing excellent external quantum efficiencies of 28.8&#8201;% at 616&#8197;nm and 20.2&#8201;% at 648&#8197;nm, which are significantly improved in comparison with that of the control molecule without cyano substituents. The findings in this work demonstrate that the introduction of cyano substituents to the acceptors of delayed fluorescence molecules could be a facile and effective approach to explore high&#8208;efficiency red or deep red delayed fluorescence materials.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Enthalpy Compensation in Solvent Geometry Regulated Supramolecular Polymerization of Luminescent Napthalimide via a Non&#8208;Cooperative, Isodesmic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrated the supramolecular polymerization of a luminescent napthalimide semiconductor in a J&#8208;type aggregation fashion in linear (dodecane) and cyclic (decalin) hydrocarbon&#8208;based solvents. It follows non&#8208;cooperative isodesmic mechanism in both the solvents, but the strength of self&#8208;assembly and gelation were found to be stronger in linear solvent due to matching geometry operated favorable van der Waals interactions with the peripheral alkyl chains.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are an important class of materials with fascinating functions and properties originated from the dynamic behavior and highly ordered molecular organizations. Here, a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor based functionalized luminescent napthalene monoimide (NMI) undergoes J&#8208;type self&#8208;assembly by non&#8208;covalent interactions via a non&#8208;cooperative, isodesmic mechanism to form supramolecular 1D nanowire. The fundamental insights into the thermodynamics regulating the supramolecular polymerization were derived through the fitting of the isodesmic model to variable temperature UV/Vis data in linear (dodecane) and nonliner hydrocarbon (decalin) based solvents. This shows a significant role of entropy&#8208;enthalpy compensation in solvent geometry&#8208;regulated formation and stabilization of supramolecular polymer. Furthermore, we have quantitively estimated the influence of solvent geometry and found that NMI forms stronger self&#8208;assembly and spontaneous gel in linear hydrocarbon based solvent compared to nonliner one and thereby substantially increases the degree of polymerization in linear hydrocarbon solvent (dodecane). This is accredited to the effective influence of the linear hydrocarbon solvent molecules in the polymerization process by favourable van der waals interactions with the peripheral alkyl chains of the NMI monomers in contrast to unfavourable interaction of nonliner hydrocarbon solvent due to geometry mismatch.

         <title>Urea&#8208;Promoted Neat Synthesis of Fused Dihydroisoquinolines and Disubstituted Pyridines: A Mechanistic Observation with Molecular&#8208;Sensing Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise and efficient synthesis of fused isoquinolines has been established by using an environmentally friendly neat approach. In this method, the electrocyclic reaction is emphasized over the typical aza&#8208;Michael addition. This green methodology allows the synthesis of various isoquinolines, including the alkaloid decumbenine B and a fluorophore that selectively detects picric acid.







Abstract
An efficient and short synthesis of fused dihydroisoquinolines, diaryl substituted pyridine derivatives in good to high yields has been established by using an environmentally safe, solvent&#8208;metal&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free tandem approach. In this article, we discuss how the electrocyclic reaction is more pronounced in the solid phase in the presence of urea, whereas the typical aza&#8208;Michael addition is more prominent in presence of arylamine in the solution phase for 3&#8208;(2&#8208;formylcycloalkenyl)acrylic ester derivative substrates. The wide range of substrates and urea&#8208;promoted neat synthesis made our approach more significant in medical and also analytical science. Moreover, an isoquinoline alkaloid decumbenine&#8197;B analogue has been synthesized by using our newly developed neat methodology. We have also investigated the photophysical properties of the synthesized fused dihydroisoquinoline derivatives. One of the synthesized molecules was used as a sensor for the selective detection of toxic picric acid. Therefore, the effective neat synthesis and molecular sensing applications of these compounds made our approach more exciting in the field of heterocyclic chemistry.

         <title>More Electropositive is More Electronegative: Atom Size Determines C=X Group Electronegativity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More electropositive is more electronegative! The C=X group electronegativity is increased when the electronegativity of X is decreased down a group of the Periodic Table. Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses reveal that the steric size of atom X is at the origin of this counterintuitive and unexpected phenomenon.







Abstract
Opposite to what one might expect, we find that the C=X group can become effectively more, not less, electronegative when the Pauling electronegativity of atom X decreases down Groups&#8197;16, 15, and 14 of the Periodic Table. Our quantum&#8208;chemical analyses, show that, and why, this phenomenon is a direct consequence of the increasing size of atom X down a group. These findings can be applied to tuning and improving the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor strength of amides H2NC(=X)R by increasingly withdrawing density from the NH2 group. A striking example is that H2NC(=SiR2)R is a stronger hydrogen&#8208;bond donor than H2NC(=CR2)R.

         <title>Research Progress in Liquid Phase Growth of GaN Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flux and ammonothermal methods are capable of the growth of large size, high quality GaN crystals, which are the main methods of liquid phase growth. The research progress of these two growth methods in terms of chemical additives and growth process is summarised, and their application prospects in industrial production are discussed.







Abstract
As a wide band gap semiconductor, gallium nitride (GaN) has high breakdown voltage, excellent structural stability and mechanical properties, giving it unique advantages in applications such as high frequency, high power, and high temperature. As a result, it has broad application prospects in optoelectronics and microelectronics. However, the lack of high&#8208;quality, large&#8208;size GaN crystal substrates severely limit the improvement of electronic device performance. To solve this problem, liquid phase growth of GaN has attracted much attention because it can produce higher quality GaN crystals compared to traditional vapor phase growth methods. This review introduces two main methods of liquid phase growth of GaN: the flux method and ammonothermal method, as well as their advantages and challenges. It reviews the research history and recent advances of these two methods, including the effects of different solvents and mineralizers on the growth quality and performance of GaN crystals, as well as various technical improvements. This review aims to outline the principles, characteristics, and development trends of liquid phase growth of GaN, to provide more inspiration for future research on liquid phase growth, and to achieve further breakthroughs in its development and commercial application.

         <title>Towards a General Access to 1&#8208;Azaspirocyclic Systems via Photoinduced, Reductive Decarboxylative Radical Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet versatile strategy for the construction of important 1&#8208;azaspirocyclic scaffolds is described. Alkynyl&#8208;tethered N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters, swiftly assembled through an alkylation/deprotection/activation sequence, undergo photoinduced reductive decarboxylative radical 5&#8208;exo and 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclizations employing eosin Y (EY) as inexpensive photocatalyst. The key step can proceed in a diastereoconvergent manner and affords diverse ring systems relevant to medicinal chemistry and natural products.

         <title>Carboranylphosphines: B9&#8208;Substituted Derivatives with Enhanced Reactivity for the Anchoring to Dendrimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several ortho&#8208;carboranes bearing a phenoxy or a phenylamino group in the B9 position were prepared employing various protection and deprotection strategies. Following established protocols, dendritic compounds were synthesized from a hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene or thiophosphoryl chloride core, and possible anchoring options for the B9&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;carboranes were investigated experimentally and theoretically (DFT). Furthermore, 1&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;phosphanyl&#8208;substituted carborane derivatives were obtained. The resulting diethyl&#8208;, diisopropyl&#8208;, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;, diphenyl&#8208; or diethoxyphosphines bearing a tunable ortho&#8208;carborane moiety are intriguing ligands for future applications in homogeneous catalysis or the medicinal sector.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Thiophene&#8209;Bridged Macrocyclic pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral organic molecules possessing high quantum yields, circular dichroism, and circularly polarized luminescence values have great potential as optically active materials for future applications. Recently, the identification of a promising class of inherently chiral compounds was reported, namely macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiyne linked pseudo&#8208;meta[2.2]paracyclophanes, displaying high circular dichroism and related gabs values albeit modest quantum yields. Increasing the quantum yields in an attempt to get bright circularly polarized light emitters, the high&#8208;yielding heterocyclization of those 1,3&#8208;butadiyne bridges resulting in macrocyclic 2,5&#8208;thienyls linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes is herein described. The chiroptical properties of both, the previously reported 1,3&#8208;butadiyne, and the novel 2,5&#8208;thienyl bridged macrocycles of various sizes, are experimentally recorded, and theoretically described using density&#8208;functional theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Partial Hydrogenation and Deuteration of Tetracyclic (Hetero)aromatic Systems Using a Simple Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of added &#8216;3&#8208;dimensionality&#8217; through late&#8208;stage functionalization of extended (hetero)aromatic systems is a powerful synthetic approach. The abundance of starting materials and cross&#8208;coupling methodologies to access the precursors allows for highly diverse products. Subsequent selective partial reduction can alter the core structure in a manner of interest to medicinal chemists. Herein, we describe the precise, partial reduction of multicyclic heteroaromatic systems using a simple heterogeneous catalyst. The approach can be extended to introduce deuterium (again at late&#8208;stage). Excellent yields can be obtained using simple reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>[2,2]Paracyclophane Bridged, Thiophene Based Macrocycles: Synthesis and Electronic Properties in Different Redox States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of through&#8208;space electronic coupling in &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains an underexplored area. In this work, we present the facile synthesis of two isomeric macrocycles (1 and 2) bridged by [2,2]paracyclophane (pCp) and based on thiophene. The structures of these macrocycles have been confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Our investigation centers on their electronic properties across various redox states, with a specific focus on potential through&#8208;space electronic coupling and global aromaticity. Experimental measurements, including UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR electronic absorption, NMR, ESR spectra, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that both the neutral compounds and their tetracations exhibit a closed&#8208;shell ground state. However, their dications manifest as diradical dications with a subtle magnetic exchange interaction. Consequently, the through&#8208;space electronic coupling facilitated by the pCp unit in their respective ground states appears to be weak.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting hydrogen production of a MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalyst with clean interface via facile one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen production from photocatalysis via the usage of multicomponent photocatalysts represents a promising pathway for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, owing to their structural advantages in dealing with the three crucial processes in photocatalysis, namely, light harvesting, charge transfer, and surface redox reactions. We demonstrate the fabrication of a MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalyst, denoted as semiconductor/MOF/cocatalyst, by a one&#8208;pot electrochemical synthetic route. The as&#8208;fabricated multicomponent photocatalyst has a clean interface among the components, leading to close connections that contribute to high&#8208;quality heterojunction and facilitate photogenerated charge transfer and separation, thereby the efficient hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen production rate of the resultant ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/Pt is 1327 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1, which is much higher than that of ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF (15 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1) and pure Zr&#8208;MOF (10.1 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1), as well as the photodeposited&#8208;Pt products ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (287 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1) and Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (192 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1) obtained by the step&#8208;wise synthetic approach.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen production from photocatalysis via the usage of multicomponent photocatalysts represents a promising pathway for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, owing to their structural advantages in dealing with the three crucial processes in photocatalysis, namely, light harvesting, charge transfer, and surface redox reactions. We demonstrate the fabrication of a MOF-based multicomponent photocatalyst, denoted as semiconductor/MOF/cocatalyst, by a one-pot electrochemical synthetic route. The as-fabricated multicomponent photocatalyst has a clean interface among the components, leading to close connections that contribute to high-quality heterojunction and facilitate photogenerated charge transfer and separation, thereby the efficient hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen production rate of the resultant ZrO2/Zr-MOF/Pt is 1327 &#956;mol&#8729;g-1&#8729;h-1, which is much higher than that of ZrO2/Zr-MOF (15 &#956;mol&#8729;g-1&#8729;h-1) and pure Zr-MOF (10.1 &#956;mol&#8729;g-1&#8729;h-1), as well as the photodeposited-Pt products ZrO2/Zr-MOF/PtPD (287 &#956;mol&#8729;g-1&#8729;h-1) and Zr-MOF/PtPD (192 &#956;mol&#8729;g-1&#8729;h-1) obtained by the step-wise synthetic approach. The work gives a good inspiration for the rational design and construction of MOF-based multicomponent photocatalysts through the one-pot electrosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the N&#8208;Hydroxylations Catalyzed by the&#160;Binuclear Iron Domain of SznF enzyme: Key Piece in the Synthesis of Streptozotocin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SznF, a member of the emerging family of heme&#8208;oxygenase&#8208;like (HO&#8208;like) di&#8208;iron oxidases and oxygenases, employs two distinct domains to catalyze the conversion of N&#969;&#8208;methyl&#8208;L&#8208;arginine (L&#8208;NMA) into N&#8208;nitroso&#8208;containing product, which can subsequently be transformed into streptozotocin. Using unrestricted density functional theory (UDFT) with the hybrid functional B3LYP, we have mechanistically investigated the two sequential hydroxylations of L&#8208;NMA catalyzed by SznF's binuclear iron central domain. Mechanism B primarily involves the O&#8208;O bond dissociation, forming Fe(IV)=O, induced by the H+/e&#8722; introduction to the FeA side of &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8208;Fe2(III/III), the substrate hydrogen abstraction by Fe(IV)=O, and the hydroxyl rebound to the substrate N radical. The stochastic addition of H+/e&#8722; to the FeB side (mechanism C) can transition to mechanism B, thereby preventing enzyme deactivation. Two other competing mechanisms, involving the direct O&#8208;O bond dissociation (mechanism A) and the addition of H2O as a co&#8208;substrate (mechanism D), have been ruled out.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Mononuclear N,N,O&#8208;Bound Fe(II) &#945;&#8208;Keto&#8208;Acid Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modelling &#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Enzymes. We employed a bulky, tripodal N,N,O phenolate ligand to synthesise the first example of a mononuclear, N,N,O&#8208;bound iron(II) &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;acid complex. This unique, pentacoordinate complex is a close structural model of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent iron enzymes. The complex undergoes rapid decarboxylation when exposed to O2, thereby mirroring important aspects of native enzyme reactivity.







Abstract
A bulky, tridentate phenolate ligand (ImPh2NNOtBu) was used to synthesise the first example of a mononuclear, facial, N,N,O&#8208;bound iron(II) benzoylformate complex, [Fe(ImPh2NNOtBu)(BF)] (2). The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 2 reveals that the iron centre is pentacoordinate (&#964;=0.5), with a vacant site located cis to the bidentate BF ligand. The M&#246;ssbauer parameters of 2 are consistent with high&#8208;spin iron(II), and are very close to those reported for &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;bound non&#8208;heme iron enzyme active sites. According to&#8197;NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, the structural integrity of 2 is retained in both coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating solvents. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the iron centre has a very low oxidation potential and is more prone to electrochemical oxidation than the redox&#8208;active phenolate ligand. Complex 2 reacts with NO to form a S=3/2 {FeNO}7 adduct in which NO binds directly to the iron centre, according to EPR, UV&#8208;vis, IR spectroscopies and DFT analysis. Upon O2 exposure, 2 undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to form a diiron(III) benzoate complex, [Fe2(ImPh2NNOtBu)2(&#956;2&#8208;OBz)(&#956;2&#8208;OH)2]+ (3). A small amount of hydroxylated ligand was also observed by ESI&#8208;MS, hinting at the formation of a high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediate. Initial reactivity studies show that 2 is capable of oxygen atom transfer reactivity with O2, converting methyl(p&#8208;tolyl)sulfide to sulfoxide.

         <title>Fluorinated Polymer Donors for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last decade, the fluorination of polymer donors has dominated the development of high&#8208;performance OSCs. This review summarized the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, fluorinated polymers and their physical and photovoltaic properties. A concise outlook is presented for fluorinated polymer donors to fulfill the practical application of OSCs.







Abstract
The rapid development of narrow&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has boosted the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs) over 19&#8201;%. The new features of high&#8208;performance NFAs, such as visible&#8208;NIR light absorption, moderate the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), and high crystallinity, require polymer donors with matching physical properties. This emphasizes the importance of methods that can effectively tune the physical properties of polymers. Owning to very small atom size and strongest electronegativity, the fluorination has been proved the most efficient strategy to regulate the physical properties of polymer donors, including frontier energy level, absorption coefficient, dielectric constant, crystallinity and charge transport. Owing to the success of fluorination strategy, the vast majority of high&#8208;performance polymer donors possess one or more fluorine atoms. In this review, the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, the fluorinated polymers which are categorized by the type of donor or acceptor units, and the relationships between the polymer structures, properties, and photovoltaic performances are comprehensively surveyed. We hope this review could provide the readers a deeper insight into fluorination strategy and lay a strong foundation for future innovation of fluorinated polymers.

         <title>Phosphinidenes: Fundamental Properties and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphinidenes are very reactive compounds containing a monocoordinated phosphorus atom, and this class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds serves as versatile intermediates in synthetic phosphorus chemistry. In this Concept we will review the recent experimental progresses in probing the fundamental properties of the prototype phosphinidenes in the triplet and singlet state.







Abstract
Phosphinidenes are heavy congeners of nitrenes that have been broadly used as in&#8197;situ reagents in synthetic phosphorus chemistry and also serve as versatile ligands in coordination with transition metals. However, the detection of free phosphinidenes is largely challenged by their high reactivity and also the lack of suitable synthetic methods, rendering the knowledge about the fundamental properties of this class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds limited. Recently, an increasing number of free phosphinidenes bearing prototype structural and bonding properties have been prepared for the first time, thus enabling the exploration of their distinct reactivity from the nitrene analogues. This Concept article will discuss the experimental approaches for the generation of the highly unstable phosphinidenes and highlight their distinct reactivity from the nitrogen analogues so as to stimuate future studies about their potential applications in phosphorus chemistry.

         <title>Zeolite/Polymer Composites Prepared by Photopolymerization: Effect of Compensation Cations on Opacity and Gas Adsorption Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphical abstract: The composition of zeolite influences the photopolymerization process of zeolite/polymer&#8208;based composites. The nature of compensation cations was examined to determine their effect on the opacity of the cured composite (via colorimetric analyses) and on the gas adsorption properties (for water, carbon dioxide and 1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene) on calcined composites.







Abstract
The fabrication of structured zeolite adsorbents through photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing which offers a solution to the limitations of conventional shaping techniques has been demonstrated but many parameters still need to be optimized. In this study, we studied the influence of zeolite compensation cations on the photopolymerization and the composite's properties. Modified zeolites (LTA 4&#8197;A and FAU 13X exchanged with K+, Li+, Sr2+, Ca2+ or Mg2+) were incorporated in PEGDA with BDMK as photoinitiator, and the formulation was cured under mild conditions (LED@405&#8197;nm, room temperature, under air). Our results indicate that the nature of zeolite compensation cations affects the colorimetric properties of polymer/zeolite composites: a better translucency parameter results in higher depth of cure. After calcination at 650&#8201;&#176;C and complete removal of PEGDA, pure zeolitic monoliths were tested for adsorption of gas molecules of interest (carbon dioxide, dichlorobenzene and water). Structured 4&#8197;A and 13X monoliths obtained by 3D printing exhibit comparable adsorption capacity to commercial beads prepared from the same zeolites. This study enhances our understanding of the photopolymerization process involved in the production of polymer/zeolite composites. These composites are used in the fabrication of zeolitic objects through 3D printing, offering potential solutions to various environmental and dental challenges.

         <title>Heterometallic AuI6AgI6 Macrocyclic Cluster Templated by a Supramolecular Melamine Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The AuI6AgI6 macrocyclic cluster has been constructed by a supramolecular templating approach. The bilayered tri&#8208;deprotonated melamine dimer [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722;]2 held together with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions is observed for the first time, and it is important for the highly ordered alignment of metal atoms. The supramolecular templates containing multiple symmetric binding sites present a facile approach to functional metal clusters.







Abstract
The application of supramolecular templates in aligning atomically precise heterometal arrays is important for pursuing functional materials. Herein, we report that a bilayered supramolecular tri&#8208;deprotonated melamine dimer functions as an effective template in the construction of a heterometallic gold(I)&#8208;silver(I) macrocyclic cluster [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722;]2&#8722;AuI6AgI6. X&#8208;ray single crystal structural analysis showed that a crown&#8208;like AuI6AgI6 macrocycle is aligned around two parallelly stacked &#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722; moieties hold together with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Theoretical calculations revealed that the [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722;]2 motif dominantly contributes to the near&#8208;occupied orbitals in the electronic structure, which is closely related to its luminescence properties. This work demonstrates that the supramolecular templates containing multiple symmetric binding sites may present a facile approach in the construction of functional metal clusters.

The coordination chemistry of the homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;dinuclear tetrahedral molybdenum complexes [Mo2E2] (E=P, As, Sb) and [Mo2PE] (E=As, Sb) towards [(dppf)Cu(MeCN)2][BF4] are presented showing structural evidence of the side&#8208;on &#951;2&#8208;coordination of the tetrahedral [Mo2PE] and [Mo2E2] complexes and a rare &#951;1&#8208;coordination of the [Mo2PSb] complex.







Abstract
Novel isomorphous tetranuclear complexes, [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;E2{CpMo(CO)2}2]BF4 [E=P (1), As (4), Sb (5), (dppf=1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;ferrocene)] and [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE{CpMo(CO)2}2]BF4 [E=As (2), Sb(3)] were synthesized from the reactions between [(dppf)Cu(MeCN)2][BF4] and tetrahedral molybdenum complexes containing unsubstituted homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;diatomic group&#8208;15 elements [(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;E2{CpMo(CO)2}2] [E=P (A), As (D), Sb (E)] and [(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE{CpMo(CO)2}2] [E=As (B), Sb (C)], respectively. In all these products, the {Mo2E2} or {Mo2PE} moieties coordinate the Cu(I) center via a rare side&#8208;on &#951;2&#8208;coordination mode. The X&#8208;ray structure analyses of [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;PSb{CpMo(CO)2}2][BF4] demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of an &#951;1&#8208;coordination mode for the ligand complex C to coordinate to the Cu(I) center. All the products were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Electrochemical studies also revealed the formation of 1&#8211;5, and, further, to understand the structure and bonding of the products, theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) were conducted.

         <title>Characterization by Gel Permeation Chromatography of the Molecular Weight of Supramolecular Polymers Generated by Forming Polyrotaxanes through the Introduction of External Stoppers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers find wide applications across diverse domains, and the molecular weight exerts a critical influence on their applicability. Consequently, the measurement of molecular weight for supramolecular polymers assumes paramount significance. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) requiring low&#8208;concentration condition is a common characterization employed for molecular weight determination, which is not suitable for supramolecular polymers possessing concentration&#8208;independence property. Here, to break this threshold, we synthesized M1 embodying dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) moiety as well as dibenzylammonium salt (DBA) group, which was capable of self&#8208;assembling into supramolecular polymers terminated with aldehyde groups at its end. Upon the addition of (4&#8208; (1,2,2&#8208;Triphenylvinyl) phenyl) methylamine (TPE&#8208;NH2), supramolecular polymers underwent a transition into polyrotaxanes, for which it was led by the generation of imine bonds. By virtue of GPC, the molecular weight of polyrotaxanes was obtained, then it was available to gain the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers with the help of transformation efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Potential of Fused Heterocycle&#8208;Based Triarylhydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of triarylhydrazone photoswitches was designed, following an idea to control the strength of a hydrogen bond connecting the photo&#8208;active hydrazone part with a heteroaryl substituent. Introducing a benzothiazole moiety results in high overall thermal stability, absorption above 365&#8197;nm, while maintaining satisfactory photoconversion rates. High&#8208;quality calculations and advanced ultrafast spectroscopy allowed the nature of the electronic transitions to be resolved, and the light was shed on the mechanism of photoisomerization and de&#8208;excitation processes.







Abstract
Triarylhydrazones represent an attractive class of photochromic compounds offering many interesting features including high molar absorptivity, good addressability, and extraordinary thermal stability. In addition, unlike most other hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitches, they effectively absorb light above 365&#8197;nm. However, previously prepared triaryhydrazones suffer from low quantum yields of the Z&#8594;E photoisomerization. Here, we have designed a new subclass of naphthoyl&#8208;benzothiazole hydrazones that balance the most beneficial features of previously reported naphthoyl&#8208;quinoline and benzoyl&#8208;pyridine triarylhydrazones. These preserve the attractive absorption characteristics, exhibit higher thermal stability of the metastable form than the former and enhance the rate of the Z&#8594;E photoisomerization compared to the later, as a result of the weakening of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydrazone hydrogen and the benzothiazole moiety. Introducing the benzothiazole motif extends the tunability of the photochromic behaviour of hydrazone&#8208;based switches.

         <title>Biological Evaluation of Isosteric Applicability of 1,3&#8208;Substituted Cuneanes as m&#8208;Substituted Benzenes Enabled by Selective Isomerization of 1,4&#8208;Substituted Cubanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological evaluation of cuneane analogs of ketoprofen, an anti&#8208;inflammatory drug having m&#8208;substituted benzene moiety, was conducted. This study was inspired from the structural similarity of 1,3&#8208;substituted cuneanes with m&#8208;substituted benzene. Selective isomerization of 1,4&#8208;substituted cubanes into 1,3&#8208;substituted cuneanes enabled this evaluation. Biological evaluation of the synthesized analogs of ketoprofen and in silico study of the result of biological study revealed a potential isosteric usage of cuneane skeleton as a m&#8208;substituted benzenes in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
We herein evaluate a biological applicability of 1,3&#8208;substituted cuneanes as an isostere of m&#8208;substituted benzenes based on its structural similarity. An investigation of a method to obtain 1,3&#8208;substituted cuneanes by selective isomerization of 1,4&#8208;substituted cubanes enables this attempt by giving a key synthetic step to obtain a cuneane analogs of pharmaceuticals having m&#8208;substituted benzene moiety. Biological evaluation of the synthesized analogs and in silico study of the obtained result revealed a potential usage of cuneane skeleton in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Photophysical Properties of Asymmetric Fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we reported the one&#8208;pot synthesis, structures, and properties of novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, in comparison with benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs. The different structures and properties can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. A new BODIPY with helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton and intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption was developed.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a one&#8208;pot procedure to synthesize novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs from &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl)&#8208;pyrrole and acylpyrrole, using 5&#8208;exo cyclization as the key transformation. Compared to benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, although they have similar chemical compositions, their structures and properties significantly differ from each other, which can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. Notably, fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPY 1&#8201;b exhibits helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton, intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption, and peak fluorescence. In addition, the pathway of this one&#8208;pot reaction and the mechanism of POCl3 mediated 5&#8208;exo cyclization have been proposed by a combining experimental and computational study.

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dinuclear Gold(I) Complexes. Study of their Structural Features and the Influence of Bridging and Phosphane Ligands in a Catalytic Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear gold(I) complexes with ferrocenylphosphane and different bridging ligands such as, chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate have a significant influence in their reactivity. Chloride&#8208;bridged complexes excel as highly efficient catalysts, while thiolate&#8208;bridged ones exhibit varied conversion rates. Additionally, the use of monophosphane or diphosphane ligands introduces intriguing performance differences, offering prospects for customized catalytic systems.







Abstract
The combination of the ferrocene moiety with gold(I) catalysis remains a relatively unexplored field. In this article, we delve into the synthesis, characterization, and potential catalytic activity of four complexes utilizing both monodentate and bidentate ferrocenyl diphenylphosphane ligands (ppf and dppf), coordinated with two gold(I) metal centers, linked by either chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate bridging ligands. This leads to the formation of cationic &#8220;self&#8208;activated&#8221; precatalysts capable of initiating the catalytic cycle without the need for external additives. The catalytic activity of these complexes was assessed through a model reaction in gold(I) catalysis, specifically the cyclization of a N&#8208;propargylbenzamide to produce an oxazole. In addition, we studied and compared the influence exerted by both the phosphane and the bridging ligand on the performance of these catalysts.

         <title>Incorporating Photoresponses into Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous liquids are a relatively new class of porous material, and while a large proportion of research has been aimed at improving gas capacity and selectivity, there has been less focus on the selective and controllable release of gas from within the material. With a handful of examples now reported, we discuss the concept of photoresponsive porous liquids, aimed at invoking a change in the gas capacity on irradiation with light, and discuss important factors in their design, alongside potential strategies for the realisation of further systems.







Abstract
Porous liquids combine the properties of a porous solid with those of a liquid, creating a porous flowable media. Since their discovery, these materials have gathered widespread interest within the scientific community, with substantial numbers of new systems being discovered, often with a focus on increasing the pore volume and gas capacity. Which begs the question, what does the future hold for porous liquids? Recently, the first examples of photoresponsive porous liquids have emerged, allowing changes in porosity to be observed under UV irradiation. Here, we expand on our previous report of photoresponsive porous liquids and explore the conceptualisation of responsive porous liquids and how these materials could be developed with the ability to respond to light, thereby offering a potential mechanism of controllable uptake and release in these systems. This concept article summarises different approaches that could be used to incorporate a photoresponse in a porous liquid before discussing recently reported systems, alongside important factors to consider in their design. Finally, by taking inspiration from the methods used to translate porous solids into the liquid state, combined with the field of photoresponsive materials, we discuss potential strategies that could be employed to realise further examples of photoresponsive porous liquids.

         <title>Bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane Building Blocks as Promising Benzene and Cycloalkane Isosteres: Multigram Synthesis, Physicochemical and Structural Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence (EDIEA) is an efficient approach to bicyclic fused and bridged mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks. The method is applicable for the multigram preparation of the target compounds, which is illustrated by synthesis of over 50 building blocks on up to 150&#8197;g scale. Physicochemical and structural parameters of the title scaffolds illustrate their utility as promising benzene and cycloalkane isosteres and provide a rationale for fine&#8208;tuning the compound's properties during drug optimization.







Abstract
Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence was used to obtain a series of bridged and fused bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane derivatives (i.&#8201;e., bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, bicyclo[3.2.1]octanes, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes, and bicyclo[4.2.0]heptanes). The scope and limitations of the method were established, and applicability to the multigram synthesis of target bicyclic compounds was illustrated. Using the developed protocols, over 50 mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry were prepared. The synthesized compounds are promising isosteres of benzene and cycloalkane rings, which is confirmed by their physicochemical and structural characterization (pKa, LogP, and exit vector parameters (EVP)). &#8220;Rules of thumb&#8221; for the upcoming isosteric replacement studies were proposed.

         <title>Stacked Covalent Organic Ribbons Perpendicular to Graphene Oxide Sheets; a 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D Design for Photocatalytic Tandem Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth of 1D covalent organic frameworks perpendicularly on the surface of GO nanosheets, a 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D design, improves the photocatalytic performance for many tandem oxidation and hydrogenation reactions. Under white light irradiation, 1D COF nanorods exhibit a superior visible light activity. The improved charge transfer and desirable separation rate obtain through the junction between COR and GO sheets.







Abstract
Development of one dimensional covalent organic frameworks (1D&#8208;COFs) with potential in light absorption and catalysis is still challenging, due to their rapid interpenetration to form 2D and 3D porous structures. Here we report a successful synthesis of imine&#8208;linked 1D covalent organic ribbons (COR), using two simple linear building blocks 1,4&#8208;Benzenediamine (Bda) and [2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine]&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Bpy). The obtained 1D structure with nanorod morphology could keep its physicochemical characteristic properties when it is perpendicular to the surface of graphene oxide (GO) sheets (1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D structure). Due to an AB &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and efficient charge transfer between perpendicular 1D COR and GO sheets, the obtained nanocomposite showed strong visible light absorbance (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) with coefficient of 4.400&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and decreased recombination rate of photogenerated reactive species by 92&#8201;%. The strategy of 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D light driven system greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity in practical applications such as both oxidation and hydrogenation tandem reactions to a rate constant of higher than 0.02&#8197;min&#8722;1. This study presents the first case of 1D covalent organic polymers grown perpendicularly on a carbon&#8208;based layer for boosting electron mobility through the junction between the two components.

         <title>Towards Efficient Polymeric Binders for Transition Metal Oxides&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional PVdF binders still remain some limitations to its use for high&#8208;voltage transition metal oxide cathodes (TMOCs). This review aims at providing a comprehensive summary of the ideal requirements, design strategies and recent progress of polymeric binders for TMOCs. Future design perspectives and promising research technologies for advanced binders for high&#8208;voltage TMOCs are introduced.







Abstract
Transition metal oxide cathodes (TMOCs) such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 have been widely employed in Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to superior operating voltages, high reversible capacities and relatively low cost. Nevertheless, despite significant advancements in practical application, TMOC&#8208;based LIBs face great challenges such as transition metal dissolution and volume expansion during cycling, which jeopardizes the future advance of high&#8208;voltage TMOCs. As a critical component of cathode, polymeric binder acts as a crucial part in maintaining the mechanical and ion/electron conductive integrity between active particles, carbon additives, and the aluminum collector, hence minimizing cathode pulverization during battery cycling. Moreover, Polymeric binder with specialized functions is thought to offer a new solution to enhancing the electrochemical stability of the TMOCs. Therefore, this review aims at providing a comprehensive summary of the ideal requirements, design strategies and recent progress of polymeric binders for TMOCs. Future design perspectives and promising research technologies for advanced binders for high&#8208;voltage TMOCs are introduced.

         <dc:description>
&#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor agonists are used for the treatment of asthma, but also play a role in heart diseases. Several photoswitchable &#946;2&#8208;receptor agonists with nanomolar activity were synthesized and one adrenaline derivative is a one&#8208;digit nanomolar, trans&#8208;on, full agonist for the &#946;2&#8208;receptor. It represents a novel molecular probe for biological studies with high structural similarity to native adrenaline.







Abstract
&#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor (&#946;2&#8208;AR) agonists are used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but also play a role in other complex disorders including cancer, diabetes and heart diseases. As the cellular and molecular mechanisms in various cells and tissues of the &#946;2&#8208;AR remain vastly elusive, we developed tools for this investigation with high temporal and spatial resolution. Several photoswitchable &#946;2&#8208;AR agonists with nanomolar activity were synthesized. The most potent agonist for &#946;2&#8208;AR with reasonable switching is a one&#8208;digit nanomolar active, trans&#8208;on arylazopyrazole&#8208;based adrenaline derivative and comprises valuable photopharmacological properties for further biological studies with high structural accordance to the native ligand adrenaline.

         <title>Improved Interface Construction on Anode and Cathode for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Ultralow&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte Containing Dual&#8208;Additives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared with Li+, Na+ with a smaller stokes radius has faster de&#8208;solvation kinetics. An electrolyte with ultralow sodium salt (0.3 M NaPF6) is used to reduce the cell cost. However, the organic&#8208;dominated interface, mainly derived from decomposed solvents (SSIP solvation structure), is defective for the long cycling performance of sodium ion batteries. In this work, the simple application of dual additives, including sodium difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) and tris(trimethylsilyl)borate (TMSB), is demonstrated to improve the cycling performance of the hard carbon/NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell by constructing interface films on the anode and cathode. A significant improvement on cycling stability has been achieved by incorporating dual additives of NaDFOB and TMSB. Particularly, the capacity retention increased from 17% (baseline) to 79% (w/w, 2.0 wt % NaDFOB) and 83% (w/w, 2.0 wt % NaDFOB and 1.0 wt % TMSB) after 200 cycles at room temperature. Insight into the mechanism of improved interfacial properties between electrodes and electrolyte in ultralow concentration electrolyte has been investigated through a combination of theoretical computation and experimental techniques.</dc:description>

However, the organic-dominated interface, mainly derived from decomposed solvents (SSIP solvation structure), is defective for the long cycling performance of sodium ion batteries. In this work, the simple application of dual additives, including sodium difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) and tris(trimethylsilyl)borate (TMSB), is demonstrated to improve the cycling performance of the hard carbon/NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell by constructing interface films on the anode and cathode. A significant improvement on cycling stability has been achieved by incorporating dual additives of NaDFOB and TMSB. Particularly, the capacity retention increased from 17% (baseline) to 79% (w/w, 2.0 wt % NaDFOB) and 83% (w/w, 2.0 wt % NaDFOB and 1.0 wt % TMSB) after 200 cycles at room temperature. Insight into the mechanism of improved interfacial properties between electrodes and electrolyte in ultralow concentration electrolyte has been investigated through a combination of theoretical computation and experimental techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azaphosphinate Dyes: A Low Molecular Weight Near&#8208;Infrared Scaffold for Development of Photoacoustic or Fluorescence Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes are desirable for biological imaging applications including photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. Nonetheless, current NIR dyes are often plagued by relatively large molecular weights, poor water solubility, and limited photostability. Herein, we provide the first examples of azaphosphinate dyes which display desirable properties such as low molecular weight, absorption/emission above 750 nm, and remarkable water solubility. In PA imaging, an azaphosphinate dye exhibited a 4.1&#8208;fold enhancement in intensity compared to commonly used standards, the ability to multiplex with existing dyes in whole blood, imaging depths of 2.75 cm in a tissue model, and contrast in mice. An improved derivative for fluorescence imaging displayed a &gt;10&#8208;fold reduction in photobleaching in water compared to the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green dye and could be visualized in mice. This new dye class provides a robust scaffold for the development of photoacoustic or NIR fluorescence imaging agents.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Micro&#8208;supercapacitors, emerging as promising micro&#8208;energy storage devices, have attracted significant attention due to their unique features. This comprehensive review focuses on two key aspects: the scalable fabrication of MSCs and their diverse applications. The review begins by elucidating the energy storage mechanisms and guiding principles for designing high&#8208;performance devices. It subsequently explores recent advancements in scalable fabrication techniques for electrode materials and micro&#8208;nano fabrication processes for micro&#8208;devices. The discussion encompasses critical application domains, including multifunctional MSCs, energy storage integration, integrated power generation, and integrated applications. Despite notable progress, there are still some challenges such as large&#8208;scale production of electrode material, well&#8208;controlled fabrication technology, and scalable integrated manufacture. The summary concludes by emphasizing the need for future research to enhance micro&#8208;supercapacitor performance, reduce production costs, achieve large&#8208;scale production, and explore synergies with other energy storage technologies. This collective effort aims to propel MSCs from laboratory innovation to market viability, providing robust energy storage solutions for MEMS and portable electronics.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work establishes the first direct mechanocatalytic reaction protocol within an extruder, focusing on the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. Through the coating of either the extruder screws or barrel with Pd, we executed the cross&#8208;coupling reaction without the reliance on molecular catalyst compounds or powders, and solvents continuously. We identified the influence and interplay of crucial reaction parameters such as temperature, mechanical energy input, residence time, rheology, and catalyst contact time and finally obtained 36% and 75% of the reaction product after one and four reactor passes respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer Clicked Poly(ferrocenylsilanes) at Au Nanoparticles as Platforms with Multiple Functions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamers are widely used in biosensing due to their specific sensitivity toward many targets. Thus, gold nanoparticle (AuNP) aptasensors are subject to intense research due to the complementary properties of aptamers as sensing elements and AuNPs as transducers. We present herein a novel method for the functional coupling of thrombin&#8208;specific aptamers to AuNPs via an anionic, redox&#8208;active poly(ferrocenylsilane) (PFS) polyelectroyte. The polymer acts as a co&#8208;reductant and stabilizer for the AuNPs, provides grafting sites for the aptamer, and can be used as a redox sensing element, making the aptamer&#8208;PFS&#8208;AuNP composite (aptamer&#8208;AuNP) a promising model system for future multifunctional sensors. The aptamer&#8208;AuNPs exhibit excellent colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments owing to the combined electrosteric stabilizing effects of the aptamer and the PFS. The synthesis of each assembly element is described, and the colloidal stability and redox responsiveness is studied. As an example to illustrate applications, we present results for thrombin sensitivity and specificity using the specific aptamer.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;immolation Assisted Morphology Transformation of Prebiotic Lipidated&#8208;cationic Amino Acids: Electro&#8208;droplet Mediated C&#8208;C Coupling Reaction to Synthesize Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compartmentalization protected biomolecules from the fluctuating environments of early Earth. Although contemporary cells mostly use phospholipid&#8208;based bilayer membranes, the utility of non&#8208;bilayer compartments was not ruled out during the prebiotic and modern eras. In the present study, we demonstrated the prebiotic synthesis of lipidated cationic amino acid&#8208;based amphiphiles (lauryl ester of lysine, Lys; ornithine, Orn; and 2,4&#8208;diamino butyric acid, Dab) using model dry&#8208;down reaction. Orn, and Dab&#8208;based amphiphiles (OrnL and DabL) self&#8208;assemble into micellar membranes but undergo pH&#8208;responsive self&#8208;immolation assisted transformation to lipid droplet&#8208;like morphologies, a probable alternative compartment model in the prebiotic Earth. These cationic droplets encapsulated prebiotic molecules (isoprene) and assisted electron transfer reaction to synthesize isoprenoid derivatives at primitive Earth conditions. The self&#8208;assembly of prebiotic amphiphiles, their transformation to droplet compartments, and droplet&#8208;assisted C&#8208;C bond formation reaction might help the evolution to synthesize various biomolecules required for the origin of life.</dc:description>

         <title>CBe2H5&#8211;: unprecedented 2&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity and dynamic structural fluxionality in a planar tetracoordinate carbon cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 14&#8208;electron ternary anionic CBe2H5&#8211; cluster containing a planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) atom is designed herein. Remarkably, it can be stabilized by only two beryllium atoms with both &#960;&#8208;acceptor/&#963;&#8208;donor properties and two hydrogen atoms, which means that the conversion from planar methane (transition state) to ptC species (global minimum) requires the substitution of only two hydrogen atoms. Moreover, two ligand H atoms exhibit alternate rotation, giving rise to interesting dynamic fluxionality in this cluster. The electronic structure analysis reveals the flexible bonding positions of ligand H atoms due to C&#8208;H localized bonds, highlighting the rotational fluxionality in the cluster, and two CBe2 3c&#8208;2e delocalized bonds endow its rare 2&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Unprecedentedly, the fluxional process exhibits a conversion in the type of bonding (&#963; bond &#8660; &#960; bond), which is an uncommon fluxional mechanism. The cluster can be seen as an attempt to apply planar hypercoordinate carbon species to molecular motors.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient C&#8208;Si/C&#8208;H Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Enabled by a Radical Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methods for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes are long&#8208;standing challenges due to the extreme inertness of C&#8208;Si(R3) bond, though the reaction is environmentally friendly and highly regioselective to synthesize biaryls. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes and aryl via a radical mechanism. The reaction proceeds efficiently with aryl sulfonium salts as limiting reagents, exhibits broad substrate scope, and provides an important synthetic strategy to acquire biaryls, exemplified by unsymmetrical fluorescence probes and late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs. Of note, the experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies revealed a radical mechanism where the copper catalyst and CsF play critical roles on the radical generation and desilylation process.</dc:description>

         <title>CARBON DOTS: Bioimaging and Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer, responsible for approximately 10 million lives annually, urgently requires innovative treatments, as well as solutions to mitigate the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, such as long&#8208;term adverse side effects and multidrug resistance. This review focuses on Carbon Dots (CDs), an emergent class of nanoparticles (NPs) with remarkable physicochemical and biological properties, and their burgeoning applications in bioimaging and as nanocarriers in drug delivery systems for cancer treatment. The review initiates with an overview of NPs as nanocarriers, followed by an in&#8208;depth look into the biological barriers that could affect their distribution, from barriers to administration, to intracellular trafficking. It explores CDs' synthesis,&#160;both bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches, and their notable biocompatibility, supported by a selection of in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo studies. Special attention is given to CDs' role in bioimaging, highlighting their optical properties. The discussion extends to their emerging significance as drug carriers, particularly in the delivery of doxorubicin and other anticancer agents, underscoring recent advancements and challenges in this field with examples of other promising bioapplications, emergent owing to the NPs flexible design. As research on CDs evolves, we envisage key challenges, as well as the potential of CD&#8208;based systems in bioimaging and cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of the Unusual Chemical Bonds and Dipole Moments of AeF&#8208; (Ae = Be &#8208; Ba): A Lesson in Covalent Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum chemical calculations of the anions AeF&#8208; (Ae = Be &#8208; Ba) have been carried out using ab initio methods at the CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVPP level and density functional theory employing BP86 with various basis sets. The detailed bonding analyses using different charge&#8208; and energy partitioning methods show that the molecules possess three distinctively different dative bonds in the lighter species with Ae = Be, Mg and four dative bonds when Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba. The occupied 2p atomic orbitals (AOs) and to a lesser degree the occupied 2s AO of F&#8208; donate electronic charge into the vacant spx(&#963;) and p(&#960;) orbitals of Be and Mg which leads to a triple bond AeF&#8208;. The heavier Ae atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use their vacant (n&#8208;1)d AOs as acceptor orbitals which enables them to form a second &#963; donor bond with F&#8208; that leads to quadruply bonded AeF&#8208; (Ae = Ca &#8211; Ba). The presentation of molecular orbitals or charge distribution using only one isodensity value may give misleading information about the overall nature of the orbital or charge distribution. Better insights are given by contour line diagrams.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Contrast Photoacoustic Imaging of Localized Cysteine in Orthotopic Breast Cancer Enabled by A Totally&#8208;Caged Methylene Blue Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to the 90th anniversary of South China Normal University.It developed a methylene blue&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with NIR optical absorption totally caged, which could afford dramatical &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; absorption transition for high&#8208;contrast photoacoustic sensing imaging (PASI) towards the localized cysteine. This work established an up&#8208;to&#8208;date strategy to originally eliminate the background photoacoustic signal for PASI to accurately monitor cysteine in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
High&#8208;contrast photoacoustic sensing imaging (PASI) was greatly determined by optical absorption changes of the absorbers usually enabled by activatable probes via controllably converting the absorbed electromagnetic energy to ultrasound waves. However, most of current photoacoustic probes still suffer from limited imaging contrast towards specific species because of their small absorption spectral changes in the near infrared (NIR) region. Herein, we developed a methylene blue&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with its NIR optical absorption totally caged, which could afford dramatical &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; absorption transition for high&#8208;contrast photoacoustic imaging towards the localized cysteine. The rationally designed methylene blue&#8208;based probe for cysteine (MB&#8208;Cys) would keep in off state with almost no absorption in NIR region, while upon activated by cysteine through cyclization reaction with acrylates, it would reconstruct the &#960;&#8208;conjugation system to release the free methylene blue with strong absorption centered at 665&#8197;nm (&gt;130&#8208;fold enhancement). The unique responsive behavior could enable the PASI for photoacoustic mapping the cysteine in orthotopic breast cancer in a high&#8208;contrast manner. Therefore, this work established an up&#8208;to&#8208;date strategy to originally eliminate the background photoacoustic signal for PASI to accurately monitor cysteine in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Phosphonium&#8208;substituted Diphosphaindenylide (PPI): Exploration of Biradical Character and Ligand Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide, PPI, is reported. Introduction of two P atoms to the indenyl core results in considerable biradical character. Moreover, the ligand properties of PPI are investigated using a chromium tricarbonyl complex as model compound.







Abstract
Starting from C6H4(PCl2)2 and the TMS&#8208;substituted ylide (TMS)2C=PR3 (TMS=trimethylsilyl, R=p&#8208;tolyl), the phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide PPI was prepared in two steps. CASSCF calculations as well as the reactivity toward diphenyl acetylene suggest a notable biradical character in PPI. Reaction with [Cr(CO)3(MeCN)3] affords the complex [Cr(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;PPI)] (5). This complex was employed to explore the ligand properties of PPI, which demonstrates considerable potential through the combination of strong metal&#8208;ligand interactions and the possibility of a pronounced indenyl effect.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Construction of Metal Nanoparticles Loaded COF Catalysts for Aqueous Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of metal nanoparticles loaded COFs catalysts have been prepared via one&#8208;pot construction strategy without lab&#8208;cost procedures, demonstrating excellent hydrogenation performance under mild conditions. The new strategy can be further evolved as into a versatile platform to create new COFs materials and explore the resultant applications.







Abstract
The catalysis performance of metal nanoparticles (NPs) will be significantly deteriorated because of their spontaneous agglomeration during practical applications. Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) materials with functional groups and well&#8208;defined channels benefit for the dispersion and anchor of metal ions and the confined growth of metal NPs, working as an ideal platform to compose catalytic systems. In this article, we report a one&#8208;pot strategy for the preparation of metal NPs loaded COFs without the need of post&#8208;modification. During the polymerization process, the pre&#8208;added metal ions were stabilized by the rapidly formed COF oligomers and hardly disturb the construction of COFs. After reduction, metal NPs are uniformly anchored on the COF matrix. Eventually, a wide spectrum of metal NPs, including Au, Pd, Pt, AuPd, CuPd, CuPt and CuPdPt, loaded COFs are successfully prepared. The versatility and metal ions anchoring mechanism are verified with four different COF matrixes. Taking AuPd NPs as example, the resultant AuPd NPs loaded COF materials can selectively decompose ammonium formate and produce hydrogen in&#8208;situ, exhibiting over 99&#8201;% conversion of hydrodechlorination for chlorobenzenes and nitro&#8208;reduction reaction for nitroaromatic compounds under ambient temperature in aqueous solution.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Peptidomimetics via Ugi Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent development for the construction of peptidomimetics via Ugi reactions or post&#8208;Ugi transformations. By the combination of Ugi reaction and transition metal catalysis such as gold, palladium, rhodium and copper, as well as metal&#8208;free strategies, devise linear, cyclic and polycyclic peptidomimetics are prepared in a rapid, highly efficient and step&#8208;economical manner.







Abstract
Peptidomimetics have been extensively explored in many area due to their ability to improve pharmacological qualities and interesting biological activities. Cycles could be incorporated in peptides to reduce their flexibility, often enhancing the affinity for a certain receptor. Many efforts have been made to synthesize various peptidomimetics. Among them, the Ugi reaction is a popular way for the synthesis of peptidomimetics because it provides peptide&#8208;like products. The Ugi reaction consists of the condensation of an aldehyde or ketone, a carboxylic acid, an amine, and an isocyanide usually giving a linear peptidomimetic. In order to obtain other linear, cyclic or polycyclic peptidomimetics, the acyclic products have to undergo additional transformations or cyclizations. This review covers the years from 2018&#8211;2023, regarding the synthesis of linear, cyclic and polycyclic peptidomimetics, employing Ugi reactions eventually followed by post&#8208;Ugi transformations. Organo&#8208;catalyzed reactions, base&#8208;promoted reactions, and metal&#8208;free reactions toward peptidomimetics are highlighted.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative Skeletal Editing of Indazoles by Donor Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the prevalence of heterocyclic scaffolds in drug&#8208;related molecules, converting these highly modular heterocyclic scaffolds into structural diversified and dearomatized analogs is an ideal strategy for improving their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we describe an efficient method for silver carbene mediated dearomative N&#8211;N bond cleavage leading to skeletal hopping between indazole and 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinazoline via a highly selective single&#8208;carbon insertion procedure. Using this methodology, a series of dihydroquinazoline analogues with diarylmethylene&#8208;substituted quaternary carbon centers were constructed with excellent yields and good functional group compatibility, which was further illustrated by the late&#8208;stage diversification of important pharmaceutically active ingredients. DFT calculations indicated that the silver catalyst not only induces the formation of the silver carbene, but also activates the diazahexatriene intermediate, which plays a crucial role in the formation of the C&#8211;N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Puffing with Large Volume Expansion and Photomechanical Motions induced by Topochemical [4+4] Reactions in Molecular Crystal Solvates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the first example of two crystal solvates of an anthracene&#8208;benzhydrazide based molecule (Ant) that display very distinct photo&#8208;responsive behaviour when 365 or 405 nm or visible light is illuminated. For the first time, the crystal hydrate that has water molecule in the lattice (hereafter named as Ant&#8208;H2O) display fascinating puffing behavior with large volume expansion and surface modulation when illuminated with 405 nm light, a phenomenon very much similar to the rice or popcorn puffing by thermal treatment. Utilizing the properties of photoconverted Ant&#8208;H2O crystals, we have demonstrated their application in photoinduced enhanced liquid absorption using various liquids/solutions.The other crystal solvate having DMF in the crystal lattice (hereafter named as Ant&#8208;DMF) responds to 405 nm light by bending, twisting, chopping, jumping or splitting etc. The chopping of Ant&#8208;DMF crystal was also observed under ambient / white light but at a slower rate compared to 405 nm light. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study reveals that the photoinduced puffing and photomechanical effects of these materials are rooted to the topochemical [4+4] cycloaddition reaction between the anthracene moieties that facilitate molecular packing change assisted by the reconfiguration of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions involving lattice trapped solvent molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>To promote interfacial charge transfer process and accelerate surface water oxidation reaction kinetics for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting over n&#8208;type Silicon (n&#8208;Si) based photoanodes, herein, starting with surface stabilized n&#8208;Si/CoOx, a NiOx/NiFeOOH composite overlayer was coated by atomic layer deposition and spray coating to fabricate the multilayer structured n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode. Encouragingly, the obtained n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode exhibits much increased PEC activity for water splitting, with onset potential cathodically shifted to ~0.96 V vs. RHE and photocurrent density increased to 22.6 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for OER, as compared to n&#8208;Si/CoOx, even significantly surpassing the counterpart n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/FeOOH and n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiOOH photoanodes. Photophysical and electrochemical characterizations evidence that the deposited CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH composite overlayer would create large band bending and strong built&#8208;in electric field at the introduced cascading interfaces, thereby producing a large photovoltage of 650 mV to efficiently accelerate charge transfer from the n&#8208;Si substrate to the electrolyte for water oxidation. Furthermore, the surface oxygen vacancy enriched NiFeOOH overlayer could effectively catalyze the water oxidation reaction by thermodynamically reducing the energy barrier of rate determining step for OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;promoted biocompatible selenium arylation of small molecules, peptides and proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A low pKa (5.2), high polarizable volume (3.8 &#197;), and proneness to oxidation under ambient conditions make selenocysteine (Sec, U) a unique, natural reactive handle present in most organisms across all domains of life. Sec modification still has untapped potential for site&#8208;selective protein modification and probing. Herein we demonstrate the use of a cyclometalated gold(III) compound, [Au(bnpy)Cl2], in the arylation of diselenides of biological significance, with a scope covering small molecule models, peptides, and proteins using a combination of multinuclear NMR (including 77Se NMR), and LC&#8208;MS. Diphenyl diselenide (Ph&#8208;Se)2 and selenocystine, (Sec)2, were used for reaction optimization. This approach allowed us to demonstrate that an excess of diselenide (Au/Se&#8208;Se) and an increasing water percentage in the reaction media enhance both the conversion and kinetics of the C&#8208;Se coupling reaction, a combination that makes the reaction biocompatible. The C&#8208;Se coupling reaction was also shown to happen for the diselenide analogue of the cyclic peptide vasopressin ((Se&#8208;Se)&#8208;AVP), and the Bos taurus glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) enzyme in ammonium acetate (2 mM, pH = 7.0). The reaction mechanism, studied by DFT revealed a redox&#8208;based mechanism where the C&#8208;Se coupling is enabled by the reductive elimination of the cyclometalated Au(III) species into Au(I).</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis with Organoselenium Compounds &#8211; The Past Twelve Years</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery and synthetic applications of novel organoselenium compounds and their reactions proceeded rapidly during the past fifty years and such processes are now carried out routinely in many laboratories. At the same time, the growing demand for new enantioselective processes provided new challenges. The convergence of selenium chemistry and asymmetric synthesis led to key developments in the 1970s, although the majority of early work was based on stoichiometric processes. More recently, greater emphasis has been placed on greener catalytic variations, along with the discovery of novel reactions and a deeper understanding of their mechanisms. The present review covers the literature in this field from 2010 to early 2023 and encompasses asymmetric reactions mediated by chiral selenium&#8208;based reagents, auxiliaries and, especially, catalysts. Protocols based on achiral selenium compounds in conjunction with other species of chiral catalysts, as well as reactions that are controlled by chiral substrates, are also included.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of 2&#8208;Substituted Benzo[cd]Indoles via the Reaction of peri&#8208;Dilithionaphthalenes with Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple and effective organolithium approach to the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzo[cd]indoles from peri&#8208;dihalonaphthalenes and nitriles has been developed. The reaction proceeds via a surprisingly easy intramolecular aromatic nucleophilic substitution facilitated by the &#8220;clothespin effect&#8221;. The discovered transformation provides good isolated yields, allows usage of an extensive range of nitriles, and demonstrates a good substituents tolerance. UV&#8208;absorption and NMR spectra of the obtained benzo[cd]indoles and their protonated forms demonstrated exclusive protonation to indole nitrogen atom even in the presence of two NMe2 groups in positions 5 and 6 (i.e. &#8220;proton sponge&#8221; moiety)</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Interlocked and Non&#8208;Interlocked Deca(para&#8208;phenylene) Derivatives by Ni&#8208;mediated Biaryl Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) (PPn) is a compound composed of directly connected 1,4&#8208;phenylene moieties. The synthesis of PPn composed of six or more phenylene moieties with no substituent at the internal phenylene moiety has been challenging because of its low solubility. Herein we synthesized oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxanes, including a deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane, with a defined number of phenylene moieties. Biaryl coupling of iodoarenes mediated by macrocyclic dibenzodihydrophenanthroline&#8208;Ni complex was utilized for the first time to synthesize the [2]rotaxanes. Compared to the non&#8208;interlocked deca(para&#8208;phenylene), the deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane showed higher solubility. The properties of the oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxanes and non&#8208;interlocked oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)s were analyzed by spectroscopic methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Central Ring Puckering Enhances the Stokes Shift of Xanthene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule dyes are generally designed based on well&#8208;understood electronic effects. However, steric hindrance can promote excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, increasing the difference between the positions of absorption and emission bands (the Stokes shift). Accordingly, we hypothesized that sterically induced central ring puckering in xanthene dyes could be used to systematically increase their Stokes shift. Through a combined experimental/quantum&#8208;chemical approach, we screened a group of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin dyes with a perturbed central ring geometry. Our results showed that an atom with sp3 hybridization in position 10 of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronins induces central ring puckering and facilitates excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, thereby markedly enhancing their Stokes shifts (by up to ~2000 cm&#8722;1). Thus, we prepared fluorescent (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin pH sensors, which showed a Stokes shift disparity between acid and base forms of up to ~8700 cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the concept of ring puckering&#8208;enhanced Stokes shift can be applied to a wide range of xanthene analogues found in the literature. Therefore, central ring puckering may be reliably used as a strategy for enhancing Stokes shifts in the rational design of dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Topology of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks through Site&#8208;Selective Synthetic Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the topology of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is of paramount scientific interest but remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present a site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy that enables the tuning of 2D COF topology by simply adjusting the molar ratio of an amine&#8208;functionalized dihydrazide monomer (NH2&#8208;Ah) and 4,4',4''&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tribenzaldehyde (Tz). This approach resulted in the formation of two distinct COFs: a clover&#8208;like 2D COF with free amine groups (NH2&#8208;Ah&#8208;Tz) and a honeycomb&#8208;like COF without amine groups (Ah&#8208;Tz). Both COFs exhibited good crystallinity and moderate porosity. Remarkably, the clover&#8208;shaped NH2&#8208;Ah&#8208;Tz COF, with abundant free amine groups, displayed significantly enhanced adsorption capacities toward crystal violet (CV, 261 mg/g) and congo red (CR, 1560 mg/g) compared to the nonfunctionalized honeycomb&#8208;like Ah&#8208;Tz COF (123 mg/g for CV and 1340 mg/g for CR), underscoring the pivotal role of free amine functional groups in enhancing adsorption capacities for organic dyes. This work highlights that the site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy paves a new avenue for manipulating 2D COF topology by adjusting the monomer feeding ratio, thereby modulating their adsorption performances toward organic dyes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tuning the topology of two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is of paramount scientific interest but remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present a site-selective synthetic strategy that enables the tuning of 2D COF topology by simply adjusting the molar ratio of an amine-functionalized dihydrazide monomer (NH2-Ah) and 4,4',4''-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tribenzaldehyde (Tz). This approach resulted in the formation of two distinct COFs: a clover-like 2D COF with free amine groups (NH2-Ah-Tz) and a honeycomb-like COF without amine groups (Ah-Tz). Both COFs exhibited good crystallinity and moderate porosity. Remarkably, the clover-shaped NH2-Ah-Tz COF, with abundant free amine groups, displayed significantly enhanced adsorption capacities toward crystal violet (CV, 261 mg/g) and congo red (CR, 1560 mg/g) compared to the nonfunctionalized honeycomb-like Ah-Tz COF (123 mg/g for CV and 1340 mg/g for CR), underscoring the pivotal role of free amine functional groups in enhancing adsorption capacities for organic dyes.

         <dc:description>Using CBr4 as a mild oxidant, the direct C&#8208;H bond oxidation of N&#8208;aryltetrahydroisoquinolines was achieved, giving a series of the corresponding iminium salts in high yields under metal&#8208; and photo&#8208;free reaction conditions. This reaction is superior in high yields and good functional group tolerance, and the late&#8208;stage derivatization showed that these iminium&#160;salts can readily be applied to the synthesis of the functionalized THIQs.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridine Iodine(I) Cations: Kinetic Trapping as a Sulfonate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seven pyridine iodine(I) sulfonate complexes were prepared and isolated at low temperatures and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The inherently instable pyridine iodine(I) cations are stabilized by an oxygen of sulfonate anions via the I&#183;&#183;&#183;O halogen bond. In these complexes, the iodine atom of the pyridine iodine(I) cation acts as an electron acceptor and the sulfonate oxygen as the electron donor. These complexes are stable enough in the crystalline state, yet decompose rapidly under ambient conditions, also being unstable in solution. The (pyridine)N&#8211;I bond lengths [2.140(3) &#8208; 2.197(2) &#197;] and the I&#183;&#183;&#183;O halogen bonds [2.345(6) &#8208; 2.227(3) &#197;] are analogous to (imide)N&#8211;I&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#8211;N&#8208;pyridine uncharged halogen&#8208;bonded complexes formed from N&#8208;haloimides and pyridine N&#8208;oxides, thus confirming the existence of elusive pyridine iodine(I) cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Dual C&#8210;F Bond Activation of Hexafluorobenzene Mediated by Boron Atom</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of laser&#8208;ablated boron atoms with hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) was investigated in neon and argon matrices, and the products are identified by matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The reaction is triggered by a boron atom insertion into one C&#8210;F bond of hexafluorobenzene on annealing, forming a fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical (A). UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation of the &#160;fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical causes generation of a 2&#8208;difluoroboryl&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl radical (B) via a second C&#8210;F bond activation. A perfluoroborepinyl radical (C) generated from the C&#8210;C bond insertion reaction is also observed upon deposition and under UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation. These findings reveal the first example of a double C&#8211;F bond activation of hexafluorobenzene mediated by a nonmetal and provides a possible route for synthesis of new perfluorinated organo&#8208;boron compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Features of DNA Mimic Foldamers for Structural Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA mimic foldamers based on aromatic oligoamide helices bearing anionic phosphonate side chains have been shown to bind to DNA&#8208;binding proteins sometimes orders of magnitude better than DNA itself. Here, we introduce new features in the DNA mimic foldamers to facilitate structural investigations of their interactions with proteins. Thirteen new foldamer sequences have been synthesized and characterized using NMR, circular dichroism, molecular modeling, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The results show that foldamer helix handedness can be quantitatively biased by means of a single stereogenic center, that the foldamer structure can be made C2&#8208;symmetrical as in palindromic B&#8208;DNA sequences, and that associations between foldamer helices can be promoted utilizing dedicated C&#8208;terminal residues that act as sticky ends in B&#8208;DNA structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy transfer on cytoskeleton of red blood cell ghosts and&#160;their efficiency control by KCl concentration&#8208;induced cell shrinkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid bilayer membranes such as liposomes have been utilized as reactors to construct bioinspired artificial photosynthesis. Embedding functional compounds, including chromophores and catalysts, into two&#8208;dimensional lipid membranes allows their high local concentration and proximity, resulting in enhanced reactivity compared to that of homogeneous solutions. The control of photoreactions by the physical and chemical properties of membranes, such as fluidity and phase separation, has also been well studied in recent years. In contrast, it remains difficult to control chemical reactions via dynamic membrane deformation. Here, we report on the control of excitation energy transfer reaction utilizing red blood cell ghosts (RBCGs), which have asymmetric lipid membranes and inherent and unique deformability, as reactors. RBCGs, in which donor and acceptor molecules were chemically conjugated to a two&#8208;dimensional cytoskeleton located beneath the inner membrane, exhibited energy transfer, and their efficiency varied depending on the amount and ratio of donor and acceptor modifications, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the KCl concentration&#8208;induced RBCG shrinkage enhanced the energy transfer efficiency. Our proposed method is expected to facilitate the construction of photoreaction systems that can be controlled via membrane deformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing the Role of BN&#8208;Embedding Position in B2N2&#8208;Perylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating heteroatoms can effectively modulate the molecular optoelectronic properties. However, the fundamental understanding of BN doping effects in BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is underexplored, lacking rational guidelines to modulate the electronic structures through BN units for advanced materials. Herein, a concise synthesis of novel B2N2&#8208;perylenes with BN doped at the bay area is achieved to systematically explore the doping effect of BN position on the photophysical properties of PAHs. The shift of BN position in B2N2&#8208;perylenes alters the &#960; electron conjugation, aromaticity and molecular rigidness significantly, achieving substantially higher electron transition abilities than those with BN doped in the nodal plane. It is further clarified that BN position dominates the photophysical properties over BN orientation. The revealed guideline here may apply generally to novel BN&#8208;PAHs, and aid the advancement of BN&#8208;PAHs with highly&#8208;emissive performance.</dc:description>
