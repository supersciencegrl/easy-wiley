         <title>Hybrid Supports for Oligonucleotide Synthesis: Controlled Pore Glass Derivatives with Branched Amine&#8208;Ended Polyether or Polyimine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid solid supports have been obtained via a two&#8208;step process consisting of a silanization and a subsequent functionalization of Controlled Pore Glass with selected multi&#8208;amine compounds. In particular, 2000&#8197;&#197; CPG functionalized with 8&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol) with each arm amine&#8208;terminated applied for 2000&#8197;&#197; CPG allowed high loading capacity and effective automated syntheses of long&#8208;chain (150 nucleotide units) oligonucleotides.







Abstract
Controlled pore glass (CPG), differing in pore size and subsequent specific surface, was chemically modified by: (1)&#8197;increasing surface susceptibility for amine functionalization via reaction with oxirane&#8208;type (active) and alkyl/aryl&#8208;type (inactive towards amine compounds) silane pro&#8208;adhesive compounds, and (2)&#8197;immobilization of trimethylolpropane tris[poly(propylene glycol), amine terminated] ether, comb&#8208;like 8&#8208;arm octa[poly(ethylene glycol) amine] with each branch amine terminated, and a poly(propylene imine) amine&#8208;terminated second&#8208;generation dendrimer. The increase in surface density of amine functions &#8211; monitored by UV&#8208;Vis technique adopted for quantitative measurements of Ruhemann's purple intensity &#8211; improved final loading capacity, characterized by dimethoxytrityl cation absorption. Obtained materials proved their applicability in automatic oligonucleotide (ON) synthesis, especially when silanized 2000&#8197;&#197; CPG modified with 8&#8208;arm octa[poly(ethylene glycol) amine], with deduced empirical formula CPG &#8211; silane &#8211; (NH)6.4PEG&#8208;(NH2)1.6, was used for long&#8208;chain (150 nucleotides) ONs synthesis. This can be regarded as a good CPG support for this purpose. Moreover, hybrid supports with different porosity allowed the synthesis of shorter ONs with satisfactory yield and purity, monitored by RP&#8208;HPLC and MALDI&#8208;TOF. On the molecular level, two competitive mechanisms seem to influence the utility of the final hybrid support: spatial availability of active sites and the propensity of the functionalizer to bond with the CPG surface.

         <title>Redox Cycling with Tellurium. Si&#8722;H Bond Activation by a Lewis Superacidic Tellurenyl Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Main group catalysis at work. The C,N&#8208;chelated aryltellurenyl triflate [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][OTf], a Lewis superacidic carbene analogue, effective activates the Si&#8722;H bonds in tertiary silanes R3SiH (R=Et, Ph, Si(SiMe3)3), which was utilized in main group redox catalysis using p&#8208;quinones, which were converted into (silylated) hydrochinones.







Abstract
The C,N&#8208;chelated aryltellurenyl triflate [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][OTf] (1) activates the Si&#8722;H bonds in the tertiary silanes R3SiH via umpolung of H&#8722; to H+ to give rise to the iminium salts (tBuN(H)CH)C6H4TeSiR3][OTf] (2R, R=Et, Ph (elusive) and R=Si(CH3)3 isolated; OTf=O3SCF3) comprising Te&#8722;Si bonds, which are capable of generating silyl triflates, R3SiOTf, under attack of a second equivalent of 1. The unprecedented Si&#8722;H activation was utilized in main group redox catalysis using p&#8208;quinones, which were converted into (silylated) hydroquinones.

         <title>50 Years of Organoselenium Chemistry, Biochemistry and Reactivity: Mechanistic Understanding, Successful and Controversial Stories</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From the stink to the stars! The reputation of organoselenium species changed drastically in the past fifty years. While at the beginning of their history they were notoriously famous for their toxicity and infernal smell, organoselenides are nowadays recognized for their fundamental role in redox biology and as green organocatalysts. While applications in pharmaceutical sciences are still lacking, safe&#8208;to&#8208;be&#8208;administered compounds exist and new venues for bioactive low molecular weight organoselenides are being explored. In this review, the pervasive chemistry of the element of the moon is discussed focusing on the pivotal role of organoselenium species in biology, catalysis and pharmacology, providing an historical perspective on different but intertwined fields.







Abstract
In 1973, two major discoveries changed the face of selenium chemistry: the identification of the first mammal selenoenzyme, glutathione peroxidase 1, and the discovery of the synthetic utility of the so&#8208;called selenoxide elimination. While the chemical mechanism behind the catalytic activity of glutathione peroxidases appears to be mostly unveiled, little is known about the mechanisms of other selenoproteins and, for some of them, even the function lies in the dark. In chemistry, the capacity of organoselenides of catalyzing hydrogen peroxide activation for the practical manipulation of organic functional groups has been largely explored, and some mechanistic details have been clearly elucidated. As a paradox, despite the long&#8208;standing experience in the field, the nature of the active oxidant in various reactions still remains matter of debate. While many successes characterize these fields, the pharmacological use of organoselenides still lacks any true application, and while some organoselenides were found to be non&#8208;toxic and safe to use, to date no therapeutically approved use was granted. In this review, some fundamental and chronologically aligned topics spanning organoselenium biochemistry, chemistry and pharmacology are discussed, focusing on the current mechanistic picture describing their activity as either bioactive compounds or catalysts.

         <title>Stable Cu (I) Complexes for Intracellular Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Azide Alkyne Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original azole ligand scaffold has been used to create a Cu (I) trinuclear dimer, demonstrating air&#8208; and water&#8208;stability due to its linear molecular geometry around the metal center. The complex is characterized and shown to efficiently catalyze the CuAAC reaction in aqueous media at low loading, as well as on fixed cells.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) has heralded a new era of chemical biology and biomedicine. However, caveats of the CuAAC include formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other copper&#8208;related toxicity. This limits utility in sensitive biological samples and matrices. Towards addressing these caveats, we synthesized and fully characterized two air and water stable trinuclear Cu(I) dimer complexes. The complexes were stable to oxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxideand other chelators, which was reasoned to be due to the linear benzimidazole&#8208;Cu&#8208;benzimidazole geometry. Computational investigations of the catalytic cycle implicated two of the three coppers in the trimer complex as the active metal centers. The complexes were shown to catalyze the reaction at far below sub&#8208;toxic concentrations for intracellular click reactions to label triple negative breast cancer cells and compared to the current CuSO4&#8208;THPTA standard.

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic Framework&#160;(MOF)&#8208;Based Sensors for Mercury (Hg) Detection: Design Strategies and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monitoring mercury (Hg) is critical for environmental and public health. Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based sensors demonstrate the advantage of high sensitivity and rapid response. We summarize the advances of MOF sensors for Hg2+ detection from the perspective of MOF type and role in the sensors. First, we introduce three MOFs used in Hg sensors&#8212;UIO, ZIF, and MIL&#8212;that have demonstrated superior performance. Then, we discuss the specifics of MOF&#8208;based sensors for Hg2+ detection in terms of the recognition and signal elements. Currently, the recognition elements include T&#8208;rich aptamers, noble metal nanoparticles, central metal ions, and organic functional groups inherent to MOFs. Sensors with fluorescence and colorimetric signals are the two main types of optical MOF sensors used for Hg detection. Electrochemical sensors have also been fabricated, but these are less frequently reported, potentially due to the limited conductivity and cycling stability of MOFs. Notably, dual&#8208;signal sensors mitigate background signals interference and enhance the accuracy of Hg2+ detection. Furthermore, to facilitate portability and user&#8208;friendliness, portable devices such as microfluidics, paper&#8208;based devices, and smartphones have been developed for Hg2+ detection, showcasing potential applications. We also address the challenges related to MOF&#8208;based sensors for Hg2+ and future outlook.</dc:description>

         <title>Intersystem Crossing, Photo&#8208;Induced Charge Separation and Regioisomer&#8208;Specific Excited State Dynamics in Fully Rigid Spiro Rhodammine&#8208;Naphthalene/Anthraquinone Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared a series fully rigid spiro electron donor&#8208;acceptor orthogonal dyads, with closed form of rhodamine (Rho) as electron donor and naphthalene (Np)/anthraquinone (AQ) as electron acceptor, to access the long&#8208;lived triplet charge separation (3CS) state, via the electron spin control method. We found strong dependency of the photophysical property of the dyads on the amino substitution positions of the Np chromophores in the dyads 1,8&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho and 2,3&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho. Nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectra show the population of the 3LE state (lifetime: 47 &#956;s) for 2,3&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho, however, long&#8208;lived 3CS state was observed (&#964;CS = 0.62 &#956;s) for AQ&#8208;Rho, with a CS quantum yield of &#934;CS = 58%. Based on femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectra, spin orbit charge transfer ISC (SOCT&#8208;ISC) is proposed to be responsible for the formation of the triplet states. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra of AQ&#8208;Rho indicate the presence of two states, a 3LE state with zero field splitting (ZFS) D parameter of 1400 MHz and E parameter of &#8208;410 MHz, formed via radical pair ISC (RP&#8208;ISC) and SOCT&#8208;ISC mechanism; and a 3CS state with the electron spin&#8208;spin interaction in the regime of spin&#8208;correlated radical pair (SCRP)</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Organic Luminophores through Stepwise Stabilization by Coordination and In&#8208;Situ Precipitation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficiency and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials through straightforward methods is highly desired. In this work, a stepwise stabilization strategy was proposed by the coordination and in&#8208;situ precipitation reactions among organic precursors, inorganic cation and anions, producing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials with high emission efficiency (phosphorescence quantum yield of 45%). Structural and photophysical characterizations revealed the coordination reaction reduced the energy gaps between singlet and triplet states and stabilized the excited states of the guest molecules. The in&#8208;situ precipitation reaction produced a solid matrix, which provided isolated environments for protecting the excitons from quenching. The applications of RTP materials in information encryption were demonstrated. The presented results provided a new clue for producing RTP materials, and extended their applications in wide fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Phosphates: A New Alternative to Conventional Borates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with balanced performance are crucial for extending laser wavelengths into the DUV region, essential for various laser applications. However, developing ideal DUV crystals is challenging due to stringent requirements: strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, short cut&#8208;off wavelength, and effective phase&#8208;matching behavior. DUV NLO borates, which feature &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups, have garnered attention for their higher SHG coefficients compared to phosphates. However, phosphates typically show short UV cut&#8208;off edges due to the large HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (approximately 9.6 eV) of the [PO&#8324;] units. To enhance the SHG effect while maintaining DUV transparency in phosphates, several strategies have been proposed: 1) using distorted polymerized P&#8722;O groups like isolated C&#8321;&#8208;[P&#8323;O&#8321;&#8320;]&#8309;&#8315; and [P&#8322;O&#8327;]&#8308;&#8315;; 2) aligning isolated [PO&#8324;]&#179;&#8315; tetrahedra along the polar screw axis; 3) introducing additional NLO&#8208;active units; and 4) exploring new units derived from [PO&#8324;]&#179;&#8315;, such as [PO&#8323;F]&#178;&#8315; tetrahedra. These strategies have led to the successful development of various non&#8208;centrosymmetric phosphates, highlighting their potential as DUV NLO candidates. This review explores the relationship between their crystal structures and DUV NLO performance, and proposes future directions for developing ideal DUV NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation Between NMR Coupling Constants and &#963;&#8208;Donating Properties of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Is the 1JC&#8208;H coupling constant for protonated carbene a relevant measure of its &#963;&#8208;donation ability? This paper addresses this question by comparing calculated 1JC&#8208;H values with various experimental and theoretical approaches across a broad spectrum of carbene compounds. We examined Arduengo&#8208;type NHCs based on the 2&#8208;imidazolylidene scaffold and many other derivatives with modified frameworks, including carbenes with extended, saturated, or conjugated rings, reduced heteroatom stabilization, alternative heteroatoms, permanently charged carbenes, acyclic carbenes, amidocarbenes, and cyclic amino(alkyl/aryl) carbenes, carbodicarbenes and carbodiphosphoranes. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between different parameters associated with &#963;&#8208;interaction, such as 1JC&#8208;H, Huynh electronic parameter (HEP), &#963;&#8208;donation from ETS&#8208;NOCV, and lone pair energy. Notably, the best correlation was observed between 1JC&#8208;H and the ETS&#8208;NOCV method, particularly for mono&#8208; and diaminocarbenes, highlighting the utility of 1JC&#8208;H in comparing &#963;&#8208;donation among structurally similar carbene types. However, the use of 1JC&#8208;H as a universal measure across all carbene classes appears limited, especially when considering carbenes with significantly different structural frameworks. While HEP is less effective for carbenes with diverse structural backbones, our study suggests that 1JC&#8208;H has potential across a broader range of systems. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates that lone pair energy reflects basicity rather than &#963;&#8208;donor ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Basic&#8208;functionalized Ionic Porous Organic Polymers: Triple Roles in One for Highly Efficient and Recyclable Carboxylative Cyclization of CO2 under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into high&#8208;value chemicals is a significant step towards achieving the goal of "carbon neutrality". &#945;&#8208;methylene cyclic carbonate, as an intermediate for the synthesis of many important organic compounds, is widely employed in industrial productions. In this work, a series of ionic porous organic polymers (IPOPs) with different basic&#8208;functionalized anions were successfully synthesized and adjusted to have certain BET surface areas and high contents of ion sites by post&#8208;modification. These basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs could exhibit excellent catalytic performance for carboxylative cyclization of CO2 at 30 oC and 1 bar in presence of silver salts, eliminating the use of extra organic bases. In the whole catalytic reaction, the basic&#8208;functionalized anions could play triple roles: enriching CO2 for further transformation, activating the hydroxyl groups of substrates to improve the catalytic performance, while coordinating with Ag atom to stabilize and regenerate catalyst. Notably, the catalytic system of DCX&#8208;4&#8208;Tet/Ag2O exhibited excellent recyclability, and the yield of &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonate was well maintained at 99% after 5 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, the catalytic system was the first example of basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs that played multiple roles for highly efficient CO2 cyclization under mild conditions without any extra organic bases.</dc:description>

Notably, the catalytic system of DCX-4-Tet/Ag2O exhibited excellent recyclability, and the yield of &#945;-alkylidene cyclic carbonate was well maintained at 99% after 5 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, the catalytic system was the first example of basic-functionalized IPOPs that played multiple roles for highly efficient CO2 cyclization under mild conditions without any extra organic bases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Scintillators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray scintillators have recently garnered considerable attention due to their indispensable roles in radiation detection, safety inspection, therapy, and medical imaging. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the development of high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators, focusing innovations driven by molecular engineering approaches.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray scintillators, materials that convert high&#8208;energy radiation into detectable light in the ultraviolet to visible spectrum, are widely used in industrial and medical applications. Organic and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid systems have emerged as promising alternatives for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging due to their mechanical flexibility, lightweight, tunable excited states, and solution processability for large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, these systems often suffer from weak X&#8208;ray absorption and insufficient exciton utilization, which seriously affects their scintillation performance, limiting their potential for broader application and commercialization. This review highlights recent advances in molecular engineering for developing high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators. It focuses on molecular design principles, such as the heavy atom effect, donor&#8208;acceptor/host&#8208;guest strategies, hydrogen/halogen bonding, molecular sensitization, and crystal packing, for enhancing scintillation performance. By leveraging these approaches, researchers have made significant strides in improving X&#8208;ray scintillation efficiency and advancing the potential of these materials for commercial applications.

         <title>Chiral Induction of a Tetrakis(porphyrin) in Various Chiral Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urethane&#8208;equipped tetrakis(porphyrin) is CD&#8208;active in many chiral solvents, which demonstrates the potential benefits of supramolecular interactions for developing chiral sensory systems.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions offer an alternative way for developing stimulus&#8208;responsive materials such as sensors, machines, and drug&#8208;delivery systems. We recently reported that a urethane&#8208;equipped tetrakis(porphyrin) forms one&#8208;handed helical supramolecular polymers in solution in response to chirality of chiral solvents. Conformational changes in helical sense were detected using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, which showed that the tetrakis(porphyrin) can possibly be used as a sensor for determining the enantiomeric excess of a chiral analyte. Hence, we studied the scope and limitations of the chiral&#8208;induction behavior of tetrakis(porphyrin) to deepen the understanding of tetrakis(porphyrin)&#8208;based chiral sensing systems. Herein, we report the chiral&#8208;induction behavior of tetrakis(porphyrin) in various chiral solvents, which was found to be CD&#8208;active in many chiral solvents. Notably, the tetrakis(porphyrin) was CD active in a cryptochiral molecular solvent, which is exciting because the chiralities of acyclic saturated hydrocarbons are hard to sense. Consequently, this study highlights the potential advantages of supramolecular chiral sensors capable of targeting a wide range of analytes, including molecules that are absorption&#8208;silent in the UV/vis region, ones devoid of anchoring functional groups, and acyclic, saturated hydrocarbons.

         <title>Neo&#8208;Glycolipid Oximes as Intestinal Permeation Enhancers for Peptide Hormone PYY3&#8208;36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Permeation enhancers optimized. Peptide hormone PYY3&#8208;36 transport across epithelial cell monolayers was facilitated by neo&#8208;glycolipids, selected from a combination of panels of mono&#8208; and disaccharides (blue circle in figure) with lipids comprising different length and terminal charge (red circle in figure).







Abstract
Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of 16 neo&#8208;glycolipids that are potential permeation enhancers for oral drug delivery of peptide therapeutics. These amphiphilic neo&#8208;glycolipids are composed of fatty acids and various carbohydrates (d&#8208;glucose, lactose, cellobiose, maltose) via an oxime linker. The ability of the synthesized neo&#8208;glycolipids to enhance permeation of fluorescein&#8208;labelled dextran (4&#8197;kDa) or 3H&#8208;mannitol across intestinal epithelium was investigated in&#8197;vitro using monolayers of human epithelial Caco&#8208;2 cells. Their effects were compared with (pre&#8208;)clinically known enhancers as reference compounds; sodium salts of octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acid, and sodium salcaprozate (SNAC). Most neo&#8208;glycolipids increased the permeation of the model compounds, proving that neo&#8208;glycolipids, which possess vastly different properties from the reference compounds, e.&#8201;g., in terms of clogD and polar surface area, are effective permeation enhancers. The neo&#8208;glycolipid based on decanoic acid and glucose was more potent than related compounds based on disaccharides. Significant differences in solubility and cellular compatibility were found for neo&#8208;glyolipids based on different carbohydrates. Finally, neo&#8208;glycolipids were evaluated as permeation enhancers for the peptide hormone PYY3&#8208;36. Glucose&#8208; and maltose&#8208;derived neo&#8208;glycolipids based on decanoic and dodecanoic acid showed promising enhancements in PYY3&#8208;36 permeation in&#8197;vitro while maintaining good cellular compatibility, relevant for oral delivery of obesity treatments.

         <title>Design and Evaluation of Azaspirocycles as RNA binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes efficient synthetic routes for the preparation of novel azaspirocycles. The resulting molecules exhibit unique three&#8208;dimensional structures with potential applications in drug discovery. The investigation of these compounds as RNA binders highlights promising activity as inhibitors of Tat/TAR interactions, presenting prospective therapeutic implications in HIV treatment and beyond.







Abstract
This study presents efficient synthetic pathways for preparing novel azaspirocycles. These methodologies involve functionalizing key bicyclic hydrazines with a substituent on one of their bridgehead carbon atoms. The desired spirocyclic cores were successfully obtained through double reductive amination reactions, intramolecular cyclizations, and cleavages of the N&#8722;N bond. The isolated molecules possess unique three&#8208;dimensional structures, suggesting potential applications in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. With the growing interest in targeting nucleic acids as a complementary approach to protein&#8208;targeting strategies for developing novel active compounds, we investigated the potential of the synthesized azaspirocycles as RNA binders. As a proof of concept, we highlight the promising activity of some compounds as strong binders of HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA and inhibitors of Tat/TAR interactions.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Triggered ROS&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Nanoprodrugs for Targeted and Synergistic Chemo/Photodynamic/Gas Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;triggered ROS&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoprodrugs (BNN6@GBTC NPs) were constructed through the self&#8208;assembly of the amphiphilic prodrug molecule (GBTC) and NO donor (BNN6) in water for targeted and synergistic chemo/photodynamic/gas therapy.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;triggered ROS&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoprodrugs (BNN6@GBTC NPs) are constructed via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic prodrug molecule (GBTC) and NO donor (BNN6). BNN6@GBTC NPs possess good stability, ROS responsiveness, and selective HepG2 cells targetability via overexpressed galactose receptors on the cell membrane. When BNN6@GBTC NPs are taken up by HepG2 cells, they can generate ROS upon light irradiation, which can not only be used for photodynamic therapy, but also cleave the thioketal linkage to release camptothecin for chemotherapy. Meanwhile, BNN6 triggering release NO for gas therapy. BNN6@GBTC NPs enable targeted and synergistic chemo/photodynamic/gas therapy, which results in reduced damage to normal cells and enhanced anti&#8208;cancer efficacy in&#8197;vitro. This work provides a novel approach for the design of nanoprodrugs based on supramolecular self&#8208;assembly to achieve the multimodal synergistic anti&#8208;cancer therapy.

BNN6@GBTC NPs enable targeted and synergistic chemo/photodynamic/gas therapy, which results in reduced damage to normal cells and enhanced anti-cancer efficacy &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;. This work provides a novel approach for the design of nanoprodrugs based on supramolecular self-assembly to achieve the multimodal synergistic anti-cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Distance&#8208;Dependent Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Charge Transfer in 9,10&#8208; Bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper investigates the role of through&#8208;bond coupling strength in modulating symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) dynamics within anthracene dimers of varying inter&#8208;chromophore distances. Utilizing both steady&#8208;state and transient spectroscopy, we uncover the significance of strong electronic coupling in facilitating SB&#8208;CS, particularly under weakly polar solvent conditions, with direct implications for enhancing photoelectric device performance.







Abstract
To investigate the effect of the through&#8208;bond coupling strength on the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) dynamics and mechanism, three 9,10&#8208;bis((4&#8208;hexylphenyl)ethynyl)anthracene dimers with varying distances, viz., a single&#8208;bond linked dimer (0&#8208;dimer), a phenylene linked dimer (1&#8208;dimer) and a para&#8208;biphenylene linked dimer (2&#8208;dimer), were synthesized and studied systematically using steady&#8208;state and transient spectroscopy. Steady&#8208;state absorption spectra revealed that the electronic coupling strength decreased gradually with the increase of the inter&#8208;chromophore distance, and the transition of S0&#8594;S1 includes the dark charge transfer (CT) excitation. fs&#8208;TA spectra demonstrated that SB&#8208;CS could be conducted in both weakly and highly polar solvents for 0&#8208;dimer, but the SB&#8208;CS dynamics has a significant difference. In weakly polar solvents, SB&#8208;CS only produces the partial CT (PCT) state, but it could generate the CT state via the PCT state in highly polar solvent. In comparison, SB&#8208;CS is only proceeded in highly polar solvents in 1&#8208;dimer and 2&#8208;dimer to produce the CT state directly. These results demonstrate that the SB&#8208;CS dynamics is strongly dependent on the inter&#8208;chromophore electronic coupling, and the relatively strong electronic coupling is crucial for the occurrence of SB&#8208;CS in weakly polar environment that is commonly presented in photoelectric devices.

         <title>Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Triisopropylsilyl Ethynyl Substituted Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of TIPS&#8208;Pen as diene with a number of different dienophiles was examined &#8211; the Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity of TIPS&#8208;Pen has not been investigated yet. The lateral size of the dienophile and the dispersion interaction between dienophile and diene are responsible for the unusual regioselectivity of cyclohexene&#8208;based dienophiles with TIPS&#8208;pentacene.







Abstract
We investigated the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 6,13&#8208;bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene (1) with small dienophiles such as (bridged) dihydronaphthalenes/cyclohexenes that yielded adducts at the central ring, the other dienophiles predominantly or exclusively attacked the unsubstituted off&#8208;center ring. The difference in regioselectivity was investigated by DFT calculations. Apart from dispersion interactions, it is due to the steric demand of the dienophiles, which need to fit in between the silylethynyl substituents to react at the central ring. Epoxynaphthalene adducts of 1 as well as its anthracene and tetracene congeners were deoxygenated, easily furnishing triarenobarrelenes with TIPS&#8208;ethynyl substituents at the bridgeheads, attractive building blocks for porous solids and higher acene&#8208;based trimers.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Interactions Facilitated by Chalcogen Bonding within Selenadiazole Functionalised Porphyrin Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and robust porphyrin nanotube (PNT) has been generated by the combination of tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin, a selenadiazole carboxylate anion and Cd(II) centres. Solvent&#8208;filled regions within the PNTs can be evacuated, allowing the incorporation of a variety of guests. X&#8208;ray diffraction and solid&#8208;state NMR provide information relating to chalcogen bonding interactions between the host and appropriate guest solvent molecules.







Abstract
The structural rigidity of tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin (TPyP) has been utilised to prepare a robust novel porous coordination polymer of composition Cd2(TPyP)(sez)2 (TPyP=5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin, sez=1,2,5&#8208;benzoselenadiazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylate). The coordination polymer may be described as a hexagonal porphyrin nanotube (PNT) and has the potential to bind guest molecules through chalcogen bonding. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) data indicate an internal pore diameter ~9&#8197;&#197; which represents ~35&#8201;% of the crystal volume. Immersion of the PNTs in solvents such as DMSO and CS2 result in the incorporation of these molecules within the nanotubes with chalcogen bonding between host and guest. The crystallographic guest&#8208;inclusion investigations are complemented by solid&#8208;state 77Se, 13C, 113Cd and 2H&#8197;NMR studies which provide insights into dynamic behaviour. The porosity of the crystals was further explored using gas adsorption experiments, indicating the reversible uptake of CO2, CH4, H2 and N2. Structure&#8208;function relationships are clearly established from complementary crystallographic, NMR and adsorption investigations.

Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced radical tandem difluoroalkylation/cyclization to construct CF2&#8208;containing isoquinolinonedione skeletons with methacryloyl benzamides is developed. Broad substrate scopes are compatible with metal&#8208;, oxidant&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions under room temperature in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Mechanistic analysis revealed that the transformation is initiated by photoinduced electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes formation.

         <title>Role of Active Centers in Predicting the Catalyst Turnover: A Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we emphasized the role of active centres in predicting the efficiency for the [M(OTf)2(Me2Pytacn)] (M=Mn, Co, Ni) catalysts in the light of our two established models viz. efficiency conceptualization model (ECM) and maximum kinetic efficiency (MaxKinEff) model.







Abstract
Water oxidation catalysis has garnered significant attention due to its potential for sustainable energy conversion. Among molecular catalysts, [Fe(OTf)2(

Me2

 ${^{{\rm{Me}}_{\rm{2}} } }$



Pytacn)] complexes have exhibited notable turning&#8208;over rates. Although various [M(OTf)2(

Me2

 ${^{{\rm{Me}}_{\rm{2}} } }$



Pytacn)] complexes (M=Mn, Co, Ni) have been synthesized, however, the role of active centres has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we apply our newly developed catalytic models, efficiency conceptualization model (ECM) and the maximum kinetic efficiency MaxKinEff framework to assess the role of the active centres in its catalytic performance. Our computational analysis identifies cobalt&#8208;based [Co(OTf)2(

Me2

 ${^{{\rm{Me}}_{\rm{2}} } }$



Pytacn)] as a superior alternative for water oxidation reactions. Notably, cobalt catalysts exhibit a longer lifespan (&#8764;44&#8197;days) and higher turnover numbers (TON), with computed values of

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new series of &#946;&#8208;to&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenyl monofused porphyrins, denoted as MMFP(MN)X2 (where MFP = monofused porphyrin, MN = malononitrile and X = H or Br) and MMFP(MN)MB (where MB = mono benzo, M = 2H, Co(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II)) were designed and successfully synthesized. These compounds were&#160;characterized using various spectroscopic techniques and SCXRD analysis. Notably, three of the porphyrins&#160;crystallized&#160; in a triclinic crystal system with a P1&#773; space group. The twist angle values for these structures ranged from 14.03&#176; to 21.35&#176;.

The first reduction and oxidation potentials of all the investigated porphyrins exhibited significant anodically shift as compared to their parent tetraphenylporphyrins attributed to peripheral fusion and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, which collectively led to a reduced HOMO&#8210;LUMO gap. Ultrafast third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) studies revealed that these monofused porphyrins showed a strong two&#8208;photon absorption coefficient &#160;and effective cross&#8208;section ([[EQUATION]] = 0.03 &#8210; 8.05 &#215; 105 GM) values along with self&#8208;defocusing negative nonlinear refraction behaviour (n2 = (&#8210;) 0.5 &#8210; 5.28 &#215; 10&#8210;16 m2/W).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cysteine (Cys) detection is recognized as an essential element in this investigation due to the critical function of Cys in several physiological processes in living organisms. A new NIR fluorescent probe SNC&#8211;Cys has been synthesized by incorporating a five&#8208;membered malononitrile derivatized ring as an electron withdrawing group, and a methacryloyl group detection moiety for cysteine. After adding Cys, SNC&#8211;Cys shows an emission of 654 nm and further works as a &#8220;Turn&#8211;on&#8221; probe via ICT photomechanism. SNC&#8211;Cys has high sensitivity and selectivity for Cys (LOD = 0.46 &#181;M) and can discriminate it from other closely related amino acids, molecules with structural similarity, and in some cases very close functional group likeness. Thus, these results allow the effective imaging of Cys in living A549 cells which indicates good cell permeability and high applicability in live cell imaging. This study anticipates that SNC&#8211;Cys could be an aid in the detection of Cys&#8211;relevant diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Parts&#8208;per&#8208;million Level Loading Cyclometalated Ru(II)&#8722;NHC Catalyzed Selective Oxidation of Olefins to Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative cleavage of olefins is a useful reaction in organic synthesis. The most well&#8208;known catalytic system is the osmium based Lemieux&#8211;Johnson catalyst, which generally requires high catalyst loading and tends to suffer from rapid overoxidation to produce the acid predominantly. Hence, the&#160;development of a mild, general, and selective method toward the oxidative cleavage of alkenes to carbonyl compounds is highly desired. In this work, a highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst for olefin oxidation has been demonstrated by employing a fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoxaline (ImQx) based NHC ligand with bidentate C(carbanion)^CNHC motif. Strong C&#8208;donor ligands, paired with a rigid backbone and ruthenium redox activity, provided exceptionally high catalytic activity and a long lifetime for olefin oxidation. Complex showed high catalytic activity and a long lifetime, TONs are several million. The catalyst tolerates numerous functional groups and can be applicable to challenging biomass, natural products, sugar, amino acids, and fatty acid&#8208;derived substrates. Based on kinetic studies, thermodynamic activation parameters, and DFT study, the mechanistic finding demonstrated that [3+2] cycloaddition reaction is the key step in the oxidation process. The use of the&#160;by&#8208;product NaIO3 in the catalytic efficiency has been disclosed for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper Nanoclusters Imparted Metalloporphyrin Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoclusters have been successfully introduced into metalloporphyrin MOFs to prepare a series of hybrid catalysts (i.&#8201;e. Cu NCs@MOF&#8208;54&#8208;M, M=Fe, Co and Ni) that can be applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR for efficient CO production.







Abstract
Strategies that can introduce catalytic auxiliary into electrocatalysts to boost the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are meaningful in exploring hybrid electrocatalytic systems. Here, a series of hybrid electrocatalysts (Cu NCs@MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M, M=Fe, Co and Ni) have been prepared by assembly Cu NCs with MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M=Fe, Co and Ni) and successfully applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR. In the obtained MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M=Fe, Co and Ni), the integration of Cu NCs with MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M=Fe, Co and Ni) can create a hybrid electrocatalytic system that enhances the charge transfer efficiency and electrocatalytic CO2RR activity. Specifically, the optimal Cu NCs@MOF&#8208;545&#8208;Co presents remarkable FECO over a wide potential range (&#8722;0.7&#8197;V to &#8722;1.0&#8197;V), high CO generation rate (8.2&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1) and excellent maximum energy efficiency (69&#8201;%, &#8722;0.7&#8197;V), which is superior to Cu NCs and MOF&#8208;545&#8208;Co, and represented to be one of the best performances to date. This work demonstrates a facile approach to significantly improve the FECO by loading metal nanoclusters into MOFs, providing a valuable reference for future studies on hybridization strategies to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts.

Unprecedented &#954;2(X,C)&#8208;haloquinolizinium (X=F, Cl, and Br) ligated Ru(II) complexes were synthesized via Ru(II)&#8208;promoted rearrangement and cyclization of homopropargylic halopyridines. These cyclic Ru(II)&#8722;halocarbon complexes, featuring rare M&#8722;X&#8722;R bonding interactions, undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution to yield quinolizinium&#8208;fused metallaoxazole complex. This work highlights the importance of metal&#8722;halocarbon bonding interactions in catalytic and coordination design.







Abstract
The activation of various homopropargylic pyridines by cis&#8208;[RuII/OsII(dppm)2Cl2] (dppm=1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) has previously been shown to generate a diverse array of metallacycles and metalated heterocyclic complexes. However, a minor structural modification of introducing a halide onto the pyridyl group of the alkyne substrate resulted in the formation of unprecedented Ru(II)/Os(II)&#8722;haloquinolizine complexes. These complexes display (1) &#954;2(X,C)&#8208;haloquinolizine chelates arising from the cycloisomerization of HC&#8801;CC(OH)(CH2(6&#8208;X&#8208;2&#8208;py))(Ph) on [RuII/OsII(dppm)2]2+ moieties via a vinylidene pathway, (2) five&#8208;membered Ru/Os&#8722;X&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8722;C rings (X=F, Cl, Br) ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;fused to quinolizinium skeletons, and (3) uncommon M&#8722;X&#8722;R bonding interactions that are atypical in coordination complexes. Despite being divalent and integrated into a five&#8208;membered Ru&#8722;X&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8722;C ring system, the X atoms in the Ru(II) complexes are susceptible to substitution by O in the presence of &#8722;OH, resulting in the formation of quinolizinium&#8208;fused ruthenaoxazole complexes. Overall, this work highlights the importance of considering metal&#8722;halocarbon bonding interactions in catalytic or coordination designs.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Gel based on Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Crosslinked Dynamic Covalent Network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The rapid development of mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescence has been driven by its promising applications in the fields of sensors, information encryption, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, designing mechanophores that can exhibit fluorescence changes under relatively low force remains challenging. In this study, a mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescent gel was developed using a tetraphenylethylene derivative as a cross&#8208;linker, producing a dynamic covalent network that exhibits increased fluorescence under tensile stress. Based on controlled experimental studies and molecular modeling calculations, the fluorescence enhancement by external forces was attributed to the restriction of intramolecular motion in tetraphenylethylene by macromolecular chain orientation. In time&#8208;dependent experiments, due to the exchange of dynamic covalent bonds, the stress relaxation and the decrease in fluorescence intensity of the gel at fixed strain occurred simultaneously, demonstrating the potential of this fluorescence as an indication of internal stress through aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) type mechanophore.

         <title>Anion&#8208;substituted Hybrid Zinc Halides with Remarkable Dielectric Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermo&#8208;responsive dielectric switching hybrid halides, displaying reversible dielectric bistability, have recently made them highly versatile. Herein, by the strategy of substituting the X site in the general formula A2BX4, the low&#8208;dimensional [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2ZnX4 (X=Br, I) hybrid halides exhibite remarkable dielectric bistability/switching characteristics with ultra&#8208;wide dielectric hysteresis loop of about 55&#8197;K near room temperature.







Abstract
Thermo&#8208;responsive dielectric switching hybrid halides, displaying reversible dielectric bistability, have recently made them highly versatile and attractive for their structural tunability and rich functional properties. However, the substantial improvement of the dielectric switching operating range is limited near room temperature, and obtaining ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region is a major challenge. Herein, a remarkable dielectric switching effect is reported with ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region in a hybrid halide system, caused by dipolar orientational polarization ascribing order&#8208;disorder phase transitions. The new A2BX4 hybrid halide [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2ZnBr4 (4PBA&#8208;ZnBr4) with an ultra&#8208;wide dielectric hysteresis loop of about 55&#8197;K near room temperature is designed successfully through halogen substitution. Meanwhile, structurally similar hybrid materials 4PBA&#8208;ZnI4 were designed as controls. More interestingly, the crystal structure, phase transition temperature (Tc), dielectric and semiconductor properties exhibit significant discrepancies as the halogen atoms vary from Br to I. This discovery provides an efficiently regulated anionic framework to construct hybrid halides with ultra&#8208;wide high dielectric switching and reliable cycling stability by assembling with various cations, making them potentially excellent candidates for highly responsive room temperature smart switches or transducer devices.

         <title>Phenazinium&#8208; and Malachite Green&#8208;Based Pd(II) Cages: Chiroptical Discrimination of Nucleoside Triphosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of two coal&#8208;tar dyes, purple N&#8208;ethyl phenazinium (PHP) and malachite green (MGP), into the backbones of bis&#8208;monodentate ligands capable of forming lantern&#8208;shaped Pd2L4 coordination cages is shown. Cage Pd2(PHP)4 was used together with methylene blue cage Pd2(MBP)4 to differentiate between nucleoside triphosphates in solution through CD spectroscopy.







Abstract
Organic chromophores have been successfully implemented into supramolecular systems to bestow them with distinct photophysical properties for various applications, ranging from solar energy conversion, photochemical reactions or as receptors for guest molecules with optical readout. We had previously introduced first members of the large family of coal&#8208;tar dyes (methylene blue, crystal violet and rhodamine) as integral components of coordination cages. Here, we add two new chromophores, malachite green (MGP) and a purple phenazinium dye (PHP), serving as backbones of bis&#8208;monodentate banana&#8208;shaped ligands with pyridine donors. We show the formation of corresponding green and purple coloured Pd2L4 coordination cages and investigate their interaction with chiral guest molecules via UV&#8208;Vis and CD spectroscopy. The PHP cage can be used to recognize nucleoside triphosphates, based on chirality transfer from the guests to the structurally flexible helicate. In combination with the already known methylene blue cage MBP we could further differentiate between all four canonical NTPs through characteristic changes in the observed CD signatures.

         <title>Enzymatic Cleavage of Double&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries (DELs) to Single&#8208;Stranded DELs with Compounds at the 3&#8242; End: Its Application in Photo&#8208;Crosslinking Selection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a novel method for converting double&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (dsDELs) to single&#8208;stranded DELs (ssDELs) with compounds at the 3&#8217; end using cleavabledeoxyuridine. Moreover, such ssDELs are converted to dsDELs with the coding information covalently attached to photo&#8208;crosslinkers (dsDELs&#8208;PC). This approach enhances photo&#8208;crosslinking selection efficiency, maintaining high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise (S/N) ratios under stringent conditions.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology is a crucial tool in pharmaceutical research, rapidly identifying compounds that bind to a target of interest from an extensive pool of compounds. In this study, we propose a new method for generating single&#8208;stranded DELs (ssDELs) with compounds at the 3&#8217; end. The introduction of uniquely designed hairpin&#8208;shaped headpieces containing deoxyuridine (NC&#8208;HP) and the use of a cleavage enzyme facilitate the conversion from double&#8208;stranded DELs (dsDELs) to such ssDELs. Moreover, Klenow fill&#8208;in provides the dsDELs with photo&#8208;crosslinkers covalently linked to the coding region, which exhibit durability even under stringent washing conditions and enable photo&#8208;crosslinking with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, as also confirmed in cell&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinking selections.

     alt="Enzymatic Cleavage of Double-Stranded DNA-Encoded Libraries (DELs) to Single-Stranded DELs with Compounds at the 3&#8242; End: Its Application in Photo-Crosslinking Selection"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we developed a novel method for converting double-stranded DNA-encoded libraries (dsDELs) to single-stranded DELs (ssDELs) with compounds at the 3&#8217; end using cleavabledeoxyuridine. Moreover, such ssDELs are converted to dsDELs with the coding information covalently attached to photo-crosslinkers (dsDELs-PC). This approach enhances photo-crosslinking selection efficiency, maintaining high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios under stringent conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology is a crucial tool in pharmaceutical research, rapidly identifying compounds that bind to a target of interest from an extensive pool of compounds. In this study, we propose a new method for generating single-stranded DELs (ssDELs) with compounds at the 3&#8217; end. The introduction of uniquely designed hairpin-shaped headpieces containing deoxyuridine (NC-HP) and the use of a cleavage enzyme facilitate the conversion from double-stranded DELs (dsDELs) to such ssDELs. Moreover, Klenow fill-in provides the dsDELs with photo-crosslinkers covalently linked to the coding region, which exhibit durability even under stringent washing conditions and enable photo-crosslinking with a high signal-to-noise ratio, as also confirmed in cell-based photo-crosslinking selections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cleavage of a Peroxide Bond via a Dual Attack by Functional Mimics of Glutathione Peroxidase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have reported the cleavage of a peroxide bond via a dual attack by synthetic model compounds similar to the nonmetal&#8208;containing peroxidase enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), bacterial peroxide sensor protein OxyR (PaOxyR) and Populus trichocarpa GPX5 (PtGPX5).







Abstract
Nonmetal&#8208;containing peroxidase enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and peroxiredoxins, control cellular redox levels by catalyzing the reduction of H2O2. The remarkably higher reactivity of GPx enzyme as compared to the fully dissociated synthetic selenolate/thiolate molecule is probably due to the dual&#8208;attack on the peroxide bond (HO1&#8722;O2H) by the enzyme; The first one is a nucleophilic attack of the selenolate/thiolate moiety to O1 atom and the second attack at the O2 atom of the peroxide bond by the acidic &#8220;parked proton&#8221; from Trp or His residue present at the enzyme's active site, leading to the facile cleavage of O&#8722;O bond. Herein, we report two synthetic compounds (1 and 2), having a selenolate (Se&#8722;) and a proton donor (imidazolium or &#8722;COOH group) moieties, which showed excellent GPx&#8208;like activity via dual&#8208;attack on the peroxide bond. The combined effect of selenolate moiety that donates electrons to the antibonding (&#963;*) orbital of O1&#8722;O2 bond and the imidazolium or carboxylic acid moiety at the side chain that forms a strong H&#8208;bonding with the O2 atom facilitates O&#8722;O bond cleavage of H2O2 more efficiently. 1 and 2 exhibit remarkable ability in protecting Cu(I)&#8208;complex [TpmCu(CH3CN)]+ (9) against H2O2 by acting as a sacrificial antioxidant, thereby preventing metal&#8208;mediated ROS production.

         <title>Potassium Phosphate&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of C4&#8208;Phosphorylated Quinolines via Cascade Cycloisomerization of Ynones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an efficient base&#8208;promoted cascade cycloisomerization of &#946;&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones with diphenylphosphine oxides, enabling straightforward synthesis of C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinolines under mild conditions. The method demonstrates broad substrate scope, high yields, and scalability. More importantly, a representative C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinoline exhibited potent inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus, highlighting the potential antimicrobial applications of these novel compounds.







Abstract
A cascade phosphorylation cycloisomerization of readily accessible ynones and diphenylphosphine oxides facilitated by potassium phosphate is described, allowing for the straightforward synthesis of C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinoline scaffolds. The formation of a C&#8722;P bond and a C&#8722;N bond is achieved in a single procedure without the need for pre&#8208;assembled quinoline cores prior to phosphorylation. This transformation operates without the requirement for metals or oxidants and exhibits excellent compatibility with various functional groups. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity evaluation demonstrated that the synthesized C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinoline derivatives exhibited potent inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus.

         <title>Overcoming the Challenges of Hyperpolarizing Substrates with Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in an MRI System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The parahydrogen&#8208;derived 13C hyperpolarization can be generated with high field polarization transfer sequences. We attempt to circumvent the need for a dedicated polarizer by using the MRI system to produce the substrate. We study the experimental conditions imposed by the MRI setup and mitigate these effects via simulations and experiments and reach hyperpolarization levels of 44.5&#8201;% of the 1&#8208;13C site of ethyl acetate&#8208;d6.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization of 13C nuclei in biomolecules and their administration as imaging agents enables in&#8208;vivo monitoring of metabolism. This approach has demonstrated potential for deriving imaging biomarkers for cancer detection, differentiation, and therapy efficacy assessment. The in&#8197;situ generation of polarized substrates using a permanent addition of parahydrogen to an unsaturated precursor inside the bore of an MRI system used for subsequent imaging circumvents the need for a dedicated external polarizer. This approach reduces polarization loss associated with sample transfer, minimizes hardware requirements and cost, and results in reduced spatial requirements. However, performing INEPT&#8208;like pulsed sequences for heteronuclear spin&#8208;order transfer in the bore of an MRI system is challenged by poor uniformity of static and excitation magnetic field and molecular convection during the polarization transfer. Therefore, here we characterize these effects, implement a robust modification to the pulse sequence, and measure experimentally the polarization improvement upon modification of the sequence. After rigorous optimization of the parameters, we obtained a 13C polarization of 44.5&#8201;% for 50&#8197;mM of the 1&#8208;13C site of ethyl acetate&#8208;d6. Our parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization approach enhances the accessibility to hyperpolarized MRI, circumventing the need for an external polarizer.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the sialyl cation, the intermediate of sialylation reactions, is experimentally characterized for the first time using messenger&#8208;tagging infrared spectroscopy. The results suggest that this intermediate is stabilized by remote participation of the C5&#8208;NHAc group, leading to the formation of a bicyclic structure. Here, the &#946;&#8208;side is shielded, potentially contributing to the &#945;&#8208;selectivity of various SN1&#8208;type sialylation reactions.







Abstract
Sialic acids are monosaccharide residues involved in several biological processes. Controlling the stereoselectivity of sialylation reactions is challenging and mechanistic studies on the structure of its intermediate, the sialyl cation, are scarce. Here it is shown that a sialyl cation can be generated and isolated from an ionized sialic acid precursor. This short&#8208;lived species is structurally characterized for the first time using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy. In combination with quantum chemical calculations, the results reveal that the positive charge at the anomeric carbon of the sialyl cation is stabilized by remote participation of the C5&#8208;NHAc group leading to the formation of a bridged structure. In this structure, the &#946;&#8208;side is shielded from nucleophilic attack, potentially explaining the &#945;&#8208;selectivity of this building block in SN1&#8208;type sialylation reactions. Other modes of participation are energetically unfavored and cannot be observed experimentally.

         <title>One&#8208;Electron NO to N2O Pathways via Heme Models and Lewis Acid: Metal Effects and Differences from the Enzymatic Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to native nitric oxide reductases using a two&#8208;electron process, Fe and Co hemes, activated by BF3, were recently found to effect this reaction with one electron. Our mechanistic study revealed their complete reaction pathways and advantageous reactivity origins of Fe heme compared to Co and the native pathway.







Abstract
Some pathogens use heme&#8208;containing nitric oxide reductases (NORs) to reduce NO to N2O as their defense mechanism to detoxify NO and reduce nitrosative stress. This reduction is also significant in the global N cycle. Our previous experimental work showed that Fe and Co porphyrin NO complexes can couple with external NO to form N2O when activated by the Lewis acid BF3. A key difference from conventional two&#8208;electron enzymatic reaction is that one electron is sufficient. However, a complete understanding of the entire reaction pathways and the more favorable reactivity for Fe remains unknown. Here, we present a quantum chemical study to provide such information. Our results confirmed Fe's higher experimental reactivity, showing advantages in all steps of the reaction pathway: easier metal oxidation for NO reduction and N&#8722;O cleavage as well as a larger size to expedite the N/O coordination mode transition. The Co system, with a similar product energy as the enzyme, shows potential for further development in catalytic NO coupling. This work also offers the first evidence that this new one&#8208;electron NO reduction is both kinetically competitive and thermodynamically more favorable than the native pathway, supporting future initiatives in optimizing NO reduction agents in biology, environment, and industry.

         <title>A Strongly Coupled 1T&#8217;&#8208;ReSe2@2H&#8208;MoSe2 van der Waals Heterostructure for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals heterostructure composed of 1T&#8217;&#8208;ReSe2 and 2H&#8208;MoSe2 exhibits exceptional catalytic capabilities in promoting the hydrogen evolution reaction, primarily attributed to the strong electronic interaction between 1T&#8217;&#8208;ReSe2 and 2H&#8208;MoSe2. Theoretical calculations indicate that hydrogen adsorption at the heterostructure exhibits an appropriate Gibbs free energy alteration conducive to the hydrogen evolution process.







Abstract
Developing efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for high current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is a pressing requirement for commercial industrial electrolyzers. In this study, a vertical 1T&#8217;&#8208;ReSe2@2H&#8208;MoSe2 van der Waals heterostructure was developed through interface engineering to enhance the advantages of each component and expose numerous active sites. Experimental investigations and density functional theory calculations demonstrate significant electronic coupling at the interface between 1T&#8217;&#8208;ReSe2 and 2H&#8208;MoSe2, with suitable Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption. The 1T&#8217;&#8208;ReSe2@2H&#8208;MoSe2 heterostructure catalyst achieves high current density HER with low overpotentials of 191&#8197;mV to generate up to 800&#8197;mA/cm2 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4, outperforming commercial 5&#8201;% Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, this catalyst exhibits rapid reaction kinetics and long&#8208;term durability, illustrating a successful approach to designing efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts for hydrogen production through interface engineering.

         <dc:description>Supramolecular interaction between polymers has been utilized for constructing three&#8208;dimensional polymer structures with unique physical and chemical properties. In this study, we demonstrated a novel supramolecular miktoarm star&#8208;shaped copolymer with a cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc) core using metal&#8208;ligand coordination. Axial coordination of the terminal pyridyl group of poly(methyl methacrylate) to the CoPc core of 4&#8208;armed star&#8208;shaped polystyrene provided AB4&#8208; and A2B4&#8208;type&#160;&#181;&#8208;stars by stepwise complexation. The spin&#8208;coated polymer films from the mixed solutions of CoPcPS4&#160;and pyPMMA in a 1:1 or 1:2 mass ratio showed phase&#8208;separated nanodomains with smooth surfaces.

         <title>Metalized Borylene in Boron&#8722;Gold Carbonyl Complexes: Infrared Spectra and Theoretical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borylenes (:B&#8211;R), built on a single B&#8211;R bond between boron and another nonmetallic atom or group,&#160;are a heated subject of special interest due to their intriguing transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mimicking reactivity, but the relative lack of understanding for the electronic structure and chemical bonding of transition metal borides leads to lingering neglect of metalized borylenes (:B&#8211;M) based on covalent B&#8211;M bonding. Here we use infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in combination with density functional calculations to study the geometric structure and chemical bonding of boron&#8208;gold carbonyl complex cations. The structure and bonding analyses demonstrated that the BAu(CO)3+ and BAu2(CO)4+ complexes can be described as bis&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;trapped borylene adducts. While the metal&#8208;rich BAu3(CO)4+ complex represents an unusual multicenter&#8208;bond&#8208;stabilized borylene cation with excellent &#963;&#8208;acidity and &#960;&#8208;backbonding capability for CO activation, featuring Cs symmetry with a quasi&#8208;T&#8208;shaped BAu3+ core. It is manifested that BAu3+ presents greater amphoteric reactivity and improved stability compared to BAu1,2+ due to the presence of the three&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron Au&#8211;B&#8211;Au bond. This study discloses a conceptually new platform for accessing reactive metalized borylenes by exploiting the boron&#8208;mediated multicenter&#8208;bond stabilization strategy and using more bench&#8208;stable and ubiquitous metal carbonyl fragments as starting materials, thus providing a broader opportunity for the design of novel chemical structures and catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;alternant benzodifluoranthene tetraimides is synthesized using UV&#8208;photocyclization of a vinyl&#8208;bridged dimer that features two newly developed 7,8,9,10&#8208;fluoranthene diimide (FDI) units. The tetraimide molecule exhibits several advantages over the FDI cores, including an extended absorption band and a red&#8208;shift in photoluminescence spectra. The fully fused aromatic tetraimides shows typical reverse saturable absorption behavior, demonstrating superior optical&#8208;limiting performance compared to vinyl&#8208;bridged dimer.

A novel tetraimide&#8208;functionalized non&#8208;alternant &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, namely, benzodifluoranthene tetraimides (BDFTI), has been designed and synthesized through highly efficient UV&#8208;photocyclization of a vinyl&#8208;bridged fluoranthene diimide dimer (i.&#8201;e., FDI&#8722;V). The synthesis of FDI&#8722;V starts from a straightforward three&#8208;step route to produce novel 7,8,9,10&#8208;fluoranthene diimide (FDIs) building&#8208;blocks, followed by nearly complete bromination and then Stille&#8208;coupling reaction to give the desired dimer. The analysis by X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms a near&#8208;coplanar geometry for FDIs, while BDFTI shows a U&#8208;shaped and distorted backbone configuration proven by theoretical optimizations. The tetraimide BDFTI exhibits several advantages over the FDI cores, including an extended absorption band and a red&#8208;shift in photoluminescence spectra. This enhancement can be attributed to the presence of additional electron&#8208;deficient imide units, which promotes increased intramolecular charge transfer and improved electron affinity. All the imides show a local aromatic characteristic owing to the incorporation of pentagon rings in the &#960;&#8208;frameworks. The fully fused BDFTI exhibits nonlinear optical properties as analyzed by the open&#8208;aperture Z&#8208;scan technique, demonstrating superior optical&#8208;limiting performance compared to vinyl&#8208;bridged FDI&#8722;V. The versatile UV&#8208;photocyclization chemistries provide a pathway for developing complex and unique multiimide&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, paving the way for creating high&#8208;performance optical&#8208;limiting materials.

&lt;p&gt;A novel non-alternant benzodifluoranthene tetraimides is synthesized using UV-photocyclization of a vinyl-bridged dimer that features two newly developed 7,8,9,10-fluoranthene diimide (FDI) units. The tetraimide molecule exhibits several advantages over the FDI cores, including an extended absorption band and a red-shift in photoluminescence spectra. The fully fused aromatic tetraimides shows typical reverse saturable absorption behavior, demonstrating superior optical-limiting performance compared to vinyl-bridged dimer.

         <title>An Ultrahigh Affinity DNA Aptamer for Quinine and Its Intrinsic Fluorescence Based Label&#8208;Free Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh affinity DNA aptamer for quinine was obtained using capture&#8208;SELEX, and it did not bind to cocaine. In comparison to the prior MN4 aptamer, the new aptamer has 70&#8208;fold better affinity with a different way of binding to quinine.







Abstract
Measuring quinine is critical for the detection of its overdose, understanding its pharmacological and toxicological effects, and monitoring its pollution. While a previously reported aptamer named MN4 can bind quinine, it was not selected for it, leading to compromised binding affinity and specificity. In this work, a new quinine aptamer was isolated using the library immobilization capture&#8208;SELEX technique. The Q1 aptamer has a Kd value of 10&#8197;nM determined by an isothermal titration calorimetry experiment and 45&#8197;nM in a fluorescence binding assay. A 3.5&#8197;nM quinine limit of detection was obtained based on the aptamer binding&#8208;induced quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of quinine. A large blue shift in fluorescence was observed for quinine upon binding to Q1, whereas binding to MN4 led to a very small red shift, indicating different ways of quinine binding by these two aptamers. Q1 did not bind cocaine based on NMR spectroscopy and fluorescence assays also indicated excellent selectivity against other tested molecules. This work has supplied a high affinity aptamer for quinine that can be useful for its detection and fundamental aptamer binding studies. It also highlights the advantages of using capture&#8208;SELEX to isolate aptamers for small molecules.

         <title>Mechanical, Thermal, and Morphological Analysis of Himalayan Agave Fiber/GO Coated Fly Ash Hybrid Polypropylene Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid composites of alkali&#8208;APTES treated Himalayan agave fibers (HAF) and polypropylene (PP) successfully reinforced with graphene oxide (GO) treated fly ash (FA). The optimized reinforcement improved tensile and flexural properties, and crystallinity, and highlighting a significant step towards sustainable and performance composite manufacturing.







Abstract
Composites containing two different types of reinforcements offer a wide range of possibilities and synergistic properties. This study investigates the hybridization effect of chemically active fly ash (FA) (5&#8197;wt&#8201;%) on the composites made from alkali (1&#8197;wt&#8201;%) &#8208; APTES silane (2&#8197;wt&#8201;%) treated Himalayan agave fibers (HAF) (25&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and polypropylene (PP). Prior to FA activation, the planetary ball mill was used to suitably reduce the particle size of the FA with was confirmed by the dynamic light scattering approach. Secondary reinforcement FA was modified with APTES silane (1&#8197;wt&#8201;%), followed by treatment with graphene oxide (GO) (0.5, 0.75, and 1&#8197;wt&#8201;%). The highest tensile strength of 40.47&#8197;MPa and modulus of 1.49&#8197;GPa were observed for the hybrid composites fabricated from 0.75 and 1.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% GO treated fly ash. Interestingly, this trend differed for flexural properties, and the highest flexural strength of 53.52&#8197;MPa was demonstrated by 0.5&#8197;wt&#8201;% GO treated FA hybrid composite. Thermal characterization revealed that addition of fiber increased crystallinity but decreased thermal stability, whereas a good wettability of the fiber and FA in matrix was demonstrated through morphological characterization.

         <dc:description>Polymorphism&#160;and its screening&#160;to select the best&#8208;performing form is in high demand. In low molecular weight organogels (LMWG), gelators are designed as they contain flexible groups, functionalities capable of varied H&#8208;bonding,&#160;and increased&#160;the potential to show polymorphism. We synthesized a bis&#8208;urea based LMWG&#160;G1&#160;and isolated three distinct polymorphic phases (Form I,&#160;II, and&#160;III).&#160;G1&#160;polymorphs showed&#160;noticeable differences in solubility;&#160;precisely, Form I is highly soluble compared to the other two. Gel screening was carried out for all three polymorphs using different stimuli like heat&#8208;cool, sonication, shaking, and grinding. Among the polymorphs,&#160;Form I&#160;was found to have better gelling ability which was reflected by the solvent scope, thermal stability (gel&#8208;sol transition temperature Tgel), minimum gelator concentration (M.G.C.), stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, morphology, and rheological properties. The differences in their gelation performance among the three polymorphs are associated with their solubility parameter. Stimuli like sonication, shaking, and grinding triggered&#160;Form I&#160;to form a gel. &#160;Form II&#160;and&#160;III&#160;responded to heat&#8208;cool stimuli only due to poor solubility. Therefore, it is noted crucial to add polymorph screening as an integral part of the gel synthesis to avoid problems associated with reproducibility in the gel prophecy of LMWG systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of ruthenium(II) tris(2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl) (Ru(bpy)32+) with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) as the good coreactant can be unexpectedly enhanced by a weak coreactant, such as triethanolamine (TEOA). First, the intensity of ECL emitted by Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA can be remarkably amplified by 10.8&#8208;fold after adding some amount of TEOA. Moreover, the ECL layer thickness, measured by self&#8208;interference spectroscopy, is also doubled. The enhancement far exceeding the superposition of respective contribution of TPrA and TEOA was elucidated by a &#8220;chemical oxidation mechanism&#8221;, in which TEOA+&#8226; acts as a chemical enhancer to oxidize TPrA in solution and to accelerate significantly the ECL reaction kinetics. This mechanism was proved by single&#8208;photon counting experiment and finite element simulations. In addition, the dual&#8208;coreactants strategy works well not only in solution with freely diffusive Ru(bpy)32+, but also on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;functionalized microbeads, suggesting that ethanolamines could act as cheap, easily available and low&#8208;background enhancers for ECL&#8208;based bioanalysis and microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ reduced Cu3N nanocrystals enable high&#8208;efficiency ammonia synthesis and zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) involves an 8&#8208;electron transfer process and competes with the hydrogen evolution reaction process, resulting in lower yields and Faraday efficiency (FE) in the process of NH3 synthesis. Especially, Cu&#8208;based catalysts (Cu0 and Cu+) have been investigated in the field of NO3RR due to the energy levels of d&#8208;orbital and the least unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) &#960;* of nitrate's orbital. Based on the above, we synthesized a Cu&#8208;based compound containing Cu3N (Cu+) through a simple one&#8208;step pyrolysis method, applied it to electrocatalytic NO3RR, and tested the performance of the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. Through various characterization analyses, Cu&#8208;based catalysts (Cu+) are the key active sites in reduction reactions, making Cu3N a potential catalyst for ammonia synthesis. The research results indicate the application of Cu3N catalyst in NO3RR shows the best NH3 yield of 173.7 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, with FENH3 reaching 91.0% at &#8722;0.3 V vs. RHE, which is much higher than that of Cu catalyst without N. In addition, the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery based on Cu3N electrode also exhibits an NH3 yield of 39.8 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, 63.0% FENH3, and a power density of 2.7 mW cm&#8722;2, as well as stable cycling charge&#8208;discharge stability for 5 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Using a Popular Titrating Agent: Aryl&#8208;Chlorides and &#8208;Fluorides Activation by the Diphenylacetic Acid Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and cheap tool smoothly activates recalcitrant electron&#8208;rich aryl fluorides by combining visible light irradiation with a popular titrating agent. The process generates in&#8208;situ aryl radicals, which can be then trapped forming a variety of new covalent bonds. The reductive method left untouched functional groups that have smaller reduction potentials than those of Ar&#8722;X bonds, opening the door to otherwise impossible synthetic strategies.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;chlorides and &#8208;fluorides are common building blocks, but their use in synthesis is limited by the high stability of their Ar&#8722;X bonds. The generation of aryl radicals via activation of strong Ar&#8722;X bonds is possible through the irradiation of tailor&#8208;made organic anions, which become reductants stronger than lithium metal. We report that the combination of visible light with the cheap diphenylacetic acid dianion is an even better tool, showing excellent activity across a variety of complex substrates and providing opportunities for late&#8208;stage drug modification. Ar&#8722;X bonds are chemoselectively activated in the presence of more easily reducible functions, such as Alk&#8208;Cl ones and carbonyl groups. These results pave the way to original synthetic strategies that would be otherwise considered impossible.

         <title>Enantioselective Cascade Reactions of Aminocatalytic Dienamines and Trienamines Initiated by a Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines and showcases how aminocatalytic dienamines and trienamines can be used in stereoselective cascade reactions, that are initiated by a cycloaddition reaction to rapidly access complex chiral molecules. We aspire that the chemical community can use this review to design new cascade reaction or use current methodologies in complex molecule synthesis.







Abstract
Cycloadditions are widely accepted as a group of reactions that rapidly generate molecular complexity. Being highly atom economic and often predictable, these reactions can generate up to four stereogenic centers and two C&#8722;C (or C&#8722;X) bonds in one reaction step. During the last two decades, asymmetric aminocatalysis has shown to be a successful strategy for controlling stereoselectivity and enabling reactivity of cycloaddition reactions. By increasing the conjugation of the carbonyl species employed, dienamines and trienamines can be catalytically formed. Not only can these facilitate the cycloaddition, often accompanied by high levels of stereocontrol, but they also leave a residual enamine or carbonyl (by hydrolysis) in the cycloadduct. This residual functionality can engage in further intramolecular reactions generating complex cyclic systems in a one&#8208;pot cascade manner. In this regard, asymmetric aminocatalysis can add another layer of complexity to the already complex nature of cycloadditions. In this review, we will present the general concept of such reactivity patterns of dienamines and trienamines, and hereafter showcase examples in the literature. We aspire that the chemical community can use these concepts to design new enantioselective aminocatalytic cascade reactions to access enantioenriched, complex compounds, and perhaps use these in complex molecule synthesis.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a general remote tribromo&#8208; and trichloromethylation process using CBr4 and CBrCl3 as ready available sources of trihalomethyl radicals. This method operates under mild and metal&#8208;free photocatalyzed conditions and enables the access to &#947;&#8208;trihalomethylated enals with complete regioselectivity in up to 71% isolated yield. Importantly, this protocol is easily adapted to the selective one&#8208;pot synthesis of the corresponding &#947;&#8208;dihalomethylidenated enals in up to 49% overall yield. Mechanistic studies are in favor of a radical chain propagation initiated by an oxidative quenching of the photocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetohydrodynamic Enhancement of Biofuel Cell Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofuel cells have become an interesting alternative for the design of sustainable energy conversion systems with multiple applications ranging from biosensing and bioelectronics to autonomously moving devices. However, as an electrochemical system, their performance is intimately related to mass transport conditions. In this work, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect is studied as an easy and straightforward alternative to enhance the performance of a biofuel cell based on the enzymes glucose oxidase (GOx) and bilirubin oxidase (BOD). The synergetic effect between the electric and ionic currents, produced by the enzymatic redox reactions, and a magnetic field orthogonal to the surface of the electrodes, leads to the formation of localized magnetohydrodynamic vortexes. Such an integrated convective regime generates an increase of the bioelectrocatalytic current and its concomitant power output in the presence of the external magnetic field. In addition, by fine&#8208;tuning the spatial arrangement of the anode and cathode, it is possible to benefit from the sum of anodic and cathodic MHD vortexes, leading to an enhanced power output of up to 300%.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multistep Oxidative Cascade Reaction from a Naphthalenediol&#8208;Based pre&#8208;Ligand to a Tetranuclear Perylenequinone&#8208;Based FeIII Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a family of dinuclear complexes using 2,7&#8208;disubstituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediol ligands that bind by molecular recognition to two neighboring phosphate diesters of the DNA backbone with the dinuclear CuII and NiII complexes exhibiting a severe cytotoxicity for human cancer cells. To increase the binding affinity, we intended to synthesize the corresponding dinuclear FeIII complex. Surprisingly, we obtained a tetranuclear FeIII perylene&#8208;based complex instead of the expected dinuclear FeIII naphthalene&#8208;based complex. In order to establish a rational and reproducible synthesis, we carefully analyzed this reaction. This revealed a multistep oxidative cascade reaction including the pre&#8208;coordination of FeII ions in the N3&#8208;binding pockets, the Lewis&#8208;acid assisted MOM&#8208;deprotection of the pre&#8208;ligand by the pre&#8208;oriented FeII ions, two oxidative aromatic C&#8208;C coupling reactions, oxidation of the perylene&#8208;based backbone and of FeII to FeIII. The careful analysis of bond lengths, HOMA indices (harmonic oscillation model of aromaticity), FTIR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectra supported by DFT calculations reveals the presence of an aromatic 18&#8208;electron oxidized perylenequinone ligand backbone. In summary, a multistep cascade reaction involving in total a 10&#8208;electron oxidation has been established for the straight&#8208;forward synthesis of an unprecedented perylenequinone&#8208;based ligand system.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present a series of six hypervalent bismuth complexes Bi(R1PDPR2)X bearing ligands characterized by the pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(pyrrolide) (PDP) structural motif. While bismuth holds considerable potential for facilitating efficient intersystem crossing (ISC), reports on phosphorescent molecular bismuth complexes are still scarce and mostly based on systems that exhibit inter&#8209; or intraligand charge transfer character of their optical excitations. Herein, the UV/vis absorptive, luminescent, and electrochemical properties of complexes Bi(R1PDPR2)X are explored, where the substituents R1 and R2, as well as the halide ligand X are varied. These compounds are characterized by an intense HOMO&#174;LUMO transition of mixed ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) and interligand charge transfer (LL&#8217;CT) character, as shown by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. At 77 K in a 2&#8208;MeTHF matrix, these compounds exhibit red, long&#8208;lived phosphorescence with lifetimes ranging from 671 to 20 &#181;s. Cyclic voltammetry measurements and TD&#8208;DFT calculations show that the substituents influence HOMO and LUMO energies to almost equal extent, resulting in nearly constant emission wavelengths throughout this series. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of four of the six complexes exemplify the inherent Lewis acidity of the coordinated Bi3+ ion, in spite of its hypervalency.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Pyrazolyl&#8208;diphosphonate Pillared Materials as Heterogeneous Catalysts in the Mukaiyama&#8208;type Aerobic Olefin Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural variability and chemical stability of metal phosphonates under harsh conditions are attractive attributes that have drawn considerable attention in recent years. As the needs for more sustainable solutions rise, the demand for novel and tolerant materials also increases. Thus, herein we report, for the first time, the synthesis of a novel diphosphonic organic linker named pyrazole diphenyl phosphonate (PZDP), envisioning the fabrication of durable metal phosphonates. In view of this, a series of M&#8208;PZDP materials (M = Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn and Co) were synthesized employing either solvothermal or hydrothermal methods. The crystal structures of the Ca, Sr, Zn, and Co derivatives were determined revealing a 2D&#8208;pillared architecture. Zn&#8208;PZDP is an anionic framework with dimethylammonium cations. The Co&#8208;PZDP compound was tested as a heterogeneous catalyst in olefin epoxidation employing molecular oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Silylation and Germylation of Azauracils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for C&#8722;H silylation and germylation of azauracils has been developed under mild reaction conditions. This method is applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules including gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, and naproxen derivatives.







Abstract
The current study demonstrates a Cu(I) catalyzed direct C(sp2)&#8722;H silylation and germylation of azauracil using triphenylsilane and triphenylgermane. A broad scope, excellent functional group tolerance, and suitability for large&#8208;scale reactions are exhibited in this protocol. Moreover, this method can be readily applied to structurally complex bioactive molecules. Experimental results suggest a radical mechanistic pathway for the reaction.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenylmethanol derivatives have been shown to display ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence and afterglow in both crystal and powder states in air at room temperature with afterglows of about 7&#8197;seconds, this material holds promise for static and dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Triphenylmethyl&#8208;based compounds such as rhodamines and fluoresceine representing an old and well&#8208;known class of triphenylmethane dyes, are widely used in fluorescent labeling of bioimaging. Inspired by ultralong room temperature phosphorescence of triphenylphosphine derivatives, herein we report a methoxy substituted triarylmethanol ((4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)diphenylmethanol, LJW&#8208;1) exhibits ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) under ambient condition with afterglows of about 7&#8197;seconds. Its multiple C&#8722;H&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; intermolecular interactions, C&#8722;H&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O intermolecular interactions, hydrogen bond and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions are beneficial for forming rigid environment in the aggregated state which is evidently an important factor in the appearance of excellent RTP. Different substituents on triarylmethanol result in compounds with different lifetimes varying from 7&#8197;&#956;s to 818&#8197;ms. The substituent effects on the phosphorescence of triarylmethanol derivatives provide an efficient method for the design of organic RTP materials and may be enlightening the phosphorescence research of triarylmethanol derivatives.

         <title>An Efficient Bifunctional Core&#8208;Shell ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67 Composite as a Stable Pickering Interfacial Catalyst for the Deacetalization&#8211;Knoevenagel Tandem Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the core&#8208;shell structure of ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67 was applied for the first time to catalyze the tandem reaction in Pickering emulsion system, which exhibited excellent catalytic performance with 99.9&#8201;% yield. Furthermore, ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67 has high stability and maintains good reproducibility after five cycles. This work provides a platform for the design of structurally and functionally diverse MOF&#8208;based interfacial catalysis for Pickering emulsions.







Abstract
Exploiting advanced solid particles is crucial to the construction of Pickering emulsions catalysis. Recently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used as ideal emulsifiers stabilizing Pickering emulsions for interfacial catalysis.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;free Electrolysis Production of Hydrogen Peroxide on Low&#8208;cost Metal&#8208;free Electrocatalysts for Dye Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dilute H2O2 solution could be produced in a flow cell with membrane&#8208;free single electrolyte system by the paired electrolysis over metal&#8208;free h&#8208;BN@C anodes and BP&#8208;2000&#8208;SO3H carbon cathodes, with an overall Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% and a H2O2 production rate of 1872&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. These dilute H2O2 solution could be conveniently taken and directly degrade dyes in water.







Abstract
The efficient production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution was achieved by combining cathodic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) and anodic two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e&#8722; WOR) in two half&#8208;reaction cells. h&#8208;BN loaded on carbon fibers (h&#8208;BN@C) is prepared and employed as an anode material to catalyze 2e&#8722; WOR, while sulfonated commercial BP&#8208;2000 carbons (BP&#8208;2000&#8208;SO3H) were prepared as the cathode materials for 2e&#8722; ORR. In a 2&#8197;M KHCO3 solution, an overall Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% and a total H2O2 production rate of 1872&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 over metal&#8208;free electrodes were accomplished in a membrane&#8208;free flow cell. The dilute H2O2 solution could be directly used to degrade cationic Rhodamine B or methyl blue and anionic methylene orange dyes in water. This work proved low&#8208;cost production of dilute H2O2 solution in simple membrane&#8208;free flow cells with single electrolyte and on&#8208;site utilization for efficient dye degradation.

         <title>Fluorine Labeling and 19F NMR Spectroscopy to Study Biological Molecules and Molecular Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, 19F NMR spectroscopy has been increasingly used to answer scientific objectives of biological relevance. Developments in labeling strategies have made it possible to produce fluorine&#8208;labeled proteins site&#8208;specifically with reasonable efforts. In this review, different labeling strategies and a variety of scientific objectives to which 19F NMR spectroscopy has significantly contributed are presented.







Abstract
High&#8208;resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy represents a key methodology for studying biomolecules and their interplay with other molecules. Recent developments in labeling strategies have made it possible to incorporate fluorine into proteins and peptides reliably, with manageable efforts and, importantly, in a highly site&#8208;specific manner. Paired with its excellent NMR spectroscopic properties and absence in most biological systems, fluorine has enabled scientists to investigate a rather wide range of scientific objectives, including protein folding, protein dynamics and drug discovery. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopic experiments can be conducted in complex environments, such as cell lysate or directly inside living cells. This review presents selected studies demonstrating how 19F NMR spectroscopic approaches enable to contribute to the understanding of biomolecular processes. Thereby the focus has been set to labeling strategies available and specific NMR experiments performed to answer the underlying scientific objective.

         <title>Revisiting Butafulvene Formation by Thermal Dimerization of Fluorene&#8208;Based Dialkynes &#8208; Effects of Aromatic Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimerization of fluorene based dialkynes into planarized butafulvenes is rediscovered and its scope expanded. The stabilities of the isobenzenes involved in the formation are explored and the often proposed antiaromaticity is investigated for these near planar derivatives.







Abstract
Butafulvenes, together with pentafulvenes and [3]radialenes, form a series of constitutional benzene isomers in which aromaticity changes significantly and can be strongly substituent dependent. Butafulvene, as a member of this series, is frequently proposed to be antiaromatic. Based on butafulvenes Hopf, Zimmerman and coworkers first time described, derivatives thereof were synthesized and the effects of substituents on both the stability of the intermediate isobenzenes and on their optoelectronic and (anti)aromatic properties are discussed.

         <title>Hybrid Particle Size Template Method for Controllable Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Multilevel Porous Carbon as High&#8208;Rate Zn&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitor Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped multilevel porous carbon (NMPC) was prepared using a hybrid particle size (20 and 40&#8197;nm) MgO templates. Utilized as a cathode material for zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors, the NMPC prepared with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mass ratio of the two templates exhibited a high energy density and rate performance due to the unique pore structure and nitrogen doping.







Abstract
Achieving high rate performance without compromising energy density has always been a critical objective for zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs). The pore structure and surface properties of carbon cathode materials play a crucial role. We propose utilizing a hybrid particle size (20 and 40&#8197;nm) magnesium oxide templates to regulate the pore structure of nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon derived from the soybean isolate. The multilevel pore structure enhanced ion transport efficiency while also improving the utilization of micropores. Nitrogen doping and oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups enhanced the wettability of carbon materials with aqueous electrolytes and facilitated the chemisorption of Zn2+ on the carbon material surface. The nitrogen&#8208;doped multilevel porous carbon material (HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1) prepared with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mass ratio of the two templates exhibited a specific capacity of 146.65&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, the Swagelok cells assembled with HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1 and Zn foil achieved a high energy density of 121.5&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1, high power output of 166&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and 93.09&#8201;% capacity retention after 8000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Therefore, HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1 is a highly promising candidate for ZHSCs cathode materials. Furthermore, the novel pore regulation strategy and straightforward preparation method offer valuable reference points for other porous carbon&#8208;based functional materials.

         <title>Nutation spectroscopy of a weakly interacting heterobimetallic spin system</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of VIV and CuII spins to design weakly coupled and dissymmetric spin systems has been examined. Such systems were synthesized using porphyrin&#8208;based complexes, with external coordination sites allowing for the formation of dimers via a PdII linker ion. Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy allowed the unequivocal magnetic characterization of the mononuclear precursors V and Cu. The porphyrin dimer VPdCu presented a broad and overlapped spectrum that was more pronounced than for the previously reported VPdV, hinting at the effect of weak interspin interactions between dissimilar spins. Pulsed EPR experiments on V, VPdV and VPdCu samples diluted in a diamagnetic matrix confirmed that this complication is also present in the Field&#8208;Swept Echo&#8208;Detected (FSED) spectra of the heterometallic VPdCu system. Despite the strongly overlapped field&#8208;swept spectra, spin nutation experiments revealed two distinct oscillations in the case of VPdCu, which are assigned to transitions with different spin characters. Remarkably, coherence is retained above liquid nitrogen temperatures for all complexes, in particular up to 295 K for V and VPdV and 150 K for VPdCu.</dc:description>

         <title>Remarkable effect of stereoisomerism on the Am(III)/Ln(III) solvent extraction. New ligands for highly efficient separation of americium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;2,9&#8208;diamide ligands were constructed based on 2&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine and obtained as pure diastereomers. These ligands demonstrated advanced properties in liquid&#8208;liquid extraction tests. They revealed high efficiency of americium(III) extraction alongside with the record values of selectivity in the separation of americium from light lanthanides from strongly acidic media. An abrupt increase of extraction efficiency when moving along the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium was observed. The examination of the extraction behavior of pure diastereomeric forms revealed noticeable differences in their selectivity while maintaining the overall extraction trend. The explanation of the discovered patterns was elucidated by a comprehensive study of the ability of the ligands to bind lanthanide nitrates in solutions. All the data collected (UV&#8208;vis and NMR titration, X&#8208;ray analysis of resulting complexes, solvation numbers estimation) were supported by quantum chemical calculation. These data clearly indicated that in case of light lanthanides the formation of 1:1 complexes is most preferable. In the same time, complexes with heavy lanthanides, such as ytterbium and lutetium, exist as ionic pairs which may consist of [L2M]z+ cations counterbalanced by metallates anions, which may result in formation of unusual composition species L2M2 or even L4M5 clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Macrocyclization in Dynamic Chiral Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The absolute and relative configurations of a macrocyclic natural product bearing multiple chirality have a crucial influence on its physical and biological properties. Nevertheless, their preparation with full stereocontrol remains largely unexplored in synthetic community. Here, we show a stereodivergent macrocyclization under dynamic chiral confinement in which the stepwise chirality switching of a chiral space directs complete stereocontrol. To confine a substrate in a dynamic chiral space, we used a chiral capsule enclosing a substrate which is collectively switchable in the chirality in response to external stimuli, but their conformations are firmly fixed by subsequent self&#8208;assembly. The consecutive chirality switching enables the confined reactions of an enclosed achiral substrate to sequentially install diverse chirality on a macrocycle product with full stereocontrol in a single pot operation, thus changing only a sequence of physical stimuli enables access to a remarkable stereodivergence in a macrocyclization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Radical Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization is recognized as an effective method for generating stable and luminescent radical polymers with both main&#8208;chain and side&#8208;chain structures. The intra&#8208; and interchain through&#8208;space interactions within these polymers play a crucial role in enhancing stability and luminescent performance compared to small radical molecules.







Abstract
Organic radicals are gaining significant interest in luminescent materials due to their unique properties, which present unprecedented opportunities for innovation across various fields, from display technology to biomedical applications. However, addressing challenges related to stability and low fluorescence efficiency is crucial to unlocking their full potential for practical applications. Polymerization has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance intra&#8208; and interchain through&#8208;space interactions, enabling the creation of stable luminescent radicals with excellent processing and multifunctional properties. This concept emphasizes the strategic use of polymerization in designing and synthesizing stable main&#8208;chain and side&#8208;chain radical polymers. This approach not only broadens the scope of stable radicals but also improves their luminescence properties as photofunctional materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work encompasses construction of four Azo&#8208;Stilbene&#8208; ThT (AST) and metal binding pyridyl&#8208;amine moieties and exploration on their multifunctionality w.r.t. to (i) metal chelating capacities (ii) A&#946; recognition and ability to modulate their aggregation, (iii) scavenge free radicals, (iv) inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase and (v) cytotoxicity with neuronal cells.







Abstract
Inhibition of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) aggregation and cholinesterase activity are two major therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multifunctional Molecules (MFMs) specifically designed to address other contributing factors, such as metal ion induced abnormalities, oxidative stress, toxic A&#946; aggregates etc. are very much required. Several multifunctional molecules have been developed using different molecular scaffolds. Reported herein is a new series of four MFMs based on ThT, Azo&#8208;stilbene and metal ion chelating pockets. The synthesis, characterization, and metal chelation ability for [Cu2+ and Zn2+] are presented herein. Furthermore, we explored their multifunctionality w.r.t. to their (i) recognition of A&#946; aggregates and monomeric form, (ii) utility in modulating the aggregation pathways of both metal&#8208;free and metal&#8208;bound amyloid&#8208;&#946;, (iii) ex&#8208;vivo staining of amyloid plaques in 5xFAD mice brain sections, (iv) ability to scavenge free radicals and (v) ability to inhibit cholinesterase activity. Molecular docking studies were also performed with A&#946; peptides and acetylcholinesterase enzyme to understand the observed inhibitory effect on activity. Overall, the studies presented here establish the multifunctional nature of these molecules and qualify them as promising candidates for furthermore investigation in the quest for finding Alzheimer's disease treatment.

         <title>Origins of Catalysis in Non&#8208;Heme Fe(II)/2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Histone Lysine Demethylase KDM4A with Differently Methylated Histone H3 Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the factors influencing Fe(II)/2OG KDM4A&#8208;mediated demethylation of three different trimethylated H3 substrates using MD, QM/MM, QM/MM MD, and QM/MM metadynamics simulations. The study reveals how SCS and LR residues, protein dynamics, active site geometry, and the intrinsic electric field of KDM4A affect the demethylation process, contributing valuable insights for developing substrate&#8208;specific inhibitors for JmjC KDMs.







Abstract
Histone lysine demethylase 4&#8197;A (KDM4A), a non&#8208;heme Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent oxygenase that catalyzes the demethylation of tri&#8208;methylated lysine residues at the 9, 27, and 36 positions of histone H3 (H3&#8197;K9me3, H3&#8197;K27me3, and H3&#8197;K36me3). These methylated residues show contrasting transcriptional roles; therefore, understanding KDM4A's catalytic mechanisms with these substrates is essential to explain the factors that control the different sequence&#8208;dependent demethylations. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD)&#8208;based combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods to investigate determinants of KDM4A catalysis with H3&#8197;K9me3, H3&#8197;K27me3 and H3&#8197;K36me3 substrates. In KDM4A&#8208;H3(5&#8211;14)K9me3 and KDM4A&#8208;H3(23&#8211;32)K27me3 ferryl complexes, the O&#8722;H distance positively correlates with the activation barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step, however in the KDM4A&#8208;H3(32&#8211;41)K36me3, no direct one&#8208;to&#8208;one relationship was found implying that the synergistic effects between the geometric parameters, second sphere interactions and the intrinsic electric field contribute for the effective catalysis for this substrate. The intrinsic electric field along the Fe&#8722;O bond changes between the three complexes and shows a positive correlation with the HAT activation barrier, suggesting that modulating electric field can be used for fine engineering KDM catalysis with a specific substrate. The results reveal how KDM4A uses a combination of strategies to enable near equally efficient demethylation of different H3Kme3 residues.

         <title>A New Platform Molecule from Gluconolactone? Access to Furanics, Rare Sugars, &#946;&#8208;Ketoamides and Amino Furanones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gluconolactone, readily derived from glucose, is transformed into a versatile hydroxymethyl furanoic ester in two steps. The reactions are catalyzed by either acid or base. The key intermediate from the base&#8208;catalyzed elimination has been studied in detail and found to serve as a versatile platform for the synthesis of highly functionalized molecules.







Abstract
Gluconolactone serves as a readily available and inexpensive starting material for synthesizing the potential platform chemical (Z)&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;1,2&#8201;:&#8201;5,6&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;hex&#8208;3&#8208;enolactone in two steps. In this work, the selective elimination of triacetone gluconolactone was optimized. The resulting product is a versatile molecule, capable of being transformed into various compound classes in one or a few steps, i.&#8201;e. potentially a new biomass&#8208;based platform chemical. This study demonstrates how it can be transformed into furanics, rare sugars, &#946;&#8208;ketoamides, and amino furanones.

         <title>Interface Engineering of Flower&#8208;like Co2P/WO3&#8722;x/Carbon Cloth Catalysts with Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared the flower&#8208;like cobalt phosphide and tungsten oxide self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst (Co2P/WO3&#8722;x/CC) with oxygen vacancies. In 1.0&#8197;M KOH solution, the Co2P/WO3&#8722;x/CC catalyst exhibits excellent OER activity, achieving a low overpotential of only 254&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope as small as 58.32&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. Moreover, it maintains good stability over 100&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The Constructing an efficient and low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is critical for improving the performance of electrolysis in alkaline water. In this study, a self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst of flower&#8208;like cobalt phosphide and tungsten oxide (Co2P/WO3&#8722;x/CC) was prepared on carbon cloth (CC) surface by hydrothermal reaction with solution immersion etching and phosphorization annealing under H2/Ar atmosphere. This strategy can generate oxygen vacancies (OV), improving the speed of charge transfer between cobalt phosphide (Co2P) and tungsten oxide (WO3&#8722;x) components. The catalyst greatly increases the electrochemical active surface area, which is beneficial for efficient oxygen evolution. Electrochemical testing studies show that in 1.0&#8197;M KOH solution, Co2P&#8211;WO3&#8722;x/CC catalyst exhibits good OER activity, with a low overpotential of 254&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 58.32&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The synergistic effect of oxygen vacancies and Co2P with WO3&#8722;x can regulate electronic structures, expose more active sites, and cooperatively enhancing the OER activity. This study provides a workable strategy for preparing efficient non&#8208;noble metal OER electrocatalysts on engineered interfaces and OV.

         <title>Approaching Dynamic Behaviors of Life through Systems Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systems chemistry focuses on constructing and exploring complex chemical systems by combining chemical reactions and molecular assemblies. It provides a powerful tool for recreating life&#8208;like behaviors and offers a chemical approach to synthetic life.







Abstract
The intricate interplay of metabolic reactions and molecular assembly in living systems enables spatiotemporally organization and gives rise to diverse dynamic behaviors that characterize life. Over the last decades, research efforts have increasingly focused on replicating the remarkable properties and characteristics of living systems, driving the rapid growth of systems chemistry. This young discipline which generally studies interacting molecular networks and emergent system&#8208;level properties, behaviors, and functions, offers new concepts and tools to tackle the complexity of life. In this review paper, we have explored seminal research and recent advancements in recreating dynamic behaviors of life with systems chemistry. We believe that the recreation of the dynamic behaviors of life through systems chemistry would set the initial steps to obtain synthetic life de novo.

         <title>B12&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylation of Carbon Tetrahalides: Using a Broad Range of Visible Light to Access Diverse Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven carbonylation of CCl4, CBr4, and CBr3F have been developed using a B12&#8722;Mg2+/TiO2 hybrid catalyst. This method enables the selective synthesis of carbonyl molecules, including ureas, carbamates, carbonate esters, and carbamoyl fluorides, under mild conditions. The reaction mechanism involves SN2 and single&#8208;electron transfer, driven by broad&#8208;range visible light. This study highlights a general platform for green and sustainable photocatalytic carbonylation reactions, extending to low&#8208;energy red&#8208;light applications.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic synthesis is a green and sustainable method for producing fine chemicals and is highly desirable at both laboratory and industrial scales. In this study, we developed a broad&#8208;range (including the red region) visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven carbonylation of CCl4, CBr4, and CBr3F with nucleophiles, such as amines and alcohols, using a B12&#8722;Mg2+/TiO2 hybrid catalyst. Carbonyl molecules such as ureas, carbamates, carbonate esters, and carbamoyl fluorides were synthesized with high selectivity and efficiency under mild conditions. Diffuse reflectance UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, femtosecond time&#8208;resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations revealed the reaction mechanism is a combination of SN2 and single&#8208;electron transfer. This is a rare example of a low&#8208;energy, red&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis, which has been a highly desired organic reaction in recent years. We believe that this study provides a general platform to access diverse carbonyl molecules and could promote photocatalytic carbonylation reactions on a pilot scale.

&lt;p&gt;A visible-light-driven carbonylation of CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and CBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F have been developed using a B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid catalyst. This method enables the selective synthesis of carbonyl molecules, including ureas, carbamates, carbonate esters, and carbamoyl fluorides, under mild conditions. The reaction mechanism involves &lt;i&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;/i&gt; and single-electron transfer, driven by broad-range visible light.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visible-light-driven organic synthesis is a green and sustainable method for producing fine chemicals and is highly desirable at both laboratory and industrial scales. In this study, we developed a broad-range (including the red region) visible-light-driven carbonylation of CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and CBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F with nucleophiles, such as amines and alcohols, using a B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid catalyst. Carbonyl molecules such as ureas, carbamates, carbonate esters, and carbamoyl fluorides were synthesized with high selectivity and efficiency under mild conditions. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy, femtosecond time-resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations revealed the reaction mechanism is a combination of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;/i&gt; and single-electron transfer. This is a rare example of a low-energy, red-light-driven photocatalysis, which has been a highly desired organic reaction in recent years.

         <title>The Effect of Hyperconjugation and Hydrogen Bonding on the Conformers of Methylated Monosaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rotational spectra of four methylated monosaccharides were recorded using a Fourier transform microwave spectrometer, employing a custom&#8208;designed nozzle cap, thus eliminating the need for an expensive laser ablation system. Ten low&#8208;energy conformers were identified experimentally, and their geometries reveal an interesting interplay between neutral hyperconjugation and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Methylation appears to exert a strong influence on structural preference.







Abstract
The conformational landscapes of four 1&#8208;O&#8208;methylated monosaccharides&#8212;methyl &#945;&#8208;glucose, methyl &#946;&#8208;glucose, methyl &#945;&#8208;galactose, and methyl &#946;&#8208;galactose&#8212;were characterized using jet&#8208;cooled broadband rotational spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory calculations. A newly designed, simple pulsed nozzle assembly was used to introduce the sugar samples into a jet expansion without thermal degradation, eliminating the need for a complex and expensive laser ablation system. Ten conformers were experimentally identified by assigning their rotational spectra, and the intricate methyl internal rotation splittings were analysed. Notably, methylation alters the directionality of intramolecular hydrogen bonding of &#945;&#8208;galactose highlighting its impact on structural preference. Natural bond orbital, intrinsic bond strength, and non&#8208;covalent interaction analyses were conducted to explore the interplay between hydrogen bonding and hyperconjugation. A set of &#963; to &#963;* neutral hyperconjugative interactions was found to override a strong hydrogen bond, driving a preference for the gauche conformers.

         <title>Buckybowl&#8208;Based Fullerene Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Buckybowls possess unique physicochemical and supramolecular assembly features associated with their concave and convex surfaces. The buckybowl&#8208;based molecular receptors show advantages in shape complementarity and electrostatic interaction for hosting fullerenes. Herein, a brief survey for the buckybowl&#8208;based fullerene receptors in the last decade is presented.







Abstract
Buckybowls, bowl&#8208;shaped polyaromatic hydrocarbons, have received intensive interest owing to their multifaceted potentials in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. Buckybowls possess unique chemical and physical properties associated with their concave and convex faces. In view of the shape complementarity, which is one of the key factors for host&#8208;guest assembly, buckybowls are ideal receptors for fullerenes. In fact, the host&#8208;guest assembly between buckybowls and fullerenes is one of the most active topics in buckybowls chemistry, and the resulting supramolecular materials show promising applications in optoelectronics, biomaterials, and so forth. In this tutorial review, we present an overview for the progress on fullerene receptors based on buckybowls over the last decade.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of atomically precise porous/holey graphene materials, including PGs, pNGs, and pGNRs, have garnered significant attention for their exceptional properties in the last few decades. This mini review explores the recent advancements in the synthesis of porous/holey graphene materials through bottom&#8208;up approach, and their potential applications in several fields.







Abstract
Incorporation of regular order pores/holes/defects into semimetalic graphene sheets can tune the band gap up to 1&#8197;eV or more introducing semiconducting property and therefore exhibiting promising applications for organic electronics such as field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), molecular sieve membranes, gas sensing, catalysis devices, etc. In this mini review, we focused on bottom&#8208;up approaches to introduce periodic homogeneous pores into graphene and nanographene and graphene nanoribbons along with their characteristics and potential applications in various fields.

         <title>Mechanochemical Radical Transformations in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state radical reactions enhance green chemistry metrics and often exhibit unique intermediates and reactivity modes. This minireview explores their role in small molecule synthesis, highlighting their increasing significance in sustainable chemistry.







Abstract
Organic synthesis has historically relied on solution&#8208;phase, polar transformations to forge new bonds. However, this paradigm is evolving, propelled by the rapid evolution of radical chemistry. Additionally, organic synthesis is witnessing a simultaneous resurgence in mechanochemistry, the formation of new bonds in the solid&#8208;state, further contributing to this shift in the status quo. The aforementioned advances in radical chemistry have predominantly occurred in the solution phase, while the majority of mechanochemical synthesis advances feature polar transformations. Herein, we discuss a rapidly advancing area of organic synthesis: mechanochemical radical reactions. Solid&#8208;state radical reactions offer improved green chemistry metrics, better reaction outcomes, and access to intermediates and products that are difficult or impossible to reach in solution. This review explores these reactions in the context of small molecule synthesis, from early findings to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, underscoring the pivotal role solid&#8208;state radical reactions are likely to play in advancing sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>The Roles of Molecular Concavities in the Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Giant Tetrahedra for CO2 Uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant tetrahedral molecules possess both trigonal and tetragonal concavities. Analysis of the close&#8208;packed structures of tetrahedral molecules indicates that occupation of the trigonal concavity of the tetrahedral molecules generates 1D supramolecular columns, while the tetragonal concavities become occupied during the formation of neighboring supramolecular columns.







Abstract
Giant tetrahedral molecules have sparked significant interest in the past decade due to their unique and diverse supramolecular nanostructures. The longer and bulkier peripheral substituents create deep molecular concavities and thus contribute to the different self&#8208;assembly behaviors compared to the conventional small tetrahedral molecules. In this study, a molecular giant tetrahedra, TetraNDI, was synthesized to investigate the important roles of the molecular concavities in the self&#8208;assembly mechanism. Single&#8208;crystal structural characterizations indicate that the TetraNDI takes its trigonal concavities to form 1D supramolecular columns, and its tetragonal concavities to reach close inter&#8208;columnar packing. The difficulty in occupying the concavities leads to the path&#8208;dependent phase behaviors of the giant tetrahedra. It is also found that the remaining molecular concavities in the supramolecular scaffolds affect the CO2 affinity of TetraNDI. With an understanding of the packing principles of molecular giant tetrahedra, the structure&#8208;property relationships could be better evaluated in the future and might broaden the horizon of porous materials.

Electrodes based on or modified with carbon dots (CDs) in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have shown significant improvements in key performance metrics. This review summarizes recent developments, challenges, and opportunities in leveraging CDs as additives in SIBs, focusing on their impact on electrolyte properties, electrode materials, and overall battery performance and several sound perspectives are also rationally proposed for fundamental research and practical development as guidelines.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs), known for their quantum size, abundant surface functional groups, excellent biocompatibility, and non&#8208;toxicity, have emerged as promising candidates for enhancing various advanced rechargeable batteries. Recent research indicates that electrodes based on or modified with CDs in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have shown significant improvements in key performance metrics such as Coulombic efficiency, cycle life, and capacity compared to traditional electrodes. Several key impacts of CDs contribute to these enhancements, including increased conductivity due to their conductive graphitized core, rich absorption sites, and excellent dispersity facilitated by abundant surface functional groups. These features accelerate ion transport through interface edges and ion diffusion paths, inhibit electrode material dissolution, buffer electrode material volume expansion, ensure electrode uniformity and stability, and promote the electrochemical reaction process between the electrode and electrolyte. This review summarizes recent developments, challenges, and opportunities in leveraging CDs as additives in SIBs, focusing on their impact on electrolyte properties, electrode materials, and overall battery performance. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the potential of CDs to significantly advance SIB technology.

         <title>N&#8208;P Type Charge Compensatory Synergistic Effect for Schottky and Efficient Photoelectrocatalysis Applications: Doping Mechanism in (Nb/Re)@WS2/Graphene Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proposed N&#8722;P type valence electron compensation mechanism to eliminate impurity levels introduced by heteroatoms doping. Synergistic enhancement of photogenerated carrier separation efficiency and migration ability through the combination of isoelectronic doping and heterojunction. Provided a new idea for the design and development of Schottky devices and efficient photoelectrocatalysis based on 2D TMDs.







Abstract
Band gap engineering based on doped two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has shown great potential in the design and development of new nano photoelectronic devices and their application in photoelectrocatalysis. However, there are two key issues that are difficult to take into account, namely the impurity levels induced by dopant atoms appear in the forbidden band of the doping system, which can become the recombination center of photogenerated carriers, thereby reducing the photocatalytic efficiency. Compared with the carrier mobility of the corresponding doped systems, that of intrinsic 2D TMDs is too low. Understanding the doping mechanism of heteroatoms in these systems and designing corresponding crystal structures rationally is important for solving these problems. In this study, the crystal structures of co&#8208;doped monolayer WS2 with Nb and Re atoms were designed using density functional theory, and doping systems with graphene (high carrier mobility) were assembled into a heterostructure using the concept of heterorecombination. The N&#8208;P type co&#8208;doping of Nb and Re atoms retained the continuous band characteristics of the original monolayer WS2 while also providing the high carrier mobility of graphene, yielding an excellent multipurpose material for manufacturing high&#8208;speed Schottky devices and efficient water&#8208;splitting H evolution catalysts.

         <dc:description>Oxo&#8208;graphene nanoribbons (oxo&#8208;GNRs) can be prepared by the oxidative unzipping of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes. We present an orthogonal functionalization method for the functionalization of the rims and the &#960;&#8208;surface, respectively, what is only possible due to the high rim portion in oxo&#8208;GNRs. Thus, in particular X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy could be used to trace reaction to detect marker atoms included in addends. We propose that the reported orthogonal functionalization strategy can also be applied on other oxo&#8208;functionalized carbon materials, such as carbon dots, or reduced graphene oxide flakes.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Bulk Synthesis of Phase&#8208;Pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 as a Model for an Argon&#8208;Flow&#8208;Mediated Metathesis Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrides represent a promising class of materials for a variety of applications. However, bulk synthesis remains a challenging task due to the stability of the N2 molecule. In this study, we introduce a simple and scalable approach for synthesizing nitride bulk materials. Moderate reaction temperatures are achieved by using reactive starting materials, slow and continuous mixing of the starting materials, and by dissipating heat generated during the reaction. The impact on the synthesis of using different starting materials as nitrogen source and the influence of a flux were examined. &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 was selected as the model compound. The synthesis of pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 bulk material on a large scale has still been a challenge, although a few synthesis methods were already described in the literature. Here we synthesized &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 by metathesis reaction of argon&#8208;diluted SnCl4 with Li3N, Mg3N2 or Ca3N2 as nitrogen sources. Products were characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, dynamic flash combustion analysis, hot gas extraction analysis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption and emission spectroscopy. Additionally, single&#8208;crystal diffraction data of &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4, previously unavailable, were successfully collected.</dc:description>

         <title>CoFe Hydroxide Nanopheres for Enhanced Alkaline Splitting and Seawater Oxidation:Anion Doping Effects of Fluorine and Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green hydrogen production can be achieved through electrolysis of fresh water or the use of renewable energy to electrolyze seawater. However, due to the low activity and poor stability of oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, direct electrolysis of alkaline seawater faces significant challenges. Herein, The catalyst F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF with three&#8208;dimensional nanosphere structure was prepared, The introduction of CO32&#8208; into the intermediate layer of&#160;CoFe Hydroxide&#160;improves the corrosion resistance of alkaline electrolyte and the doping of F&#8208; is to design three&#8208;dimensional layered nanostructures, increase the active site, and accelerate the diffusion of the electrolyte. By in situ Raman analysis, partial oxidation of CoFe hydroxide to CoFe (oxy)hydroxide as the active center can accelerating the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;related intermediates. In 1M KOH, it requires overpotentials of 210 mV and 251mV to drive current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Green hydrogen production can be achieved through electrolysis of fresh water or the use of renewable energy to electrolyze seawater. However, due to the low activity and poor stability of oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, direct electrolysis of alkaline seawater faces significant challenges. Herein, The catalyst F-CoFe(OH)-CO3/NF with three-dimensional nanosphere structure was prepared, The introduction of CO32- into the intermediate layer of&#160;CoFe Hydroxide&#160;improves the corrosion resistance of alkaline electrolyte and the doping of F- is to design three-dimensional layered nanostructures, increase the active site, and accelerate the diffusion of the electrolyte. By in situ Raman analysis, partial oxidation of CoFe hydroxide to CoFe (oxy)hydroxide as the active center can accelerating the adsorption of oxygen-related intermediates. In 1M KOH, it requires overpotentials of 210 mV and 251mV to drive current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively. And it remained stable at the current density of 100 mA cm-2 for 120 h in 1M KOH. &#160;F-CoFe(OH)-CO3/NF can also catalyzes the decomposition of electrolytic seawater. Compared with hydroxide, anion-doped carbonate hydroxide is more efficient and stable in electrolyte solution, which is of great importance for the development of a new stable electrocatalyst for water decomposition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards Designer Photocatalysts: Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in 2,6&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;pyryliums</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fully organic photocatalyst systems are highly attractive, not merely because they are transition&#8208;metal free, but more importantly due to their unique and often potent reactivity. A detailed understanding of the various redox states, both ground and excited state, and specifically what structural parameters control them is therefore crucial for harnessing the full potential of these systems in organic synthesis. However, unlike their organometallic counterparts, detailed structure&#8208;property relationships for organic photocatalysts are largely absent from the literature. In this study, we demonstrate linear free&#8208;energy relationships across a range of key photophysical and electrochemical properties of 2,6&#8208;diarylpyryliums. Electronic absorption and emission maxima can be carefully tuned over the ranges of 83 nm and 102 nm respectively. Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions were revealed in cases of substitution with polarizable heavy&#8208;atoms. A strong linear dependence of ground state reduction potentials on substituent electronics was observed. Notably, the excited state reduction potential, E*red, could be controlled over a range of nearly 1000 mV. Systematic errors in computational modeling of ground and excited state redox potentials were identified and corrected. We believe the quantitative structure&#8208;property relationships identified here provide foundational tools for rational and predictive organic photocatalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphological Evolution of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks into Hedrite, Sheaf and Spherulite Superstructures with Localized Different Coloration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The branched metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are the first superstructures of this kind, and the growth mechanism may explain crystal shapes of other materials. The mechanism of the formation of fascinating structures having a hedrite, sheaf or spherulite appearance are detailed. The branching can be controlled, resulting in crystals that either exhibit multiple generations of branching or a single generation. These structures might result from an increasing number of defects on fast&#8208;grown rods. As the basal facets become less reactive, material is added to the prism facets, leading to secondary nucleation and triangular branches. These triangular structures are connected to the rod surface, growing longer than the central rod. Electron diffraction analyses show that the sheafs are polycrystalline structures with their fantails consisting of single&#8208;crystalline nanorods deviating gradually from each&#8208;other in their orientation. The crystallographic structure formed from achiral components consists of helical channels with opposite handedness. The accessibility of the nanochannels and the porosity of the superstructures are demonstrated by chromophore diffusion into the channels. The confinement and alignment of the chromophores inside the channels resulted in polarized&#8208;light dependent coloration of the crystals; the polycrystallinity generated areas having different optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Synthesis of 3D Aligned VO2 and V2O5 Carbon Nanotube Hybrid Materials by Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>

Gas phase synthesis of vanadium oxides VO2 and V2O5 on vertically aligned 3D arrays of carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) is reported. A systematic investigation of temperature, precursor and reactor constraints towards the controlled synthesis of these composites is presented. Different text spacing!!







Abstract
3D carbon nanotube hybrid materials containing VO2 and V2O5 evenly distributed onto vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) is reported. Adjustable loading of particles in controllable sizes and shapes onto the VACNTs was developed via a stepwise chemical vapour deposition (CVD) approach. Solid VO(acac)2 is chosen as vanadium source. CO2 acts as reactive gas for the pre&#8208;functionalisation of the VACNTs. The process temperature was identified as key parameter to control the deposited vanadium oxide phase. A temperature of 550&#8201;&#176;C results in monoclinic VO2, while 600&#8201;&#176;C results in the deposition of V2O5 onto the VACNT support. The morphology and the amount of deposited material was found to be dependent on the reactor dimensions and the degree of functionalisation of the carbon support. An increase of the D/G ratio of the VACNT from 0.75 to 1.08 caused by a CO2 treatment step within the process led to an increase of the particle coverage from a scarce coverage without prior CO2 treatment to a dense coverage of the VACNT support after 15&#8197;min of CO2 exposure time. Size and crystallinity of the as deposited particles can be further adjusted by a controlled heat treatment after VO(acac)2 precursor deposition.

         <title>Isonitrile Photochemistry: A Functional Group Class Coming in from the Cold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isonitriles, often neglected for their unpleasant smell, have fascinated many generations of chemists thanks to unique reactivity modes. The present concept article, by retracing the seeds of isonitrile photochemistry, points out the hidden opportunities offered by visible light photo(redox) catalysis to promote key advancements in the field.







Abstract
Starting from a historical background that acknowledges isonitriles as a neglected class of compounds due to their unpleasant smell and hardly controlled reaction conditions with open shell species, the present concept article aims at highlighting the seeds of the modern isonitrile photochemistry. Representative essential transformations achieved via either UV light irradiation or radical initiators at high temperatures are brought into play to draw a parallel with the current literature relying on the exploitation of visible light photochemical methods. Such a comparison points out the potential of this enabling technology to further expand the scope of isonitrile chemistry and the unmet challenges which makes it a very stimulating field.

         <title>High Yield of L&#8208;Sorbose via D&#8208;Glucose Isomerization in Ethanol over a Bifunctional Titanium&#8208;Boron&#8208;Beta Zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional Ti&#8208;B&#8208;Beta zeolite is demonstrated to be an efficient catalyst for sorbose production via glucose isomerization. Ethanol directs the conformation of glucose, facilitating its selective isomerization to sorbose and enables this isomerization to surpass the thermodynamic equilibrium limit by engaging in reactions with the resultant sorbose.







Abstract
D&#8208;Glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization on Lewis acidic zeolite is a highly attractive avenue for sorbose production. But the L&#8208;sorbose yield is limited by the competing D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;D&#8208;fructose isomerization and reaction equilibrium. In this work, it is suggested that ethanol directs the glucose conformation for selective D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization. It also reacts with the produced L&#8208;sorbose to form ethyl&#8208;sorboside, which allows the D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization to proceed beyond the thermodynamic equilibrium limit. It is shown that a bifunctional zeolite Beta containing framework titanium (Ti) and boron (B) is a selective catalyst for this tandem reaction: Lewis acidic framework Ti catalyzes the D&#8208;glucose&#8208;to&#8208;L&#8208;sorbose isomerization via an intramolecular 5,1&#8208;hydride shift process as confirmed by isotopic tracing experiments followed by 13C&#8208;NMR, while weak Br&#248;nsted acid framework B selectively promotes the sorbose ketalization with ethanol. A remarkably high yield of L&#8208;sorbose with a high fraction of sugar (&gt;95&#8201;%: 27&#8201;% unreacted glucose, 11.4&#8201;% fructose, 57&#8201;% sorbose) was obtained after the mixture produced in ethanol was hydrolyzed.

It is shown that a bifunctional zeolite Beta containing framework titanium (Ti) and boron (B) is a selective catalyst for this tandem reaction: Lewis acidic framework Ti catalyzes the D-glucose-to-L-sorbose isomerization via an intramolecular 5,1-hydride shift process as confirmed by isotopic tracing experiments followed by &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR, while weak Br&#248;nsted acid framework B selectively promotes the sorbose ketalization with ethanol. A remarkably high yield of L-sorbose with a high fraction of sugar (&amp;gt;95&#8201;%: 27&#8201;% unreacted glucose, 11.4&#8201;% fructose, 57&#8201;% sorbose) was obtained after the mixture produced in ethanol was hydrolyzed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Attached (NHC)Gold(I) and (NHC)Copper(I) Complexes as Photoswitchable Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;functionalized photoswitchable N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes, (IAz&#8208;OMe)AuCl and (IAz&#8208;OMe)CuCl, are synthesized and characterized. The extent of trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis isomerization and concomitant formation of geometrical isomers are investigated. The percentage buried volumes of the cis&#8208;cis catalysts are found to be higher than the trans&#8208;trans isomers. Light&#8208;induced alteration and toggling of reaction rates in oxazoline formation and CuAAC reactions are studied.







Abstract
Photoswitchable (pre)catalysts, N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;based (NHC)gold(I) and N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;derived (NHC)copper(I) complexes are reported. Trans to cis isomerization of the attached photoswitchable moieties in the Au(I) complex enables four&#8208;fold decrement in the rate of oxazoline formation reaction. Whereas the progress of the copper(I) catalyzed, azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition reaction gets reduced by at least threefold. Alternate exposure to UV and blue light could easily toggle the rate of reactions remotely. The catalytic activity of thermodynamically stable trans&#8208;trans isomers is found to be similar to the common N&#8208;aryl substituted NHC&#8722;Au/Cu(I) complexes. NHC&#8722;Au(I) and &#8722;Cu(I) compounds bearing (trans)azobenzene moieties were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Photoswitching, recyclability studies, and the metastable isomer's thermal half&#8208;life in both complexes were studied via UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Whereas the extent of photoswitching and concomitant formation of geometrical isomers were investigated by using 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopic study. Calculated percentage buried volumes of the three geometrical isomers show the trend trans&#8208;trans&lt;trans&#8208;cis&lt;cis&#8208;cis.

         <title>Dirhodium(II)/XantPhos Catalyzed Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(E)&#8208;Vinylsilanes via Hydrosilylation and Isomerization from Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dirhodium (II) complexes play important roles in organic synthesis based on their unique lantern&#8208;type bimetallic structure. Herein, we report a simple and efficient Rh2(OAc)4/XantPhos catalyzed a stereoselective hydrosilylation of alkynes. Mechanistic studies indicated that the formation of (Z)&#8208;selective hydrosilylation of alkyne proceeded via zwitterionic carbene species while (E)&#8208;selectivity was generated by the isomerization catalyzed by rhodium hydride species.







Abstract
A concise hydrosilylation of alkynes for synthesizing &#946;&#8208;(E)&#8208;vinylsilanes catalyzed by dirhodium(II)/XantPhos has been developed. In this reaction, &#946;&#8208;(E)&#8208;vinylsilanes were generated from the isomerization of &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;vinylsilanes catalyzed by dirhodium(II) hydride species rather than the direct insertion of triple bond into M&#8722;H or M&#8722;Si bond (traditional Chalk&#8208;Harrod mechanism or modified Chalk&#8208;Harrod mechanism). The hydrosilylation displayed a broad substrate scope for alkynes and tertiary silanes, tolerating diverse functional groups including halides, nitriles, amines, esters, and heterocycles.

         <title>Rational Design of Mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 Heterojunctions for Environmental Remediation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) comprising g&#8208;C3N4@ZnFe2O4, featuring tiny mesopores and effective heterojunctions, demonstrate superior catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution and dye degradation under solar illumination, with recyclability and easy separation using magnets.







Abstract
Mesoporous catalysts with a high specific surface area, accessible pore structures, and appropriate band edges are desirable for optimal charge transfer across the interfaces, suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, and promote redox reactions at the active sites. The present study demonstrates the rational design of mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) with different pore sizes and pore volumes following a combination of facile thermal itching and thermal impregnation methods. The MNCs preserve the structural, morphological, and physical attributes of their counterparts while ensuring their effectiveness and superior catalytic capabilities. The morphological analysis confirms the successful grafting and confinement of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles with the polymeric g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets to form heterojunctions with numerous interfaces. The MNCs possess uniformly distributed small mesopores (pore size &lt;4&#8197;nm), ample active sites, and a high specific surface area of 62.50&#8197;m2/g. The mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4 notably improve hydrogen evolution rate and methylene blue dye degradation. The optimal loading weight of ZnFe2O4 is 20&#8201;%, in which the MNCs display the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 1752&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and photo&#8208;Fenton dye degradation rate constants of 0.147&#8197;min&#8722;1, upon solar&#8208;light illumination. Furthermore, the photocatalysts demonstrate recyclability over five consecutive cycles, confirming their stability, while easy separation using a simple magnet underscores practical utility.

         <title>Counterion Exchange Enhances the Brightness and Photostability of a Fluorous Cyanine Dye</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
While useful tools for studying perfluorocarbons, fluorous soluble fluorophores (fluorofluorophores) are often less bright and prone to rapid photobleaching in the fluorous phase. Here, we utilized a counterion modification on a fluorous pentatmethine dye (FCy5) to promote favorable cyanine character, resulting in a brighter and more photostable fluorofluorophore.







Abstract
Fluorofluorophores are a unique class of fluorophores that can be solubilized in perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and used to study biological systems. However, because of the low dielectric constant and high oxygen solubility in the fluorous phase, the brightness and photostability of the fluorofluorophores are significantly diminished. Here, we leveraged the tight ion pairing in the fluorous phase to improve the photophysical properties of a fluorous soluble pentamethine dye (FCy5) via counterion exchange. We found that larger, softer, fluorinated, aryl borate counterions promote the ideal polymethine state where charge delocalization across the polymethine chain increases the brightness (6&#8208;fold) and photostability (55&#8208;fold) of FCy5.

         <title>IPr*F &#8211; Highly Hindered, Fluorinated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of sterically&#8208;hindered, fluorinated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes that are characterized by unique steric and electronic properties. An efficient, one&#8208;pot synthesis of IPr*F ligands is presented, enabling broad access of academic and industrial researchers to the fluorinated ligands. We anticipate that this novel class of NHC ligands will find widespread application in stabilizing reactive metal centers in the fields of organic and inorganic chemistry.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine atom has attracted considerable interest in molecular design owing to the high electronegativity and the resulting polarization of carbon&#8211;fluorine bonds. Simultaneously, sterically&#8208;hindered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have received major interest due to high stabilization of the reactive metal centers, which has paved the way for the synthesis of stable and reactive organometallic compounds with broad applications in main group chemistry, inorganic synthesis and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysis. Herein, we report the first class of sterically&#8208;hindered, fluorinated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. These ligands feature variable fluorine substitution at the N&#8208;aromatic wingtip, permitting to rationally vary steric and electronic characteristics of the carbene center imparted by the fluorine atom. An efficient, one&#8208;pot synthesis of fluorinated IPr*F ligands is presented, enabling broad access of academic and industrial researchers to the fluorinated ligands. The evaluation of steric, electron&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties as well as coordination chemistry to Au(I), Rh(I) and Se is presented. Considering the unique properties of carbon&#8211;fluorine bonds, we anticipate that this novel class of fluorinated carbene ligands will find widespread application in stabilizing reactive metal centers.

         <title>Chirality at Metal in a Linear [Ag(NHC)2]+ Complex: Stereogenic C&#8722;Ag&#8722;C Axis, Atropisomerism and Role of &#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>

A novel class of linear chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complexes with atropisomerism by restricted rotation around a stereogenic C&#8722;Ag&#8722;C axis, all thanks to &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions!







Abstract
Chirality at the metal center is a well&#8208;established concept, exemplified by numerous four&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinated complexes. Here, a pioneering example of linear chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is described: [Ag(NHC)2]+ (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). In solution, stabilizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions preserve the chiral information of the solid state. Consequently, a novel class of atropisomers is identified, whose stereogenicity arises from hindered rotation around a C&#8722;Ag&#8722;C axis, instead of a typical C&#8722;C bond.

         <title>Formation and Stability of Benzylic Amide [2]&#8208; and [3]Rotaxanes: An Intercomponent Interactions Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the synthesis and characterization of amide&#8208;benzylic [2]&#8208; and [3]rotaxanes that include a conventional succinamide station and an innovative triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. The macrocycle preference for one station was evidenced by NMR and SC&#8208;XRD analyses. The slight modifications in the thread structure impacted the stability and intercomponent interactions, guiding the selective formation of [2]&#8208; or [3]rotaxanes.







Abstract
One of the most recent focuses in supramolecular chemistry is developing molecules designed to exhibit programmable properties at the molecular level. Rotaxanes, which function as molecular machines with movements controlled by external stimuli, are prime candidates for this purpose. However, the controlled synthesis of rotaxanes, especially amide&#8208;benzylic rotaxanes with more than two components, remains an area ripe for exploration. In this study, we aim to elucidate the formation of amide&#8208;benzylic [3]rotaxanes using a thread that includes a conventional succinamide station and an innovative triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. Including the triazole&#8208;carbonyl station introduces new perspectives into the chemistry of rotaxanes, influencing their conformation and dynamics. The synthesis of two&#8208;station rotaxanes with varying stoppers demonstrated that the macrocycle consistently occupies the succinamide station, providing greater stability as evidenced by NMR and SC&#8208;XRD analyses. The presence of a triazole&#8208;carbonyl station facilitated the formation of a second macrocycle exclusively when a secondary amide was employed as the stopper group, presumably due to decreased steric hindrance. Moreover, the second macrocycle directly forms at the triazole&#8208;carbonyl station. This investigation reveals that slight modifications in the thread structure can dramatically impact the formation, stability, and interactions between components of rotaxanes.

         <title>Transient Photoactivation of Anionophores by Using Redshifted Fast&#8208;Relaxing Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing redshifted azobenzene&#8208;based anionophores in which the more active isomer is thermally unstable, pulsed ion transport activity could be achieved by using amber/red light to generate the active ionophore, and exploiting thermal relaxation to relax back to a deactivated state over time.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;regulated transmembrane ionophores enable spatial and temporal control over activity, offering promise as targeted therapeutics. Key to such applications is control using bio&#8208;compatible visible light. Herein, we report red&#8208;shifted azobenzene&#8208;derived synthetic anionophores that use amber or red light to trigger (E)&#8208;(Z) photoisomerisation and activation of transmembrane chloride transport. We demonstrate that by tuning the thermal half&#8208;life of the more active, but thermodynamically unstable, Z isomer to relax on the timescale of minutes, transient activation of ion transport can be achieved by activating solely with visible light and deactivating by thermal relaxation.

Fluorine considered as magic element strongly affects the chemical, physical and biological properties of molecules. Simultaneously, sterically hindered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have received major interest due to the high stabilization of the reactive metal centers. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402847), G. Utecht&#8208;Jarzy&#324;ska, M. Szostak and co&#8208;workers report a new class of fluorinated, sterically hindered NHCs characterized by unique steric and electronic properties. An efficient, one&#8208;pot synthesis of IPr*F ligands is presented, enabling broad access to fluorinated ligands for academic and industrial researchers.

         <dc:description>
Despite being an important class of compounds with broad applications in organic synthesis, isonitriles have often been neglected due to concerns about their unpleasant odor, stability, and toxicity. Recently, the potential to exploit their stereoelectronic properties in light&#8208;triggered synthetic methods leading to unique reactivity patterns has sparked renewed interest, allowing them to come in from the cold. More information can be found in the Concept by M. Giustiniano (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402350). Artwork created by Gennaro Maddaloni.

The stability and formation of [2]&#8208; or [3]rotaxanes are influenced by minor alterations in the thread structure. The Cover Feature depicts scientists observing the molecular structures, symbolizing the exploration of intercomponent interactions in rotaxane molecules. It has been found that introducing a second macrocycle slightly reduced the stabilization energy between the thread and the first macrocycle but significantly enhanced the overall stabilization energy of the [3]rotaxane. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Orlando and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403276).

Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), owing the merits of ordered and tailored channel structures in the burgeoning crystalline porous materials, have demonstrated significant promise in construction of high&#8208;performance separation membranes.

Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), owing the merits of ordered and tailored channel structures in the burgeoning crystalline porous materials, have demonstrated significant promise in construction of high&#8208;performance separation membranes. However, precisely because this crystal structure with strong molecular interaction in their lattice provides robust structural integrity and resistance to chemical and thermal degradation, crystalline MOFs typically exhibit insolubility, infusibility, stiffness and brittleness, and therefore their membrane&#8208;processing properties are far inferior to the flexible amorphous polymers and hinder their subsequent storage, transportation, and utilization. Hence, focusing on film&#8208;formation and crystallization is the foundation for exploring the fabrication and application of MOF membranes. In this review, the film&#8208;forming properties of crystalline MOFs are fundamentally analyzed from their inherent characteristics and compared with those of amorphous polymers, influencing factors of polycrystalline MOF membrane formation are summarized, the trade&#8208;off relationship between crystallization and membrane formation is discussed, and the strategy solving the film formation of crystalline MOFs in recent years are systematically reviewed, in anticipation of realizing the goal of preparing crystalline membranes with optimized processability and excellent performance.

         <title>Deciphering the Cell Surface Sugar&#8208;Coating via Biochemical Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 64, November 15, 2024. </description>

Glycans have a significant role in cellular architecture, establishing cell communication and as disease biomarkers. In this work, glycan recognition is discussed using different methods, such as metabolic glycan labelling, boronic acid probes, etc. Selective recognition of glycans would open a future direction in glycan&#8208;specific target therapeutics and would be interesting for a broader readership in chemistry, biology and medicine.







Abstract
Cell surface components, specifically glycans, play a significant role in several biological functions like cell structure, crosstalk between cells, and eventual target recognition of the cells for therapeutics. The dense layer of glycans, i.&#8201;e., glycocalyx, could differ in taxon, species, and cell type. Glycans are coupled with lipids and proteins to form glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol&#8208;anchored proteins, making their study challenging. However, understanding glycosylation at the cellular level is vital for fundamental research and advancing glycan&#8208;targeted therapy. Among different pathways, metabolic glycan labelling uses the natural metabolic processes of the cell to introduce abiotic functionality into glycan residues. The Bertozzi group pioneered metabolic oligosaccharide engineering using glycan salvage pathways to convert monosaccharides with unnatural modifications. This eventually results in the probe becoming part of the complex cellular glycan structures via click chemistry using copper. On the other hand, the boronic acid&#8208;based probe can recognise carbohydrates in a single step without any chemical modification of the surface. This review discusses the significance of glycans as biomarkers for different diseases and the necessity to evaluate them in&#8197;situ within the physiological environment. The review also discusses the prospect of this field and its potential applications.

         <title>Chain&#8208;Like Pentanuclear Complexes: Syntheses, Crystal Structures and Long&#8208;Range Electronic Interactions of Cyanido&#8208;Bridged M2Ru3 (M=Fe, Ru)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For both the pentanuclear complexes with the skeleton of [M&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC&#8722;M] (M=Fe, 1; M=Ru, 2) reported in this work, a very strong electronic coupling exists between the two side Ru across the central NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN. Moreover, 1 exhibits no electronic coupling between the two terminal Fe. Upon substitution of Fe by Ru, however, 2 exhibits a long&#8208;range (20&#8197;&#197;) electronic coupling between the two terminal metal ions across the linear trinuclear cyanidometal CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC bridge.







Abstract
In this work, we report the design and synthesis of two chain&#8208;like pentanuclear cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes trans&#8208;[Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;CN)2][cis&#8208;Ru(bpy)2(&#956;&#8208;NC)M(dppe)Cp*]2[PF6]4 (M=Fe, 14+; M=Ru, 24+) and the electronic communication properties of their oxidized products 1m+ (m=6, 7, 8) and 2n+ (n=5, 6, 7, 8). The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of 1m+ (m=4, 6, 7) and 24+ show that 14+ and 24+ possess a Z&#8208;type array structure, 17+ is a U&#8208;type one, and 16+ exhibits both the types. The investigations indicate that both 1 and 2 show an extraordinarily strong electronic interaction between the two side Ru across the central NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN, leading to the formation of a fully delocalized cyanidometal Ru&#8722;Ru&#8722;Ru bridge for both three&#8208;electron oxidized states 17+ and 27+. Moreover, it should be noted that in 1 there exists no electronic interaction between the two terminal Fe ions. Upon substitution of Fe by Ru, however, 2 exhibits an electronic interaction between the two terminal metal ions across the trinuclear cyanidometal CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC&#8722;Ru&#8722;CN&#8722;Ru&#8722;NC bridge which is up to 20&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells with Efficient Charge Mobility and Separation Capabilities Studied by DFT</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of heterojunction organic solar cells were designed using bacteriochlorin as a donor. They exhibit efficient charge mobility and separation rates, which provide theoretical guidance for constructing new low&#8208;cost and highly efficient BHJ organic solar cells.







Abstract
The properties of the active layer materials play a decisive role in determining the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Chlorophyll and its derivatives are abundant and environmentally friendly functional organic molecular materials. Using density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT), we have calculated the absorption spectra and their excited state properties based on optimized ground state structures. It was found that bacteriochlorin exhibits superior structural properties, a smaller energy gap and hole reorganization energy, redshifted absorption spectra, and higher hole mobility compared to the donor D18. This suggests that bacteriochlorin exhibits superior donor properties. Comparative studies between o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and m&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl showed that o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl had superior acceptor properties, implying that differences in substitution positions can influence the physicochemical properties of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Subsequently, six bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) were constructed by combining three donors with nonfused ring electron acceptors, o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and m&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl. The bacteriochlorin&#8208;based BHJs performed well among them, with BChl3/o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl and BChl4/o&#8208;AT&#8208;2Cl having the largest interfacial charge separation rate. The results suggested that BHJs composed of bacteriochlorin and NFAs can improve OSCs&#8217; photovoltaic performance, providing a feasible scheme for designing efficient OSCs.

         <title>Designing Artificial Laccase Catalysts by Introducing Substrate Oxidation Metals into Oxygen&#8208;Reducing Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Cu&#8208;Doped ZIF&#8208;67</title>

This study presents the development of copper&#8208;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67) as an artificial laccase catalyst. Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits enhanced catalytic performance and thermal stability compared to natural laccase, providing an efficient and reusable solution for industrial applications. The dual&#8208;site mechanism, where copper facilitates phenol oxidation and cobalt&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 supports oxygen reduction, is thoroughly explored.







Abstract
Laccase, a multi&#8208;copper oxidase, is limited by its optimal temperature range and isolation costs. To overcome these challenges, we synthesized copper&#8208;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67) with 16&#8197;mol&#8201;% Cu as an artificial laccase catalyst. The introduced Cu site acts as the phenol oxidation site, and Co&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 is the four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction site. Laccase also employs this division of oxidation and reduction sites. Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 demonstrated significant catalytic activity, superior to natural laccase, especially at elevated temperatures, and maintained stability across multiple reaction cycles. These findings suggest that Cu&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;67 is a robust, reusable alternative for industrial applications requiring high thermal stability and efficient catalysis.

         <title>Skeletal Isomerization of Ergosterol&#8208;5,8&#8208;Peroxide Leading to the Discovery of Unprecedented Ergostanes and Collective Syntheses of 5,6&#8208;Epoxysterols and (+)&#8208;Sarocladione</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative metabolic pathways of ergosterol via a 5,8&#8208;peroxy intermediate were explored through chemical synthesis. This research not only facilitated access to rare sterols found in mushrooms but also led to the discovery of an unusual tricyclic ergostane and elucidation of a biosynthetic pathway for a structurally complex natural product. Additionally, some of the sterols were found to inhibit the aggregation and deposition of amyloid &#946;.







Abstract
Skeletal isomerization of ergosterol peroxide, a primary oxidation product of ergosterol, was investigated under thermal and iron(II)&#8208;mediated conditions. Thermal isomerization resulted in not only the isolation of the predicted 7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5,6&#8208;epoxides but also the discovery of the unprecedented 7/9/5&#8208;ring&#8208;fused ergostane for the first time. The iron(II)&#8208;mediated isomerization proceeded at ambient temperature, resulting in the formation of the expected 5,6&#8208;epoxysterols and a ring&#8208;opened bicyclic diketone. The diketone was further converted into novel ergostane under thermal conditions and into (+)&#8208;sarocladione under acidic conditions. All transformations from ergosterol to sarocladione, including the isolation of the unstable diketone intermediate, were achieved at ambient temperature, confirming the biosynthetic pathway of sarocladione. Several mushroom ingredients with a 5,6&#8208;epoxy group were synthesized stereoselectively from the isomerization products, leading to the confirmation or revision of the structures of natural products. The &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation inhibitory activity of synthetic sterols was evaluated for the first time to gain insights into the potential for dementia prevention. This study is valuable both for supplying rare sterols found in mushrooms for biological studies and for shedding light on the oxidative metabolic pathways of ergosterol.

         <title>Spin Crossover and Its Application in Organometallic Catalysis: Concepts and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article discusses the influence of spin crossover in open&#8208;shell metal catalytic reactions. It introduces the development of key concepts such as &#8220;two&#8208;state reactivity&#8221; and their impact on the field, proposing the concept of &#8220;spin&#8208;responsive catalysis&#8221; to encompass the effects of spin states, drawing on recent studies to highlight the role of spin crossover in reaction dynamics, pathways, and selectivity.







Abstract
Spin crossover is one of the most important properties of open&#8208;shell metal complexes. In organometallic catalytic reactions, catalysts can alter reaction kinetics by spin crossover, i.&#8201;e., accelerating or hindering the reaction progression, as well as altering reaction pathways, modulating the reaction selectivity or promoting new reactions. This personal account outlines the introduction and development of important concepts such as &#8220;two&#8208;state reactivity&#8221; involving spin crossover, and proposes a new concept, &#8220;spin&#8208;responsive catalysis&#8221; to summarize the catalytic processes in which spin effects are present. Finally, the electronic mechanism of spin crossover accelerating the reaction and the role of spin crossover in changing the reaction path and regulating the reaction selectivity are introduced by taking two recent typical iron&#8208;catalyzed reactions recently reported by our group as examples.

Images adapted with permission from references 16 and 19, copyright John Wiley and Sons and American Chemical Society. Glassy organic dots (g&#8208;Odots) are an emerging class of bright, photostable nanoparticles owing to their rigid interior matrix. They have tunable photophysical properties, as nearly any hydrophobic dye can be used in their preparation. Pictured here is a cartoon representation of a g&#8208;Odot as well as a photo of orange&#8208;emissive g&#8208;Odots in water. A scanning electron microscopy image of a sample of g&#8208;Odots is also shown (scale bar=300&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Glassy organic dots (g&#8208;Odots) are an emerging class of luminescent nanoparticles that offer enhanced photostability, superior brightness, and modular tunability compared to other commonly employed nanoparticles. In the last several years, they have been used as bioimaging probes for single&#8208; and multi&#8208;photon cellular imaging, exhibiting low cytotoxicity even after several days. While they are emerging as promising materials for use in biological applications, g&#8208;Odots face several key challenges before their use can become widespread. In this concept, we outline the state of the literature on g&#8208;Odots and highlight a few ways in which their design and use can be improved upon.

         <title>Free Alcohol&#8208;Mediated Radical Alkynylation and Allylation of Unactivated C(sp3)&#8208;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The daunting challenges in converting alcoholic O&#8208;H bonds with high bond&#8208;dissociation energy (BDE) to alkoxy radicals and harnessing those unruly reaction species largely limit exploiting free alcohols in C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization. Herein we describe a novel radical alkynylation and allylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds with unmodified aliphatic alcohols. The use of phenyliodine bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA) enables the formation of alkoxy radicals under mild photochemical conditions. &#945;&#8208;Methyl styrene serves as a sacrificial&#8208;reagent that significantly improves the reaction outcomes. This transition&#8208;metal free protocol further features broad substrate scope, exclusive site&#8208;selectivity, high product diversity, and simple operation, supplying a robust manifold for C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization using easily available aliphatic alcohols as feedstock.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Coating through Melanisation of Merocyanine Based on Catechol Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present a novel approach for synthesising a merocyanine (MC) compound that integrates gallol and a near&#8209;infrared (NIR) fluorophore using a straightforward method. We conduct a comprehensive structural analysis to elucidate the specific roles of each functional group during monomer synthesis and their effects on the properties of both the spiropyran (SP) and MC forms, particularly their fluorescence. As a proof of concept, we explore the use of these compounds in formulating innovative fluorescent polymeric coatings by melanising catechol and gallol moieties on various substrates, including glass, a cupronickel coin, and an organic polymer. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a bioinspired approach utilizing the melanisation of a catechol and gallol moiety containing merocyanine.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (LCDSA) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy to create uniform one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D), 2&#8208;D and 3&#8208;D nanostructures in a controlled manner. However, the examples of generation of uniform multi&#8208;morphology nanostructures from solution self&#8208;assembly of one single polymer sample are rare. Herein, we report the first example of preparation of multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like nanostructures consisting of an inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like core of uniform size and platelets protruded from the core by LCDSA of PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 (PAMAM = polyamidoamine, Azo = azobenzene) in methanol. It is disclosed that the different aggregation rates for PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 with varying contents of Azo units spontaneously separated nucleation and growth stages, which led to the formation of inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like cores (&#8220;seeds&#8221;) firstly, followed by the formation of platelets protruded from the edges of inner core to give &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like nanostructures. Additional annealing of initially formed &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like micelles will promote the rearrangement of Azo units to give thermodynamically&#8208;favored &#8220;perfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;shaped micelles with a uniform dimension both in the core and whole structure. This work not only provides an efficient strategy to create uniform multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;shaped nanostructures, but also reveals the essential impact of aggregation kinetics of liquid&#8208;crystalline&#8208;coil BCPs in the formation of multi&#8208;morphology nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Active and Stable Cu&#8208;Cd Bimetallic Oxides for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) can produce value&#8208;added chemicals such as carbon monoxide (CO) and multicarbon&#160;(C2+). However, the complex reaction pathways of CO2&#160;electro&#8208;reduction reaction (CO2RR) greatly limit the product selectivity and conversion efficiency. Herein, the Cu&#8208;Cd bimetallic oxides catalyst was designed and applied for the CO2RR. The optimized 4.73%Cd&#8208;CuO exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic CO2RR activity for selective CO production in H&#8208;cell using 0.5 M 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)/MeCN as electrolyte. The Faradaic efficiency of CO (FE(CO)) can be maintained above 90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;2.0 to &#8722;2.4 V vs. Ag/Ag+. Particularly, the catalyst achieves an impressive FE(CO) of 96.3% with a current density of 60.7 mA cm&#8722;2&#160;at &#8722;2.2 V vs. Ag/Ag+. Furthermore, scaling up the 4.73%Cd&#8208;CuO catalyst into a flow cell can reach 56.64% FE of C2+&#160;products (ethylene, ethanol and n&#8208;propanol) with a current density as high as 600 mA cm&#8722;2&#160;steadily.&#160;The excellent CO2RR performance of the as&#8208;synthesized 4.73%Cd&#8208;CuO&#160;can be mainly attributed to the introduction of CdO to improve the ability of CuO to activate CO2, the electronic interactions between Cu and Cd can boost&#160;activation and conversion&#160;key intermediates of CO2RR and ensure the continuous stability of&#160;4.73%Cd&#8208;CuO&#160;in electrolysis process.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Sulfurization of Cubic Cu2O to Form Cu2S Nanostructure&#8208;Decorated Catalysts for Light&#8208;enhanced Electrocatalytic H2 Evolution and Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for electrocatalysis and photocatalysis suffers from sluggish charge transfer and poor photo&#8208;to&#8208;electric conversion rate. Herein, micro&#8208;sized Cu2O cubes were initially prepared for subsequent transformation into Cu2O@Cu2S core&#8208;shell structures by a slight surface sulfurization. The formation of nanostructured Cu2S thin layer at Cu2O surface can endow an immediate charge separation and migration under light irradiation, leading to high surface photovoltages (SPV, 18&#8208;30 mV). As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Cu2O@Cu2S catalysts exhibited reduced overpotentials (&#951;, only 86 mV is required for the optimized sample to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2) for H2 evolution with good cycling stability in electrocatalytic water splitting. Meanwhile, a high methane (CH4) production rate of 30.3 &#956;mol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 can be delivered from the optimized Cu2O@Cu2S sample when used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work has provided a strategy to prepare bifunctional catalysts with improved photoelectric properties for photo/electrocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Efficiency and Intrinsic Stability of Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells through Dimethylamine&#8208;Based Cation Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High efficiency and stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are important for perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells. However, the efficiency and stability of wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs suffers from severe phase segregation and surface defects. In this study, we propose a cation engineering strategy for wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite deposited by a two&#8208;step&#160;sequential method&#160;&#160;through the incorporation of&#160;dimethylamine hydroiodide (DMAI)&#160;into the lead halide complex in the first step. The DMAI additive modifies the crystal structure and grain growth of perovskite film, resulting in enhancing crystal quality, suppressing photo&#8208;induced halide segregation, reducing defect density, and improving charge carrier mobility. As a result, we achieved a champion photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.9% for 1.68 eV wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs. Additionally, the stability of PSCs based on DMA doped perovskite was strongly enhanced, after being exposed to ambient air for 1500 hours, the unencapsulated device maintained an impressive 80.6% of their initial efficiency, demonstrating great potential for stable and efficient wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Emulsion Interfaces: Surface Chemistry made Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disperse systems, and emulsions in particular, are currently massively used in fields as varied as food industry, cosmetics, health care and environmentally&#8208;friendly materials. To meet increasingly precise needs or targeted applications, these systems need to be endowed with new functionalities at their interfaces, in addition to their composition and structural properties. However, due to the fragility of drops and the low reactivity of their surface, conventional solid surface chemistry cannot be used for such a purpose. Several specific emulsion interface functionalization techniques have thus been developed for targeted systems and applications, but a general framework has yet to be drawn. In this review, we attempt to present these methods in a unified way through the prism of what we may call &#8220;liquid surface chemistry&#8221;. We propose to categorize existing methods into drop&#8208;coating strategies, including layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer techniques and polymer coating, and emulsifier&#8208;carrier approaches involving particles and/or amphiphilic molecules. They are discussed in a transversal way, highlighting the underlying physico&#8208;chemical principles and providing a comparative analysis of their advantages, current limitations and potential for improvement. We also propose future directions and opportunities, involving for instance DNA&#8208;based programmability or artificial intelligence, which could make liquid surface chemistry more versatile and controlled.</dc:description>

         <title>Substitution of the axial Type 1 Cu Ligand Afford Binding of a Water Molecule in Axial Position Affecting Kinetics, Spectral, and Structural Properties of the Small Laccase Ssl1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multicopper oxidases use Cu ions as cofactors to oxidize various substrates. High reduction potential at Type 1 Cu is considered as crucial for effective catalysis. Previous studies have shown that replacing the axial methionine ligand of the Type 1 Cu with leucine or phenylalanine leads to an increased reduction potential, but not always to higher enzyme activity. Here we present a study of six variants of the small laccase Ssl1 from Streptomyces sviceus, where the axial methionine ligand was substituted and the effect of the axial ligand on reduction potential, activity, spectral properties and structure was investigated. Absorption, electronic circular dichroism and EPR spectra revealed the presence of a stronger coordinating axial ligand like oxygen, which influences the electronic and catalytic properties more than the nature of the amino acid side chain. The crystal structures of the Ssl1 variants were solved, which show that none of the amino acids side chains coordinates to the Cu. Instead, a water molecule is found in the axial coordination site, which support the spectroscopic data. Our findings highlight the importance of combining structural and spectroscopic methods to investigate the effect of amino acid exchange on multicopper oxidases.</dc:description>

         <title>Changes in Secondary Structure upon Pr to Pfr Transition in Cyanobacterial Phytochrome Cph1 detected by DNP NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phytochromes perceive subtle changes in the light environment and convert them into biological signals by photoconversion between the red&#8208;light absorbing (Pr) and the far&#8208;red&#8208;absorbing (Pfr) states. In the primitive bacteriophytochromes this includes refolding of a tongue&#8208;like hairpin loop close to the chromophore, one strand of an antiparallel&#160;b&#8208;sheet&#160;being replaced by&#160;&#945;&#8208;helix. However,&#160;the strand sequence in the&#160;cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1&#160;is different from that of previously investigated bacteriophytochromes and has a higher&#160;b&#8208;sheet&#160;propensity. We&#160;confirm here the transition experimentally and estimate minimum helix length using&#160;dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) magic angle spinning NMR. Sample conditions were optimized for protein DNP NMR studies at high field, yielding Boltzmann enhancements&#160;eB&#160;of 19 at an NMR field of 18.801 T. Selective labelling of Trp, Ile, Arg, and Val residues with&#160;13C and&#160;15N enabled&#160;filtering for pairs of labelled amino acids by the 3D CANCOCA technique to identify signals of the motif&#160;483Ile&#8208;Val&#8208;Arg485&#160;(IVR) present in both sheet and helix. Those signals were assigned for the Pfr state of the protein. Based on the chemical shift pattern, we confirm for Cph1 the formation of a helix covering the IVR motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution Enhances Kemp Eliminase Activity by Optimizing Oxyanion Stabilization and Conformational Flexibility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The base&#8208;promoted Kemp elimination reaction has been used as a model system for enzyme design. Among the multiple computationally designed and evolved Kemp eliminases generated along the years, the HG3&#8208;to&#8208;HG3.17 evolutionary trajectory is particularly interesting due to the high catalytic efficiency of HG3.17 and the debated role of glutamine 50 (Gln50) as potential oxyanion stabilizer. This study aims to elucidate the structural and dynamic changes along the evolutionary pathway from HG3 to HG3.17 that contribute to improved catalytic efficiency. In particular, we evaluate key variants along the HG3 evolutionary trajectory via molecular dynamics simulations coupled to non&#8208;covalent interactions and water analysis. Our computational study indicates that HG3.17 can adopt a catalytically competent conformation promoted by a water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions, in which aspartate 124 is properly positioned for proton abstraction and both glutamine 50 and mutation cysteine 84 contribute to oxyanion stabilization. We find that HG3.17 exhibits a rather high flexibility of Gln50, which is regulated by the conformation adopted by the active site residue Trp44. This interplay between Gln50 and Trp44 positioning induced by distal active site mutations affects the water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions, Gln50 preorganization, and water content of the active site pocket.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;selectively Phosphorylated Hsp90 C&#8208;terminal Domain Variants Provide Access to Deciphering the Chaperone Code.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitous molecular chaperone Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is pivotal in many cellular processes through folding of client proteins under stressed and normal conditions. Despite intensive research on its function as a chaperone, the influence of posttranslational modifications on Hsp90 (the &#8216;chaperone code&#8217;), and its interactions with co&#8208;chaperones and client proteins, still remains to be elucidated. The C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of Hsp90 is essential for formation of the active homodimer state of Hsp90 and contains recognition sites for co&#8208;chaperones and client proteins. Here we used expressed protein selenoester ligation to introduce site&#8208;selective phosphorylations in the Hsp90 CTD, while preserving the native amino acid sequence. The two phosphorylations do not affect the overall secondary structure, but in combination, slightly decrease the thermal stability of the CTD. The Hsp90 CTD functions as a chaperone in decreasing aggregation of model client proteins, but the C&#8208;terminal phosphorylations do not significantly alter the anti&#8208;aggregation activity for these clients. The optimization of expressed protein selenoester ligation to carry out several steps in one pot provides an efficient route to access site&#8208;specifically modified Hsp90 CTD variants, allowing the generation of Hsp90 variants with site&#8208;specific PTMs to decipher the chaperone code.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of 4&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217; Disubstituted CinNapht Dyes Accessible through Double SNAr Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes the synthesis of a difluorinated CinNapht derivative in the 4' and 5' positions allowing the easy access to two new families of fluorophores by late&#8208;stage functionalization using SNAr. The first one comprises derivatives incorporating hindered aromatic amines in the 4' and 5' positions, which show redemission in apolar solvents. The second one is obtained through the use of dinucleophiles. Among them, Tetrahydroquinoxaline (THQ) and tetrahydrobenzodiazepine (THB) compounds show strongly redshifted emission. The photophysical properties of all the fluorophores in these two families are studied and rationalized by DFT and TDDFT calculations. The most promising compounds have been used to image living cells by confocal microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Air&#8208;stable N&#8208;type Organic Field&#8208;effect Transistor (OFET) Properties of&#160;Functionalized&#8208;phenanthrene Conjugated Asymmetric N&#8208;heteroacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of stable high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors for applications in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) under ambient conditions is desirable but challenging. To address this issue, we here synthesized a series of functionalized&#8208;phenanthrene conjugated asymmetric N&#8208;heteroacenes, where the phenanthrene moiety was modified by N substitution or Br functionalization at different positions to induce various degrees of asymmetry in their structures. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these molecules were studied, and their packing patterns were analysed. The OFETs based on these materials were fabricated through simple spin&#8208;coating method, and the as&#8208;resulted thin films were treated with different conditions. The devices exhibit typical n&#8208;type performances under ambient conditions with charge carrier mobilities up to 4.27 &#215; 10&#8208;3 cm2&#160;V&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1. The crystallinities and morphologies of these thin films were studied to investigate the correlations between the device performances and thin&#8208;film characteristics. Our study suggests that phenanthrene conjugated N&#8208;heteroacenes can be developed as promising air&#8208;stable solution&#8208;processable n&#8208;type semiconducting materials, and Br modification at certain positions of phenanthrene is beneficial in adjusting the thin&#8208;film properties for the improvement of OFET performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Switch of Five Contiguous Chiral Centers in the Synthesis of Both Enantiomers of Hajos&#8211;Parrish Ketone Analogs via Diphenylprolinol Silyl Ether&#8208;Mediated Domino Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both enantiomers of functionalized Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone (HPK) analogs were prepared with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities using the same chiral catalyst under two slightly different conditions. In condition A, dioxane was used as the solvent with 3 equivalents of water. In condition B, acetonitrile was used as the solvent with 30 equivalents of water, followed by epimerization with a base in a one&#8208;pot. The reaction consisted of a domino reaction including a diphenylprolinol silyl ether&#8211;mediated asymmetric Michael reaction and an intramolecular Henry reaction. In the Michael reaction, depending on the solvent and water amounts, syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;isomers were selectively synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity, in which the absolute configuration at C5 (indanone numbering) was opposite. The subsequent Henry reaction was diastereoselective, in which the C5 substituent controlled the three chiral centers in a highly diastereoselective manner. The final base treatment in condition B caused epimerization, changing the stereochemistry at C6. Switching more than two chiral centers with high enantioselectivity is extremely difficult using the same chiral catalyst; the present reaction is a very rare enantiodivergent reaction that switches five continuous chiral centers with high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nanosized {NiII18} Cluster with a &#8216;Flying Saucer&#8217; Topology Exhibiting Slow Relaxation of Magnetisation Phenomena at Both 15 K and 1.3 K</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A high&#8208;nuclearity {Ni18} complex (1) with a unique &#8216;flying saucer&#8217; motif has been prepared from the organic chelate, &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;methanol (mpmH), in conjunction with bridging azido (N3&#8208;) and peroxido (O22&#8208;) ligands. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed the presence of both ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the metal centres in 1, and the stabilization of spin states with appreciable S values at two different temperature regimes. The end&#8208;on bridging azido and alkoxido groups are in all likelyhood the ferromagnetic mediators, while the &#951;3:&#951;3:&#956;6&#8208;bridging peroxides most likely promote the antiparallel alignment of the metals&#8217; spin vectors, yielding an overall non&#8208;zero spin ground state for the centrosymmetric compound 1. Furthermore, the {Ni18} nanosized cluster behaves as a single&#8208;molecule magnet, exhibiting magnetic hysteresis at low temperatures and two relaxation processes at 15 K and 1.3 K, a very rare phenomenon in polynuclear magnetic 3d&#8208;metal clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond the Diffusion Limit: Pre&#8208;Associated Ion&#8208;Pair Photoinitiating Systems for Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pre&#8208;association mechanism of an ion&#8208;pair Type II photoinitiating system (PIS) acting in the visible range was studied. The choice of a dye as photoinitiator (crystal violet) with an excited state lifetime of 200 ps ensured the absence of dynamical quenching by the borate salts used as coinitiators. In spite of the fact that no diffusional bimolecular quenching can take place, excellent polymerization efficiency was found, underlining the high reactivity of the PIS. A saturation effect is observed when increasing the concentration of borate as a consequence of the pre&#8208;association mechanism arising from coulombic interaction between the cationic dye and the anionic coinitiator. The association equilibria of the system were described and the corresponding association constant values were calculated, allowing to quantify the pre&#8208;association efficiency. This was further successfully correlated to the observed maximal rates of polymerization. The efficiency of this super&#8208;stoichiometric sample with an excess of borate was finally compared to the stoichiometric 1:1 dye:borate ion&#8208;pair. It is shown that the pre&#8208;association mechanism could lead to much higher efficiency than the stoichiometric ion&#8208;pair.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispecific Thio&#8208;linked Disaccharides as Inhibitors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Lectins LecA (PA&#8208;IL) and LecB (PA&#8208;IIL): Dual&#8208;Targeting Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent opportunistic human pathogen, particularly associated with cystic fibrosis. Among its virulence factors are the LecA and LecB lectins. Both lectins play an important role in the adhesion to the host cells and display cytotoxic activity. In this study, we successfully synthesized hardly hydrolysable carbohydrate ligands targeting these pathogenic lectins, including two bispecific glycans. The interactions between LecA/LecB lectins and synthetic glycans were evaluated using hemagglutination (yeast agglutination) inhibition assays, comparing their efficacy with corresponding monosaccharides. Additionally, the binding affinities of bispecific glycans were assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Structural insight into the lectin&#8208;ligand interaction was obtained by determining the crystal structures of LecA/LecB lectins in complex with one of the bispecific ligands using X ray crystallography. This comprehensive investigation into the inhibitory potential of synthetic glycosides against P. aeruginosa lectins sheds light on their potential application in antimicrobial therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Luminescent Terpyridine&#8208;Based Metallo&#8208;Bowties with Alkyl Chain&#8208;Bridged Dimerized Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous metallo&#8208;supramolecules with well&#8208;defined sizes and shapes have been successfully constructed via the strong coordination interaction between terpyridine (TPY) moieties and ruthenium cations. However, the pseudo&#8208;octahedral geometry of &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; unit hampers the luminescent properties of such metallo&#8208;architectures, thus limiting their applications as optical materials. To address this issue, we herein use a flexible alkyl chain to bridge TPY building blocks, replacing conventional &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. The introduction of alkyl chain guides the self&#8208;assembly into desired architecture while simultaneously eliminating the quenching effects typically associated with the &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. More importantly, this design strategy enables the precise construction of bowtie&#8208;shaped metallo&#8208;supramolecules with significantly enhanced emission. The incorporation of alkyl chain linkage not only maintains structural integrity but also enhances optical performance, making these metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies highly promising for applications in advanced photonic and luminescent materials. This study offers a versatile approach to construct complex metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures with desired optical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Quenching Rate Constants of Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radical by Substrates: a Laser Flash Photolysis Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advanced strategy using  Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals (LBRs) has recently been proposed for the addition of alkyl substituents to the full&#8208;carbon quaternary center of an organic molecule. However, as the rate&#8208;determining step in the whole route, reaction rate constants of LBRs with substrates are extremely lacking. In this paper, 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;BH2&#8226; was selected as a representative of LBRs, and its reactions with six monochloro&#8208;substituted substrates, including three methyl chlorobenzoates and three chlorinated acetanilides were studied in experiments and theoretical calculations. The bimolecular reaction rate constants, kq, were determined using laser flash photolysis approach. By comparing activation energies along the two addition pathways, we have clarified the rate&#8208;determining step as the attacking to carbonyl oxygen instead of chlorine atom. Furthermore, noncovalent interaction (NCI) analyses on these substrates indicate that weak interactions, such as hydrogen&#8208;bonding and van der Waals interactions, have significant influence on the reactivity of these substrates. Our study provides concrete clues to extend this synthetic strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step Macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;Macrocycle Conversion Towards Two New Macrocyclic Arenes with Different Structures and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new macrocyclic arenes H1 and H2 were conveniently synthesized by the one&#8208;step reaction of carboxylic acid substituted octopus[3]arene. It was found that H1 was composed of three ethenoanthracene subunits with a rigid hexagonal structure and H2 contained two ethenoanthracene subunits and one anthracene subunit with a rigid house&#8208;shaped structure. Among them, H2 exhibited strong blue fluorescence due to the existence of an anthracene subunit. Moreover, both H1 and H2 showed large and electron&#8208;rich cavities, which enable them to effectively complex different nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic salt guests in solution and the solid state. It was further found that H2 exhibited stronger complexation towards the tested guests than H1 probably due to the stronger charge&#8208;transfer interactions between H2 and the guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Isoreticular Contraction in Dicopper Paddle&#8208;Wheel&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Enhance C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving a balance between high selectivity and uptake is a formidable challenge for the purification of acetylene from mixtures with carbon dioxide, particularly when seeking to maximize both C2H2 adsorption capacity and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity in crystalline porous materials. In this study, leveraging the principles of reticular chemistry, we selected two tetracarboxylate&#8208;based linkers and combined them with Cu2+ ions to synthesize two isoreticular dicopper paddle&#8208;wheel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs): Cu&#8208;TPTC (terphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid , H4TPTC) and Cu&#8208;ABTC (3,3,5,5&#8208;azobenzenetetracarboxylic acid, H4ABTC). The structural and sorption analyses revealed that Cu&#8208;ABTC, despite having slightly smaller pores due to the strategic replacement of a phenyl ring with an azo group between two tetratopic ligands, maintains high porosity compared to Cu&#8208;TPTC. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;ABTC outperforms Cu&#8208;TPTC in terms of C2H2 adsorption capacity (196 cm3 g&#8208;1 at 298 K and 1 bar) and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity (16.5~5.6). These findings were corroborated by dynamic breakthrough experiments and computational modeling. This research highlights the potential of the isoreticular contraction strategy in enhancing MOFs for sophisticated gas adsorption and separation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Basics and Advances of Manganese&#8208;Based Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is greatly crucial to develop low&#8208;cost energy storage candidates with high safety and stability to replace alkali metal systems for a sustainable future. Recently, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have received tremendous interest owing to their low cost, high safety, wide oxidation states, and sophisticated fabrication process. Nanostructured manganese (Mn)&#8208;based oxides in different polymorphs are the potential cathode materials for the widespread application of ZIBs. However, Mn&#8208;based oxide materials suffer from several drawbacks, such as low electronic/ionic conductivity and poor cycling performance. To overcome these issues, various structural modification strategies have been adopted to enhance their electrochemical activity, including phase/defect engineering, doping with foreign atoms (e.g., metal and/or nonmetal atoms), and coupling with carbon materials or conducting polymers. Herein, this review targets to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the above&#8208;mentioned strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of the cathodic part of ZIBs. The challenges and suggestions for the development of manganese oxides for ZIBs are put forward.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Chemical Stability of P12L24 Cage: Transformation of the Chemically Labile Imine Cage into a Robust Carbamate Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report enhancement in chemical stability of the imine&#8208;based porphyrinic cage P12L24 by converting it into a robust carbamate porphyrinic cage, c&#8208;P12L24, through a two&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification process. First, the imine bonds in P12L24 were reduced to form an amine&#8208;based cage, r&#8208;P12L24, followed by carbamation using N,N&#8242;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) to yield c&#8208;P12L24. The resulting carbamate cage exhibits high stability under acidic and basic conditions (pH 1&#8211;13) and in the presence of moisture. 1H NMR, DOSY NMR, and DFT calculations revealed that reducing the imine bonds to amine increases the framework&#8217;s flexibility, causing partial structural collapse, whereas the carbamate formation restores structural rigidity. The insertion of a 4.0 nm molecular ruler into the cavity of zinc&#8208;metallated c&#8208;P12L24 via metal&#8208;ligand coordination further confirmed restoration of the cavity size and geometry of the original cage. This enhancement of chemical stability through carbamate formation can pave the way to a wide range of potential applications for the gigantic porphyrinic cage.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxydiazomethylation of Alkenes via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Diazoesters belong to significantly important carbenoid precursors in synthetic chemistry. Diazomethylation&#8208;based difunctionalization of alkenes is highly valuable but remain nontrivial. Herein, we reported a general and modular approach for the direct 1,2&#8208;oxydiazomethylation of alkenes through visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. This process exploits photocatalyzed strategy to convert alkenes to &#947;&#8208;formyloxyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoesters using &#945;&#8208;diazo iodonium salts as carbyne precursors, featuring wide substrate tolerance and broad late&#8208;stage diversi&#64257;cations. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of &#947;&#8208;carbocation&#8208;tethered &#945;&#8208;diazoesters plays a crucial role in trapping DMF and H2O to allow for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Proximity Effects and Aggregation of Hamilton&#8208;Receptor Barbiturate Host&#8208;Guest Complexes Probed by Cross&#8208;Metathesis and ESI MS Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular environment around supramolecular bonding systems significantly affects their stability and the assembly of host&#8208;guest complexes, most prominent for hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds). Hamilton receptor&#8208;barbiturate host&#8208;guest complexes are well&#8208;known in solution, typically forming a 1:1 molar ratio complex. However, within a polymer matrix, these complexes can form higher&#8208;order assemblies, deviating from the standard 1:1 complex, which are challenging to characterize and often require lab&#8208;intensive methods. In this study, a novel Hamilton receptor (H) was equipped with cyclopentene moieties and used as a host to form host&#8208;guest complexes (H&#8208;B) with allobarbital (B), followed by covalent crosslinking. UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy titration experiments in different solvents and at various temperatures revealed that polar solvents containing additional H&#8208;bonding sites significantly reduce the formation of the 1:1 H&#8208;B complex, as indicated by a reduced association constant. Higher&#8208;order aggregates (HH&#8208;dimer, HHH&#8208;trimer) were subsequently detected via an alkene cross&#8208;metathesis (CM) reaction to fix the assemblies covalently, followed by analysis via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS). This two&#8208;step method, firstly via CM fixation followed by ESI MS, was extended to study the H&#8208;B model complex within a polyisobutylene (PIB) matrix, presenting a direct method to analyze the complex host&#8208;guest assembly in solvent&#8208;free (polymer) environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Defining the Synthetic Scope of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides by Quantifying Their Electrophilicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of aryl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;quinone methides (oQMs) was synthesised and structurally characterised. Kinetic studies of the nucleophilic additions of carbanions (reference nucleophiles) to oQMs were used to determine second&#8208;order rate constants k2 for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions (20&#160;&#176;C, DMSO) at the oQMs&#8217; exocyclic &#960;&#8208;bond. Analysing the kinetic data by the linear free energy relationship lg k2 = sN(N+E) revealed the Mayr electrophilicities E of the oQMs. The electrophilicities E of oQMs correlate linearly with Hammett substituent constants and experimentally determined reduction potentials Epred as well as with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs), which provides valuable tools for prediciting the reactivity of further types of oQMs. Embedding the oQMs in Mayr&#8217;s reactivity scales enables to predict novel nucleophilic reaction partners for oQMs and can productively be used to prepare simple Michael adducts as well as 4+2 or 4+1 cyclisation products as demonstrated in this work by several novel reactions with neutral or negatively charged C&#8208;, N&#8208;, and S&#8208;nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Triflyl [18F]Fluoride as a Solution for Base&#8208;sensitive Late&#8208;stage Nucleophilic Aromatic 18F&#8208;Fluorination Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;18 is the predominant radionuclide used to label Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracers. One outstanding challenge in nucleophilic aromatic radiofluorination reactions is the sensitivity of precursors and catalysts for basic reaction conditions, which are necessary for the work&#8208;up of [18F]fluoride, resulting in limited reproducibility. Triflyl [18F]fluoride is a new [18F]fluoride source that allows freedom in choice of type and amounts of base and cryptand. The aim of the current work is to explore the scope and limitations of triflyl [18F]fluoride in the late&#8208;stage nucleophilic aromatic 18F&#8208;fluorination of various functionalized precursors, exploring reduced amounts of base and cryptand. The assessment allowed for the application of this new nucleophilic [18F]fluoride reagent to the successful radiosynthesis of boron, stannane, hypervalent iodonium ylide and phenol substrates bearing electron&#8208;deficient, &#8208;neutral and &#8208;rich functional groups as well as the clinically relevant PET tracers [18F]FPEB, [18F]mFBG and [18F]SynVesT&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The pH effect on the photophysics of three push&#8208;pull compounds bearing dimethoxytriphenylamine (TPA&#8208;OMe) as electron donor and pyridine as electron acceptor, with different ortho&#8208;functionalization (&#8211;H, &#8211;Br, &#8211;TPA&#8208;OMe), is assessed through steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques in DMSO/water mixed solutions and in water dispersions over a wide pH range. The enhanced intramolecular charge transfer upon protonation of the pyridine&#160;leads to the acidochromic (from colorless to yellow) and acido(fluoro)chromic (from cyan to pink) behaviours of the investigated compounds. In dilute DMSO/buffer mixtures these molecules exhibited low pKa values (&#8804; 3.5) and short singlet lifetimes. Nevertheless, it is by exploiting the aggregation phenomenon in aqueous environment that the practical use of these compounds largely expands: i) the basicity increases (pKa &#8776; 4.5) approaching the optimum values for pH&#8208;sensing in cancer cell recognition; ii) the fluorescence efficiencies are boosted due to Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE), making these compounds appealing as fluorescent probes; iii) longer singlet lifetimes enable Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer, paving the way for the application of these molecules as photobases (pKa* = 9.1). The synergy of charge and proton transfers combined to the AIE behaviour in these pyridines allows tunable multi&#8208;responsive optical properties providing valuable information for the design of new light&#8208;emitting photobases.</dc:description>

         <title>Flipping&#160;the Metalation of 4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine: Steric Repulsion versus&#160;London Dispersion Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions, including the coordination of an organolithium reagent by a directing group and the steric hindrance from substituents, play a crucial role in determining the selectivity of metalation reactions. Here, we demonstrate the effective utilization of steric interactions for &#8220;flipping&#8221; the lithiation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Introduction of a Me3Si substituent to the position 1 of DMAP or simple complexation with t&#8208;BuLi allows selective C3&#8208;lithiation, due to the steric hindrance of a C2&#8208;H bond by the bulky moiety at the pyridine nitrogen. This simple approach creates a convenient way to achieve the selective C3&#8208;functionalization of DMAP. In contrast, the utilization of an even bulkier i&#8208;Pr3Si substituent leads to exclusive C2&#8208;functionalization due to the dispersion interactions with organometallic bases. For the first time, it is demonstrated that the i&#8208;Pr3Si moiety can serve as a directing group, providing a new type of direct ortho&#8208;metalation effect.</dc:description>

Introduction of a Me3Si substituent to the position 1 of DMAP or simple complexation with t-BuLi allows selective C3-lithiation, due to the steric hindrance of a C2-H bond by the bulky moiety at the pyridine nitrogen. This simple approach creates a convenient way to achieve the selective C3-functionalization of DMAP. In contrast, the utilization of an even bulkier i-Pr3Si substituent leads to exclusive C2-functionalization due to the dispersion interactions with organometallic bases.
