         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Discharge Processes of Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8722;CO2 batteries correspond to renewable energy storage in a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly CO2 fixation manner. However, an inadequate understanding of their reaction mechanism severely impedes their development. Here we outline recent mechanistic advances in the discharge processes of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries, especially from the theoretical aspect. We first highlight the vital factors affecting the formation of discharge intermediates and a surface lithiation mechanism that may dominate the catalysts with weak CO2 adsorption. Then, we discuss the modeling of the chemical potential of Li+ + e&#8722;, which is crucial for the evaluation of the theoretical limiting voltage. Finally, we describe challenges and future directions to facilitate the understanding of Li&#8722;CO2 electrochemistry. This concept article would inspire more experimental and theoretical studies to advance the development of Li&#8722;CO2 electrochemical technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalene diimide&#8208;Annulated Heterocyclic Acenes: Synthesis, Electrochemical and Semiconductor Properties and their Multifaceted Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes and Naphthalene Diimides (NDIs) stand as distinguished classes of organic compounds, each possessing unique and intriguing properties that have garnered significant attention across various scientific disciplines. Acenes, characterized by linearly fused aromatic rings, have captivated researchers due to their diverse electronic structures and promising applications in materials science. On the other hand, NDIs, known for their distinctive electron&#8208;accepting properties, exhibit remarkable versatility in fields ranging from organic electronics, supramolecular to spin chemistry. In this review, we navigate through the fascinating realms of both acenes and NDIs before converging our focus on the highly diverse and distinctive subgroup of NDI&#8208;annulated heterocyclic acenes. This potentially important subgroup, has emerged as a subject of intense investigation, encapsulating their fascinating synthesis, optical and electrochemical characteristics, and multifaceted applications that span the realms of chemistry, physics, and biology. Through the exploration of their synthetic strategies, unique properties, and diverse applications, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the pivotal role played by NDI&#8208;based heterocyclic acenes in contemporary multidisciplinary research and technological innovation.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesogenic Ordering&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the development of nanotechnology, the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles with nicely defined structures has been well&#8208;developed, and the functionalization and subsequent applications of the resultant nanostructures are becoming increasingly important. Particularly, by introducing mesogenic ordering as the driving force for the solution&#8208;state self&#8208;assembly of liquid crystalline (LC) block copolymers (BCPs), micellar nanostructures with different morphologies, especially anisotropic morphologies, can be easily prepared. This review summarizes the recent progress in the solution&#8208;state self&#8208;assembly of LC BCPs and is mostly focused on four main related aspects, including an in&#8208;depth understanding of the mesogenic ordering&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, precise self&#8208;assembly methods, utilization of these methods to fabricate hierarchical structures, and the potential applications of these well&#8208;defined nanostructures. We hope not only to make a systematic summary of previous studies but also to provide some useful thinking for the future development of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>A Healable Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Balanced Toughness and Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have garnered extensive attention as potential alternatives to traditional liquid electrolytes, primarily due to their prowess in curbing lithium dendrite formation and preventing electrolyte leaks. The quest for SPEs that are both mechanically robust and exhibit superior ionic conductivity has been vigorous. However, achieving a harmonious balance between these two attributes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte, ingeniously crafted from a poly(urethane&#8208;urea) network, enriched with lithium salts and plasticizers. This innovative composition not only boasts remarkable toughness but also ensures commendable ionic conductivity. Our post&#8208;gelation method yields gel polymer electrolytes that undergo rigorous evaluation, leading to an optimized version that stands out with its exceptional room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity (2.94 &#215; 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1) and outstanding toughness (11.9 MJ m&#8208;3). Moreover, it demonstrates a broad electrochemical window (4.73 V), remarkable stability across a 600&#8208;hour cycle test, a high capacity retention exceeding 80% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C, and a noteworthy self&#8208;healing capability. This quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte emerges as a promising contender to replace current liquid electrolyte solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Quest for Double M&#246;bius Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neutral four&#8208;membered rings with 4n electrons are generally H&#252;ckel antiaromatic. On the other hand, 4n electron system can also be M&#246;bius aromatic, although identification has escaped so far. A recent study of double M&#246;bius aromaticity has been put forwarded in the D2h symmetric singlet ground state of four member Pa2B2 ring. Although interesting, but the synthesis possesses a significant challenge as Pa is rare, highly radioactive and toxic. Herein, a synthetically viable four membered Rh2B2 cluster is proposed which contains double M&#246;bius aromaticity. Interestingly, the three membered RhB2&#8208; cluster also possess M&#246;bius aromaticity and is the smallest ring to show such phenomenon.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Glycosylated Soluble Fas Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical access to the enigmatic death receptor ligand sFasL in its glycosylated version using a combination of native chemical and diselenide selenoester ligation.







Abstract
Controlled cell death is essential for the regulation of the immune system and plays a role in pathogen defense. It is often altered in pathogenic conditions such as cancer, viral infections and autoimmune diseases. The Fas receptor and its corresponding membrane&#8208;bound ligand (FasL) are part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway activated in these cases. A soluble form of FasL (sFasL), produced by ectodomain shedding, displays a diverse but still elusive set of non&#8208;apoptotic functions and sometimes even serves as a pro&#8208;survival factor. To gather more knowledge about the characteristics of this protein and the impact N&#8208;glycosylations may have, access to homogeneous posttranslationally modified variants of sFasL is needed. Therefore, we developed a flexible strategy to obtain such homogeneously N&#8208;glycosylated variants of sFasL by applying chemical protein synthesis. This strategy can be flexibly combined with enzymatic methods to introduce more complex, site selective glycosylations.

         <dc:description>
The mechanism and reactivity of the Povarov reaction catalyzed by cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysts were discussed by DFT calculations, and importance of electrostatic energy on the reactivity was explored. The structure&#8208;property relationship between positive electrostatic potential and Gibbs free energy barrier was established to assess the reactivity. Furthermore, the importance of the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction in stereoselectivity was clarified for solving stereoselectivity in other reactions.







Abstract
Chalcogen bond catalysis, particularly cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysis, is considered to be an effective strategy for organocatalysis. In this work, the cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysis for the Povarov reaction between N&#8208;benzylideneaniline and ethyl vinyl ether was investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic reaction involves the cycloaddition process and the proton transfer process, and the rate&#8208;determining step is the cycloaddition process. Cationic hypervalent tellurium derivatives bearing CF3 and F groups exhibit superior catalytic activity. For the rate&#8208;determining step, the Gibbs free energy barrier decreases as the positive electrostatic potential of the chalcogen bond catalysts increases. More importantly, the Gibbs free energy barrier has a strong linear correlation with the electrostatic energy of the chalcogen bond in the catalyst&#8208;substrate complex. Furthermore, the catalytic reactions include the endo pathway and exo pathway. The C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction between the substituent of the ethyl vinyl ether and the aryl ring of the N&#8208;benzylideneaniline contributes to the endo&#8208;selectivity of the reaction. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of chalcogen bond catalysis, providing insights for designing chalcogen bond catalysts with high performance.

Neutral pincer bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;2,6&#8208;di(amino)pyridine (&#8220;PN3P&#8221;) ligands appear to play a central role in the electrocatalytic abilities of the Zn(II) complexes [Zn(&#954;2&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3)Br2] (R=Me, 1; R=H, 2). The complexes electrocatalytically reduce CO2 at &#8208;2.3&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 to selectively yield CO in mixed water/acetonitrile solutions and generate H2 from water in acetonitrile solutions with Faradaic efficiencies up to 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
Air and water&#8208;stable zinc (II) complexes of neutral pincer bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;2,6&#8208;di(amino)pyridine (&#8220;PN3P&#8221;) ligands are reported. These compounds, [Zn(&#954;2&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3))Br2] (R=Me, 1; R=H, 2), were shown to be capable of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 at &#8722;2.3&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 to selectively yield CO in mixed water/acetonitrile solutions. These complexes also electrocatalytically generate H2 from water in acetonitrile solutions, at the same potential, with Faradaic efficiencies of up to 90&#8201;%. DFT computations support a proposed mechanism involving the first reduction of 1 or 2 occurring at the PN3P ligand. Furthermore, computational analysis suggested a mechanism involving metal&#8208;ligand cooperation of a Lewis acidic Zn(II) and a basic ligand.

         <title>Phosphorescent Platinum(II) Complexes with a Spiro&#8208;fused Xanthene Unit: Synthesis and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes chelated by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) linked to a cyclometalating spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;xanthene] (SFX) motif in 2&#8208;position, is hereby reported. Acetylacetonate (acac), bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dionate (mesacac) and dihydrobis(3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl) borate are used as auxiliary ligands. These complexes show ligand&#8208;centered (LC) green&#8208;blue emission with photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) ranging from 87&#8201;%&#8211;91&#8201;%. The emission lifetimes vary from 33&#8197;&#956;s to 43&#8197;&#956;s. DFT calculations show that the corresponding 2&#8217;&#8208;regioisomer of the SFX motif with the mesacac ligand has a strong metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) character instead of a LC character.







Abstract
Novel platinum(II) complexes, derived from the spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;xanthene] (SFX) motif, were synthesized and combined with different auxiliary ligands such as acetylacetonate (acac), bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dionate (mesacac) and dihydrobis(3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl) borate. The final products were obtained in yields of up to 36&#8201;% and characterized by NMR, X&#8208;ray and combustion analysis. These complexes have structured green&#8208;blue emission spectra with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIExy) coordinates of (0.21;0.46). Excellent photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) ranging from 87&#8201;%&#8211;91&#8201;% were found. The emission lifetimes vary from 33&#8197;&#956;s to 43&#8197;&#956;s. Calculations on the B3LYP/6&#8208;311++G** level of theory reveal, that the nature of the emissive state is dependent on the positional regioisomerism of the SFX motif. The 2&#8208;SFX complexes demonstrate ligand&#8208;centered (3LC) emission, while the 2&#8217;&#8208;SFX regioisomer with the mesacac ligand shows a strong 3MLCT character.

The scale-up reaction and further derivation of the product were demonstrated. A plausible reaction mechanism was also proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Formed Electron Inhibitor Enabling Dendrite&#8208;free Garnet Electrolytes: A Case Study of Fumed Silica</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modified solid&#8208;state electrolytes were prepared by introducing fumed silica (FS) into Ta&#8208;doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO). The introduced FS could decrease the ion migration activation energy, decrease the electronic conductivity, acting as electron inhibitor in the garnet pellet, thus improving the overall battery performance. Our research contributes to the advancement of dendrite&#8208;free solid&#8208;state electrolytes and high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Ta&#8208;doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs) show great promise for solid&#8208;state batteries due to its high conductivity and safety. However, one of the challenges it faces is lithium dendrite propagation upon long&#8208;term cycling. To address this issue, we propose the incorporation of fumed silica (FS) at the grain boundaries of LLZTO to modify the properties of the garnet pellet, which effectively inhibits the dendrite growth. The introduction of FS has demonstrated several beneficial effects. Firstly, it reduces the migration barrier of lithium ions, which helps prevent dendrite formation and propagation. Additionally, FS reduces the electronic conductivity of the SEs pellet, suppressing the dendrite formation. Moreover, the formed lithium silicates from FS might also be acted as electron inhibitor, thus inhibiting the lithium dendrite growth upon cycling. By investigating the use of FS as a modifier in LLZTO&#8208;based electrolytes, our study contributes to advancing dendrite&#8208;free solid&#8208;state electrolytes and thus the development of high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Temperature Control of the Self&#8208;Assembly Process of 4&#8208;Aminoquinoline Amphiphile: Selective Construction of Perforated Vesicles and Nanofibers, and Structural Restoration Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the selective construction of perforated vesicles and nanofibers based on temperature control of self&#8208;assembly process of a 4&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;based amphiphile through its LCST behavior in 10&#8197;mM HEPES buffer (pH&#8197;7.4). The perforated vesicles exhibit a slow morphological transformation but can be readily restored with a brief heating above the LCST.







Abstract
The construction of diverse and distinctive self&#8208;assembled structures in water, based on the control of the self&#8208;assembly processes of artificial small molecules, has received considerable attention in supramolecular chemistry. Cage&#8208;like perforated vesicles are distinctive and interesting self&#8208;assembled structures. However, the development of self&#8208;assembling molecules that can easily form perforated vesicles remains challenging. This paper reports a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly property of a 4&#8208;aminoquinoline (4&#8208;AQ)&#8208;based amphiphile with a tetra(ethylene glycol) chain, in HEPES buffer (pH&#8197;7.4). This property allows to form perforated vesicles after heating at 80&#8201;&#176;C (&gt; LCST). The self&#8208;assembly process of the 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile can be controlled by heating at 80&#8201;&#176;C (&gt; LCST) or 60&#8201;&#176;C (&lt; LCST). After cooling to room temperature, the selective construction of the perforated vesicles and nanofibers was achieved from the same 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile. Furthermore, the perforated vesicles exhibited slow morphological transformation into intertwined&#8208;like nanofibers but were easily restored by brief heating above the LCST.

         <title>Effect of Fe Doping Profile on Current Collapse in GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using computer&#8208;aided design (TCAD) simulation, the impact of the Fe doping profile, including concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region on current&#8208;collapse magnitude (&#8710;CC) in 0.5&#8208;&#956;m gated GaN&#8208;based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) is systematically investigated. Accurate simulation models are established and developed to facilitate the fabrication of electronics. It is elucidated that the intricate interplay between trapping and de&#8208;trapping of Fe&#8208;related traps at the gate&#8208;drain edge is responsible for current collapse. The concentration and decay rate of the doping region have a more significant impact on current collapse than the depth. Increased trap state density near two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel caused by deep&#8208;level acceptors would boost &#8710;CC. However, a minor dynamic reduction in 2DEG density (nT) induces a relatively small &#8710;CC. By adjusting the concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region, &#8710;CC of GaN&#8208;based Radio Frequency (RF) HEMTs can be reduced by approximately 50.3%.The optimized distribution of Fe doping discussed in this work helps to prepare GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs with a limited current collapse effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Dextrans, Pullulan and Lentinan, New Scaffold Materials for Use as Hydrogels in Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel saccharide world: The synthesis of hydrogels based on dextrans, pullulan, and lentinan under physiological conditions are reported by evaluating two different &#8220;click&#8221;&#8208;strategies. In selected cases either ligands (L) with growth factor properties or alternatively fluorescent dyes are attached to the hydrogels for biomedical applications. In addition, rheological properties, water uptake, permeability, degradability and cytotoxicity have been assessed.







Abstract
The development of hydrogels based on dextrans, pullulan and lentinan to be used in biomedical applications including tissue engineering is reported. Despite the fact that selected polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid are well established, little is known, how these polysaccharides can be chemically modified to create hydrogels under controlled conditions. In this study we present a small library of chemically modified polysaccharides which are used for a divergent approach to achieve biomedical relevant hydrogels. In this case the crosslinking is based on thio ether formation between thiol modified donor and vinylsulfone or maleimide modified acceptor components. Successful synthesis of the linker systems and coupling at the polysaccharides, hydrogel formation takes place under physiological conditions. We extended the study by coupling small molecules like adhesion factors for increasing cell compatibility as well as a dye for further studies.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A hydrogel saccharide world&lt;/b&gt;: The synthesis of hydrogels based on dextrans, pullulan, and lentinan under physiological conditions are reported by evaluating two different &#8220;click&#8221;-strategies. In selected cases either ligands (L) with growth factor properties or alternatively fluorescent dyes are attached to the hydrogels for biomedical applications. In addition, rheological properties, water uptake, permeability, degradability and cytotoxicity have been assessed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of hydrogels based on dextrans, pullulan and lentinan to be used in biomedical applications including tissue engineering is reported. Despite the fact that selected polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid are well established, little is known, how these polysaccharides can be chemically modified to create hydrogels under controlled conditions. In this study we present a small library of chemically modified polysaccharides which are used for a divergent approach to achieve biomedical relevant hydrogels. In this case the crosslinking is based on thio ether formation between thiol modified donor and vinylsulfone or maleimide modified acceptor components. Successful synthesis of the linker systems and coupling at the polysaccharides, hydrogel formation takes place under physiological conditions. We extended the study by coupling small molecules like adhesion factors for increasing cell compatibility as well as a dye for further studies. The different hydrogels were studied to their rheological properties, water uptake, their permeability, biodegrability and their cytotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanding Chemical Frontiers: Approaches for Generating Diverse and Bioactive Natural Product&#8208;Like Compounds Libraries from Extracts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining natural and synthetic chemical spaces is achievable through the generation of &#8216;natural product&#8208;like compounds&#8217; that incorporate structural elements from natural and synthetic precursors, by directly chemically modifying natural extracts. The review provides insights into this approach, covering alterations from simple substitutions to complete scaffold remodelling, and highlighting achievements, promises and technical challenges in the field.







Abstract
The realms of natural products and synthetic compounds exhibit distinct chemical spaces that not only differ but also complement each other. While the convergence of these two domains has been explored through semisynthesis and conventional pharmacomodulation endeavours applied to natural frameworks, a recent and innovative approach has emerged that involves the combinatorial generation of libraries of &#8216;natural product&#8208;like compounds&#8217; (NPLCs) through the direct synthetic derivatization of natural extracts. This has led to the production of numerous NPLCs that incorporate structural elements from both their natural (multiple saturated rings, oxygen content, chiral centres) and synthetic (aromatic rings, nitrogen and halogen content, drug&#8208;like properties) precursors. Through careful selection of extracts and reagents, specific bioactivities have been achieved, and this strategy has been deployed in various ways, showing great promise without reaching its full potential to date. This review seeks to provide an overview of reported examples involving the chemical engineering of extracts, showcasing a spectrum of natural product alterations spanning from simple substitutions to complete scaffold remodelling. It also includes an analysis of the accomplishments, perspectives and technical challenges within this field.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated BPC catalyzed late&#8208;stage solution phase desulfonylation from tryptophan, tyrosine and histidine amino acid residues in oligopeptides is presented herein, by overcoming the isolation issue up to octamers. Additionally, organophotocatalyst BPC demonstrates efficient solution&#8208;phase phenacyl deprotection from C&#8208;terminal in peptides. This effective and mild strategy portrayes exceptional selectivity by tolerating a wide range of functional groups in heteroaromatics and peptides.







Abstract
Herein, BPC catalyzed visible&#8208;light&#8208;triggered target&#8208;specific late&#8208;stage solution phase desulfonylation from tryptophan in oligopeptides is portrayed by overcoming the isolation issue up to octamers. This robust and mild method is highly predictable and chemoselective, tolerating myriad of functional groups in aza&#8208;heteroaromatics and peptides. Interestingly, reductive desulfonylation is also amenable to biologically significant reactive histidine and tyrosine side chains, signifying the versatility of the strategy. Additional efficacy of BPC is demonstrated by solution phase phenacyl deprotection from C&#8208;terminal in peptides. Furthermore, excellent catalyst loading of 0.5&#8197;mol% and recyclability demonstrate the practical utility and applicability of this strategy.

         <title>Influence of Defects and Charges on the Colloidal Stabilization of Graphene in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphite intercalation compounds allow gentle exfoliation of soluble graphenide (reduced graphene) flakes. Oxidation of graphenide to graphene and solvent exchange produce aqueous graphene dispersions (Eau de graphene, EdG), stabilized by electrostatic forces, with a minimal amount of defects if graphenide oxidation is carried out before exposure to water.







Abstract
Mastering graphene preparation is an essential step to its integration into practical applications. For large&#8208;scale purposes, full graphite exfoliation appears as a suitable route for graphene production. However, it requires overpowering attractive van der Waals forces demanding large energy input, with the risk of introducing defects in the material. This difficulty can be overcome by using graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) as starting material. The greater inter&#8208;sheet separation in GICs (compared with graphite) allows the gentler exfoliation of soluble graphenide (reduced graphene) flakes. A solvent exchange strategy, accompanied by the oxidation of graphenide to graphene, can be implemented to produce stable aqueous graphene dispersions (Eau de graphene, EdG), which can be readily incorporated into many processes or materials. In this work, we prove that electrostatic forces are responsible for the stability of fully exfoliated graphene in water, and explore the influence of the oxidation and solvent exchange procedures on the quality and stability of EdG. We show that the amount of defects in graphene is limited if graphenide oxidation is carried out before exposing the material to water, and that gas removal of water before the incorporation of pre&#8208;oxidized graphene is advantageous for the long&#8208;term stability of EdG.

         <title>Chiral Bis&#8208;phosphate Macrocycles for Catalytic, Efficient, and Enantioselective Electrophilic Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;phosphate macrocycles have been designed with an integrated chiral cavity and two cooperative phosphate sites for accommodating DABCO dications through complementary ion&#8208;pair interactions. Only 2&#8197;mol% of the macrocycle was necessary for efficiently catalyzing the fluorocyclization of tryptamines in up to 91&#8201;% ee, thus significantly outperforming the acyclic counterparts (lower reactivity; &lt;20&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Incorporation of privileged catalytic scaffolds into a macrocyclic skeleton represents an attractive strategy to furnish supramolecular catalysis systems with enzyme&#8208;mimetic cavity and multi&#8208;site cooperation. Herein we reported the synthesis, structure, binding properties and catalytic application of a series of chiral bis&#8208;phosphate macrocycles toward the challenging asymmetric electrophilic fluorination. With a large, integrated chiral cavity and two cooperative phosphate sites, these macrocycles exhibited good inclusion toward 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) dicationic ammoniums through complementary ion&#8208;pair and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions, as confirmed by crystallographic and solution binding studies. In fluorocyclization of tryptamines with Selectfluor reagent which has a similar DABCO&#8208;based dicationic structure, only 2&#8197;mol% macrocycle catalyst afforded the desired pyrroloindoline products in moderate yields and up to 91&#8201;% ee. For comparison, the acyclic mono&#8208;phosphate analogue gave obviously lower reactivity and enantioselectivity (&lt;20&#8201;% ee), suggesting a remarkable macrocyclic effect. The high catalytic efficiency and superior stereocontrol were ascribed to the tight ion&#8208;pair binding and cavity&#8208;directed noncovalent interaction cooperation.

         <title>Metal Organic Frameworks Synthesis: The Versatility of Triethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exploration of suitable synthesis strategies to meet specific needs has been a very active research topic in the field of MOFs. Triethylamine as an organic base has consistently played a fundamental role in the development of MOF syntheses. This concept summarizes the versatility of triethylamine and provides insights into further development of MOF syntheses.







Abstract
Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with exceptionally customizable composition and properties. MOFs intrinsically possess open metal sites, tunable pore size/shape and an ultra&#8208;large specific surface area, and have obtained significant attention over the past 30&#8197;years. Furthermore, through the integration of functional moieties such as, molecules, functional groups, noble metal clusters and nanocrystals or nanoparticles into MOFs, the resulting composites have greatly enriched the physical and chemical properties of pure MOFs, enabling their application in a wider range of fields. Triethylamine (TEA) as an organic base has consistently played a fundamental role in the development of MOFs. In this Concept, the versatility of triethylamine when involved in the synthesis of MOFs is discussed. Four sections are used to elaborate on the role of TEA including: (1) Single crystal synthesis; (2) Size and morphology control; (3) Counterion of MOFs; (4) MOFs composites synthesis. In the last part, we highlight the potential of TEA for further developments.

MOFs intrinsically possess open metal sites, tunable pore size/shape and an ultra-large specific surface area, and have obtained significant attention over the past 30&#8197;years. Furthermore, through the integration of functional moieties such as, molecules, functional groups, noble metal clusters and nanocrystals or nanoparticles into MOFs, the resulting composites have greatly enriched the physical and chemical properties of pure MOFs, enabling their application in a wider range of fields. Triethylamine (TEA) as an organic base has consistently played a fundamental role in the development of MOFs. In this Concept, the versatility of triethylamine when involved in the synthesis of MOFs is discussed. Four sections are used to elaborate on the role of TEA including: (1) Single crystal synthesis; (2) Size and morphology control; (3) Counterion of MOFs; (4) MOFs composites synthesis. In the last part, we highlight the potential of TEA for further developments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computational Study Into the Oxidative Ring&#8208;Closure Mechanism During the Biosynthesis of Deoxypodophyllotoxin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. Density functional theory calculations on large enzymatic cluster models of deoxypodophyllotoxin synthase shows that substrate (&#8722;)&#8208;yatein reacts efficiently through a radical reaction mechanism to form the oxidative ring&#8208;closure, while the OH rebound is prevented through electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions to the oxidant that guide the selectivity of the reaction.







Abstract
The nonheme iron dioxygenase deoxypodophyllotoxin synthase performs an oxidative ring&#8208;closure reaction as part of natural product synthesis in plants. How the enzyme enables the oxidative ring&#8208;closure reaction of (&#8722;)&#8208;yatein and avoids substrate hydroxylation remains unknown. To gain insight into the reaction mechanism and understand the details of the pathways leading to products and by&#8208;products we performed a comprehensive computational study. The work shows that substrate is bound tightly into the substrate binding pocket with the C7&#8217;&#8722;H bond closest to the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species. The reaction proceeds through a radical mechanism starting with hydrogen atom abstraction from the C7&#8217;&#8722;H position followed by ring&#8208;closure and a final hydrogen transfer to form iron(II)&#8208;water and deoxypodophyllotoxin. Alternative mechanisms including substrate hydroxylation and an electron transfer pathway were explored but found to be higher in energy. The mechanism is guided by electrostatic perturbations of charged residues in the second&#8208;coordination sphere that prevent alternative pathways.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Switchable Sensors for Hydroxide on Glass Surfaces Based on Isoquinolinium&#8208;Quinolinium&#8208;substituted Acetylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title compounds are sensitive sensors for less than 0.5&#8197;ppm hydroxide, the release of which can even be detected from high&#8208;quality wine glasses by intensive coloration. Adduct formation with O&#8208;nucleophiles is responsible for this. Acid reconstitutes the initial state.







Abstract
Bi&#8208;substituted acetylenes with a quinolinium and an isoquinolinium substituent are described, which reversibly form intensely colored adducts with O&#8208;nucleophiles and thus enable the detection of &gt;0,5&#8197;ppm hydroxide on the surfaces of various glasses. Acids reconstitute the colorless bi&#8208;substituted acetylenes. The quinolinium and isoquinolinium rings are bound via their 2&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 4&#8208; and 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 4&#8208;positions to the triple bond, respectively. The choice of substitution sites of the hetarenium rings enables the design of mixed conjugated/cross&#8208;conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems. Depending on the combination of binding sites, the frontier orbital profile, the triple bond polarization, the fluorescence behaviour, and the sensitivity to hydroxide differs.

         <title>Bi(III) Binding Stoichiometry and Domain&#8208;Specificity Differences Between Apo and Zn(II)&#8208;bound Human Metallothionein 1a</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallothionein (MT) binds a variety of metals using 20 cysteine residues. When Bi(III) binds to apo&#8208;MT, a maximum of six Bi(III) bind. The binding of Bi(III) &#8220;tangles&#8221; the protein, resulting in free but inaccessible cysteines, preventing further binding. When Bi(III) binds to Zn7MT, the formation of Bi7MT is favourable, showing that the initial MT structure impacts the metallated species formed.







Abstract
Bismuth is a xenobiotic metal with a high affinity to sulfur that is used in a variety of therapeutic applications. Bi(III) induces the cysteine&#8208;rich metallothionein (MT), a protein known to form two&#8208;domain cluster structures with certain metals such as Zn(II), Cd(II), or Cu(I). The binding of Bi(III) to MTs has been previously studied, but there are conflicting reports on the stoichiometry and binding pathway, which appear to be highly dependent on pH and initial metal&#8208;loading status of the MT. Additionally, domain specificity has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, ESI&#8208;MS was used to determine the binding constants of [Bi(EDTA)]&#8722; binding to apo&#8208;MT1a and its individual &#945;MT fragment. The results were compared to previous experiments using &#946;MT1a and &#946;&#945;MT3. Domain specificity was investigated using proteolysis methods and the initial cooperatively formed Bi2MT was found to bind to cysteines that spanned across the traditional metal binding domain regions. Titrations of [Bi(EDTA)]&#8722; into Zn7MT were performed and were found to result in a maximum stoichiometry of Bi7MT, contrasting the Bi6MT formed when [Bi(EDTA)]&#8722; was added to apo&#8208;MT. These results show that the initial structure of the apo&#8208;MT determines the stoichiometry of new incoming metals and explains the previously observed differences in stoichiometry.

         <title>NiCo&#8208;LDH coupled with 2D ZIF&#8208;derived Co nitrogen doped carbon nanosheet arrays as a self&#8208;supporting electrocatalyst for detection of formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique coupling NiCo&#8208;LDH with 2D ZIF derived Co&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon on carbon cloth (Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC) acts as a self&#8208;supporting electrode has excellent sensing performance for formaldehyde with low detection limit of 82&#8197;nM at S/N=3 and a wide linear range of 1&#8197;&#956;M to 13&#8197;mM, respectively.







Abstract
Formaldehyde is susceptible to illegal addition to foodstuffs to extend their shelf life due to its antimicrobial, preservative and bleaching properties. In this study, a self&#8208;supporting &#8220;nanosheet on nanosheet&#8221; arrays electrocatalyst with core&#8208;shell heterostructure was prepared in&#8197;situ by coupling NiCo layer double hydroxide with 2D ZIF derived Co&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon on carbon cloth (Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC). Co&#8722;N/C nanosheet arrays act as a scaffold core with good electrical conductivity, providing more NiCo&#8208;LDH nucleation sites to avoid NiCo&#8208;LDH agglomeration, thus having fast mass/charge transfer performance. While the NiCo&#8208;LDH nanosheet arrays shell with high specific surface area provide more active sites for electrochemical reactions. As an electrocatalytic sensing electrode, Co&#8722;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC has a wide linear range of 1&#8197;&#956;M to 13&#8197;mM for formaldehyde detection, and the detection limit is 82&#8197;nM. Besides, the sensor has been applied to the detection of formaldehyde in food samples with satisfactory results.

         <title>Synthesis and Isolation of a Homochiral Nanohoop Composed of a Tr&#246;ger's Base and Hexaparaphenylene</title>

         <dc:description>
A witch with a racemic pair of our nanohoops, TB[6]CPPs, chants words shown in the font of a magical world. This magic is that the chirality of Troger&#8242;s base forces paraphenylenes to become part of a circularly polarized luminescence chromophore. The spiral light bands coming out to the space indicate CPL and give the impression that our research contributes to the development of CPL chromophores, for example, of a 3D display in the near future. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Yoshigoe and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304059).

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of the Small Superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the small superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+ turned out to be a challenging task since stabilizing it in convenient superacids was not possible. Quantum chemical calculations predict a reduced C2 symmetry, yet experimental data confirms C2h symmetry in the solid state. The origin of this finding is fathomed based on X&#8208;ray structure analysis together with quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The acid&#8208;activation of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds plays a key role in a variety of electrophilic reactions, some of which are only accessible in superacidic media when a superelectrophilic dication is formed. To obtain structural and electronic information about these elusive species, the vicinal dication [C2(OH)2Me2]2+ is synthesized and characterized by Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Since this superelectrophile could not be stabilized in convenient superacids, the usage of liquid SO2 turned out to be crucial. The experimental data are discussed together with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analyses quantify the superelectrophilic interactions found in the solid state.

         <title>Socialane, a Nonaprenyl Terpene Hydrocarbon Surface Lipid from the Collembola Hypogastrura socialis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Springtails use unique compounds for their outermost epicuticular wax layer, often of terpenoid origin. We report here the structure and synthesis of socialane, the major cuticular constituent of the Collembola Hypogastrura socialis. Socialane is also the first regular nonaprenyl terpene with a cyclic head group. The saturated side chain has seven stereogenic centers, making the determination of the configuration difficult. We describe here the identification of socialane and a synthetic approach using the building blocks farnesol and phytol, enantioselective hydrogenation, and a&#8208;alkylation of sulfones for the synthesis of various stereoisomers. NMR experiments showed the presence of an anti&#8208;configuration of the methyl groups closest to the benzene ring and that the other methyl groups of the polyprenyl side&#8208;chain are not uniformly configured. Furthermore, socialane is structurally different from [6+2]&#8208;terpene viaticene of the closely related H. viatica, showing species specificity of the epicuticular lipids of this genus and hinting at a possible role of surface lipids in the communication of these gregarious arthropods.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimodal use of chiral &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib Foldamers: study of the position impact towards the helical screw&#8208;sense preference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligomers of the achiral &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) adopt a 310 helical conformation in which the screw&#8208;sense preference can be controlled by a single chiral residue. The use of the fluorinated residue &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine (&#945;&#8208;TfmAla) revealed a unique way to both induce and measure the screw&#8208;sense preference of such oligomers acting as 19F NMR probe. This work proposes a systematic study of the effect of this fluorinated chiral inducer on the helical screw&#8208;sense preference of poly&#8208;Aib oligomers. The impact of the position of the fluorinated residue into pentamers (N&#8208;terminal, central or C&#8208;terminal) as well as the nature of the C&#8208;terminal capping of the peptides was thoroughly studied in light of complete structural analysis. A deeper understanding of the fluorine effect was achieved confirming the unique ability of &#945;&#8208;TfmAla as a helical screw&#8208;sense controller.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An effective, GFP&#8208;inspired fluorescent Zn2+ sensor is developed for two&#8208;photon microscopy and related biological application that featured an 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline moiety. Excellent photophysical characteristics including a 37&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with excitation and emission maxima at 440 nm and 505&#160;nm, respectively, as well as a high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;section of 73 GM at 880 nm are reported. Based on the experimental data, the relationship between the structure and properties was elucidated and explained backed up by DFT calculations, particularly to the observed PeT phenomenon for the turn&#8208;on process. Biological validation and detailed experimental and theoretical characterization of the free and the zinc&#8208;bound compounds are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of polymer side chain size and backbone length on the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular polymer bottlebrushes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen bonds are a versatile tool for creating fibrous, bottlebrush&#8208;like assemblies of polymeric building blocks. However, a delicate balance of forces exists between the steric repulsion of the polymer chains and these directed supramolecular forces. In this work we have systematically investigated the influence of structural parameters of the attached polymers on the assembly behaviour of benzene trisurea (BTU) and benzene tris(phenylalanine) (BTP) conjugates in water. Polymers with increasing main chain lengths and different side chain sizes were prepared by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization of hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), tri(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (TEGA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (OEGA). The resulting structures were analyzed using small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both BTU and BTP formed fibres with PHEA attached, but a transition to spherical morphologies was observed at degrees of polymerisation (DP) of 70 and above. Overall, the main chain length appeared to be a dominating factor in inducing morphology transitions. Increasing the side chain size generally had a similar effect but mainly impeded any aggregation as is the case of POEGA. Interestingly, BTP conjugates still formed fibres, suggesting that the stronger intermolecular interactions can compensate partially for the steric repulsion.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Ionic Ir(III) Cyclometalated Complexes as Photocatalysts for Light Assisted ATRP of MMA. A Combined Experimental and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of ionic Ir(III) cyclometalated complexes with general formula [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)][Br], was designed and prepared to be assessed as photocalysts for the visible light assisted ATRP polymerization of MMA. To this purpose, our design strategy involved both: i) the decoration of the cyclometalating (C^N) and the ancillary (N^N) ligands with various electron withdrawing and/or electron donor substituents and, ii) the use of Br&#8208; as the counter anion for these cationic Ir(III) species. After an extensive screening in which the [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)][Br]&#8208;type compounds were compared to the model neutral complex fac&#8208;[Ir(ppy)3], the &#8220;fully&#8221; amino&#8208;substituted ion pairs abbreviated as [10][Br] and [11][Br], exhibited the best photocatalytic performances under irradiation with CFL lamps. It is worth noting that the outcomes of transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) experiments combined with theoretical DFT calculations, allowed to corroborate the role played by the Ir(III) complexes in the mechanism responsible the photoATRP process, and suggested the rationalization of the different performances that were highlighted by our Ir(III) catalyst in the visible light assisted photopolymerization of MMA.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox catalytic access to N,O&#8208;acetals from enamides by means of electron&#8208;poor perylene bisimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N,O&#8208;acetals are found as structural motif in natural products and are important synthetic precursors for N&#8208;acylimines as building blocks in organic synthesis for C&#8208;C&#8208;bond formation and amines. For the synthesis of N,O&#8208;acetals, an acid&#8208;, base&#8208; and metal&#8208;free catalytic method is reported applying N,N&#8208;di&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl)&#8208;1,7&#8208;dicyano&#8208;perylen&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid imide and N,N&#8208;di&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl)&#8208;1,6,7,12&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;2,5,8,11&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;perylen&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid imide as extremely electron&#8208;deficient photocatalysts. The first perylene bisimide highly selectively photocatalyzes the formation of the N,O&#8208;acetals as products in high yields, and the second and more electron&#8208;deficient perylene bisimide allows these reactions without thiophenol as H&#8208;atom transfer reagent. Calculated electron density maps support this. The reaction scope comprises different substituents at the nitrogen of the enamides and different alcohols as starting material. Dehydroalanines are converted to non&#8208;natural amino acids that shows the usefulness of this method for organic and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Nano&#8208;Reservoir for Room Temperature RNA Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emerging role of Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) as therapeutics is alluring. However, RNAs are extremely labile under ambient conditions and typically need to be stored in cryogenic conditions (&#8208;20 &#7506;C to &#8208;80 &#7506;C). Hence, storage, stabilization, and transportation of RNA under ambient conditions have been an arduous task and remain an unsolved problem. In this work, a guanidinium&#8208;based ionic covalent organic framework (COF), TTGCl with nanotubular morphology, was synthesized and used as nano&#8208;reservoirs for room&#8208;temperature storage of RNA. To understand the role of the nanotubular morphology and chemical nature of TTGCl in stabilizing the RNA structure and for comparison purposes, a neutral COF, TMT&#8208;TT, is synthesized and studied. Further, density functional theory (DFT) studies confirmed non&#8208;covalent interaction between the COFs and the RNA nucleobases, facilitating reversible storage of RNA. RNA loaded in COFs was found to be resistant to enzymatic degradation when treated with RNase. Gel electrophoresis and sequencing confirmed the structural integrity of the recovered RNAs and their further processibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Templated Assembly of D5h&#8208;Symmetric Pd5L10&#160;Rings by Precise Ligand Angle Adjustment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a series of Pd(II)nL2n coordination rings for which nuclearity is controlled by the binding angle of the corresponding bis&#8208;monodentate bridging ligands. Judicious choice of the angle within a family of rather rigid ligands allowed for the first&#8208;time to synthesize a homoleptic five&#8208;membered Pd5L10 ring that does not require any template to form. We demonstrate that control over the ring size is maintained both in the solid&#8208;, solution&#8208;, and gas&#8208;phase. Two X&#8208;ray structures of fivemembered rings from ligands with ideal angles (yielding a perfect pentagonal ring) vs. suboptimal angles (resulting in a highly distorted structure) illustrate the importance of the correct ligand geometry. A mathematical model for estimating the expected ring size based on the ligand angle was derived and DFT computations show that ring&#8208;strain is the major factor determining the assembly outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Ring Opening of a Tetracyclic Tetraphosphane with Twofold Metallocene Bridging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented and highly symmetric twofold bridged P4&#8208;cycle has been embedded into a tetracyclic bisferrocenophane scaffold. Selective P&#8722;P bond can be achieved giving straightforward access to well&#8208;defined linear P4&#8208;snippets of different polarity or ultimately all&#8208;trans polyphosphanes.







Abstract
A direct route to a doubly ferrocene bridged tetracyclic tetraphosphane 1 was developed via reductive coupling of Fe(CpPCl2)2 (2&#8201;a), where a chlorine terminated linear P4&#8208;compound 3 could be identified as an intermediate. Selective P&#8722;P bond activation was further achieved by reacting 1 with elemental selenium or [Cp*Al]4, where regioselective insertion of Se or Al atoms resulted in ferrocenylene bridged [P4Se] (4) or [P4Al] (7) moieties. Compound 7 can be transformed to a hydrogen terminated linear P4 species, 8, with protic solvents. Methylation of compound 1 with MeOTf, proceeds via intermediate formation of monomethylated species 5, which gradually produced Me2&#8208;terminated dicationic 6, again containing a linear P4&#8208;unit. Besides spectroscopic characterization, the structural details of compounds 1, 4, 6, and 8 could be determined by SC&#8208;XRD. Moreover, DFT calculations were used to rationalize the reactivity of 1, derived compounds and intermediates. As a key feature, 1 undergoes ring opening polymerization to a linear polyphosphane 9.

         <title>N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;DABCO Salts as an Unprecedented Sensing Platform for the Detection of Thiols and Selenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bright ring&#8208;opening! The first N&#8208;(cumarin&#8208;7&#8208;yl)&#8208;DABCO&#8208;based &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescent probe for thiols and selenols was designed and synthesized. Fluorescence intensity enhancement is achieved through the selective cleavage of the quaternized DABCO&#8208;ring, yielding the product with a high fluorescence quantum yield (~72&#8201;%). LODs for p&#8208;thiocresol and phenyl selenide are 22&#8197;nM and 6&#8197;nM respectively.







Abstract
Quaternary N&#8208;aryl&#8208;DABCO salts were introduced for the first time as a highly selective sensing platform for thiols and selenols. By employing this platform, a highly sensitive coumarin based &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescent probe was designed and synthesized. The probe possesses a good solubility in water, low background fluorescence, and, most importantly, demonstrates high selectivity to aryl thiols and selenols over their aliphatic counterparts and other common nucleophiles. A dramatic increase in fluorescence intensity is achieved through the selective cleavage of the quaternized DABCO&#8208;ring, yielding a piperazine derivatives with a high fluorescence quantum yield (~72&#8201;%). Moreover, stability of the probe to the most used reducing agents DTT and TCEP was demonstrated. The limits of detection for p&#8208;thiocresol and phenyl selenide were evaluated to be 22&#8197;nM and 6&#8197;nM, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A bright ring-opening&lt;/b&gt;! The first &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(cumarin-7-yl)-DABCO-based &#8220;off-on&#8221; fluorescent probe for thiols and selenols was designed and synthesized. Fluorescence intensity enhancement is achieved through the selective cleavage of the quaternized DABCO-ring, yielding the product with a high fluorescence quantum yield (~72&#8201;%). LODs for &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-thiocresol and phenyl selenide are 22&#8197;nM and 6&#8197;nM respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quaternary &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl-DABCO salts were introduced for the first time as a highly selective sensing platform for thiols and selenols. By employing this platform, a highly sensitive coumarin based &#8220;off-on&#8221; fluorescent probe was designed and synthesized. The probe possesses a good solubility in water, low background fluorescence, and, most importantly, demonstrates high selectivity to aryl thiols and selenols over their aliphatic counterparts and other common nucleophiles. A dramatic increase in fluorescence intensity is achieved through the selective cleavage of the quaternized DABCO-ring, yielding a piperazine derivatives with a high fluorescence quantum yield (~72&#8201;%). Moreover, stability of the probe to the most used reducing agents DTT and TCEP was demonstrated. The limits of detection for &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-thiocresol and phenyl selenide were evaluated to be 22&#8197;nM and 6&#8197;nM, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bright Fluorescent p&#8208;Phenylene&#8208;bridged Triarylmethyl Highly Stable Diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two units of highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical (PyBTM) were bridged by p&#8208;phenylene linker. The photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;f) of the diradical (1) was decreased than the PyBTM monoradical. Adding two mesityl groups on the terminals of PyBTM&#8722;PhPyBTM diradical (2) did not improve the &#934;f, but adding two n&#8208;hexyl groups on the bridging p&#8208;phenylene (3) did greatly improve it.







Abstract
Two units of highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical, (3,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)bis(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (PyBTM), were bridged by p&#8208;phenylene linker. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of PyBTM&#8722;PhPyBTM was at most 0.4&#8201;% in various organic solvents. Adding two mesityl groups on the terminals did not improve the PLQY. In the MesPyBTM&#8722;PhPyBTM&#8722;Mes, the mesityl group did not worked as an electron donor unlike the previously reported monoradical MesPyBTM. However, adding two n&#8208;hexyl groups on the bridging p&#8208;phenylene did greatly improve it, and the PLQY of the PyBTM&#8722;(Hex2Ph)PyBTM was 7&#8201;% in dichloromethane and acetone, and 12&#8201;% in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film. Twisting p&#8208;phenylene linker by hexyl groups hindered the &#960;&#8208;conjugation and suppressed the non&#8208;radiative decay of the excited state.

This review examines mono&#8208;alkylation methodologies targeting key nitrogen moieties in organic building blocks and pharmaceuticals. Focusing on chemical precision in drug discovery, it addresses challenges in achieving one&#8208;pot mono&#8208;selective N&#8208;alkylations, emphasizing sustainable alternatives to traditional alkylating agents. Categorized by alkylating agent type, the review guides researchers in selecting suitable methods for mono&#8208;selective N&#8208;alkylation.







Abstract
This review provides a comprehensive overview of mono&#8208;alkylation methodologies targeting crucial nitrogen moieties &#8211; amines, amides, and sulfonamides &#8211; found in organic building blocks and pharmaceuticals. Emphasizing the intersection of chemical precision with drug discovery, the central challenge addressed is achieving one&#8208;pot mono&#8208;selective short&#8208;chain N&#8208;alkylations (methylations, ethylations, and n&#8208;propylations), preventing undesired overalkylation. Additionally, sustainable, safe, and benign alternatives to traditional alkylating agents, including alcohols, carbon dioxide, carboxylic acids, nitriles, alkyl phosphates, quaternary ammonium salts, and alkyl carbonates, are explored. This review, categorized by the nature of the alkylating agent, aids researchers in selecting suitable methods for mono&#8208;selective N&#8208;alkylation.

         <title>Electronic Structure Analysis of the A10Tt2P6 System (A=Li&#8722;Cs; Tt=Si, Ge, Sn) and Synthesis of the Direct Band Gap Semiconductor K10Sn2P6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From observation via DFT calculations to synthesis: The temperature dependent stability of the two isomeric structures of A10Tt2P6 (A=Li&#8722;Cs; Tt=Si&#8722;Sn) comprising ether trigonal planar TtP35&#8722; units or the dimerization product [Tt2P6]10&#8722; are calculated. Subsequently the crystal structure of K10Sn2P6 with [Sn2P6]10&#8722; dimers is predicted and synthesized accordingly. Further on property calculations reveal why compounds prefer one structure over the other.







Abstract
Investigating the relationship between atomic and electronic structures is a powerful tool to screen the wide variety of Zintl phases for interesting (opto&#8722;)electronic properties. To get an insight in such relations, the A10Tt2P6 system (A=Li&#8722;Cs; Tt=Si&#8722;Sn) was picked as model system to analyse the influence of structural motives, combination of elements and their properties on type and width of the band gaps. Those compounds comprise two interesting structural motives of their anions, which are either monomeric trigonal planar TtP35&#8722; units which are isostructural to CO32&#8722; or [Tt2P6]10&#8722; dimers which correspond to two edge&#8208;sharing TtP4 tetrahedra. The A10Tt2P6 compounds were structurally optimized for both polymorphs and subsequent frequency analysis, band structure as well as density of states calculations were performed. The Gibbs free energies were compared to determine temperature dependent stability, where Na10Si2P6, Na10Ge2P6 and K10Sn2P6 were found to be candidates for a high temperature phase transition between the two polymorphs. Additionally, the unknown, but predicted compound K10Sn2P6 was synthesized and characterized by single crystal and powder x&#8208;ray diffraction. It crystalizes in the monoclinic space group P 21/n and incorporates [Sn2P6]10&#8722; edge sharing double tetrahedra. It was determined to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.57&#8197;eV.

The Gibbs free energies were compared to determine temperature dependent stability, where Na&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, Na&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; were found to be candidates for a high temperature phase transition between the two polymorphs. Additionally, the unknown, but predicted compound K&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; was synthesized and characterized by single crystal and powder x-ray diffraction. It crystalizes in the monoclinic space group &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; 2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; and incorporates [Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;10&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; edge sharing double tetrahedra. It was determined to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.57&#8197;eV.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Stable Self&#8208;Regenerating Organic Multi&#8208;Redox Systems derived from Bicyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes (BICAACs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An extended class of organic multi&#8208;redox systems was derived from bicyclic(alkyl)amino carbenes (BICAACs).&#160;The highly&#8208;conjugated system undergoes a total of 4 redox events spanning a 1.8 V redox range.&#160;These organic compounds exhibited four different stable redox states (dication, radical cation, neutral and radical anion), and all of them were characterized either by single crystal X&#8208;ray study and/or various spectroscopic studies.&#160;Three of the four redox states are stable to air and moisture.&#160;The availability of stable multiple redox states demonstrated promise towards their efficacy in the symmetric H&#8208;cell charge/discharge cycling. Among various redox states, the dication/neutral state works efficiently and continuously for 1500 cycles in 2e&#8208;&#160;charge/discharge process outside glovebox in commercially available DMF with minimum capacity loss (retaining nearly 90% Coulombic efficiency). Surprisingly, the efficiency of the redox cycle was retained even if the system was exposed to air for 30 days when it slowly regenerated to the initial deep blue radical cation, and it exhibited another 100 charge/discharge cycles with a minimal capacity loss.&#160;Such a stable H&#8208;cell cycling ability is not well known among organic molecule&#8208;based systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Prism[2]dihydrophenazines: Synthesis, Configurational Analysis, and Supramolecular Tessellation through Exo&#8208;Wall Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic arenes have gained considerable attention for their structural diversity and widespread applications. In this research, a new kind of macrocyclic arenes, namely prism[2]dihydrophenazine&#160;(anti&#8208;P2P20, syn&#8208;P2P20, and P2P22), composed of two dihydrophenazine derivatives&#160;subunits bridged by methylene groups, were conveniently synthesized by AlCl3&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot condensation in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. Both anti&#8208;P2P20 and its isomer syn&#8208;P2P20 exhibited flexible and convertible conformation with narrow cavity, while P2P22 possessed rigid and rhombic&#8208;like skeleton due to the more steric hindrance on subunits. In addition, the selection of electron&#8208;deficient guest was found to influence the outside binding behavior of syn&#8208;P2P20. Fantastic regular supramolecular tessellation was fabricated&#160;by tiling of syn&#8208;P2P20 with tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TFB) through the exo&#8208;wall interactions. Using 1,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene (DFN) as a linker, only the regular 2D network superstructure with periodic units in a plane was obtained through cocrystallization. This work not only reports the construction of supramolecular tessellations by using prism[2]dihydrophenazines as building blocks, but also provides a new perspective for the design of macrocyclic arenes and fabrication of 2D supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>N,N&#8217;&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;Sulfurdiimides Are Strongly Redox Tuned</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and extensive characterization of nine aryl sulfur diimides (SDIs, Ar&#8208;NSN&#8208;Ar) are presented with a robust computational and experimental investigation of the fundamental properties of these important members of the thiazyl family of compounds, with particular attention paid to their highly tunable electrochemical behaviour. This is the first work to undertake a systematic comparison of the electrochemical profiles of a coherent series of SDIs to demonstrate and quantify the response of their reduction potentials to substituent electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing properties. This effect is found to be not only exceptionally strong, but also correlates very closely with computed orbital energies. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to determine the nature, localization, and qualitative lifetimes of the radical anions of SDIs. This work also addresses significant misconceptions about physical properties of SDIs. Experimental data and modern computational methods are employed to provide a resolute answer to the long&#8208;standing contention of the solution&#8208;state conformations of SDIs, and to correct historical mistakes in the assignment of infrared spectroscopic data. High&#8208;quality crystal structures of all SDIs in this work showcase the utility of the recently introduced structural refinement software NoSpherA2, enabling full anisotropic refinement of H&#8208;atoms with accurate C&#8208;H bond lengths.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ confining selenium within bubble &#8211; like carbon nanoshells for ultra&#8208;stable Li&#8722;Se batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel &#8220;top&#8211;down&#8221; approach to in&#8211;situ confine Se within bubble&#8211;like carbon frameworks to minimize the shuttle effect and volume expansion of Se cathode in Li&#8208;Se batteries. The resultant Se@void@BLNC shows a unique half&#8208;filled core&#8208;shell structure than ensures an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of almost 100% capacity reservation during 4000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;selenium (Li&#8722;Se) batteries are promising energy storage devices. However, the long&#8208;term durability and high&#8208;rate performance of the Se cathode have been limited by significant volume expansion and the troublesome shuttle effect of polyselenides during repeated charging/discharging processes. To revolutionize these issues, we applied a top&#8208;down strategy through the in&#8208;situ trapping of amorphous Se within bubble&#8208;like carbon (BLC) frameworks, which can radically minimize the presence of surface&#8208;absorbed Se while enhancing Se loading capacity. This ingenious technique successfully encapsulates all Se species within carbon nanoshells, creating a distinct half&#8208;filled core&#8208;shell structure known as Se@void@BLC. This in&#8208;situ trapping approach ensures the efficient management of Se volume changes during repeated discharge and charge cycles. Moreover, an extraordinary Se loading capacity of up to 65.6&#8197;wt% is reached. Using the Se@void@BLC as cathode for Li&#8722;Se battery, we achieve a high initial Columbic efficiency of 84.2&#8201;%, a high reversible capacity of 585&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and an ultralow capacity decay of only 0.0037&#8201;% per cycle during 4000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-selenium (Li&#8722;Se) batteries are promising energy storage devices. However, the long-term durability and high-rate performance of the Se cathode have been limited by significant volume expansion and the troublesome shuttle effect of polyselenides during repeated charging/discharging processes. To revolutionize these issues, we applied a top-down strategy through the &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; trapping of amorphous Se within bubble-like carbon (BLC) frameworks, which can radically minimize the presence of surface-absorbed Se while enhancing Se loading capacity. This ingenious technique successfully encapsulates all Se species within carbon nanoshells, creating a distinct half-filled core-shell structure known as Se@void@BLC. This &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; trapping approach ensures the efficient management of Se volume changes during repeated discharge and charge cycles. Moreover, an extraordinary Se loading capacity of up to 65.6&#8197;wt% is reached. Using the Se@void@BLC as cathode for Li&#8722;Se battery, we achieve a high initial Columbic efficiency of 84.2&#8201;%, a high reversible capacity of 585&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and an ultralow capacity decay of only 0.0037&#8201;% per cycle during 4000 cycles at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the Inorganic Core of a reduced Ni2Ge2 Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclose convenient synthetic strategies to access highly reduced Ni2Ge2 inorganic square&#8208;type cores, identified as key motifs in catalysis. We demonstrate that the structure and bonding within the metallic core can be transformed by the addition of common Lewis bases, providing as well computational insights that will aid in the rationale preparation of these unusual clusters.







Abstract
Tetranuclear cores (M&#8722;E)2 of transition metals (M) and tetrylenes (EII=Si, Ge, Sn) are key motifs in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. They exhibit a continuum of M&#8722;M and E&#8722;E bonding within the inorganic core that leads to a variety of structures for which there are no specific synthetic methods. Herein, we report a series of highly reduced [Ni0GeII]2 squares solely stabilized by bulky terphenyl (C6H3&#8722;2,6&#8208;Ar2) ligands, for which we provide complementary and high&#8208;yielding syntheses. Reactivity studies with common Lewis bases (carbene and CO) evince that the structure of the (M&#8722;E)2 core can be transformed. We have investigated this core modification by computational means, offering a rationale to better understand the continuum of bonding across these clusters.

         <title>Each Interruption Is an Opportunity: Novel Synthetic Strategies Explored through Interrupted Click Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemistry professor explains the mechanism of the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8211;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) while suggesting that by interrupting the click reaction, it is possible to exploit the reactivity of the copper metallacycle intermediate to synthesize new products. The students who are listening are imagining novel synthetic pathways and finding ways to access products that are typically hard to obtain. More information can be found in the Review by M. Giustiniano, G.&#8197;C. Tron and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303844).

         <dc:description>Here, we combined magnetometry, multi&#8208;frequency electronic paramagnetic resonance, and wave function based ab initio calculations to investigate magnetic properties of two high spin Co(II) complexes Co(BDPRP) (BDPRP = 2,6&#8208;bis((2&#8208;(S)&#8208;di(4&#8208;R)phenylhydroxylmethyl&#8208;1&#8208;pyrrolidinyl)methyl)pyridine) complexes (R = H for 8; R = tBu for 9). Complexes 8 and 9 featuring effective D3h symmetry were found to possess D = 24.0 and 32.0 cm&#8211;1, respectively, in their S = 3/2 ground states of . Ligand field analyses revealed that the low&#8208;lying d&#8208;d excited states make either positive or vanishing contributions to D. Hence, total positive D values were measured for 8 and 9, as well as related D3h high spin Co(II) complexes.
In contrast, negative D values are usually observed for C3v congeners. In&#8208;depth analyses suggested that lowering symmetry from D3h to C3v induces orbital mixing between &#160;and &#160;and admixes excited state &#160;into the ground state. Both factors turn the total D value progressively negative with the increasing distance (&#948;) of the Co(II) out of the equatorial plane. Therefore, &#948; determines the sign and magnitude of final D values of five&#8208;coordinate trigonal bipyramidal S = 3/2 Co(II) complexes as measured for a series of such species with varying &#948;.</dc:description>

         <title>Cavity Catalysis of an Enantioselective Reaction under Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong light&#8208;matter interaction is emerging as an exciting tool for controlling chemical reactions. Here, we demonstrate an L&#8208;proline&#8208;catalyzed direct asymmetric Aldol reaction under vibrational strong coupling. Both the reactants (4&#8208;nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone) carbonyl bands are coupled to an infrared photon and react in the presence of L&#8208;proline. The reaction mixture is eluted from the cavity, and the conversion yields and enantiomeric excess are quantified using NMR and chiral HPLC. The conversion yields increase by up to 90% in ON&#8208;resonance conditions. Interestingly, a large increase in the conversion yield does not affect the enantiomeric excess. Further control experiments were carried out by varying the temperature, and we propose that the rate&#8208;limiting step may not be the deciding factor in enantioselectivity. Whereas the formation of the enamine intermediate is modified by cavity coupling experiments. For this class of enantioselective reactions, strong coupling does not change the enantiomeric excess, possibly due to the large energy difference in chiral transition states. Strong coupling can boost the formation of enamine intermediate, thereby favouring the product yield. This gives more hope to test polaritonic chemistry based on enantioselective reactions in which the branching ratios can be controlled.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced adhesive and mechanically robust silicone&#8208;based coating with excellent marine anti&#8208;fouling and anti&#8208;corrosion performances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Condensation polymerization is utilized to prepare PDMS&#8208;based polythiamine ester (PTUBAF) coatings that consist of PDMS, polytetrahydrofuran (PTMG), 2, 3, 5, 6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;1, 4&#8208;benzenedimethanol (TBD) as the main chains and isobornyl acrylate(IBA) as the antifouling group. The strong synergistic effect of bactericidal groups and low surface energy surface endows the PTUBAF coating with outstanding antifouling and excellent anti&#8208;corrosion performance.







Abstract
Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is widely used in marine antifouling coatings due to its low surface energy property. However, certain drawbacks of PDMS coatings such as poor surface adhesion, weak mechanical properties, and inadequate static antifouling performance have hindered its practical applications. Herein, condensation polymerization is utilized to prepare PDMS&#8208;based polythiamine ester (PTUBAF) coatings that consist of PDMS, polytetrahydrofuran (PTMG), 2, 3, 5, 6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;1, 4&#8208;benzenedimethanol (TBD) as the main chains and isobornyl acrylate(IBA) as the antifouling group. The surface adhesion to the substrate is enhanced due to the hydrogen bond between the coated carbamate group and the hydroxyl group on the surface of the substrate. Mechanical properties of PTUBAF are significantly improved due to the benzene ring and six&#8208;membered ring biphase hard structure. The strong synergistic effect of bactericidal groups and low surface energy surface endows the PTUBAF coating with outstanding antifouling performance. Due to the low surface energy surface, the PTUBAF coatings are also found to possess excellent anti&#8208;corrosion. Furthermore, since the PTUBAF coatings exhibit a visible light transmittance of 91&#8201;%, they can applied as protective films for smartphones. The proposed method has the potential to boost the production and practical applications of silicone&#8208;based coatings.

Due to the low surface energy surface, the PTUBAF coatings are also found to possess excellent anti-corrosion. Furthermore, since the PTUBAF coatings exhibit a visible light transmittance of 91&#8201;%, they can applied as protective films for smartphones. The proposed method has the potential to boost the production and practical applications of silicone-based coatings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ge anode is one of the promising candidates to replace the traditional graphite anode material for high&#8208;performance binder&#8208;free lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The enlarged surface area and the shorted ions/electrons transporting path length of the 3D electrode would greatly facilitate the rapid transfer of abundant lithium ions during cycling, thus achieve enhanced energy and power density during cycling. Cycle stability of the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge electrode would also be improved due to the obtained enough space could effectively accommodate the large volume expansion of the Ge anode. In this review, we first describe the electrochemical properties and Li ions storage mechanism of Ge anode. Moreover, the recent advances in the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge anode architectures design are majorly illustrated and discussed. Challenges and prospects of the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge electrode are finally provided, which shed light on ways to design more reliable 3D Ge&#8208;based electrodes in energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Investigation of a Soluble Distannene with no Trans&#8208;Bent Angle or Twisting in the Solid&#8208;State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn2(TIPS)4 is the second distannene with a planar, alkene&#8208;like arrangement of substituents. In the solid state it shows exciting behaviour in M&#246;ssbauer studies and interesting cycloaddition reactions in solution.







Abstract
By treating KSiiPr3 with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 the distannene Sn2(TIPS)4 (TIPS=SiiPr3) is formed in a metathesis reaction. The crystal structure analysis of Sn2(TIPS)4 reveals a planar arrangement of the substituents in the solid&#8208;state and hence the second planar alkene like distannene of its kind. Due to the TIPS substituents, Sn2(TIPS)4 is well soluble in all commonly used organic solvents, opening the door for various analytics and reactivity studies. Due to its stability in solution, various reactions can be performed such as cycloaddition reactions with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (DMBD) and TMS&#8208;azide.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Neutral Multicatalytic Cerium Photoredox&#8208;Enabled Cleavage of O&#8211;H Bearing Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The need for synthetic methodologies capable of rapidly altering molecular structure are in high demand. Most existing methods to modify scaffolds rely on net exothermicity to drive the desired transformation. We sought to develop a general strategy for the cleavage of C&#8211;C bonds&#160;b&#160;to hydroxyl groups independent of inherent substrate strain. To this end we have applied a multicatalytic cerium photoredox&#8208;based system capable of activating O&#8211;H bonds in lactols&#160;&#160;to deliver formate esters. The same system is also capable of effecting hydrodecarboxylation and hydrodecarbonylation reactions. Initial mechanistic probes demonstrate atomic chlorine (Cl&#8226;) is generated under the reaction conditions, but substrate activation through cerium&#8208;alkoxides or &#8208;carboxylates cannot be ruled out.</dc:description>

One&#8208;electron oxidation of 3a,b yields the corresponding radical cation [(NHC)(Stil)NHC)]B(C6F5)4 4a,b. The accessibility of 3a&#8208;c and 4a,b corroborates well with the cyclic voltammograms of 2a&#8208;c. All compounds have been characterized by UV&#8208;Vis/NMR/EPR spectroscopy as well as 2a, 3a, and 3b by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Ligand Centered Reactivity of a Transition Metal Bound Geometrically Constrained Phosphine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic properties, coordination chemistry and reactivity of metal complexes of a planar (C2v symmetric) acridane&#8208;derived geometrically constrained phosphine, P(NNN), are described. On complexation to metal centers, the phosphine was found to adopt a distorted trigonal pyramidal structure with a high barrier to pyramidal inversion (22.3 kcal/mol at 298 K for Au[P(NNN)]Cl). Spectroscopic data and theoretical calculations carried out at the density functional level of theory indicate that P(NNN) is a moderate &#963;&#8208;donor, with significant &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties. Despite the distortion undergone by the phosphorus atom on coordination to metal centers, the P(NNN) ligand retains its ability to react with small molecule substrates with polar E&#8211;H bonds (MeOH, NH2Ph, NH3). It does so in a concerted fashion across one of the P&#8211;N bonds, and reversibly in the case of amine substrates. This cooperative bond activation chemistry may ultimately prove beneficial in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>First Potassium Fluoroaluminate Ionic Exchanger for Rapid and Selective Removal of Sr2+ with High Capacity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>90Sr, as a typical artificial radionuclide, poses a serious threat to human health and the ecological environment. The selective removal of this radionuclide from industrial nuclear waste is very necessary for our environment. Here we report a novel potassium fluoroaluminate, K2[(AlF5)H2O], which was synthesized by a simple low&#8208;temperature one&#8208;step method. It adopts a 1D AlF6&#8208;chain structure, which consists of exchangeable potassium ions in between the infinite chains of octahedral Al centers. As a remarkable inorganic ionic exchanger, K2[(AlF5)H2O] has a high chemical stability (resistance of pH= ~3&#8208;12) and thermal stability. It possesses an excellent adsorption selectivity (Kd=~6.1&#215;104 mL&#183;g&#8722;1) and a maximum adsorption capacity of qm= ~120.32 mg&#183;g&#8722;1 for Sr2+. Importantly, it still keep a very good selectivity for Sr2+ ions even in the presence of competing Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ aqueous solutions. K2[(AlF5)H2O] is the first example of fluoroaluminate ionic exchange materials that can capture Sr2+. This result opens up a new way to design and synthesize inorganic ionic exchangers for the selective removal of Sr2+ ions from radioactive waste water.</dc:description>

This result opens up a new way to design and synthesize inorganic ionic exchangers for the selective removal of Sr2+ ions from radioactive waste water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>New chiral ligands could be obtained by introducing proline moieties and imidazoline moieties to binaphthyl skeletons. The chiral ligands exhibited balanced rigidity and flexibility which could allow the change of the conformations during the reactions on one hand, and could provide sufficient asymmetric induction on the other. The proline moiety could act as a linker connecting the binaphthyl skeletons and the imidazoline moieties as well as a coordinating group for the central metal, and the electronic and steric properties of the imidazoline groups could be carefully fine&#8208;tuned by the use of different substituents. In the presence of Cu(II) catalyst bearing such chiral ligands, aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of 1&#8208;naphthols and electron&#8208;rich phenols with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines provided the desired products with good to excellent yields and up to 99% ee.

         <title>Bending a Cumulene with Electrons: Stepwise Chemical Reduction and Structural Study of a Tetraaryl[4]Cumulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reduction of a [4]cumulene with cesium metal was explored, and the structural changes stemming from electron acquisition are detailed using X&#8208;ray crystallography. It is found that the [4]cumulene undergoes dramatic geometric changes upon stepwise reduction, including bending of the cumulenic core and twisting of the endgroups from orthogonal to planar. The structural deformation is consistent with early theoretical reports&#160; that suggests that the twisting should occur upon reduction of both even and odd [n]cumulenes. The current results, on the other hand, are inconsistent with a previous experimental study of a [3]cumulene in which the predicted twisting is not observed upon reduction . DFT computations help to reveal that the barrier to deformation was significantly lower in a [3]cumulene than a [4]cumulene, allowing the barrier to be overcome in the solid&#8208;state.</dc:description>

         <title>A Study on Auto&#8208;Catalysis and Product Inhibition: A Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution Reaction Catalysed within the Cavity of an Octanuclear Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of an octanuclear cubic coordination cage to catalyse a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction on a cavity&#8208;bound guest was studied with 2,4&#8208;dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) as the guest/substrate. It was found that DNFB undergoes a catalysed reaction with hydroxide ions within the cavity of the cubic cage (in aqueous buffer solution, pH 8.6). The rate enhancement of kcat/kuncat was determined to be 23, with cavity binding of the guest being required for catalysis to occur. The product, 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenolate (DNP), remained bound within the cavity due to electrostatic stabilisation and exerts two apparently contradictory effects: it initially auto&#8208;catalyses the reaction when present at low concentrations, but at higher concentrations inhibits catalysis when a pair of DNP guests block the cavity. When encapsulated, the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of DNP is red&#8208;shifted when compared to the spectrum of free DNP in aqueous solution. Further investigations using other aromatic guests determined that a similar red&#8208;shift on cavity binding also occurred for 4&#8208;nitrophenolate (4NP) at pH 8.6. The red&#8208;shift was used to determine the stoichiometry of guest binding of DNP and 4NP within the cage cavity, which was confirmed by structural analysis with X&#8208;ray crystallography; and also used to perform catalytic kinetic studies in the solution&#8208;state.</dc:description>

         <title>3,4&#8208;Dimethylenecyclobutene: A Building Block for Design of Macrocycles with Excited State Aromatic Low&#8208;Lying High&#8208;Spin States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3,4&#8208;Dimethylenecyclobutene (DMCB) is an unusual isomer of benzene. Motivated by recent synthetic progress to substituted derivatives of this scaffold, we carried out a theoretical and computational analysis with a particular focus on the extent of (anti)aromatic character in the lowest excited states of different multiplicities. We found that the parent DMCB is non&#8208;aromatic in its singlet ground state (S0), lowest triplet state (T1), and lowest singlet excited state (S1), while it is aromatic in its lowest quintet state (Q1) as this state is represented by a triplet multiplicity cyclobutadiene (CBD) ring and two uncoupled same&#8208;spin methylene radicals. Interestingly, the Q1 state, despite having four unpaired electrons, is placed merely 4.8 eV above S0, and there is a corresponding singlet tetraradical 0.16 eV above. The DMCB is potentially a highly useful structural motif for the design of larger molecular entities with interesting optoelectronic properties. Here, we designed macrocycles composed of fused DMCB units, and according to our computations, two of these have low&#8208;lying nonet states (i.e., octaradical states) at energies merely 2.40 and 0.37 eV above their S0 states as a result of local H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;aromatic character of individual 6&#960;&#8208; and 4&#960;&#8208;electron monocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Transformations for the Construction of All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of asymmetric carbene reactions for the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary center have been summarized: 1) using carbene species as a 1C synthon that reacts with a trisubstituted prochiral center; 2) sequential installation of two different C&#8722;C bonds on the carbene position, which features a gem&#8208;difunctionalization process.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic carbene reactions have been well documented in the last few decades for the expeditious assembly of chiral molecules with structural diversity. However, the enantioselective construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers remains a challenge in this area. In this review article, two types of asymmetric carbene reactions that beyond cyclopropanation, cyclopropenation, and B&#252;chner reaction, have been summarized for the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers: 1) using carbene species as a 1C synthon that reacts with a trisubstituted prochiral center; 2) sequential installation of two different C&#8722;C bonds on the carbene position, which features a gem&#8208;difunctionalization reaction. Especially, the asymmetric metal carbene gem&#8208;dialkylation process, which has emerged as a practical and versatile method for the expeditious assembly of complex architectures from readily available chemical resources, is a complementary approach for the expeditious assembly of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers.

         <title>Electropolymerization of Preferred&#8208;Oriented Conjugated Microporous Polymer Films for Enhanced Fluorescent Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides the effective construction of CMP 3D composite films (pZn/PTPCz) with a controlled porosity structure and preferred orientation using the template&#8208;assisted electropolymerization (EP) approach for the first time. When compared to the control CMP film made on flat substrates, the as&#8208;prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive.







Abstract
High&#8208;quality conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films with orientation and controlled structure are extremely desired for applications. Here, we report the effective construction of CMP 3D composite films (pZn/PTPCz) with a controlled porosity structure and preferred orientation using the template&#8208;assisted electropolymerization (EP) approach for the first time. The structure of pZn/PTPCz composite thin films and nitrophenol sensing performance were thoroughly studied. When compared to the control CMP film made on flat indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, the as&#8208;prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive. This was attributed to the metal&#8208;enhanced fluorescence (MEF) of porous nanostructured zinc (pZn) and the additional macroporosity of the pZn/PTPCz composite films. This work provides a feasible approach for creating oriented 3D CMP&#8208;based thin films for advanced applications.

When compared to the control CMP film made on flat substrates, the as-prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-quality conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) films with orientation and controlled structure are extremely desired for applications. Here, we report the effective construction of CMP 3D composite films (pZn/PTPCz) with a controlled porosity structure and preferred orientation using the template-assisted electropolymerization (EP) approach for the first time. The structure of pZn/PTPCz composite thin films and nitrophenol sensing performance were thoroughly studied. When compared to the control CMP film made on flat indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, the as-prepared pZn/PTPCz composite films showed significantly enhanced fluorescent intensity and much better sensing performance for the model explosive. This was attributed to the metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) of porous nanostructured zinc (pZn) and the additional macroporosity of the pZn/PTPCz composite films. This work provides a feasible approach for creating oriented 3D CMP-based thin films for advanced applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Triplet Energy Transfer Mechanism in Copper Photocatalytic N&#8208; and O&#8208;Methylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the photochemical energy transfer mechanism of hypervalent iodine reagents. When coupled to copper catalysis we achieved successful methylation of a diverse set of N&#8208;heterocycles and (hetero&#8722;)aromatic carboxylic acids. In addition, we could show application of this methodology to more complex active pharmaceutical intermediates. Mechanistic investigations support our observations and provide the basis for future developments.







Abstract
Methylation reactions are chemically simple but challenging to perform under mild and non&#8208;toxic conditions. A photochemical energy transfer strategy was merged with copper catalysis to enable fast reaction times of minutes and broad applicability to N&#8208;heterocycles, (hetero&#8722;)aromatic carboxylic acids, and drug&#8208;like molecules in high yields and good functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic investigations, using kinetic analysis, aprotic MS, UV/Vis, and luminescence quenching experiments revealed a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanism between hypervalent iodine(III) reagents and readily available photosensitizers.

Abstract
Four donor&#8208;acceptor boron difluoride complexes based on the carbazole electron donor and the [1,3,5,2]oxadiazaborinino[3,4&#8208;a][1,8]naphthyridine acceptor were designed, synthesized, and systematically spectroscopically investigated in solutions, in dye&#8208;doped polymer films, and in the solid states. The dyes exhibit an intense blue to red solid&#8208;state emission with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 59&#8201;% in pure dye samples and 86&#8201;% in poly(methyl methacrylate) films. All boron complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and reversible mechanofluorochromism. The optical properties of these dyes and their solid state luminescence can be tuned by substitution pattern, i.&#8201;e., the substituents at the naphthyridine unit. Exchange of CH3&#8208; for CF3&#8208;groups does not only increase the intramolecular charge transfer character, but also provides a crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Synthesis of B&#8592;N Adducts by the Amine&#8208;Facilitated Trimerization of the Phenylboronic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical synthesis of boroxine&#8208;amine adducts was monitored by in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and ex&#8208;situ PXRD. Amine is exchanged in 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts by a stronger amine. Experimental and DFT data show that both 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 adducts (with same or different amines) form if pKa(amine)&gt;8, that was evidenced by the first crystal structure with two different amines (DMAP and piperidine) bound to one boroxine.







Abstract
Stable boroxine&#8208;amine adducts comprising dative B&#8592;N bond(s) were prepared by mechanochemically&#8208;induced reactions of phenylboronic acid (PBA) and amines (pyridine, DMAP, 1H&#8208;pyrazole, piperidine, DABCO, hexamethylenetetramine, or 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine). In&#8208;situ Raman monitoring, ex&#8208;situ PXRD and DFT calculations were used for product identification. Stoichiometry of the product (3&#8201;:&#8201;1, 3&#8201;:&#8201;2 or 6&#8201;:&#8201;1 adduct) was controlled by the amine structure and the molar ratio of the reactants. The 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 H&#8208;bonded assembly of PBA and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) was confirmed as an intermediate in the adduct formation for bpy. Competitive binding experiments indicated that the exchange of the amines in the 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts follows the computed adduct stabilities that increase with the amine basicity. Following the DFT prediction, the first adduct with two different amines, DMAP and pip, bound to one boroxine moiety was isolated and structurally characterized. Results show that calculations can be used to predict possible and preferred product(s) and their spectral characteristics.

         <title>Spiropyran&#8208;Based Photoisomerizable &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid for Membrane&#8208;Active Peptide Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiropyran&#8208;derived &#945;&#8208;amino acid was carefully designed for the synthesis of photocontrollable bioactive peptides. Dramatic changes in structure and polarity occurring upon light exposure or dark adaptation of the spiropyran side chain can cause changes in the behavior of peptides in lipid membranes and living cells, as demonstrated on spiropyran&#8208;containing analogs of the membrane&#8208;active peptide BP100 (KKLFKKILKYL&#8208;NH2).







Abstract
Photoisomerizable peptides are promising drug candidates in photopharmacology. While azobenzene&#8208; and diarylethene&#8208;containing photoisomerizable peptides have already demonstrated their potential in this regard, reports on the use of spiropyrans to photoregulate bioactive peptides are still scarce. This work focuses on the design and synthesis of a spiropyran&#8208;derived amino acid, (S)&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(6'&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1',3',3'&#8208;trimethylspiro&#8208;[2H&#8208;1&#8208;benzopyran&#8208;2,2'&#8208;indolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl])propanoic acid, which is suitable for the preparation of photoisomerizable peptides. The utility of this amino acid is demonstrated by incorporating it into the backbone of BP100, a known membrane&#8208;active peptide, and by examining the photoregulation of the membrane perturbation by the spiropyran&#8208;containing peptides. The toxicity of the peptides (against the plant cell line BY&#8208;2), their bacteriotoxicity (E.&#8197;coli), and actin&#8211;auxin oscillator modulation ability were shown to be significantly dependent on the photoisomeric state of the spiropyran unit.

         <dc:description>
Hydrolytically stable palladium and platinum diaminocarbene complexes exhibit nanomolar antiproliferative activity and high selectivity for triple&#8208;negative breast cancer. Our lead drug candidate surpasses cisplatin by 300 times in vitro and exhibits superior efficacy in reducing the growth of aggressive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft tumors in mice. The critical role of interference with metabolic processes and redox homeostasis in achieving excellent selectivity for cancer cells is demonstrated.







Abstract
Hydrolytically stable PdII and PtII complexes supported by acyclic diaminocarbene ligands represent a novel class of structural organometallic anticancer agents exhibiting nanomolar antiproliferative activity in a panel of cancer cell lines (IC50 0.07&#8211;0.81&#8197;&#956;M) and up to 300&#8208;fold selectivity for cancer cells over normal primary fibroblasts. The lead drug candidate was 300 times more potent than cisplatin in&#8197;vitro and showed higher efficacy in reducing the growth of aggressive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft tumors in mice.

Hydrogen thermal reduction process removed oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups on the surface of Super&#8197;P, thereby weakening interface side reactions with sulfide benefits Li&#8208;ion migration. Only 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% reduced Super&#8197;P based ASSLBs exhibited better reversible capacity of 180.2&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and high capacity retention of 81.8&#8201;% after 40&#8197;cycles, and 130.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 64.6&#8201;% for Super&#8197;P.







Abstract
Conductive additives are of great importance for the adequate utilization of active materials in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries by establishing conductive networks in the composite cathode. However, it usually causes severe interfacial side reactions with solid electrolytes, especially sulfide electrolytes, leading to sluggish ion transportation and accelerated performance degradation. Herein, a simple hydrogen thermal reduction process is proposed on a commonly used conductive additive Super&#8197;P, which effectively removes the surface oxygen functional groups and weakens the interfacial side reactions with sulfide. With a small amount of 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% reduced Super&#8197;P, ASSLBs demonstrates a competitive capacity of 180.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is much higher than the 130.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 of untreated Super&#8197;P. Impressively, reduced Super&#8197;P based ASSLBs also exhibit a higher capacity retention of 81.8&#8201;% than 64.6&#8201;% of untreated Super&#8197;P. The cathode interfacial chemical evolutions reveal that reduced Super&#8197;P could effectively alleviate the side reactions of sulfide. Reduced Super&#8197;P shows better reversible capacity compared to reduced carbon nanofiber with almost no loss of capacity retention, due to its more complete conductive network. Our results highlight the importance of oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups for conductive additives, lightening the prospect of low&#8208;cost 0D conductive additives for practical ASSLBs.

         <title>NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;Phenalenyls: the Yin and Yang of Heteroatom&#8208;doped&#160;&#960; Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;doped phenalenyls are isoelectronic to phenalenyl anions and cations, respectively. They represent a pair of complementary molecules that have essentially identical structures but opposite properties as electron donors and acceptors. The NBN&#8208;phenalenyls 1&#8722;4 considered here were prepared from N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene and readily available boron&#8208;containing building blocks (i.e., BH3&#8729;SMe2 (1), p&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4B(OH)2 (2), C6H5B(OH)2 (3), or MesBCl2/iPr2NEt (4)). Treatment of 1 with 4&#8208;Me2N&#8208;2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;C6H2Li gave the corresponding NBN derivative 5. The BNB&#8208;phenalenyl 6 was synthesized from 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediyl&#8208;bridged diborane(6), PhNH2, and MesMgBr. A computational study reveals that the photoemission of 1, 4, and 5 originates from locally excited (LE) states at the NBN&#8208;phenalenyl fragments, while that of 2 is dominated by charge transfer (CT) from the NBN&#8208;phenalenyl to the p&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4 fragment. Depending on the dihedral angle &#952; between its Ph and NBN planes, compound 3 emits mainly from a less polar LE (&#952; &gt; 55&#176;) or more polar CT state (&#952; &lt; 55&#176;). In turn, the energetic preference for either state is governed by the polarity of the solvent used. An equimolar aggregate of the NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;phenalenyls 3 and 6 (in THF/H2O) shows a distinct red&#8208;shifted emission compared to that of the individual components, which originates from an intermolecular CT state.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chiral&#160;[2 + 3]&#160;Covalent Organic Cage Based on 1,1&#8217;&#8208;Bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) Units</title>

         <dc:description>A [2 + 3] chiral covalent organic cage is produced through a dynamic covalent chemistry approach by mixing two readily available building units, viz. an enantiopure 3,3&#8217;&#8208;diformyl 2,2&#8217;&#8208;BINOL compound (A) with a triamino spacer (B). The two enantiomeric (R,R,R) and (S,S,S) forms of the cage&#160;C&#160;are produced nearly quantitatively thanks to the reversibility of the imine linkage. The X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of cage (S,S,S)&#8208;C&#160;highlights that the six OH functions of the BINOL fragments are positioned inside the cage cavity. Upon reduction of the imine bonds of cage&#160;C, the amine cage&#160;D&#160;is obtained. The ability of the cage&#160;D&#160;to host the&#160;1&#8208;phenylethylammonium cation (EH+) as a guest&#160;is evaluated through UV, CD and DOSY NMR studies. A higher binding constant for (R)&#8208;EH+&#160;cation (Ka = 1.7 106&#160;&#177; 10 % M&#8208;1)&#160;related to (S)&#8208;EH+&#160;(Ka = 0.9 106&#160;&#177; 10 % M&#8208;1)&#160;is determined in the presence of the (R,R,R)&#8208;D&#160;cage. This enantiopreference is in close agreement with molecular dynamics simulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Phenyl Transfer from a Boronate to Lithium in the Gas Phase Reveals Crucial Role of Solvation in Transmetalations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to its behavior in solution, the adduct [(LiBr)(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8211; (pin = pinacol) transfers its phenyl anion from boron to lithium upon fragmentation in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations predict this exceptional transmetalation to be exothermic relative to the separated reactants, [(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8211; and LiBr, which we attribute to the high phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of the coordinatively unsaturated LiBr unit. The addition of a single molecule of tetrahydrofuran drastically reduces the phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of LiBr and thereby renders the transmetalation from boron to lithium endothermic. Thus, the probed system highlights the importance of solvation and ligation effects in transmetalations.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In contrast to its behavior in solution, the adduct [(LiBr)(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8211; (pin = pinacol) transfers its phenyl anion from boron to lithium upon fragmentation in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations predict this exceptional transmetalation to be exothermic relative to the separated reactants, [(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8211; and LiBr, which we attribute to the high phenyl-anion affinity of the coordinatively unsaturated LiBr unit. The addition of a single molecule of tetrahydrofuran drastically reduces the phenyl-anion affinity of LiBr and thereby renders the transmetalation from boron to lithium endothermic. Thus, the probed system highlights the importance of solvation and ligation effects in transmetalations. For correctly predicting the direction, in which these reactions proceed, it is not sufficient to consider the electronegativities or partial charges of the involved metals or metalloids. Instead, the individual coordination states and their changes over the course of the reaction must be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phenanthrothiophene&#8208;Triazine Star&#8208;Shaped Discotic Liquid Crystals: Synthesis, Self&#8208;Assembly, and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipophilic biphenylthiophene&#8208; and phenanthrothiophene&#8208;triazine compounds, BPTTn and CPTTn respectively, were prepared by a tandem procedure involving successive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and Scholl cyclodehydrogenation reactions. These compounds display photoluminescence in solution and in thin film state, solvatochromism with increasing solvent&#8217;s polarity, as well as acidochromism and metal ion recognition stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence. Protonation of BPTT10 and CPTT10 by trifluoroacetic acid results in fluorescence quenching, which is reversibly restored once treated with triethylamine (ON&#8208;OFF switch). DFT computational studies show that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomena occurs for both molecules, and reveal that protonation enhances the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the triazine core and reduces the band gap. This acidochromic behavior was applied to a prototype fluorescent anti&#8208;counterfeiting device. They also specifically recognize Fe3+ through coordination, and the recognition mechanism is closely related to the photoinduced electron transfer between Fe3+ and BPTT10/CPTT10. CPTTn self&#8208;assemble into columnar rectangular (Colrec) mesophase, which can be modulated by oleic acid via the formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular liquid crystal hexagonal Colhex mesophase. Finally, CPTTn also form organic gels in alkanes at low critical gel concentration (3.0 mg/mL). Therefore, these star&#8208;shaped triazine molecules possess many interesting features and thus hold great promises for information processing, liquid crystal semiconductors and organogelators.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular Grignard&#8208;type Reaction of Vinyl Iodide&#8722;Carbonyl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The insertion of carbonyl into C(sp2)&#8211;Pd(II) &#963;&#8208;bond (Grignard&#8208;type addition) was not established until the 1990s. While this elemental reaction has been well explored since then, its application in Pd(0) asymmetric catalysis remain elusive. Herein, we report the Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular Grignard&#8208;type reaction of vinyl iodide&#8211;carbonyl in the presence of HCO2H additive, affording cyclic allylic alcohol with good to excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggested that besides serving as an efficient reductant, HCO2H is also capable of facilitating protonation of the involved secondary alkoxyl&#8208;Pd(II), thus completely suppressing the &#946;&#8208;H elimination. Moreover, no KIE was found in the competing reaction between vinyl iodide&#8208;aldehyde and 1&#8208;deuterated one, demonstrating the facile step of aldehyde insertion.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Complex of the Parent Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diatomic molecule PH is very reactive, and it serves as the parent compound for phosphinidenes featuring a monovalent phosphorus atom. Herein, we report the characterization and reactivity of a rare hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex of PH. Specifically, the molecular complex between PH and HCl has been generated by photolysis of chlorophosphine (H2PCl) at 254 nm in a solid Ar&#8208;matrix at 10 K. The IR spectrum of the complex HP&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;HCl and quantum chemical calculations at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/haTZ level consistently prove that the phosphorus atom acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor with a binding energy (D0) of &#8211;0.6 kcal mol&#8722;1. In line with the observed absorption at 341 nm for the binary complex, the triplet phosphinidene PH undergoes prototype H&#8722;Cl bond insertion by reformation of H2PCl upon photoexcitation at 365 nm. However, this hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is unstable in the presence of N2 and HCl, as both molecules prefers stronger interactions with HCl than PH in the observed complexes HP&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;HCl&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;N2 and HP&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;2HCl.</dc:description>

         <title>Caged Dexamethasone to Photo&#8208;control the Development of Embryos through Activation of the Glucocorticoid Receptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easily synthesized caged inducer for the glucocorticoid receptor is demonstrated to spatially and temporally control gene&#8208;expression and development in two well&#8208;known vertebrate models: Zebrafish and Xenopus. Biologically orthogonal to the ones for photo&#8208;activating proteins fused to the estrogen ERT receptor, it brings great prospect for activating two distinct proteins down to the single cell level.







Abstract
Efficient tools for controlling molecular functions with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution are much in demand to investigate biological processes in living systems. Here we report an easily synthesized caged dexamethasone for photo&#8208;activating cytoplasmic proteins fused to the glucocorticoid receptor. In the dark, it is stable in&#8197;vitro as well as in&#8197;vivo in both zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Xenopus sp, two significant models of vertebrates. In contrast, it liberates dexamethasone upon UV illumination, which has been harnessed to interfere with developmental steps in embryos of these animals. Interestingly, this new system is biologically orthogonal to the one for photo&#8208;activating proteins fused to the estrogen ERT receptor, which brings great prospect for activating two distinct proteins down to the single cell level.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Sc(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Homologation of Ketones with Diazo Compounds: How Trans Influence Assists in Controlling Stereochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT study of Sc(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric homologation of ketones with diazo compounds revealed a new coordination mode of substrates which was rationalized by the trans influence. The origin of stereo&#8208;selectivity was explored based on the coordination mode. A promising new strategy to adjust stereo&#8208;selectivity by trans influence was proposed.







Abstract
Asymmetric one&#8208;carbon homologation or ring expansion of ketones with formal insertion of carbene intermediate, is a challenging but useful strategy to construct a complex skeleton. Sc(III) and chiral ligands have been employed in this regard. However, due to flexible conformations and a variety of stereo models, the origin of stereochemistry remains ambiguous. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to explore the interactions that control the stereoselectivity of a Sc(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric homologation. The trans influence of counterions was found to affect the coordination mode of ketone to Sc(III), and consequently affect the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Recent Advances in Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost Reactions of 1,n&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric tandem Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction provided a powerful method for the preparation of various chiral compounds containing an allylic moiety. Chiral palladium/phosphine complex efficiently promoted a wide range of difunctionalization of 1,n&#8208;dienes (n=2&#8211;4) for constructing C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=C, O, N) bond simultaneously. This review summarizes the recent advances in this field and highlights the significant achievements.







Abstract
Transition&#8211;metal catalyzed tandem asymmetric reactions were powerful tools to access various chiral compounds. Many strategies have been developed for the coupling of 1,n&#8208;dienes with aryl halides via a tandem Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost process. However, the control of regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;chemistry remains a challenging task. This minireview details the recent advances in the field of asymmetric Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost reactions catalyzed by palladium complex, which have opened new opportunities and expanded our understanding in this area of research in recent years.

&lt;p&gt;The Pd-catalyzed asymmetric tandem Heck/Tsuji&#8211;Trost reaction provided a powerful method for the preparation of various chiral compounds containing an allylic moiety. Chiral palladium/phosphine complex efficiently promoted a wide range of difunctionalization of 1,n-dienes (n=2&#8211;4) for constructing C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=C, O, N) bond simultaneously. This review summarizes the recent advances in this field and highlights the significant achievements.

         <title>Mesoporous Metal nanomaterials: Developments and Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept, we primarily summarized the design and synthetic strategies of mesoporous metal nanomaterials (MPMNs), aligning with the dynamic requirements of diverse electrocatalytic applications. MPMNs successfully make up for the unsatisfactory of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials by exposing more active sites and providing channels through interconnected pores for efficient mass transfer.







Abstract
Mesoporous metal nanomaterials (MPMNs) are pivotal in nanotechnology, especially in electrochemical applications, due to their unique structure. Unlike traditional nanomaterials, MPMNs possess hierarchical and mesoporous characteristics, providing more active sites for improved mass and electron transfer. This distinctive composition offers dual benefits, enhancing activity, stability, and selectivity for specific reactions. The intricate architecture, featuring interconnected pores, amplifies surface area, ensuring efficient use of active sites and boosting reactivity in electrocatalytic processes. Additionally, the mesoporous nature promotes superior diffusion kinetics, facilitating better transport of reactants and products. This intricate interplay of structural elements contributes not only to the increased efficiency of electrochemical reactions but also to the extended durability of MPMNs during prolonged usage. This concept focus on the synthesis and design strategies of MPMNs, aligning with the dynamic requirements of diverse electrocatalytic applications. The synergy resulting from these advancements not only accentuates the intrinsic properties of MPMNs but also broadens their scope for practical implementation in emerging fields of electrochemistry.

         <title>Photosensitizers Enable the Formation of Biphenyls with UV&#8208;LEDs and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselective synthesis of biphenyls, which are economically important pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and liquid crystals, is a challenging task. Current methods rely on metal&#8208;dependent cross&#8208;coupling reactions, which unfortunately require the use of harmful halogenated aryls and heavy metal catalysts that are toxic and difficult to remove from the final products. Recently, we have circumvented these problems by developing a metal&#8208;free and broadly applicable photochemical method for biphenyl synthesis using UV&#8208;C light, called photosplicing. Here we present an improved method using photosensitizers in combination with UV&#8208;B, UVA light, or sunlight. Using a high&#8208;precision flow reactor with deep&#8208;UV LEDs, we investigated the ability of commonly available organic photosensitizers to enhance the photosplicing reaction and identified a number of suitable photosensitizers with the required triplet energy. This method allows for easy batch synthesis of biaryls in borosilicate glassware and paves the way for their large&#8208;scale production without the need for flow reactors.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity in Adduct Formation of a Bidentate Boron Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bidentate boron Lewis acid based on 1,8&#8208;diethynylan&#173;thracene has been studied in detail with respect to its adduct formation with diamines and diphosphanes of different linker lengths between the donor functions. A clear correlation between the linker length of the bifunctional base and the formation of 1:1 adducts, 1:2 adducts or oligomers was found. The adducts were characterized in solution by NMR titration experiments and structurally by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, adduct formation and competition experiments of the host system with ZR3 (Z = N, P; R = H, Me) demonstrated the generally higher stability of alkylphosphane adducts compared to alkylamine adducts with boron functions. The results provide a gene&#173;ral insight into the adduct formation of bidentate Lewis acids with guests of different sizes as well as the differences in stability between borane&#8208;amine and borane&#8208;phosphane adducts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immobilized Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling under continuous&#8208;flow conditions using a packed&#8208;bed reactor, representing an efficient, automated, practical, and safe technology compared to conventional batch&#8208;type reactions. The core objective of this study is the development of an active and durable catalyst. In contrast to supported Pd nanoparticles, the attachment of Pd complexes onto solid supports through well&#8208;defined coordination sites is considered a favorable approach for preparing highly dispersed and stabilized Pd species. These species can be directly employed in various flow reactions without the need for pre&#8208;treatment.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#160;has attracted extensive attention due to its potential of&#160;real&#8208;time monitoring&#160;the lesion locations&#160;and visualizing&#160;the treatment process with high sensitivity and resolution.&#160;Aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#160;luminogens (AIEgens)&#160;show&#160;enhanced fluorescence and reactive oxygen species&#160;(ROS) generation after cellular uptake, giving them&#160;significant advantages&#160;in bioimaging and PDT applications. However, most AIEgens are unfavorable for the application in organisms due to their severe hydrophobicity.&#160;Anion&#8208;&#960;+&#160;type AIEgens carry intrinsic charges&#160;that can effectively alleviate their hydrophobicity and improve&#160;their binding capability to&#160;cells, which is expected to enhance the&#160;bioimaging quality and PDT performance.&#160;This concept summarizes the applications of anion&#8208;&#960;+&#160;type AIEgens in fluorescence imaging, fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided&#160;photodynamic anticancer and antimicrobial&#160;therapy&#160;in recent years, hoping to provide some&#160;new ideas&#160;for the construction of robust photosensitizers.

However, most AIEgens are unfavorable for the application in organisms due to their severe hydrophobicity.&#160;Anion-&#960;+&#160;type AIEgens carry intrinsic charges&#160;that can effectively alleviate their hydrophobicity and improve&#160;their binding capability to&#160;cells, which is expected to enhance the&#160;bioimaging quality and PDT performance.&#160;This concept summarizes the applications of anion-&#960;+&#160;type AIEgens in fluorescence imaging, fluorescence imaging-guided&#160;photodynamic anticancer and antimicrobial&#160;therapy&#160;in recent years, hoping to provide some&#160;new ideas&#160;for the construction of robust photosensitizers. Finally, the current problems and future challenges of anion-&#960;+&#160;AIEgens are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Versatile, Functional Group&#8208;Tolerant, and Bench&#8208;Stable Iron Precatalyst for Building Arene and Triazine Rings by [2+2+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new [2+2+2] cycloaddition procedure relying on the use of an air&#8208;stable iron precatalyst is described, which allows the construction of aromatic and nitrogen&#8208;containing heteroaromatic rings in green solvents and mild conditions. Cycloadditions and cross&#8208;cycloadditions between 1,6&#8208; or 1,7&#8208;diynes and alkynes are reported, with a broad functional tolerance, leading to a variety of functionalizable scaffolds.







Abstract
We report an efficient iron&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition procedure leading to the construction of (hetero)aromatic rings by alkyne [2+2+2] cycloisomerization. This method relies on the use of an air&#8208;stable (N,N)Fe(II) precursor easily prepared from a commercially available ligand derived from 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, reduced in&#8197;situ into a catalytically active non&#8208;innocent (N,N &#8901;&#8722;)2Fe(II) species. This system displays a large scope application, operates under mild conditions and at low catalytic charges (25 cycloadducts formed, up to 1.5&#8197;mol% catalyst). Moreover, this method also enables access to 29 cycloadducts by cross&#8208;cycloisomerization between 1,6&#8208; or 1,7&#8208;diynes and alkynes in near&#8208;equimolar conditions. 1,3,5&#8208;Triazines can also be prepared with this procedure starting from the corresponding cyanamides. Scale&#8208;up reactions and post&#8208;functionalization of several cycloadducts also show that this [2+2+2] cycloaddition can be used in multistep sequences.

         <title>Interaction of the Immune System TIM&#8208;3 Protein with a Model Cellular Membrane Containing Phosphatidyl&#8208;Serine Lipids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report molecular modeling and simulation of the specific recognition of Phosphatidyl serine&#8211;containing lipids and TIM&#8208;3 immune system agent, which is particularly present in natural killer and T&#8208;cells. We also identify the thermodynamic of the interaction process, using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics.







Abstract
T cell transmembrane, Immunoglobulin, and Mucin (TIM) are important immune system proteins which are especially present in T&#8208;cells and regulated the immune system by sensing cell engulfment and apoptotic processes. Their role is exerted by the capacity to detect the presence of phosphatidyl&#8211;serine lipid polar head in the outer leaflet of cellular membranes (correlated with apoptosis). In this contribution by using equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulation we unravel the molecular bases and the thermodynamics of TIM, and in particular TIM&#8208;3, interaction with phosphatidyl serine in a lipid bilayer. Since TIM&#8208;3 deregulation is an important factor of pro&#8208;oncogenic tumor micro&#8208;environment understanding its functioning at a molecular level may pave the way to the development of original immunotherapeutic approaches.

         <title>Impact of the Methylene Bridge Substitution in Chelating NHC&#8208;Phosphine Mn(I) Catalyst for Ketone Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridge substituent matters: the incorporation of phenyl group into the methylene bridge of bidentate phosphine&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand leads to significant increase of catalytic performance for the corresponding Mn(I) complex. Mechanistic studies revealed that this effect was caused by stabilization of key metal intermediates including a highly reactive anionic hydride complex due to more efficient negative charge delocalization.







Abstract
Systematic modification of the chelating NHC&#8208;phosphine ligand (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) in highly efficient ketone hydrogenation Mn(I) catalyst fac&#8208;[(Ph2PCH2NHC)Mn(CO)3Br] has been performed and the catalytic activity of the resulting complexes was evaluated using acetophenone as a benchmark substrate. While the variation of phosphine and NHC moieties led to inferior results than for a parent system, the incorporation of a phenyl substituent into the ligand methylene bridge improved catalytic performance by ca. 3 times providing maximal TON values in the range of 15000&#8211;20000. Mechanistic investigation combining experimental and computational studies allowed to rationalize this beneficial effect as an enhanced stabilization of reaction intermediates including anionic hydride species fac&#8208;[(Ph2PC(Ph)NHC)Mn(CO)3H]&#8722; playing a crucial role in the hydrogenation process. These results highlight the interest of such carbon bridge substitution strategy being rarely employed in the design of chemically non&#8208;innocent ligands.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;Thallusin and Mediated Uptake of Fe(III) into the Green Seaweed Ulva</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The algal morphogen (&#8722;)&#8208;thallusin was stereoselectively synthesized by implementing an IrI&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective polyene cyclization. A TMS group tracelessly directed the regioselectivity. (&#8722;)&#8208;Thallusin is secreted by bacteria associated with the green seaweed Ulva and forms a stable 2:1 FeIII complex that the algae take up, selectively promoting their massive development.

         <title>Stability of the Protactinium(V) Mono&#8208;oxo Cation Probed by First&#8208;Principle Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In solution, protactinium(V) can exist as a mono&#8208;oxo PaO3+ cation or a Pa5+, a unique feature along the actinide series. The relative stability of these two species has been explored by relativistic correlated quantum chemical methods. The equilibrium graphic highlights that ligands positioned to the right enhance the formation of a Pa mono&#8208;oxo triple bond in the aqueous phase. In contrast, those on the left destabilize this bond making the Pa5+ more stable. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Vallet and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304068). The cover design is credited to the graphic designer Ihsan Obeid.

         <title>TiO2/Loofah&#8211;Halloysite Bio&#8211;Hybrid Composites as Efficient Systems for VOCs Removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an easy and environmentally friendly synthesis of TiO2/loofah&#8211;halloysite composite from low&#8211;cost and environmentally friendly materials such as loofah fibers and halloysite nanotubes. The material has been extensively characterized. The co&#8211;presence of loofah, halloysite nanotubes, and titanium dioxide allowed a synergistic effect for application in the photooxidation of VOCs, such as toluene and ethanol.







Abstract
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), recognized as hazardous air contaminants, prompt the exploration of sustainable air purification methods. Solar photocatalytic oxidation emerges as a promising solution, utilizing semiconductor photocatalysts like titanium dioxide (TiO2). However, the raw material crisis necessitates reduced TiO2 usage, leading to investigations into TiO2 modification techniques. The study introduces a novel approach by employing natural fibers, specifically loofah sponge, as a TiO2 support. This method aims to maintain photocatalytic activity while minimizing TiO2 content. The article explores using halloysite, a natural clay mineral, as a supportive material, enhancing mechanical strength and adsorption properties. The resulting TiO2/loofah&#8211;halloysite composites are evaluated for their efficacy in gas&#8208;phase photocatalytic oxidation of toluene and ethanol, chosen as representative VOCs. The conversion of toluene and ethanol on the composite was 88&#8201;% and 39&#8201;%, respectively, with high selectivity toward CO2. In addition to its high performance, the bio&#8211;composite was stable for several conversion cycles, keeping the conversion activity unchanged. The study contributes to developing green hybrid materials for VOC removal, showcasing potential applications across industries.

         <title>Accessing Rare &#945;&#8208;Heterocyclic Aziridines via Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;catalyzed Michael Addition/Annulation: Scope, Limitations, and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an approach to the diastereoselective synthesis of rare 1,2&#8208;disubstituted heterocyclic aziridines. Our approach utilizes an inherent degradation of 1,2&#8208;chloroamines in the presence of trace acid, followed by annulation to give a diverse array of cis&#8208;aziridines which are not captured by alternative synthetic methodologies. The scope, limitations, and mechanistic insights into the selectivity are presented.







Abstract
We report an approach to the diastereoselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted heterocyclic aziridines. A Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition of anilines to trisubstituted heterocyclic chloroalkenes provides an intermediate 1,2&#8208;chloroamine. Diastereocontrol was found to vary significantly with solvent selection, with computational modelling confirming selective, spontaneous fragmentation in the presence of trace acids, proceeding through a pseudo&#8208;cyclic, protonated intermediate and transition state. These chloroamines can then be converted to the aziridine by treatment with LiHMDS with high stereochemical fidelity. This solvent&#8208;induced stereochemical enrichment thereby enables an efficient route to rare cis&#8208;aziridines with high dr. The scope, limitations, and mechanistic origins of selectivity are also presented.

         <title>Access to a peri&#8208;Annulated Aluminium Compound via C&#8722;H Bond Activation by a Cyclic Bis&#8208;Aluminylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KC8 reduction of 2&#8208;I with a catalytic amount the NHC (IMe4) has been shown to afford the peri&#8208;annulated compound 4 as a colorless crystalline solid. The formation of 4 suggests intramolecular insertion of the putative bis&#8208;aluminylene 3 into the C&#8722;H bonds of HCMe2 groups. Calculations predict singlet ground state for 3 while the conversion of 3 into 4 is thermodynamically favored by 61&#8197;kcal/mol.







Abstract
Carbocyclic aluminium halides [(ADC)AlX2]2 (2&#8208;X) (X=F, Cl, and I) based on an anionic dicarbene (ADC=PhC{N(Dipp)C}2, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) framework are prepared as crystalline solids by dehydrohalogenations of the alane [(ADC)AlH2]2 (1). KC8 reduction of 2&#8208;I affords the peri&#8208;annulated Al(III) compound [(ADCH)AlH]2 (4) (ADCH=PhC{N(Dipp)C2(DippH)N}, DippH=2&#8208;iPr,6&#8208;(Me2C)C6H3)) as a colorless crystalline solid in 76&#8201;% yield. The formation of 4 suggests intramolecular insertion of the putative bis&#8208;aluminylene species [(ADC)Al]2 (3) into the methine C&#8722;H bond of HCMe2 group. Calculations predict singlet ground state for 3, while the conversion of 3 into 4 is thermodynamically favored by 61&#8197;kcal/mol. Compounds 2&#8208;F, 2&#8208;Cl, 2&#8208;I, and 4 have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and their solid&#8208;state molecular structures have been established by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Investigating Recurrent Matere Bonds in Pertechnetate Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the structure of new pertechnetate derivatives: a journey through 1d and 2d supramolecular polymer formation dictated by matere bonds in combination with hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
In this manuscript we evaluate the X&#8208;ray structure of five new pertechnetate derivatives of general formula [M(H2O)4(TcO4)2], M=Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn (compounds 1&#8211;5) and one perrhenate compound Zn(H2O)4(ReO4)2 (6). In these complexes the metal center exhibits an octahedral coordination with the pertechnetate units as axial ligands. All compounds exhibit the formation of directional Tc&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Matere bonds (MaBs) that propagate the [M(H2O)4(TcO4)2], into 1D supramolecular polymers in the solid state. Such 1D polymers are linked, generating 2D layers, by combining additional MaBs and hydrogen bonds (HBs). Such concurrent motifs have been analyzed theoretically, suggesting the noncovalent &#963;&#8208;hole nature of the MaBs. The interaction energies range from weak (~ &#8722;2&#8197;kcal/mol) for the MaBs to strong (~ &#8722;30&#8197;kcal/mol) for the MaB+HB assemblies, where HB dominates. In case of M=Zn, the corresponding perrhenate Zn(H2O)4(ReO4)2 complex, has been also synthesized for comparison purposes, resulting in the formation of an isostructural X&#8208;ray structure, corroborating the structure&#8208;directing role of Matere bonds.

&lt;p&gt;Unveiling the structure of new pertechnetate derivatives: a journey through 1d and 2d supramolecular polymer formation dictated by matere bonds in combination with hydrogen bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this manuscript we evaluate the X-ray structure of five new pertechnetate derivatives of general formula [M(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], M=Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn (compounds 1&#8211;5) and one perrhenate compound Zn(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(ReO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;). In these complexes the metal center exhibits an octahedral coordination with the pertechnetate units as axial ligands. All compounds exhibit the formation of directional Tc&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Matere bonds (MaBs) that propagate the [M(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], into 1D supramolecular polymers in the solid state. Such 1D polymers are linked, generating 2D layers, by combining additional MaBs and hydrogen bonds (HBs). Such concurrent motifs have been analyzed theoretically, suggesting the noncovalent &#963;-hole nature of the MaBs. The interaction energies range from weak (~ &#8722;2&#8197;kcal/mol) for the MaBs to strong (~ &#8722;30&#8197;kcal/mol) for the MaB+HB assemblies, where HB dominates. In case of M=Zn, the corresponding perrhenate Zn(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(ReO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex, has been also synthesized for comparison purposes, resulting in the formation of an isostructural X-ray structure, corroborating the structure-directing role of Matere bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Catalytic Application of Colloidal and Supported Mn Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal and supported manganese nanoparticles were synthesized following an organometallic approach and applied in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of aldehydes and ketones. Reaction parameters for the preparation of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) were optimized to yield small (2&#8208;2.5 nm) and well&#8208;dispersed NPs. Manganese NPs were further immobilized on an imidazolium&#8208;based supported ionic phase (SILP) and characterized to evaluate NP size, metal loading, and oxidation states. Oxidation of the Mn NPs by the support was observed resulting in an average formal oxidation state of +2.5. The MnOx@SILP material showed promising performance in the CTH of aldehydes and ketones using 2&#8208;propanol as a hydrogen donor, outperforming previously reported Mn NPs&#8208;based CTH catalysts in terms of metal loading&#8208;normalized turnover numbers. Interestingly, MnOx@SILP were found to lose activity upon air exposure, which correlates with an additional increase in the average oxidation state of Mn as revealed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Pertechnetates &#8211; a structural study across the periodic table</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The number of crystal structures of pertechnetates derived from aqueous solutions has been expanded from seven to over 30. We report the conversion of NH4TcO4 to aqueous HTcO4 via acidic cation exchange. This is followed by the synthesis and structural elucidation of pertechnetate salts of alkaline earth (AE), transition metal (TM) and lanthanoids (Ln) elements. Various degrees of hydration and coordination are discussed. Where possible, a comparison with the perrhenate homologues is made. The described syntheses and materials may be used as novel starting materials for extended technetium research.</dc:description>

These complexes represent the first step beyond the current lanthanide(II) hydrides that are all based on ytterbium. Tuning the steric profile of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligands from a symmetrical to unsymmetrical disposition, enhanced solubility and stability in the solution&#8208;state. This provides the first opportunity to study the structure and bonding of these novel Eu(II) hydride complexes crystallographically, spectroscopically and computationally, with their preliminary reactivity investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>para&#8208;Phenylenediamine Dimer as a Redox&#8208;Active Guest for Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;active components are highly valuable in the construction of molecular devices. We combined two p&#8208;phenylenediamines (p&#8208;PDA) with a biphenyl (BiPhe) unit to prepare a supramolecular guest 4 consisting of three binding sites for cucurbit[7/8]uril (CBn) and/or cyclodextrins (CD). Supramolecular properties of 4 were investigated using NMR, UV&#8208;vis, mass spectrometry and isothermal titration calorimetry. Our analysis revealed that 4 forms higher&#8208;order host&#8211;guest complexes, wherein a CD unit occupies the central BiPhe site, secured by two CBn units at the terminal p&#8208;PDA sites. Additionally, 1:1 complexes with &#945;&#8208;CD and &#946;&#8208;CD, a 1:2 complex with &#947;&#8208;CD and 2:1 complexes with CB7 and CB8 were identified. Through UV&#8208;vis and cyclic voltammetry, redox processes leading to the formation of a stable, deep blue dication diradical of 4 are elucidated. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that CB7 selectively protects oxidised 4 from reduction in the presence of a reducing agent. The supramolecular and redox properties of the structural motif represented by 4 render it an interesting candidate for the construction of supramolecular devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper(I)&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been conceived to be promising candidates for display and lighting applications because of their multifarious structures and strong photoluminescence. Herein a string of binuclear Cu(I) complexes bearing pronounced cuprophilic interactions have been designed and synthesized. [Cu2(dppb)2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;Ph)2] (1a) and [Cu2(dppb)2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;PPXZ)2] (1b) display photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 67% in doped films and solid states via TADF and exhibit reversible bicolor luminescence switching upon mechanical stimuli. Computational studies manifest that the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer predominant transitions ensure a small energy splitting (&#916;EST) between the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states and cuprophilic interactions promote the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), favoring the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. This study provides a new strategy for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;based TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments of Nontraditional Single&#8208;Molecule Toroics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule toroics (SMTs), are defined as a type of molecules with toroidal arrangement of magnetic moment associated with bi&#8208;stable non&#8208;magnetic ground states, making them promising candidates for high&#8208;density information storage and the development of molecule based multiferroic materials with linear magneto&#8211;electric coupling and multiferroic behavior. The design and synthesis of SMTs by arranging the magnetic anisotropy axis in a circular pattern at the molecular level has been of great interest to scientists for last two decades since the first detection of the SMT behavior in the seminal Dy3 molecules. DyIII ion has long been the ideal candidate for constructing SMTs due to its Kramer ion nature as well as high anisotropy. Nevertheless, other LnIII ions such as TbIII and HoIII ions, as well as some paramagnetic transition metal ions, have also been used to construct many nontraditional SMTs. Therefore, we review the progress in the studies of SMTs based on the nontraditional perspective, ranging from the 3D topological to 1D&amp;2D&amp;3D polymeric SMTs, and 3d&#8208;4f to non Dy&#8208;based SMTs. We hope the understanding we provide about nontraditional SMTs will be helpful to design novel SMTs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single-molecule toroics (SMTs), are defined as a type of molecules with toroidal arrangement of magnetic moment associated with bi-stable non-magnetic ground states, making them promising candidates for high-density information storage and the development of molecule based multiferroic materials with linear magneto&#8211;electric coupling and multiferroic behavior. The design and synthesis of SMTs by arranging the magnetic anisotropy axis in a circular pattern at the molecular level has been of great interest to scientists for last two decades since the first detection of the SMT behavior in the seminal Dy3 molecules. DyIII ion has long been the ideal candidate for constructing SMTs due to its Kramer ion nature as well as high anisotropy. Nevertheless, other LnIII ions such as TbIII and HoIII ions, as well as some paramagnetic transition metal ions, have also been used to construct many nontraditional SMTs. Therefore, we review the progress in the studies of SMTs based on the nontraditional perspective, ranging from the 3D topological to 1D&amp;amp;2D&amp;amp;3D polymeric SMTs, and 3d-4f to non Dy-based SMTs. We hope the understanding we provide about nontraditional SMTs will be helpful to design novel SMTs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Poly(vinyl chloride) Dechlorination Catalyzed by Zirconium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic amidozirconocene catalyst is shown to dechlorinate poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) under mild conditions in the presence of triethylsilane as a hydrogen donor. PVC additives containing carbonyl functional groups (e.&#8201;g. phthalates, poly(vinyl acetate)) underwent complete hydrosilylation. A procedure is reported for the deconvolution of catalyst poisoning effects by PVC additives.







Abstract
Poly(vinyl chloride) undergoes dechlorination in the presence of triethylsilane (Et3SiH) and a catalytic amount of [Cp2Zr(NPh2)][CH3B(C6F5)3] (1&#8201;b) at 40&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C, with up to 91&#8201;% efficiency. Stoichiometric reactivity studies conducted on cyclohexyl chloride as a model suggest that 1&#8201;b dechlorinates PVC by initial chloride abstraction, followed by hydride transfer to the cationic PVC chain from Et3SiH. Consumer items such as pipe fitting, vinyl disc or electric cable insulation undergo either dechlorination or hydrosilylation of the carbonyl&#8208;containing copolymer (polyvinyl acetate) or plasticizer (phthalate).

         <title>Molybdenum(0)&#8208;Tricarbonyl Complex Supported by an Azacalix&#8208;pyridine Ligand: Synthesis, Characterization, Surface Deposition and Conversion to a Molybdenum(VI)&#8208;Trioxo Complex with O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes the synthesis of a molybdenum(0) tricarbonyl complex supported by an azacalixpyridine ligand. This complex can activate CO and reacts with dioxygen (O2) in solution, in the solid state and on surfaces to form a molybdenum(VI) trioxo complex which mediates O&#8208;transfer from dioxygen to external substrates.







Abstract
Adsorption of metal&#8208;organic complexes on metallic surfaces to produce well&#8208;defined single site catalysts is a novel approach combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. To avoid the &#8220;surface trans&#8208;effect&#8221; a dome&#8208;shaped molybdenum(0) tricarbonyl complex supported by an tolylazacalix[3](2,6)pyridine ligand is synthesized. This vacuum&#8208;evaporable complex both activates CO and reacts with molecular oxygen (O2) to form a Mo(VI) trioxo complex which in turn is capable of catalytically mediating oxygen transfer. The molybdenum tricarbonyl&#8208; and trioxo complexes are investigated in the solid state, in homogeneous solution and on noble metal surfaces (Cu, Au) employing a range of spectroscopic and analytical methods.

         <title>Electrochemical Multicomponent Synthesis of Alkyl Alkenesulfonates using Styrenes, SO2 and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first of its kind electrochemical approach for the direct synthesis of alkyl alkenesulfonates using styrenes, SO2 stock solution and alcohols was developed. The reaction features the in&#8208;situ generation of a monoalkylsulfite species with subsequent radical addition to an anodically oxidized styrene substrate. The applicability of the protocol was demonstrated with a broad scope as well as a gram&#8208;scale reaction.







Abstract
A novel electrochemical approach to access alkyl alkenesulfonates via a multicomponent reaction was developed. The metal&#8208;free method features easy&#8208;to&#8208;use SO2 stock solution forming monoalkylsulfites from alcohols with an auxiliary base in&#8208;situ. These intermediates serve a dual role as starting materials and as supporting electrolyte enabling conductivity. Anodic oxidation of the substrate styrene, radical addition of these monoalkylsulfites and consecutive second oxidation and deprotonation preserve the double bond and form alkyl &#946;&#8208;styrenesulfonates in a highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective fashion. The feasibility of this electrosynthetic method is demonstrated in 44 examples with yields up to 81&#8201;%, employing various styrenes and related substrates as well as a diverse set of alcohols. A gram&#8208;scale experiment underlines the applicability of this process, which uses inexpensive and readily available electrode materials.

         <title>A New Molybdenum Blue Structure Type: How Uranium Expands This Family of Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of molybdenum polyoxometalates (POMs) has afforded large discrete nanoclusters with varied degrees of reduction such as the ~20% reduced molybdenum blues. While many heterometals have been incorporated into these clusters to afford new properties, uranium has yet to be reported. Here we report the first uranium containing molybdenum blue clusters and the unique properties exhibited by this incorporation. The uranyl ion (UO22+) directs formation of Mo72U8, a square POM comprised of two faces connected by eight edge&#8208;sharing molybdenum dimers. Mo72U8, a chiral cluster, crystallizes as a racemic mixture and, in the solid state, has a &#8216;negative&#8217; charge localized on one face of the cluster opposite the &#8216;positively&#8217; charged face of another cluster. Using U(IV) as both heterometal and molybdenum reductant afforded crystals of Mo97U10, a wheel cluster with a heptamolybdate cap on one face. Mo97U10 dissociates in solution, losing the heptamolybdate, to form Mo90U10. Using more solvent during synthesis afforded crystals of Mo90U10S4 which, instead of heptamolybdate, contains four sulfate ions. Crystals of Mo90U10S4 undergo a dehydration induced phase change where clusters form a sheet through oxide bridges. Half of the bridges are cation&#8208;cation interactions between the uranyl oxygen atom and molybdenum, the first reported of this kind.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the intriguing aspects of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomenon of multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based push&#8211;pull systems are of paramount importance considering their promising applications, particularly in solar energy harvesting and light&#8208;emitting devices. Herein, a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores 1&#8211;6, are designed and synthesized by the Corey&#8208;Fuchs reaction via Evano&#8217;s condition followed by [2 + 2] cycloaddition retroelectrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reaction with strong electron acceptors TCNE and TCNQ in good yields (~60&#8211;85%). The photophysical, electrochemical, and computational studies are investigated to explore the effect of incorporation of strong electron acceptors TCBD and DCNQ with phenothiazine (PTZ) donor. An additional low&#8208;lying broad absorption band extended towards the NIR region suggests charge polarization after the introduction of the electron acceptors in both symmetrical and asymmetrical systems, leading to such strong ICT bands. Relative positions of the frontier orbitals on geometry&#8208;optimized structures further support accessing donor&#8208;acceptor sites responsible for the ICT transitions. Eventually, ultrafast carrier dynamics of the photoinduced species are investigated provided information about different excited states photophysical events including ICT and their associated time profiles.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoreactor Confined and Enriched Intermediates for Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the process of electroreduction of carbon dioxide (eCO2RR) to multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products, it is imperative to enhance the concentration of key intermediate species on the catalyst surface. The utilization of micro&#8208;nano reactors to achieve confinement effects has been widely observed in various catalytic reactions, yet it has seldom been employed in eCO2RR. Here, we present a novel nanoreactor composed of stacked CuS nanosheets for eCO2RR to C2+ products. In comparison to catalyst comprising of nanosheet with open space, the C&#8208;C coupling within this confined nanospace is significantly enhanced, resulting in the increase of Faraday efficiency (FE) of C2+ products to 53%. In situ infrared (IR) spectroscopy reveals the confinement and enrichment of key intermediate by the nanoreactor. Our research findings demonstrate that a meticulously designed nanoreactor can elevate the selectivity of C2+ products, thereby aiding in the design of eCO2RR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Visible light&#8208;induced charge separation and directional charge transfer are cornerstones for artificial photosynthesis and the generation of solar fuels. Here, we report synthetic access to a series of noble metal&#8208;free donor&#8208;acceptor dyads based on bodipy light&#8208;absorbers and redox&#8208;active quinone / anthraquinone charge storage sites. Peripheral functionalization of the quinone / anthraquinone units with alkynes primes the dyads for integration into a range of light&#8208;harvesting systems, e.g., by Cu&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions (CLICK chemistry) or Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions.

         <title>From the Total Synthesis of Semi&#8208;Viriditoxin, Semi&#8208;Viriditoxic Acid and Dimeric Naphthopyranones to their Biological Activities in Burkitt B Cell Lymphoma</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimeric naphthopyranones are known to be biologically active, however, for the corresponding monomeric naphthopyranones this information is still elusive. Here the first enantioselective total synthesis of semi&#8208;viriditoxic acid as well as the synthesis of semi&#8208;viriditoxin and derivatives is reported. The key intermediate in the synthesis of naphthopyranones is an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8209;lactone, which we synthesized in two different ways (Ghosez&#8208;cyclization and Grubbs ring&#8208;closing metathesis), while the domino&#8208;Michael&#8208;Dieckmann reaction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8209;lactone with an orsellinic acid derivative is the key reaction. A structure&#8208;activity relationship study was performed measuring the cytotoxicity in Burkitt B lymphoma cells (Ramos). The dimeric structure was found to be crucial for biological activity: Only the dimeric naphthopyranones showed cytotoxic and apoptotic activity, whereas the monomers did not display any activity at all.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tandem Hydroformylation&#8208;organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction for the synthesis of Diindolylmethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we present an efficient and atom&#8208;economic tandem hydroformylation organocatalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction sequence for the synthesis of diindolylmethanes. Classic syntheses have relied on (Lewis) acid activation of aldehydes, which are often not commercially available and rather sensitive in handling. In contrast, the combination of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation and subsequent organocatalytic activation of the&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;formed aldehydes allows the use of readily available and stable alkenes with various functional groups while avoiding acidic conditions to expand the range of available diindolylmethanes. A broad scope of diindolylmethanes was prepared in yields up to 85% demonstrates the utility of the presented method.</dc:description>

         <title>Soft multi&#8208;layer actuators integrated with the functions of electrical energy harvest and storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating functions such as energy harvesting and storage with actuators to create intelligent actuators has emerged as a growing trend in development. By functionalizing actuation materials, they can take on a range of capabilities including energy harvesting, conversion, and storage. We provide a detailed introduction to smart actuators equipped with these functions, covering design concepts, typical applications, and future prospects.







Abstract
Soft multi&#8208;layer actuators are smart, lightweight, and flexible, which can be used in a wide range of fields such as artificial muscles, advanced medical devices, and wearable devices. The research on the actuation property of the soft actuators has made significant progress, paving the way for the controllable motions of the actuators. However, compared with the intelligence and adaptability of life in nature, these actuators still have the problem of insufficient intelligence. The phenomenon is reflected in a lack of continuous supply of energy. Therefore, it has become a development trend to combine functions such as energy harvesting, storage, and conversion with actuators to build intelligent actuators. This concept presents a synopsis of the advancements made in soft actuators that have been coupled with the capabilities of electrical energy harvesting and storage. The design concepts and typical applications of this soft smart actuators are introduced in detail. Finally, the future research directions and applications of smart actuators are prospected from our perspective.

         <title>Proton transfer and regulation across chemical interfaces by small&#8208;molecule assemblies</title>

We study proton transport across a membrane mimic composed of the liquid&#8208;liquid interface between an aqueous solution and an organic solution. The proton transport across this membrane mimic can be quantified and analyzed by impedance spectroscopy. We show that the interfacial proton movement is controlled by the pH of the aqueous phase and cross&#8208;membrane proton transfer rate is higher at lower pHs. We utilize proton transporters found in the electron transport chain such as ubiquinols and 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenol to further influence the rate of proton shuttling. The ubiquinols are effective in transporting protons across the membrane when paired with a reducing agent that activates their high rate cross&#8208;membrane proton movement. 2,4&#8208;Dinitrophenol's acts as a pH activated proton transporter only active at pH&gt;4.







Abstract
We report on measurements and control of proton gradient across interfaces of water and dichloroethane. Such interfaces are interesting as mimics of biological membranes. We use impedance spectroscopy to quantify interfacial proton gradient and identify proton transfer modes. We quantify proton movement using reciprocal of time constant (&#964;&#8722;1) acquired from electrochemical impedance modeling. We show that proton gradient across interfaces of water/dichloroethane and &#964;&#8722;1 correlate with the aqueous phase pH, changing from ca. 1&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;1 to 0.2&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;7. &#964;&#8722;1 changes in the presence of proton shuttling fat&#8208;soluble molecules. Dinitrophenol acts as a pH activated proton coupler which is active at around neutral pH and inert at pH &lt;4. However, quinone type cofactors change the interfacial proton transport when activated by redox reactions with ferrocene type molecules, such as decamethyl ferrocence (DMFc). Quinone type cofactors show distinct features in their impedance response assigned to a proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, different from the uncoupled proton transfer activity of dinitrophenol. The observed PCET reaction significantly changes &#964;&#8722;1. We use &#964;&#8722;1 as a proton transport descriptor. In particular, CoQ10&#8208;DMFc shows a &#964;&#8722;1 of 3.5&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;7, indicating how small&#8208;molecule assemblies change proton availability.

         <title>Probing oxygen exchange between UiO&#8208;66(Zr) MOF and water using 17O solid&#8208;state NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 17O labeled terephtalic acid ligand has been used for the synthesis of 17O enriched UiO&#8208;66 compound. High&#8208;field 17O solid&#8208;state NMR experiments show an overall transfer of oxygen in the structure.







Abstract
The Zr&#8208;based Metal Organic Framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;66(Zr) is widely employed owing to its good thermal and chemical stabilities. Although the long&#8208;range structure of this MOF is preserved in the presence of water during several days, little is known about the formation of defects, which cannot be detected using diffraction techniques. We apply here 17O solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy at 18.8&#8197;T to investigate the reactivity of UiO&#8208;66, through the exchange of oxygen atoms between the different sites of the MOF and water. For that purpose, we have selectively enriched in 17O isotope the carboxylate groups of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) by using it with 17O&#8208;labeled terephthalic acid prepared using mechanochemistry. In the presence of water at 50&#8201;&#176;C and a following dehydration at 150&#8201;&#176;C, we observe an overall exchange of O atoms between COO&#8722; and &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722; sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the three distinct oxygen sites, &#956;3&#8208;OH, &#956;3&#8208;O2&#8722; and COO&#8722;, of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) MOF can be enriched in 17O isotope by post&#8208;synthetic hydrothermal treatment in the presence of 17O&#8208;enriched water. These results demonstrate the lability of Zr&#8722;O bonds and the reactivity of UiO&#8208;66(Zr) with water.

         <title>Ca(II) and Yb(II) complexes featuring M(C&#8801;C)4 structural motif: enforced proximity or genuine &#951;2&#8208;bonding?</title>

The &#951;2&#8208;coordination of the alkyne triple C&#8801;C bond to Ca2+ and Yb2+ ions in the 1,8&#8208;bis(ethynyl)substituted carbazolide complexes is confirmed in the solid state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy and in the solution by NMR spectroscopy. QTIAM analysis proves the existence of M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C) T&#8208;shaped bond pathways.







Abstract
Bis(carbazolide) complexes M[3,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;1,8&#8208;(RC&#8801;C)2Carb]2(THF)n (R=SiMe3, n=0, M=Ca, Yb; R=Ph, n=1, M=Ca, Yb; n=0, M=Yb) were synthesized through transamination reaction of M[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2 with two molar equivalents of carbazoles. The complexes feature M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C)4 structural motif composed of M(II) ions encapsulated by four acetylene fragments due to atypical for alkaline&#8208; and rare&#8208;earth metals &#951;2&#8208;interactions with triple C&#8801;C bond. This interaction is evidenced experimentally by X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy in the solid state and by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy in the solution. According to QTAIM analysis there are 4 bond critical points (3;&#8722;1) between the metal atom and each of the triple bonds, which are connected by a strongly curved, almost T&#8208;shaped bond pathway.

Herein, a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation of naphthoquinone with unactivated alkanes using Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst under blue&#8208;light (457&#8197;nm) irradiation without any utilization of external base, oxidant, and pre&#8208;functionalization is described. Using the presented methodology, the high&#8208;value&#8208;added compound parvaquone (a commercially available drug for treating theileriosis) and its derivatives can be directly constructed under ambient reaction conditions.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of unreactive hydrocarbons is always challenging due to its inherited chemical inertness, slightly different reactivity of various C&#8722;H bonds, and intrinsically high bond dissociation energies. Here, a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation of naphthoquinone with unactivated hydrocarbons using Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst under blue&#8208;light (457&#8197;nm) irradiation without any external acid or base and pre&#8208;functionalization is presented. The selective C&#8722;H functionalization of tertiary over secondary and secondary over primary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in abundant chemical feedstocks was achieved, and hydroxylation of quinones was realized in&#8197;situ by employing the developed methodology. This protocol provides a new catalytic system for the direct construction of high&#8208;value&#8208;added compounds, namely, parvaquone (a commercially available drug used to treat theileriosis) and its derivatives under ambient reaction conditions. Moreover, this operationally simple protocol applies to various linear&#8208;, branched&#8208;, and cyclo&#8208;alkanes with high degrees of site selectivity under blue&#8208;light irradiated conditions and could provide rapid and straightforward access to versatile methodologies for upgrading feedstock chemicals. Mechanistic insight by radical trapping, radical scavenging, EPR, and other controlled experiments well corroborated with DFT studies suggest that the reaction proceeds by a radical pathway.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H functionalization of unreactive hydrocarbons is always challenging due to its inherited chemical inertness, slightly different reactivity of various C&#8722;H bonds, and intrinsically high bond dissociation energies. Here, a site-selective C&#8722;H alkylation of naphthoquinone with unactivated hydrocarbons using Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; as a catalyst under blue-light (457&#8197;nm) irradiation without any external acid or base and pre-functionalization is presented. The selective C&#8722;H functionalization of tertiary over secondary and secondary over primary C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bonds in abundant chemical feedstocks was achieved, and hydroxylation of quinones was realized &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; by employing the developed methodology. This protocol provides a new catalytic system for the direct construction of high-value-added compounds, namely, parvaquone (a commercially available drug used to treat &lt;i&gt;theileriosis&lt;/i&gt;) and its derivatives under ambient reaction conditions. Moreover, this operationally simple protocol applies to various linear-, branched-, and cyclo-alkanes with high degrees of site selectivity under blue-light irradiated conditions and could provide rapid and straightforward access to versatile methodologies for upgrading feedstock chemicals. Mechanistic insight by radical trapping, radical scavenging, EPR, and other controlled experiments well corroborated with DFT studies suggest that the reaction proceeds by a radical pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescence color change of supramolecular polymer networks controlled by crown ether&#8208;cation recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition was fabricated. The host dimer M1 which exhibits blue fluorescence was prepared by decorating benzo[15]crown&#8208;5 with a quinoline group. M1 can crosslink the ammonium cations&#8208;grafted polymer P1 to form a supramolecular polymer networks through host&#8208;guest recognition, accompanied by the transformation of blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence.







Abstract
We report a fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) system based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition. The polymer side chains bear ammonium cations, which can be recognized by host molecules with a B15C5 unit and a quinoline group at each end. The quinoline group makes the host molecule exhibit blue fluorescence. After the formation of SPNs, the recognition of the crown ether&#8208;cation transforms the blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence. The accompanying fluorescence color change during the formation of SPNs makes it with potential applications in the fields of display, printing, information storage, and bioimaging.

         <title>Characterization of the Ligand Properties of Donor&#8208;stabilized Pnictogenyltrielanes</title>

The syntheses and characterizations of alkyl&#8208;substituted compounds IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2 (E=P, As; R=alkyl) are presented. Together with other donor&#8208;stabilized pnictogenyltrielanes, these compounds were reacted with Ni(CO)4 and their ligand properties evaluated regarding the steric and electronic nature of this class of compounds. According to the corresponding Tolman Electronic Parameters, the compounds are significantly more electron&#8208;rich than regular phosphines and their steric and electronic demands can be modified easily.







Abstract
A general synthesis and the characterization of novel alkyl&#8208;substituted NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenylboranes NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2 (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, E=P, As; R2=Me2, Ph2, tBuH, Cy2, (SiMe3)2) are reported. These compounds were reacted with Ni(CO)4 to the corresponding complexes of the type [(NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2ER2)Ni(CO)3] to determine their donor strength by Tolman Electronic Parameters (TEPs) and their steric demand as ligands compared to classical phosphines, superbasic phosphines and other commonly applied donor systems. The results show that the NHC&#8208;stabilized pnictogenyltrielanes can be considered as being highly basic, while their steric influence depends strongly on the organic residues as well as the donor attached to the {BH2} moiety. Although weaker than commonly used superbasic phosphines, the donor strength of pnictogenyltrielanes in general can be classified as of similar strength as NHCs. The steric and electronic properties can easily be modified by alkyl substitution as evident from the TEP trends.

         <title>Two Allogons of an O2&#8208;activating Bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) Accessible Selectively just by Variation of the Crystallization Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One allogon hardly ever comes alone but the bis(disiloxido)ferrate(II) presented here is a unique case where the selective crystallization of two individual allogons &#8211; one with a square planar and one with a distorted FeO2 core &#8211; has been reached. Theoretical investigations allowed for the rationalization of this phenomenon. Reaction with O2 proceeds within milliseconds as monitored by stopped&#8208;flow measurements.







Abstract
Deprotonation of O(iPr2SiOH)2 (iPrLH2) with LiOtBu followed by reaction with FeCl2 in THF led to the complex [iPrL2Fe][Li(THF)2]2, 2, which represents a structural and spectroscopic model of the &#945;&#8208;Fe sites of Fe/ZSM&#8208;5. Reaction with O2 in THF solution proceeds rather fast and is complete within 200&#8197;ms; an intermediate O2 adduct could not be identified by stopped&#8208;flow methods. Cooling blue solutions of 2 to &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C led to the growth of blue crystals of 2&#8901;THF, the analysis of which by XRD revealed a FeO4 core that is somewhat distorted from planarity towards a tetrahedral structure. By contrast, cooling such solutions to &#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C led to pink crystals of an allogon featuring a perfectly square planar FeO4 entity. Hence, 2 represents a unique case where two different structural isomers (allogons) can be crystallized from the same solvent selectively, controlled by the temperature. DFT calculations were performed to understand this finding.

         <title>Stacked Covalent Organic Ribbons Perpendicular to Graphene Oxide Sheets; a 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D Design for Photocatalytic Tandem Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth of 1D covalent organic frameworks perpendicularly on the surface of GO nanosheets, a 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D design, improves the photocatalytic performance for many tandem oxidation and hydrogenation reactions. Under white light irradiation, 1D COF nanorods exhibit a superior visible light activity. The improved charge transfer and desirable separation rate obtain through the junction between COR and GO sheets.







Abstract
Development of one dimensional covalent organic frameworks (1D&#8208;COFs) with potential in light absorption and catalysis is still challenging, due to their rapid interpenetration to form 2D and 3D porous structures. Here we report a successful synthesis of imine&#8208;linked 1D covalent organic ribbons (COR), using two simple linear building blocks 1,4&#8208;Benzenediamine (Bda) and [2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine]&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Bpy). The obtained 1D structure with nanorod morphology could keep its physicochemical characteristic properties when it is perpendicular to the surface of graphene oxide (GO) sheets (1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D structure). Due to an AB &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and efficient charge transfer between perpendicular 1D COR and GO sheets, the obtained nanocomposite showed strong visible light absorbance (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) with coefficient of 4.400&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and decreased recombination rate of photogenerated reactive species by 92&#8201;%. The strategy of 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D light driven system greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity in practical applications such as both oxidation and hydrogenation tandem reactions to a rate constant of higher than 0.02&#8197;min&#8722;1. This study presents the first case of 1D covalent organic polymers grown perpendicularly on a carbon&#8208;based layer for boosting electron mobility through the junction between the two components.

Due to an AB &#960;&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;&#960; stacking and efficient charge transfer between perpendicular 1D COR and GO sheets, the obtained nanocomposite showed strong visible light absorbance (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) with coefficient of 4.400&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and decreased recombination rate of photogenerated reactive species by 92&#8201;%. The strategy of 1D-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-2D light driven system greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity in practical applications such as both oxidation and hydrogenation tandem reactions to a rate constant of higher than 0.02&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study presents the first case of 1D covalent organic polymers grown perpendicularly on a carbon-based layer for boosting electron mobility through the junction between the two components.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and dark state EPR properties of PDI&#8208;trityl dyads and triads</title>

Chromophore&#8208;radical systems are promising structures for quantum information science experiments, due to the possibility of generating high&#8208;spin states with strong spin polarization upon light excitation. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a number of different perylene diimides covalently linked to trityl radicals and explore their dark state properties by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.







Abstract
Covalently&#8208;linked chromophore&#8208;radical systems with their unique optical and magnetic properties are useful for applications in, e.&#8201;g., quantum information science. To expand the catalog of molecular systems, we synthesized and characterized six novel chromophore&#8211;radical and radical&#8208;chromophore&#8208;radical systems employing derivatives of perylene diimide (PDI) as the chromophore and trityl as the radical. The EPR properties of these compounds were evaluated in solution at cryogenic and room temperatures. In addition, the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling in the two bistrityl systems was investigated using DQC measurements. The presented results serve as a basis for further spectroscopic investigations under photoexcitation of the PDI core.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Stabilized Mixed Group 13/14/15 Element Hydrides</title>

Reactions of the NHC&#8208;stabilized compound IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf with NaPH2 were carried out. Hereby, mixtures of isomers of the unprecedented parent hydride adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2 were isolated in different ratios in favour of the latter isomer, depending on the reaction conditions. Subsequent reactions of these isomers yielded the borane adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2BH3 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2BH3 as well as the cyclohexyl&#8208;like anion [PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2]&#8211;.







Abstract
The syntheses of novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) adducts of group 13, 14 and 15 element hydrides are reported. Salt metathesis reactions between NaPH2 and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2OTf (1) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) led to mixtures of the two isomers IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2 (2&#8201;a) and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2 (2&#8201;b); by altering the reaction conditions an almost exclusive formation of 2&#8201;b was achieved. Attempts to purify mixtures of 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b by re&#8208;crystallization from THF afforded a salt [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;IDipp][PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2] (4) that contains the novel anionic cyclohexyl&#8208;like inorganic heterocycle [PHGeH2BH2PH2BH2GeH2]&#8722;. In addition, the borane adducts IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GeH2BH2PH2BH3 (3&#8201;a) and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2GeH2PH2BH3 (3&#8201;b) as even longer chain compounds were obtained from reactions of 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b with H3B&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 and were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Accompanying DFT computations give insight into the mechanism and energetics associated with 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b isomerization as well as their decomposition pathways.

         <title>Investigating the Structure&#8208;property Relationships of Two Cd&#8208;based Hybrid Multifunctional Compounds with High Tc, Bright Fluorescence and Wide Band&#8208;gap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two Cd&#8208;based hybrid multifunctional compounds with dual&#8208;stable behavior in dielectric, high transition temperature and bright fluorescence were reported. Then, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8722;C to C&#8722;F), and halide framework (Cl to I) on fluorescent properties.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional materials have shown significant application in lighting and sensor fields, owing to their prominent performance and diversity structures. Herein, we synthesized two multifunctional compounds: (propyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (1) and (F&#8208;butyl&#8208;quinuclidone)2CdBr4 (2). By introducing light&#8208;emitting organic cation with flexible long chain, 1 and 2 exhibit excellent transition properties and bright blue&#8208;white fluorescence. Then, combine fluorescence lifetime and first&#8208;principal calculation, providing evidence for the electron transfer emission. Subsequently, investigated the impact of substituent carbon chain length (methyl to butyl), structural rigidity (C&#8722;C to C&#8722;F) and halide framework (Cl to I) on the fluorescence properties. Results indicate that Cd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cd distance and structural rigidity play an important role in fluorescence. Overall, our research provides valuable insight and example for chemical modifications enhance compound performance.

Herein, we designed a novel PDI&#8208;based Zr&#8208;MOF as a photocatalytic molecular reactor for the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;phase photocatalytic oxidation of sulfur ethers to sulfoxides. High yields and excellent selectivity and recyclability were demonstrated, which provide a basis for further investigation of the mechanism of action of PDI&#8208;MOF in other photocatalytic reactions.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as photocatalytic molecular reactors for varied reactions have drawn great attention. In this work, we designed a novel photoactive perylenediimides&#8208;based (PDI) carboxylate ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;di(3&#8217;,3&#8221;,5&#8217;,5&#8221;&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl))&#8208;1,2,6,7&#8208;tetrachloroperylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid diimide (Cl&#8208;PDI&#8208;TA) and use it to successfully synthesize a novel Zr(IV)&#8208;based MOF 1 constructed from [Zr6O8(H2O)8]8+ clusters bridged by Cl&#8208;PDI&#8208;TA ligands. Structural analysis revealed that Zr&#8208;MOF 1 manifests a 3D framework with (4,8)&#8208;connected csq topology and possesses triangular channels of ~17&#8197;&#197; and mesoporous hexagonal channels of ~26&#8197;&#197; along c&#8208;axis. Moreover, the synthesized Zr&#8208;MOF 1 exhibits visible&#8208;light absorption and efficient photoinduced free radical generation property, making it a promising photocatalytic molecular reactor. When Zr&#8208;MOF 1 was used as a photocatalyst for the aerobic oxidation of sulfides under irradiation of visible light, it could afford the corresponding sulfoxides with high yield and selectivity. Experimental results demonstrated that the substrate sulfides could be fixed in the pores of 1 and directly transformed to the products sulfoxides in the solid state. Furthermore, the mechanism for the photocatalytic transformation was also investigated and the results revealed that the singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide radical (O2&#8901;&#8722;) generated by the energy transfer and electron transfer from the photoexcited Zr&#8208;MOF to oxidants were the main active species for the catalytic reactions. This work offers a perceptive comprehension of the mechanism in PDI&#8208;based MOFs for further study on photocatalytic reactions.

Heavy group 14&#8208;15&#8201;compounds: Various low&#8208;valent group 14&#8211;15 compounds of the type [(Dipp2NacNac)ME(SiMe3)2] (M=Ge&#8722;Pb, E=As&#8722;Bi) were obtained by salt elimination reactions. The focus of these investigations is on the heavy representatives of both groups, on the structures and the reactivity.







Abstract
A series of low&#8208;valent Group 14&#8211;15 compounds were obtained starting from [(Dipp2NacNac)MCl] (M=Ge&#8208;Pb) (I&#8211;III) (Dipp2NacNac=HC{C(Me)N(Dipp)}2) and M'E(SiMe3)2 (M&#8217;=Li, E=As; M&#8217;=K, E=Sb, Bi) (IV&#8211;VI). In the course of this investigations we were able to fully characterize all permutations except Pb&#8722;Bi for compounds of the composition [(Dipp2NacNac)ME(SiMe3)2] (1E: M=Ge, 2E: M=Sn, 3E: M=Pb). Thus, we report the first low valent tetrelene with Sn&#8722;Bi bond. All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and except compound 1As by X&#8208;ray structure analysis. Moreover, were examined UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and investigated the reactivity of these compounds towards different substrates in more detail. Starting with the compound [(Dipp2NacNac)SnAs(SiMe3)2] (2As), the reaction with red selenium yields [(Dipp2NacNac)Sn&#8722;Se&#8208;As(SiMe3)2] (4) which exhibits a Sn&#8722;Se&#8722;As chain.

         <title>Epoxide&#8208;Mediated Trans&#8208;Thioglycosylation and Application to the Synthesis of Oligosaccharides Related to the Capsular Polysaccharides of C. jejuni HS:4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>

Enzyme&#8208;resistant thioglycosides have the potential to be used as potent immunogens in vaccinations. The regio&#8208; and stereoselective opening of pyranosyl epoxides has been taken advantage of to obtain a family of very challenging thiooligosaccharide antigens related to Campylobacter jejuni HS:4 with unprecedented efficiency.







Abstract
The enzyme&#8208;resistant thioglycosides are highly valuable immunogens because of their enhanced metabolic stability. We report the first synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides related to the capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4 for potential use in conjugate vaccines. The native CPS structures of the pathogen consist of a challenging repeating disaccharide formed with &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine; the rare 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl backbone and &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration of the former monosaccharide makes the synthesis of this family of antigens very challenging. So far, no synthesis of the thioanalogs of the CPS antigens have been reported. The unprecedented synthesis presented in this work is built on an elegant approach by using &#946;&#8208;glycosylthiolate as a glycosyl donor to open the 2,3&#8208;epoxide functionality of pre&#8208;designed 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;talo&#8208;heptopyranosides. Our results illustrated that this key trans&#8208;thioglycosylation can be designed in a modular and regio and stereo&#8208;selective manner. Built on the success of this novel approach, we succeeded the synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides including a thiohexasaccharide which is considered to be the desired antigen length and complexity for immunizations. We also report the first direct conversion of base&#8208;stable but acid&#8208;labile 2&#8208;trimethylsilylethyl glycosides to glycosyl&#8208;1&#8208;thioacetates in a one&#8208;pot manner.

         <title>Diindolocarbazole&#8208;Based Rigid Donor&#8208;Acceptor TADF Molecules for Energy and Electron Transfer Photocatalysis

Four twisted D&#8208;A TADF molecules based on diindolocarbazole and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor were synthesized, characterized and utilized for photocatalytic E&#8722;Z isomerization of stilbene and C&#8722;H arylation of heteroarenes.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of four twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules CBZ&#8208;IQ, CBZ&#8208;2FIQ, DI&#8208;IQ and DI&#8208;2FIQ is reported in this work based on diindolocarbazole (DI) and phenyl carbazole as donor and indoloquinoxalines as acceptor. These compounds serve as photocatalysts for organic transformations. Theoretical calculations and experimental data showed reasonable singlet and triplet energy gaps of 0.17&#8208;0.26&#8197;eV for all compounds. All molecules showed increase in fluorescence quantum yields after degassing the solution and the transient photoluminescence decay showed two components: shorter prompt components (11.4&#8197;ns to 31&#8197;ns) and longer delayed components (36.4&#8197;ns to 1.5 &#956;s) which further indicate the occurrence of TADF process. Cyclic voltammetry studies indicated well&#8208;suited excited state redox potentials of all compounds to catalyze organic transformations such as heteroarene arylation. Accordingly, photocatalytic C&#8722;H arylation of heteroarenes were performed using these compounds with excellent isolated yields of upto 80&#8201;%. Due to their suitable efficient triplet energy levels, all the emitters were also employed as energy transfer photocatalysts in E to Z isomerization of stilbene with the excellent conversion of ~90&#8201;%.

Due to their suitable efficient triplet energy levels, all the emitters were also employed as energy transfer photocatalysts in E to Z isomerization of stilbene with the excellent conversion of ~90&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study describes the synthesis and characterization of carbon dots. These nanomaterials can be used as fluorescent sensors. Introduced in the Fricke solution, they detect ionizing radiation by oxidizing Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions. It has high sensitivity to gamma radiation, useful as a tissue&#8208;equivalent dosimeter. Tested as radiation sensors, they showed two regions of linear response.







Abstract
This work explores the potential of carbon dots as a fluorescent probe in the determination of heavy ions and as an electrochemical biosensor. It also discusses how carbon dots can be introduced into the Fricke solution to potentially serve as an ionizing radiation sensor. The study presents a novel tissue equivalent dosimeter carbon dots&#8208;based as an ionizing radiation sensor. The methodology for the synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbon Dots N&#8208;CDs and the characterization of the material are described. The results show that the N&#8208;CDs have a high sensitivity to ionizing radiation and can be used as a dosimeter for radiation detection. The study also discusses the limitations and challenges of using carbon dots as a dosimeter for ionizing radiation. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential applications of carbon dots in different fields and highlights the importance of further research in this area.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated Amination of Pyrogallol&#8208;Based Polyphenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloids are known to be modified by natural polyphenols via amination. This study investigates the oxidative coupling mechanisms between polyphenols and N&#8208;nucleophiles, using in&#8197;vitro and in silico approaches. It is shown that polyphenols with a pyrogallol substructure and an electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the C4a&#8208;position are most effective. These insights can play a crucial role in drug design against amyloidogenesis.







Abstract
Flavonoids are known to covalently modify amyloidogenic peptides by amination reactions. The underlying coupling process between polyphenols and N&#8208;nucleophiles is assessed by several in&#8197;vitro and in silico approaches. The coupling reaction involves a sequence of oxidative dearomatization, amination, and reductive amination (ODARA) reaction steps. The C6&#8208;regioselectivity of the product is confirmed by crystallographic analysis. Under aqueous conditions, the reaction of baicalein with lysine derivatives yields C&#8722;N coupling as well as hydrolysis products of transient imine intermediates. The observed C&#8722;N coupling reactions work best for flavonoids combining a pyrogallol substructure with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group attached to the C4a&#8208;position. Thermodynamic properties such as bond dissociation energies also highlight the key role of pyrogallol units for the antioxidant ability. Combining the computed electronic properties and in&#8197;vitro antioxidant assays suggests that the studied pyrogallol&#8208;containing flavonoids act by various radical&#8208;scavenging mechanisms working in synergy. Multivariate analysis indicates that a small number of descriptors for transient intermediates of the ODARA process generates a model with excellent performance (r=0.93) for the prediction of cross&#8208;coupling yields. The same model has been employed to predict novel antioxidant flavonoid&#8208;based molecules as potential covalent inhibitors, opening a new avenue to the design of therapeutically relevant anti&#8208;amyloid compounds.

         <title>Structurally Diverse Pyrene&#8208;decorated Planar Chiral [2,2]Paracyclophanes with Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence between Monomer and Excimer</title>

Various pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives can be constructed by different substitution modes and connection patterns of [2,2]PCP cores and pyrene units. Diverse structures of these compounds lead to distinctive optical properties.







Abstract
We reported the synthesis of a series of structurally diverse CPL&#8208;active molecules, in which pyrene units were installed to chiral pm/po&#8208;[2,2]PCP scaffolds either with or without a triple bond spacer for pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2, respectively. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that these pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibited diverse structures and crystal packings in the solid phases. The pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives exhibit various (chir)optical properties in organic solutions, depending on their respective structures. In a mixture of dioxane and water, pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 emit green excimer fluorescence, whereas pm/po&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 emit blue one. The chiroptical investigation demonstrated that Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P1 and Rp&#8208;pm&#8208;PCP&#8208;P2 exhibited completely opposite CD and CPL signals even they possess the same chiral Rp&#8208;[2,2]PCP core. The same argument also holds for other chiral pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives. The theoretical calculation revealed that these unusual phenomena were attributed to different orientation between transition electric dipole moments and the magnetic dipole moments originating from the presence or absence of a triple bond spacer. These pyrene&#8208;based [2,2]PCP derivatives display various colours and fluorescence emissions in the solid state and PMMA films, possibly due to the different packings as observed in the crystal structure. Moreover, these compounds also can interact with perylene diimide through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, leading to near&#8208;white fluorescence.

         <title>Bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane Building Blocks as Promising Benzene and Cycloalkane Isosteres: Multigram Synthesis, Physicochemical and Structural Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence (EDIEA) is an efficient approach to bicyclic fused and bridged mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks. The method is applicable for the multigram preparation of the target compounds, which is illustrated by synthesis of over 50 building blocks on up to 150&#8197;g scale. Physicochemical and structural parameters of the title scaffolds illustrate their utility as promising benzene and cycloalkane isosteres and provide a rationale for fine&#8208;tuning the compound's properties during drug optimization.







Abstract
Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence was used to obtain a series of bridged and fused bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane derivatives (i.&#8201;e., bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, bicyclo[3.2.1]octanes, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes, and bicyclo[4.2.0]heptanes). The scope and limitations of the method were established, and applicability to the multigram synthesis of target bicyclic compounds was illustrated. Using the developed protocols, over 50 mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry were prepared. The synthesized compounds are promising isosteres of benzene and cycloalkane rings, which is confirmed by their physicochemical and structural characterization (pKa, LogP, and exit vector parameters (EVP)). &#8220;Rules of thumb&#8221; for the upcoming isosteric replacement studies were proposed.

         <title>An Electrochemical Oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;Indazoles: Synthesis of Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Indazolylindazolones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally benign supporting electrolyte&#8208;free oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;indazole has been developed for the synthesis of symmetrical indazolylindazolones via electrochemical reduction of aerial oxygen. Simultaneously, unsymmetrical coupling products were efficiently produced by cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling between indazolone and 2H&#8208;indazole derivatives through electrochemical C&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
We have established a supporting&#8208;electrolyte free electrochemical method for the synthesis of indazolylindazolones through oxygen reduction reaction (eORR) induced 1,3&#8208;oxo&#8208;amination of 2H&#8208;indazoles where 2H&#8208;indazole is used as both aminating agent as well as the precursor of indazolone. Moreover, we have merged indazolone and indazole to get unsymmetrical indazolylindazolones through direct electrochemical cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC). This exogenous metal&#8208;, oxidant&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free protocol delivered a number of multi&#8208;functionalized products with high tolerance of diverse functional groups.

A metal&#8208;free protocol for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective thioarylation at the C3 position of 6&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonic acid (iminoKdo) is presented. The transformation of these derivatives into 3,6&#8208;disubstituted picolinates was achieved through an acid&#8208;driven deprotection/aromatization sequence. Experimental studies and NMR analyses were employed to elucidate the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
In this work, we present a metal&#8208;free coupling protocol for the regio&#8208; and stereoselective C3&#8208;thioarylation of 6&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,6&#8208;trideoxy&#8208;d&#8208;manno&#8208;oct&#8208;2&#8208;ulosonic acid (iminoKdo). The developed procedure enables the coupling of electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;deficient, and hindered arylthiols, providing a series of C3&#8208;modified iminoKdo derivatives in moderate to good yields. Elucidation of active species through controlled experimental studies and time&#8208;lapse 31P NMR analysis provides insights into the reaction mechanism. We demonstrate that, following a tandem Staudinger/aza&#8208;Wittig reaction of an azido&#8208;containing keto ester, an inseparable equimolar mixture of imine/enamine is formed. The enamine then undergoes a Stork&#8208;like nucleophilic attack with the in&#8197;situ&#8208;formed disulfide reagent, resulting in the formation of the coupling products. Additionally, we describe a rarely reported acid&#8208;promoted aromatization of the C3&#8208;thioarylated iminoKdo skeleton into 3,6&#8208;disubstituted picolinates, which are reminiscent of dichotomines.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Photophysical Properties of Asymmetric Fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we reported the one&#8208;pot synthesis, structures, and properties of novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, in comparison with benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs. The different structures and properties can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. A new BODIPY with helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton and intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption was developed.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a one&#8208;pot procedure to synthesize novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs from &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl)&#8208;pyrrole and acylpyrrole, using 5&#8208;exo cyclization as the key transformation. Compared to benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, although they have similar chemical compositions, their structures and properties significantly differ from each other, which can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. Notably, fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPY 1&#8201;b exhibits helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton, intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption, and peak fluorescence. In addition, the pathway of this one&#8208;pot reaction and the mechanism of POCl3 mediated 5&#8208;exo cyclization have been proposed by a combining experimental and computational study.

Unfolding novel metal carbenes: Silver(III) carbene complexes with square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometries are reported. These unprecedented organosilver(III) compounds exhibit remarkable stability: In the solid state they evolve into mixed&#8208;valence Ag(I)/Ag(III) compounds only at high temperatures (&gt;185&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
We have synthesized the first silver(III) carbene complexes, (CF3)3Ag(NHC), by direct reaction of the silver(III) fluoride precursor complex [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] with different imidazolium salts. This novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. The silver(III) carbene complexes thus prepared are unprecedented and show remarkable thermal stabilities. They display square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometry. Following our calculations, the electronic structure of a model representative complex exhibits Inverse Ligand Field (ILF). The compounds reported herein are synthetic analogues of the elusive difluorocarbene and carbonyl species proposed as intermediates in the acidic decomposition of [Ag(CF3)4]&#8722;. The synthetic procedure reported is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition&#8208;metals in high oxidation states.

         <title>Tridentate NacNac Tames T&#8208;Shaped Nickel(I) Radical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally stable, T&#8208;shaped, nickel(I) radical was straightforward obtained by reduction of a tridentate nacnac nickel(II) chloride with KSi(TMS)3. The metalloradical character of the compound was demonstrated by the formation of a highly unusual nickeloxaziridine complex upon addition of TEMPO. The Ni(I) species displays a rich chemistry towards activation S&#8722;S, and Se&#8722;Se bond leading to unusual C&#8722;C coupled product as well as dihydrogen activation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to generate monomeric nickel hydride.

The reaction of a nickel(II) chloride complex containing a tridentate &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand with a picolyl group [2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3NC(Me)CHC(Me)NH(CH2py)]Ni(II)Cl (1)] with KSi(SiMe3)3 conveniently afforded a nickel(I) radical with a T&#8208;shaped geometry (2). The compound&#8216;s metalloradical nature was confirmed through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies and its reaction with TEMPO, resulting in the formation of a highly unusual three&#8208;membered nickeloxaziridine complex (3). When reacted with disulfide and diselenide, the S&#8722;S and Se&#8722;Se bonds were cleaved, and a coupled product was formed through carbon atom of the pyridine&#8208;imine group. The nickel(I) radical activates dihydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to give the monomeric nickel hydride.

&lt;p&gt;A thermally stable, T-shaped, nickel(I) radical was straightforward obtained by reduction of a tridentate nacnac nickel(II) chloride with KSi(TMS)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The metalloradical character of the compound was demonstrated by the formation of a highly unusual nickeloxaziridine complex upon addition of TEMPO.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Preparation of Sulfones Using Bis&#8208;Piperidine Sulfur Dioxide &#8211; An Underutilized Reagent for SO2 Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot sulfone preparation is reported from alkyl bromides activated by silane&#8208;mediated halogen atom transfer. In the process, a previously unutilized SO2 adduct bis(piperidine) sulfur dioxide &#8211; or PIPSO &#8211; was found to be the best source of SO2 for radical capture under the reaction conditions. Alkyl and aryl sulfones were prepared as well as sulfonylated APIs.







Abstract
Sulfonyl groups are widely observed in biologically relevant molecules and consequently, SO2 capture is an increasingly attractive method to prepare these sulfonyl&#8208;containing compounds given the range of SO2&#8208;surrogates now available as alternatives to using the neat gas. This, along with the advent of photoredox catalysis, has enabled mild radical capture of SO2 to emerge as an effective route to sulfonyl compounds. Here we report a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile sulfonylation of aryl and alkyl bromides making use of a previously under&#8208;used amine&#8208;SO2 surrogate; bis(piperidine) sulfur dioxide (PIPSO). A broad selection of alkyl and aryl bromides were photocatalytically converted to their corresponding sulfinates and then trapped with various electrophiles in a one&#8208;pot multistep procedure to prepare sulfones and sulfonamides.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrins as Supramolecular Reactors for the Three&#8208;component Aza&#8208;Darzens Reaction in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work aims to study the aza&#8208;Darzens reaction using water as a solvent in a nanoconfined environment. This study was carried out on four different gamma&#8208;cyclodextrin systems to evaluate the reaction yield and the cis/trans ratio of the aziridines obtained. In addition, the reaction mechanism was studied using molecular dynamics and the support of mass spectrometry and DOSY experiments.







Abstract
In recent decades, many efforts have been devoted to studying reactions catalyzed in nanoconfined spaces. The most impressive aspect of catalysis in nanoconfined spaces is that the reactivity of the molecules can be smartly driven to disobey classical behavior. A green and efficient three&#8208;component aza&#8208;Darzens (TCAD) reaction using a catalytic amount of &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins (CDs) in water has been developed to synthesize N&#8208;phenylaziridines. CDs effectively performed this reaction in an environmentally friendly setting, achieving good yields. The same reaction was then performed using polymeric &#947;&#8208;CD such as a &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin polymer crosslinked (GCDPC) with epichlorohydrin, a sponge&#8208;like macroporous &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based cryogel (GCDC), and a &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based hydrogel (GCDH). The homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst recovery was then studied, and it was proved to be easily recycled several times without relevant activity loss. Water, as a unique and eco&#8208;friendly reaction medium, has been utilized for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, in this reaction. The inclusion of the reagents in CDs has been studied and rationalized by NMR spectroscopy experiments and molecular modeling calculations. The credit of the presented protocol includes good yields and catalyst reusability and precludes the use of organic solvents.

Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives have attracted significant recent interest in drug discovery as alkyne, tert&#8208;butyl and arene bioisosteres, where their incorporation is frequently associated with increased compound solubility and metabolic stability. While strategies for functionalisation of the bridgehead (1,3) positions are extensively developed, platforms allowing divergent substitution at the bridge (2,4,5) positions remain limited. Recent reports have introduced 1&#8208;electron strategies for arylation and incorporation of a small range of other substituents, but are limited in terms of scope, yields or practical complexity. Herein, we show the synthesis of diverse 1,2,3&#8208;trifunctionalised BCPs through lithium&#8208;halogen exchange of a readily accessible BCP bromide. When coupled with medicinally relevant product derivatisations, our developed 2&#8208;electron &#8220;late stage&#8221; approach provides rapid and straightforward access to unprecedented BCP structural diversity (&gt;20&#8197;hitherto&#8208;unknown motifs reported). Additionally, we describe a method for the synthesis of enantioenriched &#8220;chiral&#8208;at&#8208;BCP&#8221; bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes through a novel stereoselective bridgehead desymmetrisation.

         <title>Solution and Solvent&#8208;Free Stopper Exchange Reactions for the Preparation of Pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing [2] and [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stopper exchange reactions between a rotaxane building block and diamine reagents gave dramatically different outcome in solution and in solvent&#8208;free conditions. Upon a first acylation, an intermediate host&#8208;guest complex with a terminal amine function is obtained. Dissociation of the intermediate occurs in solution but the inclusion complex is preserved under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Diamine reagents have been used to functionalize a [2]rotaxane building block bearing an activated pentafluorophenyl ester stopper. Upon a first acylation, an intermediate host&#8208;guest complex with a terminal amine function is obtained. Dissociation of the intermediate occurs in solution and acylation of the released axle generates a [2]rotaxane with an elongated axle subunit. In contrast, the corresponding [3]rotaxane can be obtained if the reaction conditions are appropriate to stabilize the inclusion complex of the mono&#8208;amine intermediate and the pillar[5]arene. This is the case when the stopper exchange is performed under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions. Alternatively, if the newly introduced terminal amide group is large enough to prevent the dissociation, the second acylation provides exclusively a [3]rotaxane. On the other hand, detailed conformational analysis has been also carried out by variable temperature NMR investigations. A complete understanding of the shuttling motions of the pillar[5]arene subunit along the axles of the rotaxanes reported therein has been achieved with the help of density functional theory calculations.

Alternatively, if the newly introduced terminal amide group is large enough to prevent the dissociation, the second acylation provides exclusively a [3]rotaxane. On the other hand, detailed conformational analysis has been also carried out by variable temperature NMR investigations. A complete understanding of the shuttling motions of the pillar[5]arene subunit along the axles of the rotaxanes reported therein has been achieved with the help of density functional theory calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin qubits of Cu(II) doped in Zn(II) metal&#8211;organic frameworks above microsecond phase memory time</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the occurrence of both magnetic relaxation and spin coherence on single&#8208;ion Cu(II) centers in the three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) having phase memory time above microsecond. It provides a new platform for the application of MOFs as spin quantum materials having fine&#8208;tuning ability.







Abstract
With the aim of creating Cu(II) spin qubits in a rigid metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), this work demonstrates a doping of 5&#8201;%, 2&#8201;%, 1&#8201;%, and 0.1&#8201;% mol of Cu(II) ions into a perovskite&#8208;type MOF [CH6N3][ZnII(HCOO)3]. The presence of dopant Cu(II) sites are confirmed with anisotropic g&#8208;factors (gx=2.07, gy=2.12, and gz=2.44) in the S=1/2 system by experimentally and theoretically. Magnetic dynamics indicate the occurrence of a slow magnetic relaxation via the direct and Raman processes under an applied field, with a relaxation time (&#964;) of 3.5&#8197;ms (5&#8201;% Cu), 9.2&#8197;ms (2&#8201;% Cu), and 15&#8197;ms (1&#8201;% Cu) at 1.8&#8197;K. Furthermore, pulse&#8208;ESR spectroscopy reveals spin qubit properties with a spin&#8208;spin relaxation (phase memory) time (T2) of 0.21&#8197;&#956;s (2&#8201;%Cu), 0.39&#8197;&#956;s (1&#8201;%Cu), and 3.0&#8197;&#956;s (0.1&#8201;%Cu) at 10&#8197;K as well as Rabi oscillation between MS=&#177;1/2 spin sublevels. T2 above microsecond is achieved for the first time in the Cu(II)&#8208;doped MOFs. It can be observed at submicrosecond around 50&#8197;K. These spin relaxations are very sensitive to the magnetic dipole interactions relating with cross&#8208;relaxation between the Cu(II) sites and can be tuned by adjusting the dopant concentration.

Let there be rock! Like the hand of a guitarist moving all over the guitar neck when improvising a solo, the pillar[5]arene moiety of a rotaxane slides over the axle component with preferential positions and a substantial distortion. A complete understanding of such motions was achieved by detailed variable&#8208;temperature NMR investigations with the help of density functional theory calculations. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Nierengarten, J.&#8208;F. Nierengarten, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304131).

An efficient, atom&#8208;economic synthesis for a family of thio&#8208;oligosaccharides related to C.&#8197;jejuni HS:4 capsular polysaccharide is facilitated by epoxide&#8208;mediated trans&#8208;thioglycosylation. Access to these thio&#8208;linked analogs, known to have enhanced metabolic stability, has the potential to boost immunogenicity, accelerating the development of a synthetic vaccine against C.&#8197;jejuni HS:4, a multi&#8208;drug&#8208;resistant pathogen ranked as a high priority by the WHO.

Multipurpose silver(III) fluoride. Access to the first silver(III) carbene complexes has been achieved by reaction of the fluoride [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] precursor with different imidazolium salts. The novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. This synthetic procedure is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition&#8208;metals in high oxidation states. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.

         <title>Fluorinated Polymer Donors for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last decade, the fluorination of polymer donors has dominated the development of high&#8208;performance OSCs. This review summarized the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, fluorinated polymers and their physical and photovoltaic properties. A concise outlook is presented for fluorinated polymer donors to fulfill the practical application of OSCs.







Abstract
The rapid development of narrow&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has boosted the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs) over 19&#8201;%. The new features of high&#8208;performance NFAs, such as visible&#8208;NIR light absorption, moderate the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), and high crystallinity, require polymer donors with matching physical properties. This emphasizes the importance of methods that can effectively tune the physical properties of polymers. Owning to very small atom size and strongest electronegativity, the fluorination has been proved the most efficient strategy to regulate the physical properties of polymer donors, including frontier energy level, absorption coefficient, dielectric constant, crystallinity and charge transport. Owing to the success of fluorination strategy, the vast majority of high&#8208;performance polymer donors possess one or more fluorine atoms. In this review, the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, the fluorinated polymers which are categorized by the type of donor or acceptor units, and the relationships between the polymer structures, properties, and photovoltaic performances are comprehensively surveyed. We hope this review could provide the readers a deeper insight into fluorination strategy and lay a strong foundation for future innovation of fluorinated polymers.

&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, the fluorination of polymer donors has dominated the development of high-performance OSCs. This review summarized the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well-known fluorinated building blocks, fluorinated polymers and their physical and photovoltaic properties. A concise outlook is presented for fluorinated polymer donors to fulfill the practical application of OSCs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid development of narrow-bandgap nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has boosted the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs) over 19&#8201;%. The new features of high-performance NFAs, such as visible-NIR light absorption, moderate the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), and high crystallinity, require polymer donors with matching physical properties. This emphasizes the importance of methods that can effectively tune the physical properties of polymers. Owning to very small atom size and strongest electronegativity, the fluorination has been proved the most efficient strategy to regulate the physical properties of polymer donors, including frontier energy level, absorption coefficient, dielectric constant, crystallinity and charge transport. Owing to the success of fluorination strategy, the vast majority of high-performance polymer donors possess one or more fluorine atoms. In this review, the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well-known fluorinated building blocks, the fluorinated polymers which are categorized by the type of donor or acceptor units, and the relationships between the polymer structures, properties, and photovoltaic performances are comprehensively surveyed. We hope this review could provide the readers a deeper insight into fluorination strategy and lay a strong foundation for future innovation of fluorinated polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design and Biological Application of Hybrid Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we primarily summarized the hybridizations between four classical fluorophores, namely xanthene, cyanine, coumarin and BODIPY. We provided an overview of the connection modes between conjugated and non&#8208;conjugated hybrid fluorophores. Hybrid fluorophores have played an irreplaceable role in the fields of biological detection, diagnosis and treatment.







Abstract
Fluorophores are considered powerful tools for not only enabling the visualization of cell structures, substructures, and biological processes, but also making for the quantitative and qualitative measurement of various analytes in living systems. However, most fluorophores do not meet the diverse requirements for biological applications in terms of their photophysical and biological properties. Hybridization is an important strategy in molecular engineering that provides fluorophores with complementarity and multifunctionality. This review summarizes the basic strategies of hybridization with four classes of fluorophores, including xanthene, cyanine, coumarin, and BODIPY with a focus on their structure&#8208;property relationship (SPR) and biological applications. This review aims to provide rational hybrid ideas for expanding the reservoir of knowledge regarding fluorophores and promoting the development of newly produced fluorophores for applications in the field of life sciences.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic framework (COFs) is a promising electrode material, which has the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area, excellent thermal stability. The effective strategies (introducing active sites, constructing conjugated structures, carbon composites, etc.) for improving the conductivity and stability of COFs materials are summarized, and the current challenges and future design directions of COFs electrodes are discussed.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of porous crystalline polymeric materials constructed by linking organic small molecules through covalent bonds. COFs have the advantages of strong covalent bond network, adjustable pore structure, large specific surface area and excellent thermal stability, and have broad application prospects in various fields. Based on these advantages, rational COFs design strategies such as the introduction of active sites, construction of conjugated structures, and carbon material composite, etc. can effectively improve the conductivity and stability of the electrode materials in the field of batteries. This paper introduces the latest research results of high&#8208;performance COFs electrode materials in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs, PIBs and LSBs) and other advanced batteries. The current challenges and future design directions of COFs&#8208;based electrode are discussed. It provides useful insights for the design of novel COFs structures and the development of high&#8208;performance alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Solution and Solvent&#8208;Free Stopper Exchange Reactions for the Preparation of Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Containing [2] and [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 12, February 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;The dramatically different outcome of the stopper exchange reactions performed in solution and under mechanochemical solvent&#8208;free conditions is certainly the most important finding reported in this paper.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202304131).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the group of Iwona and Jean&#8208;Fran&#231;ois Nierengarten from the University of Strasbourg (LIMA, UMR 7042, CNRS) and collaborators from the University of Carthage and the IPHC (University of Strasbourg and CNRS, UMR 7178). The image illustrates the fast motions of a pillar[5]arene subunit along the axle of a rotaxane, reminiscent of those of a guitarist's hand along the neck allowing him to use random parts of a scale with certain sweet spots when improvising a solo.

         <title>The Role of Base in Reaction Performance of Photochemical Synthesis of Thiazoles: An Integrated Theoretical and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) is emerging as pivotal in synthetic chemistry, offering revolutionary potential in retrosynthetic analysis, reaction conditions and reaction prediction. We have combined chemical descriptors, primarily based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, with various AI/ML tools such as Multi&#8208;Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF), to predict the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylbenzothiazole in photoredox reactions. Significantly, our models underscore the critical role of the molecular structure and physicochemical characteristics of the base, especially the total atomic polarizabilities, in the rate&#8208;determining steps involving cyclohexyl and phenethyl moieties of the substrate. Moreover, we validated our findings in articles through experimental studies. It showcases the power of AI/ML and quantum chemistry in shaping the future of organic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrasensitive Solvatochirochromism of Single Benzene Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solvents influence the structure, aggregation and folding behaviors of solvatochromic compounds. Ultrasensitive solvent mediated chiroptical response is conducive to the fabrication of molecular platform for sensing and recognition, which however, remains great challenges in conceptual or applicable design. Here we report a cysteine&#8208;based single benzene chromophore system that shows ultrasensitivity to solvents. Compared to the ratiometrically responsive systems, the chiroptical activities could be triggered or inverted depending on the substituents of chiral entities with an ultralow solvent volume fraction (&lt;1 vol%). On drop of dipolar solvents shall significantly induce the emergence or inversion of chiroptical signals in bulky phases. Based on the experimental and computational studies, the ultrasensitivity is contributed to the intimate interplay between solvents and chiral compounds that anchors the specific chiral conformation. It illustrates that structurally simple organic compounds without aggregation or folding behaviors possess pronounced solvatochiroptical properties, which sheds light on the next&#8208;generation of chiroptical sensors and switches.</dc:description>

         <title>In2Q2: A New Entry of 16&#8208;Membered Tetraazamacrocycle Concatenating Indole and Quinoline Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of 16&#8208;membered macrocycles comprising two indole (In) and two quinoline (Q) units, coined In2Q2, was synthesized. Each unit is diagonally located and concatenated in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion, furnishing a non&#8208;flat saddle&#8208;shaped architecture with C2 symmetry. The synthetic protocol utilizing macrocyclic diamide as a pivotal precursor allowed us to access a series of In2Q2 derivatives bearing various substituents on the periphery. The In2Q2 derivatives and their Zn2+ complexes were emissive in both solution phase and solid state. While the entire architecture of In2Q2 is similar to that of quinoline tetramer TEtraQuinoline, a couple of contrasting physicochemical properties were revealed.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Ionic Liquids: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ionic liquids are an extraordinary group of compounds, fully ionic in structure like inorganic salts but with low melting points, that resemble organic molecular solvents. Their chemical, electrochemical, and thermal stability is what draws the attention and enables their use in many applications, including electrochemical power sources. Even though they are no longer considered eco&#8208;friendly because of nonnegligible toxicity and long bioaccumulation, they can still be efficiently recovered, purified, and reused. These attributes can be harvested to enhance the properties of gel polymer electrolytes for the emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The variety of ions and cations for ILs and their influence on the final properties of the compound opens the road to tuning the properties of gel polymer electrolytes. Ionic liquids as plasticizers constitute a major part of gel polymer electrolytes (average of 70 wt%) and hence, they affect the fundamental properties of gel electrolytes like ionic conductivity and electrochemical window. They also improve the safety features of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is relevant for their anticipated applications in stationary energy storage and electric vehicles. The presented review paper aims to explain the relationship between the cation and anion in ionic liquid and the properties of gel electrolytes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Internal Vanadium doping and external modification design of P2&#8208;type layered Mn&#8208;based oxides as competitive cathodes toward Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P2&#8208;type layered manganese&#8208;based oxides have attracted considerable interest as economical, cathode materials with high energy density for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Despite their potential, these materials still face challenges related to sluggish kinetics and structural instability. In this study, a composite cathode material, Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@Na3V2O2(PO4)2F was developed by surface&#8208;coating P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2 with a thin layer of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F to enhance both the electrochemical sodium storage and material air stability. The optimized Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@5wt%Na3V2O2(PO4)2F exhibited a high discharge capacity of 176 mA h g&#8208;1 within the 1.5&#8208;4.1 V range at a low current density of 17 mA g&#8208;1. At an increased current density of 850 mA g&#8208;1 within the same voltage window, it still delivered a substantial initial discharge capacity of 112 mAh g&#8208;1. These findings validate the significant enhancement of ion diffusion capabilities and rate performance in the P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 material conferred by the composite cathode.</dc:description>
