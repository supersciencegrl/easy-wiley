         <title>Ester&#8208;Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;Ketene Acetals with Solid&#8208;State Luminescence: AIEgens from Sequential Three&#8208;Component Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difference in nucleophilicity of alcohols and S,N&#8208;ketene acetals sets the stage for the desymmetrizing acylation of diaroyl chlorides in a consecutive one&#8208;pot fashion in good yields. The ester&#8208;functionalized aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals are solid&#8208;state emitters that emit in solution only upon aggregation. Upon encapsulation in polystyrene nanoparticles, the fluorescence quantum yield enhances significantly.








Abstract
Di(hetero)aroyl dichlorides are desymmetrized upon sequential reaction with alcohols and 2&#8208;methyl N&#8208;benzyl thiazolium salts within the course of a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction yielding ester&#8208;substituted aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals under mild conditions in good yields. A prerequisite for the concise one&#8208;pot process is the different nucleophilicity of the alcohols and in situ generated S,N&#8208;ketene acetals. The resulting compounds are merocyanines with dominant charge&#8208;transfer absorption bands which are fluorescent in the solid state, but not in solution. In water/ethanol solvent mixtures of increasing water content, the water&#8208;insoluble dyes display typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. The water fraction inducing AIE as well as the emission color, and fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;f) of the aggregated dyes can be controlled by the alcohol part of the ester moiety. Encapsulation into polystyrene nanoparticles can lead to a considerable increase of the fluorescence quantum yield &#934;f to 30% as shown for a representatively chosen dye revealing the highest &#934;f of 11% within the dye series in the water/ethanol mixtures and enabling the usage of these dyes as fluorescent reporters in aqueous environments.

         <title>4&#8208;Dimethylamino&#8208;1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide as a Fluorescence Signal Amplification for Site Selective and in Situ Probing of the Hydroxyl Radical</title>

4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NMI) as new fluorescence&#8208;responsive tool for HO&#8226; detection. Proof of concept illustrating that NMI selectively probes HO&#8226; produced by Cu&#8208;bound to A&#946;16 in presence of scavengers with an amplified response.








Abstract
Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in several diseases. Copper can be an efficient catalysts for ROS generation, as it was suggested for Cu bound to aberrant sites. Determination of rates and type of ROS production in more complex biological media is challenging and often only down&#8208;stream events can be monitored. Here, a selective detection of the hydroxyl radical (HO&#8226;), by a demethylation of 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NMI) fluorescence probe by HO&#8226; resulting in &#8764;25&#8208;fold increase in quantum yield is reported. To investigate potential applications, the NMI was coupled to the Cu&#8208;binding domain of amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;16). This allowed the in situ fluorescence detection of HO&#8226; produced by A&#946;16 bound Cu due to the Fenton&#8208;type reaction. In a more complex medium with scavengers present including in cell culture conditions, the HO&#8226; produced in the bulk was not detected, in line with the short life&#8208;time of HO&#8226; in the presence of other molecules. Thus, this is a proof of concept to show that NMI reaction&#8208;based HO&#8226; detection could be a useful and a versatile tool to investigate in situ the role of HO&#8226; in a defined location such as Cu bound to A&#946;16 in biologically relevant complex systems

         <title>Recent Advances in Detergent Chemistry and Handling Support Membrane Protein Analysis Including Lipid Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 49, September 1, 2025. </description>

Detergent design parameters determine experimental successes in membrane protein research. Recent progresses in detergent chemistry are reviewed to promote the top&#8208;down design of non&#8208;ionic detergents for the purification and analysis of intact membrane proteins, including lipid interactions.








Abstract
Non&#8208;ionic detergents are key reagents for the characterization of membrane protein drug targets. Suitable detergents are commonly identified by trial and error, which leads to failed preparations and raising costs. Recent findings suggest that not only the chemistry of detergents but also the strategy with which detergents and proteins are brought together impact the successes of investigations. To facilitate the future development of non&#8208;ionic detergents in membrane protein research, herein, we review chemical design concepts and detergent exchange strategies for a successful integration of detergents into the analysis of challenging membrane protein complexes. Our overview reveals exciting opportunities to tackle existing challenges, including the stabilization of G&#8208;protein coupled receptors, the development of fluorinated detergents for studying protein&#8211;lipid binding, top&#8208;down design of detergents, and hybrid detergents for the identification of non&#8208;canonical lipid associations to proteins with relevance to antibiotic research. Our review will facilitate the development of chemical tools for the biophysical characterization of membrane proteins and support the discovery of biological findings in the&#160;future.

         <title>The Application of PEG&#8208;functionalized Amphiphilic Pillararene in Drug Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 49, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes the application of PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes in drug delivery systems for chemotherapy, phototherapy, and gas therapy of tumor. Some corresponding examples were discussed in detail to evaluate their performance in chemotherapy, phototherapy, and gas therapy of tumor. At the end, some future developmental directions for PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes were also put forward.








Abstract
As a new generation of supramolecular host macrocyclic molecules, pillararenes display many advantages including simple synthesis routes, rigid electron&#8208;rich structures, unique host&#8208;guest interactions, and adjustable cavity sizes, which make them widely be used in drug delivery systems for precise diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The molecular functions of pillararenes can be easily expanded through the introduction of different functional groups into the side chain. For example, polyethylene glycol (PEG) which has good biocompatibility and water solubility can be used to construct PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes. These PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes can be used to construct the nanocarriers with good water solubility and excellent biocompatibility through their self&#8208;assembly to deliver hydrophobic drugs. Although there are many reviews introducing the application of amphiphilic pillararenes in drug delivery, there are still no comprehensive articles summarizing such type of pillararenes. In this paper, based on their functional characteristics, the applications of PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararene in drug delivery systems have been summarized. We focused on the relationship between their molecular design and functional application, providing reasonable guidance for the structural design of amphiphilic pillararenes.

&lt;p&gt;As a new generation of supramolecular host macrocyclic molecules, pillararenes display many advantages including simple synthesis routes, rigid electron-rich structures, unique host-guest interactions, and adjustable cavity sizes, which make them widely be used in drug delivery systems for precise diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The molecular functions of pillararenes can be easily expanded through the introduction of different functional groups into the side chain. For example, polyethylene glycol (PEG) which has good biocompatibility and water solubility can be used to construct PEG-functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes. These PEG-functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes can be used to construct the nanocarriers with good water solubility and excellent biocompatibility through their self-assembly to deliver hydrophobic drugs. Although there are many reviews introducing the application of amphiphilic pillararenes in drug delivery, there are still no comprehensive articles summarizing such type of pillararenes. In this paper, based on their functional characteristics, the applications of PEG-functionalized amphiphilic pillararene in drug delivery systems have been summarized. We focused on the relationship between their molecular design and functional application, providing reasonable guidance for the structural design of amphiphilic pillararenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox Mediated Synthesis of Substituted Imidazoles from Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 49, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light photoredox&#8208;induced approach for the synthesis of substituted imidazoles via alkynes, glycine methyl ester, and thiophenol is presented. The reaction is driven via photoinduced exploration of alkynes and their combination with thiol, producing vinylic radical and its subsequent nucleophilic addition to glycine methyl ester as N&#8208;source to produce imidazoles via concurrent two C&#9472;N bond formations.








Abstract
A visible light photoredox&#8208;induced approach for the synthesis of substituted imidazoles via alkynes, glycine methyl ester, and thiophenol is presented. The reaction is facilitated by the photoinduced activation of alkynes, coupled with thiol, which generates a vinylic radical. This radical subsequently undergoes a nucleophilic addition to glycine methyl ester, serving as a nitrogen source, thereby leading to the formation of imidazoles through the concurrent creation of two carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds.

Three functionalized Zr(IV) MOFs detect nitrophenols in water by rapid and strong fluorescence quenching with detection limits below 0.040 &#181;M, showing promise for real&#8208;time, in&#8208;field applications.








Abstract
Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are widely used industrial chemicals, recognized as both environmental pollutants and explosive hazards. Optical sensors are gaining increasing research ground as they&#160;offer a platform for the&#160;rapid and efficient in&#8208;field detection of NACs. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of three new fluorescent&#160;metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on Zr(IV) and structurally analogous to UiO&#8208;66, with the assigned formula {Zr6O4(OH)8(H2O)4(L)1&#8208;x(NH2bdc2&#8722;)x}. The incorporation of strongly fluorescent ligands 2&#8208;((2&#8208;methoxybenzyl)amino)terephthalic acid (L&#8208;2), 2&#8208;((3&#8208;methoxybenzyl)amino)terephthalic acid (L&#8208;3), and 2&#8208;((4&#8208;methoxybenzyl) amino)terephthalic acid (L&#8208;4) resulted in the formation of MOFs Zr&#8208;2, Zr&#8208;3, and Zr&#8208;4, respectively. These materials feature pendant &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich aromatic groups and basic secondary amine functionalities, which are suitable for donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with the electron&#8208;deficient and acidic NACs 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrophenol (TNP) and 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenol (DNP). Fluorescence titration experiments on protonated samples (pZr&#8208;2, pZr&#8208;3, and pZr&#8208;4) demonstrate that our MOFs selectively respond to small concentrations of TNP and DNP in H2O, by exhibiting strong emission quenching with detection limits estimated below 0.030 &#181;M for TNP and 0.040 &#181;M for DNP. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence studies reveal very fast response times (&#8764;1&#160;s) for pZr&#8208;2 and pZr&#8208;3, making them promising candidates for real&#8208;time, in&#8208;field detection applications.

         <title>Citrate&#8208;Assisted Solvothermal Synthesis of SnO2 Porous Microflowers as Efficient Cathode for Advanced Hybrid Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 49, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
SnO2 porous microflowers were prepared by a citrate&#8208;mediated solvothermal route along with a post&#8208;annealing treatment in air. Such SnO2 flowers exhibited a battery&#8208;type electrochemical response with a great specific capacity of 177.2 C g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 in 2&#160;M of KOH electrolyte. The assembled SnO2 microflowers//AC hybrid supercapacitor delivered a high specific energy of 29.5&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 at 883.9&#160;W kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Herein, mesoporous tin dioxide materials with distinct structures (SnO2 microflowers and SnO2 microsheets) were, respectively, prepared via a citrate&#8208;mediated solvothermal route along with a post&#8208;annealing treatment in air. Electrochemical tests revealed a typical battery&#8208;type charge storage behavior of SnO2 materials. Attributing to the 3D hierarchical flower&#8208;like structure and its good conductivity, the SnO2 microflowers possessed a specific capacity of 177.2 C g&#8722;1, slightly greater than 159.0 C g&#8722;1 achieved by SnO2 microsheets under 1 A g&#8722;1. When assembled into hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) utilizing activated carbon (AC) as an anode, the SnO2 microflowers//AC HSC device delivered a high energy density (ED) of 29.5&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 at 883.9&#160;W kg&#8722;1, surpassing SnO2 microsheets//AC HSC (26.9&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 at 881.7&#160;W kg&#8722;1). Furthermore, both SnO2//AC HSCs exhibited long&#8208;term stability, showing 113.2% (SnO2 microflowers//AC) and 106.4% (SnO2 microsheets//AC) capacity retention over 5000 cycles. Notably, this synthesis strategy achieves facile morphological control and improved electrochemical properties of SnO2 materials by adjusting the sodium citrate amount. These results indicate that SnO2 microflowers and SnO2 microsheets are attractive candidates for high&#8208;performance HSC assembly. Furthermore, this cost&#8208;effective approach can provide a reference for synthesizing other advanced metal oxide&#8208;based electrode materials.

         <title>The Ability of Enzymes to Preserve Reactive Conformations During Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions can be an Important Factor for Efficient Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 49, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes may not only generate catalytic competent conformations for enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes but also be able to preserve the reactive conformations to the stage when the reactions reach TS to allow catalytic residues to exert their effects. Such property could be lost for some mutants, leading to diminished TS stabilization and significant reduction of catalytic efficiency. Blue: enzyme; Yellow: substrate; Orange: the altered structure of substrate in TS.








Abstract
Determining strategies used by enzymes to achieve enormous rate enhancements has been a central goal in biochemical research. The abilities to form catalytic competent reactive conformations for enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes with well&#8208;positioned residues and to lower activation barriers through transition state (TS) stabilization are two accepted mechanisms. Enzymes might have evolved to possess other unrecognized strategies to achieve rate enhancements, and identification of such strategies is of fundamental importance. Here we perform a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical study of carnosine N&#8208;methyltransferase 1 and its mutants, and results indicate that enzymes may possess the ability to preserve reactive conformations and prevent their premature distortions into less active forms during reactions. For wild&#8208;type, the reactive conformation can be formed in the enzyme&#8208;substrate complex and be preserved to the stage when the reaction reaches TS. For Tyr386Ala, Tyr396Asp, and Tyr398Ala, the wild&#8208;type&#8208;like reactive conformations can be formed in the mutant&#8208;substrate complexes but undergo distortions into less active conformations in the early stage of the reaction before TS. Such premature distortions of the wild&#8208;type&#8208;like reactive conformations in the mutant complexes prevent residues from fully exerting catalytic effects. Thus, the ability to preserve reactive conformations may be an important feature for some enzymes and can make important contributions to catalytic efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;Enzymes may not only generate catalytic competent conformations for enzyme-substrate complexes but also be able to preserve the reactive conformations to the stage when the reactions reach TS to allow catalytic residues to exert their effects. Such property could be lost for some mutants, leading to diminished TS stabilization and significant reduction of catalytic efficiency. Blue: enzyme; Yellow: substrate; Orange: the altered structure of substrate in TS.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining strategies used by enzymes to achieve enormous rate enhancements has been a central goal in biochemical research. The abilities to form catalytic competent reactive conformations for enzyme-substrate complexes with well-positioned residues and to lower activation barriers through transition state (TS) stabilization are two accepted mechanisms. Enzymes might have evolved to possess other unrecognized strategies to achieve rate enhancements, and identification of such strategies is of fundamental importance. Here we perform a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical study of carnosine N-methyltransferase 1 and its mutants, and results indicate that enzymes may possess the ability to preserve reactive conformations and prevent their premature distortions into less active forms during reactions. For wild-type, the reactive conformation can be formed in the enzyme-substrate complex and be preserved to the stage when the reaction reaches TS. For Tyr386Ala, Tyr396Asp, and Tyr398Ala, the wild-type-like reactive conformations can be formed in the mutant-substrate complexes but undergo distortions into less active conformations in the early stage of the reaction before TS. Such premature distortions of the wild-type-like reactive conformations in the mutant complexes prevent residues from fully exerting catalytic effects. Thus, the ability to preserve reactive conformations may be an important feature for some enzymes and can make important contributions to catalytic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Mediated C&#8208;S Bond Formation: Mechanistic Insights from the state&#8208;crossing tRNA Methylthiolation by the Radical SAM Enzyme MiaB</title>

Iron&#8208;sulfur cluster chemistry: The mechanism of the MiaB&#8208;catalyzed methylthiolation of N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine at position 37 in tRNA is elucidated. The reaction sequence clearly demonstrates that the state&#8208;crossing methylthiolation occurs following C2&#8208;H abstraction by 5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&#8226;. Moreover, the essential role of the auxiliary [3Fe&#8208;4S] cluster is revealed, as it functions as both the methyl carrier and the direct sulfur donor during catalysis.








Abstract
The radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme MiaB is a bifunctional catalyst that mediates the posttranscriptional methylthiolation of N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine (i6A37) at position 37 in tRNA. Herein, density functional calculations were employed to elucidate the two stages of MiaB&#8208;catalyzed modification: methylation and sulfur insertion at the C2 position of i6A37. MiaB contains two iron&#8208;sulfur clusters: a radical SAM cluster ([4Fe&#8208;4S]RS) and an auxiliary cluster ([3Fe&#8208;4S]Aux). Our calculations demonstrate that the [4Fe&#8208;4S]RS cluster is essential for generating the potent oxidant 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosyl radical (5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&#8226;) via the reductive cleavage of SAM and that the [3Fe&#8208;4S]Aux cluster serves both as the carrier of methyl and as a direct sulfur donor during catalysis. Furthermore, it is revealed that a state crossing occurs during the methylthio installation at the substrate, which follows C2&#8208;H abstraction by 5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&#8226;. Additionally, substituting Arg66 with glutamine highlights its critical role in stabilizing the substrate radical and modulating MiaB activity. Overall, our work advances the understanding of iron&#8208;sulfur cluster chemistry and inert C&#8208;H bond activation within the growing superfamily of radical SAM enzymes, offering insights for translating the catalytic advantages of natural enzymes into synthetic transition&#8208;metal complexes and functional materials.

         <title>Mild and Selective Trifluoromethylation of Peptides at Tryptophane Residues by a Water&#8208;Soluble Copper Complex with Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
Selective functionalization of aminoacids is a key endeavor in chemical biology. Radical manifolds offer interesting possibilities but can suffer from limited control over radical processes, resulting in a lack of selectivity in product distribution. A water&#8208;soluble copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands has been developed and performs trifluoromethylation of tryptophane residues with high selectivity. This method displays both inter&#8208; and intramolecular selectivity and its synthetic relevance is demonstrated by the selective conversion of a 13&#8208;residue peptidic sequence and an endomorphine analogue in good yields.








Abstract
Selective chemical modifications of biomolecules are in high demand for the development and implementation of chemical biology strategies. Methods involving radicals have emerged as powerful options yet potentially generate side reactivities when involving harsh reaction conditions. We report the development of a mild catalytic method for the selective functionalization of tryptophane residues in peptides with a trifluoromethyl group using a water&#8208;soluble copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands. This method displays both inter&#8208; and intramolecular selectivity for tryptophane residues and its synthetic relevance is demonstrated by the selective conversion of a 13&#8208;residue peptidic sequence and an endomorphine analogue in good yields.

         <title>Metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based Conductive Frameworks as Working Electrode for Dehydrogenase&#8208;Like Electrochemical Oxidation of Thioethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 49, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of polymetallophthalocyanines as working electrode achieves dehydrogenase&#8208;like electrochemical oxidation of thioethers with excellent Faradaic efficiency over 96.3% and nearly 100% product distribution to sulfoxides, along with a high conversion rate of 0.238 mmol&#160;h&#8722;1, outperforming carbon paper electrodes.








Abstract
The selection of electrode materials is critical to the reactivity and selectivity for organic electrosynthesis. In this work, we for the first time use polymetallophthalocyanines (pMPcs) as working electrode for the efficient and highly selective oxidation of sulfide. pMPcs was found to be able to mediate sulfide oxidation with dehydrogenase&#8208;like activity, in which water acts as an oxygen source, for a broad substrate scope, including pharmaceuticals. Among the pMPcs electrodes, pFePc exhibits the highest catalytic selectivity with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.3% and nearly 100% product distribution for the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides, as well as the highest conversion rate of 0.238&#160;mmol h&#8722;1. Studies combining spectroscopic experiments and computational approaches reveal that the mechanism of oxidation of sulfide involves the proton&#8208;coupled oxidation of Fe&#9472;OH2 to generate Fe&#9552;O intermediates on the metal atom of the metal&#8208;N4 units of pMPcs. This work highlights the potential for the application of conductive framework materials in organic&#8208;electrical synthesis.

         <title>A Mechanistic Insight into the Emission Behavior of Boron Difluorohydrazones (BODIHYs): Suppression of Kasha's Rule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 49, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Kasha property of phenanthrene&#8208;based BODIHY compounds leads to excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent RGB emissions. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that both molecules emit from three different excited states, namely S1, S2, and S3. Importantly, the phenyl&#8208;substituted BODIHY exhibits thermal equilibrium between S1 and S2, while S3 does not.








Abstract
Single component&#8208;based molecules and materials exhibiting excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emission are of significant interest in both academic and industrial contexts. Luminophores capable of emitting multiple colors in response to different excitation wavelengths often deviate from Kasha's rule. The boron difluorohydrazone (BODIHY) derivatives reported herein exhibit excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emissions, illuminating red, green, and blue (RGB) colors. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that this multi&#8208;color luminescence originates from three bright excited states, namely, S1, S2, and S3. Such anomalous fluorescence in small organic molecules that possess three bright excited states and emit RGB as a function of excitation wavelength is unique and unprecedented. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations indicate that the energy gap (&#916;E) between S2 and S3 exceeds 3000 cm&#8722;1 (0.37&#160;eV), facilitating radiative decay S3&#8594;S0 over the competitive nonradiative decay. For compound 1, the &#916;E(S1&#8211;S2) was found to be&#160;&lt;&#160;2000 cm&#8722;1 (0.25&#160;eV), leading to thermal equilibrium between the two states. In contrast, compound 2 possesses three distinct excited states that fluoresce independently due to large energy gaps between them. Furthermore, different excitation spectra, fluorescence lifetimes, and photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) for these emission bands indeed support the presence of three bright excited electronic states.

Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations indicate that the energy gap (&#916;E) between S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exceeds 3000 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (0.37&#160;eV), facilitating radiative decay S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; over the competitive nonradiative decay. For compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, the &#916;E&lt;sub&gt;(S1&#8211;S2)&lt;/sub&gt; was found to be&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;2000 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (0.25&#160;eV), leading to thermal equilibrium between the two states. In contrast, compound &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; possesses three distinct excited states that fluoresce independently due to large energy gaps between them. Furthermore, different excitation spectra, fluorescence lifetimes, and photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) for these emission bands indeed support the presence of three bright excited electronic states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The ion pairs, consisting of the polarized porphyrin AuIII complex as a dipolar &#960;&#8208;electronic cation, formed crystal&#8208;state ion&#8208;pairing assemblies based on antiparallel stacking structures stabilized by dispersion forces along with reduced electrostatic repulsion originating from the dipole&#8211;dipole interactions.








Abstract
A porphyrin AuIII complex comprising 5,10&#8208;penatafluorophenyl units was synthesized as a dipolar &#960;&#8208;electronic cation. The &#960;&#8208;electronic cation was combined with anions, including a bulky borate anion and planar &#960;&#8208;electronic anions. The dipolar &#960;&#8208;electronic cation formed crystal&#8208;state ion&#8208;pairing assemblies based on antiparallel stacking structures, which were stabilized by interionic dipole&#8211;dipole interactions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Heterochiral and Homochiral Peptides Conjugated to PNA Dimers and Their Integration in Peptide&#8208;Based Hydrogels</title>

Homochiral PNA&#8208;peptide conjugates mixed to homochiral peptides yield hydrogels supporting cell growth.








Abstract
Hybrid biomolecules composed of short peptides and nucleic acid analogues can self&#8208;assemble and are good candidates to produce new materials thanks to their biocompatibility and versatility. The assembly occurs by exploiting hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions between nucleobases and amino acids. The organization of the molecules at the supramolecular level is dictated by the structure of the assembling units. In this work we explored the effect of chirality on the self&#8208;assembly of PNA&#8208;peptide conjugates. We focused on homochiral and heterochiral peptides conjugated to PNA dimers and we characterized by spectroscopic techniques the assembled objects. Furthermore, we investigated the ability of the conjugates to form hydrogels in combination with the peptides. The architecture of the assembled molecules in the hydrogels was investigated, as well as the ability of hydrogels to support cell growth. Interestingly, hydrogels formed by homochiral and heterochiral mixtures show pores of different size. In the hydrogels cells grow along a specific direction, dictated by the fiber axis formed by the assembled compounds and their viability seems related to the gel pore size.

         <title>Tuning Electrocatalytic Energy Release in Norbornadiene&#160;Based Molecular Solar Thermal Systems Through Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 49, September 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated how push&#8211;pull substituents influence the electrochemically driven energy release in norbornadiene&#8208;based MOST systems. Electron&#8208;donating groups proved to be decisive, with p&#8208;methoxyphenyl derivatives achieving up to 99% selectivity. These insights offer valuable design guidelines for future MOST systems.








Abstract
Molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems, such as the norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) pair, combine solar energy conversion, storage, and release in a simple one&#8208;molecule process. The energy&#8208;releasing reaction QC to NBD can be controlled electrochemically. In this study, we used in&#8208;situ photoelectrochemical infrared spectroscopy (PEC&#8208;IRRAS) together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate how electron donating (EDG) and electron withdrawing (EWG) groups in the push&#8208;pull system of the MOST pair affect the electrocatalytic properties of the electrochemically triggered back&#8208;conversion. Specifically, we investigated cyano, tosyl, and methyl ester groups as EWGs, and methoxy, dimethylamine, thioether, and diphenylamine groups located in the para&#8208;position of a phenyl group as EDGs. We characterized the onset potential, electrochemical stability window, and selectivity. We found that these properties strongly depend on the strength of electron donation of the EDG, as it exclusively locates the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and raises its energy level. We obtained the highest selectivity for compounds with p&#8208;methoxyphenyl functionality.

         <title>Rational Design of Cationic Silyl Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a family of selanyl&#8208;stabilized silyl cations is reported. Variations of the scaffold, the substituents at the silicon and the selenium atoms allow to adjust their Lewis acidity over a wide range. The Lewis acidity is quantified by the FBN method.








Abstract
The synthesis of a series of selanyl&#8208;stabilized cationic silyl Lewis acids with naphthalene or acenaphthalene scaffolds is described. The influence of scaffold modifications, substitution variations at the selanyl donor and at the silicon atom on the strengths of the silyl Lewis acid is evaluated using the p&#8208;fluorobenzonitrile (FBN) method. These simple variations of the principal structure allow to adjust the Lewis acidity of the cationic silyl Lewis acids from weak ones to examples that are significantly stronger than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF). The solid&#8208;state structure of the cationic FBN complex [11(FBN)]+ with an acenaphthene backbone and a pentafluorophenylselanyl donor provides evidence for the penta&#8208;coordination of the silicon atom in this complex, in agreement with the results of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies in solution. Finally, this study suggests that the FBN method is well suited to assess even very subtle differences in the strength of Lewis acids.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrite at a Copper(II) Trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;ONO Complex via Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer and Oxygen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the synthesis of a copper(II) nitrite complex which possesses unusual trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O binding mode in trigonal bipyramidal geometry, and characterization through various physicochemical methods. The reduction of NO2&#8722; to release NO&#8226; was examined through PCET and OAT by using ferrocene and PPh3, respectively. DFT calculations revealed that the isomerization of trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O to &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is the key step for the OAT. The superiority of &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode in the OAT was further rationalized by molecular orbital analysis.








Abstract
Reduction of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) to nitric oxide (NO) serves important roles in NO&#8208;dependent signaling as well as in the broad nitrogen biogeochemical cycle. In biological system, copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductases (CuNiRs) are well known to bind a nitrite anion to mediate the nitrite reduction to release NO, of which the mechanism still requires further understanding. Herein, synthetic copper(II) nitrite complex with a rare binding mode, [CuII(iPr3&#8208;tren)(trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;ONO)]+ (2), is characterized physicochemically and examined in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to release NO. For the first time to gain mechanistic insights into the trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O binding copper(II) nitrite complex, detailed kinetic studies in company with theoretical calculations have been performed for oxidation of triphenylphosphine (PPh3), which shows that isomerization of trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O to &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is necessary to exert electrophilic OAT. The better reactivity of &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is attributed to a fine orbital mixing of Cu&#8208;dz2 with highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of NO2&#8722;, thereby imposing much larger electron density on NO2&#8722; moiety. Thus, it is suggested that the reactivity of the copper(II) nitrite complex is conjunctly related to the binding mode of nitrite.

     alt="Reduction of Nitrite at a Copper(II) Trans-&#954;1-ONO Complex via Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer and Oxygen Atom Transfer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we describe the synthesis of a copper(II) nitrite complex which possesses unusual &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-O binding mode in trigonal bipyramidal geometry, and characterization through various physicochemical methods. The reduction of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to release NO&#8226; was examined through PCET and OAT by using ferrocene and PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. DFT calculations revealed that the isomerization of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-O to &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-N binding mode is the key step for the OAT. The superiority of &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-N binding mode in the OAT was further rationalized by molecular orbital analysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduction of nitrite (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) to nitric oxide (NO) serves important roles in NO-dependent signaling as well as in the broad nitrogen biogeochemical cycle. In biological system, copper-containing nitrite reductases (CuNiRs) are well known to bind a nitrite anion to mediate the nitrite reduction to release NO, of which the mechanism still requires further understanding. Herein, synthetic copper(II) nitrite complex with a rare binding mode, [Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-tren)(&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-ONO)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), is characterized physicochemically and examined in proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to release NO. For the first time to gain mechanistic insights into the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-O binding copper(II) nitrite complex, detailed kinetic studies in company with theoretical calculations have been performed for oxidation of triphenylphosphine (PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which shows that isomerization of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-O to &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-N binding mode is necessary to exert electrophilic OAT. The better reactivity of &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-N binding mode is attributed to a fine orbital mixing of Cu-d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;2 with highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby imposing much larger electron density on NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; moiety. Thus, it is suggested that the reactivity of the copper(II) nitrite complex is conjunctly related to the binding mode of nitrite.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cooperativity wins: Judiciously designed heterobimetallic conjugates of Ru(II) and Fe(II) metal centers have shown remarkable redox cooperativity to achieve living and well&#8208;defined acrylate polymers.








Abstract
Employing heterobimetallic complexes (HBCs) offers an exciting and powerful strategy for various catalytic applications. Here, we present an unorthodox synthetic route to synthesize a novel RuII&#8208;FeII heterobimetallic complex by implementing the strategy of &#8220;metalation with functionalization.&#8221; This complex utilizes a redox&#8208;assisted concerted strategy to facilitate the controlled radical polymerization (CRP) of acrylate monomers with significantly low catalyst loading. To understand the efficiency of the bimetallic catalyst over the other corresponding monometallic complexes, controlled polymerization experiments on acrylate monomers have been carried out. The redox cooperativity for efficient living CRP is very much pronounced and established in the RuII&#8208;FeII heterobimetallic dyad as evidenced by multiple orthogonal experimental results and the interesting rearrangement in the frontier molecular orbitals during catalysis steps. A plausible mechanistic pathway is proposed based on insights from electroparamagnetic resonance spectroscopy, cyclic voltametry, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, rigid potential energy scans (PES), and the Fukui function. A modified atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) mechanism is offered by RuII&#8208;FeII conjugate, where redox&#8208;cooperativity and intramolecular electron transfer (IET) between the metal centers play a crucial role. This study investigates the potential of redox cooperativity in heterobimetallic systems, highlighting their efficacy as adaptable catalytic platforms.

         <title>Expanding Chemistry of Expanded Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advances in the chemistry of expanded helicenes, defined as helicenes containing linearly fused benzene rings, as novel aromatic compounds. This review begins with a summary of their structural classification, followed by the synthesis, structures, properties, and chiroptical performance of expanded helicenes of various shapes, such as hexagons, triangles, and rhombuses.








Abstract
Expanded helicenes are interesting compounds created by modifying the original helicene structure through the incorporation of linearly fused benzene rings, enlarging the helical diameter. Motivated by Tilley et&#160;al.&#8217;s report of a key expanded helicene structure in 2017, several research groups have synthesized such nonplanar aromatic compounds, aiming to explore their impressive structures, properties, and chiroptical performance. This review highlights recent advances in the expanded helicene chemistry through experimental and theoretical studies. The shape and length of helical structures depend on the number and combination of angularly and linearly fused benzene rings. Helical structures are classified using notations, and specific compounds corresponding to each structural form, namely, hexagonal, triangular, rhombic, or others, are introduced herein. As an extension of the molecular design, examples of nonhexagonal and heteroaromatic ring&#8208;embedded expanded helicenes are presented. Specifically, this review focuses on how the diameters, lengths, and turn numbers of helical structures depend on dynamic processes involving helical inversion and chiroptical properties (circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)). The characteristics and perspectives of this molecular design are also discussed.

         <title>Host Cavities Enhance the Photocatalytic Conversion of &#945;&#8208;Terpinene to Ascaridole Under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY&#8208;functionalized host molecules are effective visible&#8208;light photosensitizers for the conversion of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to ascaridole in the presence of molecular oxygen, providing up to a 28&#8208;fold increase in the rate of conversion depending on the host employed.








Abstract
BODIPY&#8208;functionalized host molecules have been used as effective visible&#8208;light photosensitizers in the conversion of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to ascaridole in the presence of molecular oxygen. Host&#8208;guest interactions enhance the effective local concentration of the substrate and singlet oxygen generated by the photosensitizing host. This results in up to a 28&#8208;fold increase in the rate of conversion depending on the host employed. A tetramethyl BODIPY analogue, in which guest access to the host cavity is blocked, was also employed to confirm that the cavities do indeed enhance substrate turnover. Whilst the latter photocatalyst is more efficient due to the suppression of nonradiative relaxation pathways associated with rotation of the meso&#8208;phenyl substituent, the rate enhancement induced by host&#8208;guest binding is not present. Combined, this provides insight for the future design of enhanced systems.

         <title>An Unusual Activity of Conformationally Restricted Naphthalene Peri&#8208;Dichalcogenides in the Reduction of Nitro and Azide Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the unique ability of a conformationally restricted dichalcogenide to reduce nitro and azide groups to their corresponding amines under physiological conditions. The redox potential is strongly influenced by the nature of chalcogen atom substitution as well as the conformational rigidity of the dichalcogenide bond.








Abstract
Rigid and conformationally restricted dichalcogenides based on 1,8&#8208;naphthyl system have attracted significant interest as electron donors in charge transfer complexes and organic electrode materials. Recently, naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;peri&#8208;diselenides have been shown to mimic the function of two major selenoenzymes&#160;&#8722;&#160;iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) &#8722; mainly through two&#8208;electron redox processes involving deiodination of thyroid hormones and thiol&#8208;mediated reduction of hydrogen peroxide, respectively. Herein, we report that naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;peri&#8208;dichalcogenides can mediate a six&#8208;electron reduction of organic nitro compounds to produce the corresponding primary amines at physiologically relevant temperature (37 &#176;C) using water as the solvent. The stepwise reduction process is highly dependent on the nature of the chalcogen atom present at the peri&#8208;positions of the naphthyl ring. While no reduction was observed with the disulfide, the selenenyl sulfide mediated a four&#8208;electron reduction of the nitro group to the corresponding hydroxylamine. The diselenide and ditelluride reduced the nitro groups all the way to amines through six&#8208;electron transfer. The diselenides also mediated the reduction of various aromatic azides to the corresponding primary amines.

         <title>New ESIPT&#8208;Dyes of Record Capacity to Fluorescence Detection of H&#8208;Bond Donor and Acceptor Molecules, Including Local Water Concentration</title>

Multi&#8208;color fluorescent labels for detecting local water concentration at a selected cite of lipid&#8208;protein, protein&#8208;protein or protein&#8208;DNA complexes.








Abstract
5&#8208;Substituted 3&#8208;hydroxychromones (3&#8208;HCs) are challenging to synthesize but are of significant interest as fluorescent labels. This is primarily due to the pronounced modulation of their fluorescence by surrounding molecules, a consequence of the 5&#8208;substituent's proximity to the negative pole of the molecular dipole. The newly synthesized derivatives of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;chromene&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid exhibit unique fluorescence behaviors. Their color of emission is highly sensitive to the solvation environment and is strongly influenced by the nature of the functional group introduced at position 5. Notably, the fluorescence of acid demonstrates inhibition of ESIPT (excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer) in both neutral and H&#8208;bond donor solvents, a phenomenon not previously observed in 3&#8208;HCs. Furthermore, investigated dye stands out as the first 3&#8208;HC compound whose fluorescence responds to the H&#8208;bond acceptor capacity of the environment, particularly in mildly acidic conditions (below pH 6). In contrast, methyl ester and glycine amide of key acid are responsive to the H&#8208;bond donor properties of their surroundings&#8212;a feature especially relevant in biological systems, where local water concentration plays a critical role. Thus, the derivatives such as N&#8208;terminal or lysine&#8208;labeled peptides incorporating these dyes can serve as valuable tools for investigating peptide&#8208;DNA, peptide&#8208;lipid, and other biomolecular interactions for the selected location of peptide.

         <title>Electrochemical and Photoelectrochemical Transformations of Thioamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes efficient EC and iPEC methods for the transformation of thioamides. The EC approach is inexpensive, mild, and metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free. On the other hand, the interfacial iPEC method, due to the lower applied potential, proved to be beneficial in terms of broadening the scope and limitations and energy efficiency.








Abstract
Pursuing innovative and environmentally friendly synthetic strategies is always a desirable goal in organic synthesis, and thus, we have developed green and sustainable electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (iPEC) transformations of thioamides into amides. The established EC protocol is inexpensive, mild, and metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free. iPEC cells are extensively studied for solar energy conversion, but their application in synthesizing high&#8208;value organic molecules has been limited. Here, we describe a strategy to use BiVO4, an abundant and robust photoanode, for the desulfurization of thioamides. Under light irradiation, the photogenerated holes in BiVO4 oxidize thioamides to radical cations, which further react with the oxygen radical anion to produce amides. The proposed iPEC strategy presents a high promise for green organic chemical transformations with the goal of maximizing not only the atom economy but also the energy efficiency.

         <title>A Bichromophoric Triazatruxene Tetrad as a Highly Tunable Multicolor Emitter and Its Application in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on a TAT tetrad, whose propargylic linkers electronically decouple the central TAT unit from the peripheral ones. This results in dual fluorescence and, at 77&#160;K, dual phosphorescence emission. The emission color varies with excitation wavelength from blue to yellowish white or orange.








Abstract
We report on the new star&#8208;shaped triazatruxene (TAT) tetrad 1, where three peripheral TAT moieties connect to a central TAT through propargylic spacers. The insulating nature of the linkers results in separate, partially overlapping blue and yellow&#8208;orange emissions from the peripheral and central TATs. This renders 1 a multicolor emitter, whose emission color can be tuned by the choice of the excitation wavelength and the solvent. In frozen solution, dual fluorescence emission from the two different types of TATs is complemented by dual phosphorescence with radiative lifetimes in the range of seconds. Organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) constructed with 1 as the emissive layer achieved a peak irradiance of 5.87 &#181;W/nm/m2 at 580&#160;nm at an operation voltage of 6.7&#160;V. Remarkably, the emission color of the electroluminescence can be varied from yellow over different hues of orange to red or&#160;even to near infrared (NIR) emission, depending on the applied voltage. Tetrad 1 is also redox&#8208;active, indicating that 1 may simultaneously serve as a hole conductor and emitter. Its oxidized forms are panchromatic absorbers from the near UV to the NIR due to intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;TAT charge&#8208;transfer (CT) absorptions.

         <title>A Strategic Advance from Pincer Complexes to Hexadentate&#8208;Co(III) Catalyst for Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperative Activation of Primary Alcohols to Access Highly Functionalized Pyrimidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have developed a first cobalt(III) catalyst [Co(III)BPMAP&#8208;O]ClO4 supported by a hexadentate ligand system with a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative approach for sustainable multicomponent reaction to access a library of highly substituted pyrimidines (150 examples) using dehydrogenation of aromatic as well as inactive aliphatic primary alcohols.








Abstract
In this report, we present a sustainable, eco&#8208;friendly, practical, and cost&#8208;effective one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction for the synthesis of a diverse library of highly substituted pyrimidines from amidines, primary alcohols, and aromatic ketones, catalyzed by a cobalt(III) complex. The well&#8208;defined cobalt(III) complex [Co(III)BPMAP&#8208;O]ClO4 is derived from a redox&#8208;active phosphine&#8208;free, pentadentate mono&#8208;carboxamide ligand (BPMAP&#8208;H), and is formed in situ from various cobalt(II) sources, including CoCl2&#183;6H2O, CoBr2, Co(NO3)2&#183;6H2O, Co(OAc)2&#183;4H2O via oxygen activation. Using aromatic ketones and benzyl alcohols, a wide range of 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyrimidines (TriPym) and 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted pyrimidines (TetraPym) were synthesized (119 examples) in isolated yields of up to 93%. The catalytic system is also applicable to aliphatic ketones and aliphatic primary alcohols, affording 31 additional examples with yields of up to 92%. Control experiments and DFT calculations support a plausible mechanism involving dehydrogenation of the alcohols through a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative pathway.

         <title>Acidity Controlled Formal Nucleophilic Substitution of Hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;based Iodonium Salt with O&#8208;nucleophiles: Synthetic Application and Mechanistic Study</title>

         <dc:description>
A new method using hypervalent iodonium species derived from hydrofluoroolefin gas enables fast, mild, and efficient synthesis of fluoroalkyl ethers from phenols. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies show that phenol acidity influences the reaction pathway.








Abstract
The development and mechanistic investigation of a novel O&#8208;fluoroalkylation of phenol derivatives using a hypervalent fluoroalkyliodonium salt, derived from hydrofluoroolefin gas (HFO&#8208;1234yf) as bulk fluorous feedstock, is reported. Optimization of the reaction conditions enabled versatile and efficient synthetic applications, and the synthetic study revealed phenol acidity&#8208;dependent selectivity of the O&#8208;fluoroalkylation process. The mechanistic behavior of phenols was supported by both experimental studies and DFT calculations. As a result, we showed that more acidic phenols (pKa &lt; 5) undergo direct O&#8208;alkylation, while reactions of the fluoroalkyliodonium salt involving less acidic phenol substrates proceed via a base&#8208;assisted chloride elimination and substitution pathway. Deuterium&#8208;labeling and halide competition experiments further validated the proposed mechanism. This practical and scalable method provides access to structurally diverse fluoroalkyl ethers and holds significant potential for applications in medicinal and materials chemistry.

         <title>The Important Role of the Polarization Effect in Cationic Hypervalent Chalcogen Bonds Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations demonstrate that increasing the central atom size (Se/Te) and incorporating stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (&#8208;CF3, &#8208;F, &#8208;NO2) in cationic hypervalent ChB catalysts amplify the &#963;&#8208;hole, thereby strengthening ChB interactions. This polarization effect significantly lowers the bromine transfer barrier in the NBS bromolactonization reaction, enabling efficient and tunable organocatalysis.








Abstract
Chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysts have recently garnered considerable attention in the field of organocatalysis owing to their advantages of nontoxicity, environmental sustainability, extensive applicability, affordability, and remarkable reactivity. In this work, the Se&#8208; and Te&#8208;based cationic hypervalent ChB catalysis on the bromolactonization reaction of N&#8208;Bromosuccinimide (NBS) with 4&#8208;pentenoic acid is investigated by high&#8208;level density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The ChB&#8208;catalyzed bromolactonization reaction has an intricate process involving bromine transfer, cyclization, and proton transfer. Moreover, the bromine transfer process is identified as the rate&#8208;determining step with the highest Gibbs free energy barrier. The increase in the size of the central atom in the ChB catalysts and the enhancement of electron&#8208;withdrawing capabilities with greater dipole moments of substitutions on the catalysts provide larger &#963;&#8208;holes with stronger polarization effects, resulting in stronger ChB interactions with the reactant, thus lowering the reaction barrier. From a kinetic perspective, different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the catalyst can be used to regulate the reaction rate, leading to better experimental outcomes. These findings demonstrate the important roles of polarization effects in cationic hypervalent chalcogen bonds catalysis and provide a theoretical foundation for the development of novel environmentally friendly and efficient hypervalent ChB catalysts.

         <title>Speciation and Luminescence of a Binuclear Lanthanide Complex Bearing an Aminophenolate Chromophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide complexes are used in patients and for bioimaging and assays. The solution structure and speciation are critical when evaluating function, and here we fully unravel the structure and photophysics of a binuclear lanthanide complex.








Abstract
Lanthanide(III) complexes show diverse speciation in solution. Here, the photophysical properties and speciation in solution of binuclear lanthanide complexes bearing an aminophenolate chromophore that reversibly bind to both metal centers were determined. The aminophenolate can reversibly bind to both lanthanide ions in a pH dependent manner. Above pH 3 the phenolate moiety remains deprotonated and the lanthanide complexes exhibit very high kinetic stability, however, protonation of the amino group modulates the luminescence intensity without changing the luminescence lifetime of the lanthanide. Below pH 3, protonation of the phenol results in a flexible, open structure, leading to reversible demetallation of the lanthanide complex as the system comes under thermodynamic control. This study highlights the importance of a detailed understanding of both the speciation and pH responsive behavior of highly luminescent binuclear lanthanide complexes for their development as responsive probes. These results confirm the promise of phenolate derived binuclear complexes as highly luminescent responsive probes, modulated by changes in pH.

         <title>Systematic Mapping of Homoserine Lactone and Cyclodextrin Binding Strengths &#8212; Effects of Structural Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding of homoserine lactone (HSL) signaling molecules used by Gram&#8208;negative bacteria with native and substituted cyclodextrin (CD) host molecules was mapped. Between differently substituted HSLs with different alkyl chain lengths, chain length governed binding affinity. Between &#945;&#8208;CD and &#946;&#8208;CDs, the wider &#946;&#8208;CD cavity was found to be more tolerant of substitutions in terms of binding constant.








Abstract
Directing the collective behavior of bacteria is important for various applications in chemical bioproduction, water treatment, and antibiofilm solutions. A potential approach to such control mechanisms lies in sequestering signal molecules (autoinducers) by macrocyclic host molecules that lower the effective concentration of the former, modulating bacterial signaling. Cyclodextrins (CD) &#8212; one of the best&#8208;established families of hosts &#8212; have been shown to bind homoserine lactones (HSL) acting as autoinducers, but with a focus limited to shorter (&#8804; 8 carbons) tailed molecules and &#946;&#8208;CD. Here, we have systematically mapped binding affinities for HSLs of three different tail lengths and with different 3&#8208;site substituents (used for signal differentiation), with native and substituted &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;CDs. The HSL alkyl chain length has the most influence on affinity, although the 3&#8208;substitution also slightly affects the binding constant. Little difference between native CDs was observed, but the binding ability of &#945;&#8208;CD was more susceptible to even minute substitutions. The wider &#946;&#8208;CD core could be substituted with greater modularity without impairing HSL binding ability. The results constitute an initial chemical toolbox to be applied in guiding host design for HSL sequestering in, for example, therapeutic applications, but also in constructing systems for the modulation of bacterial collective behavior.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclobutenoates From Photochemical Rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;Diazo Cyclopropanes and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ring expansion of &#945;&#8208;cyclopropyl diazoacetates into cyclobutenoates upon irradiation at 425&#160;nm was reported in moderate to excellent yields (17% to 75%) and moderate to good regioisomeric ratio (55:45 to 82:18). The formation of two regioisomers was explained using DFT calculations as well as the involvement of a singlet state carbene.








Abstract
The ring expansion of &#945;&#8208;cyclopropyl diazoacetates into cyclobutenoates upon irradiation at 425&#160;nm was reported. This method allowed an access to a large array of cyclobutenoates as a mixture of regioisomers. The products were isolated in moderate to excellent yields (17% to 75%) and moderate to good regioisomeric ratio (55:45 to 82:18). The synthetic utility of the products was showcased and the mechanism was studied. Thanks to DFT calculations, the formation of two regioisomers was explained as well as the involvement of a singlet state carbene.

         <title>Small Molecular Dibenzochalcogenophenes as Potent Organic Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review compiles recent achievements and applications of purely organic small luminescent DBC. We present frequently employed functionalities and design strategies, accomplishing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). In addition, we discuss the challenges for luminescent selenium and tellurium derivatives as well as the influence of commercial impurities on the photophysical properties of this compound class.








Abstract
Dibenzochalcogenophenes (DBC) have attracted huge attention ever since the discovery that they are able to act as potent (phosphorescent) emitters more than 60 years ago. From then on, they were extensively used as versatile emissive platforms for applications in materials science and optoelectronics. In this review, we focus on the main achievements of the past 20 years, highlighting especially monomolecular small purely organic compounds with less than 10 aromatic units and only one chalcogenophene moiety. Besides this, we wish to focus on their emission properties and to evaluate general design principles to fine&#8208;tune photophysical properties.

         <title>Reusable Br&#248;nsted Acidic Ionic Liquid Catalyzed Reductive Alkylation of Quinolines to Functionalized Tetrahydroquinolines</title>

Abstract
A Br&#248;nsted acidic ionic liquid (BAIL)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem reduction of quinoline to tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) followed by reductive alkylation by the aldehyde has been demonstrated under mild reaction conditions with a shorter reaction time. This step&#8208;economical synthetic approach is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates a wide range of reducible&#8208;sensitive functional groups. The current reductive N&#8208;alkylation approach was also successfully utilized to synthesize novel tricyclic oxazino&#8208;fused&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline/benzoxazine compounds via tandem reductive cyclization of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;(8&#8208;quinolinyloxy) ethanones. Further reductive protocol has been applied for the synthesis of antiarrhythmic drug nicainoprol and tubulin polymerization inhibitor efficiently. Notably, BAIL was easily recovered and reused multiple times without a considerable loss in catalytic activity. The elucidation of the underlying mechanism was achieved through a combination of several control experiments, kinetic studies, and isotopic labelling experiments. This study offers a new reaction pathway for the reduction of quinoline, in which BAIL facilitates proton transfer through a distinctive hydrogen bonding ion&#8208;pair mechanism.

         <title>Synthetic Membranes for Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries (AORFBs): towards&#160;High Conductive and Selective Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have emerged as a leading electrochemical technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, using water&#8208;based electrolytes to deliver inherent safety and cost efficiency. High&#8208;performance ion exchange membranes&#160;promote the battery performance, including energy/power densities, operational durability, and Coulombic/energy efficiencies. This review examines recent advances in ion channel engineering for AORFB membranes, focusing on chemical synthesis strategies, structural optimization approaches, and ion channel architecture evolution. We analyze characterization methodologies for diverse membrane types, their corresponding cell performance, and design principles.&#160;We highlight conductivity&#8208;permeability relationships across membrane architectures, particularly microphase separation, microporous channels, and dual&#8208;ion configurations, establishing fundamental structure&#8208;property correlations.&#160;These insights provide a strategic roadmap for future ion channel design in membranes, advancing practical frameworks for high&#8208;performance AORFBs.








Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have emerged as one of the most promising electrochemical technologies for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their use of water&#8208;based electrolytes, offering safety and cost advantages over organic solvent&#8208;based systems. AORFBs utilize organic molecules derived from earth&#8208;abundant elements, enabling tunable properties such as solubility, stability, and redox potential at the molecular level. These features enable improvements in energy and power densities, operational lifetimes, and efficiency metrics in the battery system. However, the lack of suitable ion exchange membranes limits the energy efficiency, power density, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Membrane design for AORFBs faces challenges in balancing conductivity and permeability, requiring precise control over ion transfer channel size, quantity, and interconnection. This review summarizes recent advances in AORFBs membrane design, focusing on ion channel engineering through chemical and microstructural adjustments. We highlight the impact of these designs on membrane conductivity, permeability, and overall cell performance, aiming to provide a practical framework for developing superior membranes for future grid&#8208;scale AORFBs applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;Disubstituted Isoquinoline&#8208;Containing Lipoxin A4 Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(1R)&#8208; and (1S)&#8208;Epimers of novel isoquinoline&#8208;derived SPMs were prepared, with a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction and a Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation as the key synthetic steps. Biological assessment demonstrated that several analogues significantly attenuate lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B activation and downstream pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretion, including IL&#8208;6, IL&#8208;1&#946;, and TNF.








Abstract
The resolution of inflammation is increasingly recognized as an active, highly regulated process essential for restoring tissue homeostasis following immune activation. Lipoxin&#8208;A4 (LXA4), an endogenous specialized pro&#8208;resolving mediator (SPM), plays a central role in this process through activation of the ALX/FPR2 receptor. However, its clinical application is limited by rapid metabolic degradation and poor in vivo stability. In this study, we report the design, asymmetric synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;disubstituted isoquinoline&#8208;based analogues of LXA4 (Isoq&#8208;sLXms), designed to enhance metabolic stability. The synthetic route employed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck cross&#8208;coupling and Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, affording diastereomerically pure compounds. Biological assessment in THP&#8208;1 LUCIA monocytes demonstrated that several analogues, particularly (1R)&#8208;8, significantly attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B activation and downstream pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretion, including IL&#8208;6, IL&#8208;1&#946;, and TNF. Functional assays using ALX/FPR2&#8208;transfected HEK&#8208;293 cells revealed that (1R)&#8208;8 acts as a partial agonist, supporting its role in engaging pro&#8208;resolving signaling mechanisms. Safety profiling confirmed low cytotoxicity across physiologically relevant concentrations. These findings demonstrate that isoquinoline&#8208;based LXA4 mimetics retain and enhance key pro&#8208;resolving bioactivities while offering improved stability and receptor selectivity. (1R)&#8208;8 emerges as a promising lead compound for the development of resolution&#8208;directed therapeutics in the context of chronic inflammation.

         <title>Electron Density&#8208;Dependent Mallory Photocyclization Constructs Rigid Saddle&#8208;Shaped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Enhanced Aromaticity</title>

         <dc:description>
Saddle&#8208;Shaped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons have been synthesized via highly efficient Mallory reaction, and exhibited extended aromatic skeleton with high quantum yields in solutions and aggregation casued quenching in solid states.








Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of three saddle&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)&#8212;bFT&#8208;C, bFP&#8208;C, and bFP2&#8208;C&#8212;via Mallory photocyclization of bisfluorenylidene&#8208;dihydroacene precursors. The reaction achieved high yields (77&#8211;88%) under UV irradiation, with structural characterization confirming enhanced aromaticity and rigid frameworks in the cyclized products. Kinetic studies revealed that anthracene&#8208;containing bFP2 exhibited the fastest reaction rate, which we attribute to its elevated electron density. Photophysical studies showed strong solution fluorescence (PLQY: 45&#8211;48%) but aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in solids due to enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Electrochemical analyses revealed reversible redox processes, while low&#8208;temperature spectroscopy identified deep&#8208;red phosphorescence (lifetimes: 72.6&#8211;270.0&#160;ms). This work demonstrates how precursor architecture governs reaction kinetics and photophysical properties, providing a design strategy for nonplanar PAHs with tailored luminescence characteristics.

         <title>Transformation of Silyl&#8208;Protected Tetrafluorinated Thia[6]helicene S&#8208;Oxide into a Difluorinated Coronene via Induced Desilylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimethylsilyl&#8208;protected tetrafluorinated thia[6]helicene S&#8208;oxide undergoes a more efficient transformation to difluorinated coronene than its unprotected S&#8208;oxide and S,S&#8208;dioxide counterparts. Si&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions and in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated sulfur monoxide facilitate selective desilylation, offering mechanistic insight into this cascade transformation.








Abstract
Sulfur oxidation of thiophene rings is an effective strategy for constructing substituted and polycyclic arenes via Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, wherein each thiophene ring is converted into a benzene ring. In the context of converting helicenes into planar coronenes, tetrafluorinated thia[6]helicene S,S&#8208;dioxide undergoes a smooth intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to afford the difluorinated coronene. However, the corresponding S&#8208;oxide counterpart is affected by competing side reactions that limit its utility. Herein, we demonstrate that introducing a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group onto the thiophene S&#8208;oxide ring suppresses self&#8208;condensation and enables more efficient coronene conversion than its S,S&#8208;dioxide counterpart. Unexpectedly, the TMS group is removed during the transformation, yielding both the TMS&#8208;protected and deprotected forms of the difluorinated coronene. Mechanistic investigations suggest that this desilylation arises from the combined effect of Si&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions and in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated sulfur monoxide (SO). These findings provide insights into the reactivity control of thiophene S&#8208;oxides and demonstrate how silicon, fluorine, and SO can influence cascade transformations toward functionalized polycyclic aromatic systems.

&lt;p&gt;Trimethylsilyl-protected tetrafluorinated thia[6]helicene &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-oxide undergoes a more efficient transformation to difluorinated coronene than its unprotected &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-oxide and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-dioxide counterparts. Si&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions and in-situ-generated sulfur monoxide facilitate selective desilylation, offering mechanistic insight into this cascade transformation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfur oxidation of thiophene rings is an effective strategy for constructing substituted and polycyclic arenes via Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, wherein each thiophene ring is converted into a benzene ring. In the context of converting helicenes into planar coronenes, tetrafluorinated thia[6]helicene &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-dioxide undergoes a smooth intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to afford the difluorinated coronene. However, the corresponding &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-oxide counterpart is affected by competing side reactions that limit its utility. Herein, we demonstrate that introducing a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group onto the thiophene &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-oxide ring suppresses self-condensation and enables more efficient coronene conversion than its &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-dioxide counterpart. Unexpectedly, the TMS group is removed during the transformation, yielding both the TMS-protected and deprotected forms of the difluorinated coronene. Mechanistic investigations suggest that this desilylation arises from the combined effect of Si&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions and in-situ-generated sulfur monoxide (SO). These findings provide insights into the reactivity control of thiophene &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-oxides and demonstrate how silicon, fluorine, and SO can influence cascade transformations toward functionalized polycyclic aromatic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Layered MnAl Complex Oxide Realizes the Efficient Aerobic Oxidative Transformations of 1,2&#8208;Diols and Alcohols Under Normal Pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient catalyst based on MnAl layered double oxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDO) has been developed for the aerobic oxidative transformations of 1,2&#8208;diols and alcohols under normal pressure without any additives. The excellent electron transfer ability and strong surface basic sites of the catalyst realize the oxidation primarily via two&#8208;electron transfer (TET), and minorly via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes.








Abstract
An efficient and convenient MnAl layered double oxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDO) catalyst has been developed. Characterization results indicated that Mn2Al&#8208;LDO exhibits an improved ability of electron transfer and increased surface strong basic sites on its surface compared to the layered double hydroxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDH) precursor and conventionally prepared Mn2AlOx. These characters endow the Mn2Al&#8208;LDO with excellent catalytic performance in the aerobic oxidative cleavage of 1,2&#8208;diols under normal pressure without additives. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that both the two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) and single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes are included in the catalytic reaction, with the former being more prominent. The Mn2Al&#8208;LDO catalytic system can tolerate a broad substrate scope, including monosubstituted 1,2&#8208;diols, internal 1,2&#8208;diols, primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, and various &#945;&#8208;functionalized alcohols. Additionally, the Mn2Al&#8208;LDO catalytic system also exhibits excellent catalytic stability and shows great potential for application in cascade transformations.

         <title>Inherently Chiral Calix[4]Arene Derivatives: Concept and Enantioselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The past decade has seen a significant rise in the enantioselective synthesis of calix[4]arene derivatives with inherent chirality, which arises from the twisted macrocyclic structures of the linked aryl groups. This development is crucial for applications in chiral catalyst design and the creation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Two main strategies have been extensively explored: the de novo synthesis of macrocycles and the desymmetrization of prochiral calix[4]arene derivatives. This review highlights the enantioselective synthetic approaches used to achieve inherently chiral calix[4]arene derivatives and offers a forward&#8208;looking perspective on future advancements in this field.








Abstract
Calix[4]arene derivatives possess chirality derived from macrocycles with twisted linked aryls and have numerous applications in chiral recognition, chiral sensors, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, and enantioselective catalysis. Due to their unique structural scaffolds, calix[4]arene derivatives have seen increased attention in enantioselective synthesis in recent decades. Although many achievements have been made in this area based on desymmetrization or de novo macrocycle synthesis strategies, new calix[4]arene derivatives structures and efficient enantioselective synthesis methodologies are highly desirable. This review highlights recent enantioselective synthesis strategies and provides perspectives for future developments.

Abstract
Mirror&#8208;image poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes have emerged as promising biocatalytic platforms due to their exceptional enzymatic stability and low immunogenicity. Currently, the sole reported mirror&#8208;image plastic&#8208;degrading enzyme, the D&#8208;form of 231&#8208;residue PET hydrolase ICCG (engineered leaf&#8208;branch compost cutinase variant), suffers from thermophilic activity requirements, which limits its practical applications. Here, the first total chemical synthesis of a mirror&#8208;image 271&#8208;residue D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase was presented by using an enzyme&#8208;cleavable solubilizing tag strategy. Comparative kinetic analysis revealed that D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase showed a remarkable increase (&#8764;20&#8208;fold within 24&#160;hours) in PET degradation efficiency compared to D&#8208;ICCG at temperatures of 37 &#176;C, making it a promising candidate for prolonged PET decomposition in open environments and holding potential in addressing microplastic&#8208;related health issues within the biomedical field. This work not only expands the chemical biology toolbox for mirror&#8208;image enzyme synthesis but also establishes D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase as a candidate in combating the dual crises of global plastic pollution and microplastic&#8208;associated health risks.

         <title>Pyrrole&#8208;Imine Macrocycle: Self&#8208;Organizing Cross&#8208;Reactive Anion Receptor and Sensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imine macrocycle comprising pyrroles as hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and an environmentally sensitive fluorophore displays a wide cross&#8208;reactive binding, which, in combination with an analyte&#8208;specific fluorescence response allows differentiation between ten analytes and their concentrations. Thus, one cross&#8208;reactive sensor performs the work of multiple, essentially acting as a &#8220;sensor array of one molecule&#8221;.








Abstract
Self&#8208;organizing macrocyclic receptor&#8208;sensors for phosphorus oxyanions, phosphates, and phosphonates comprising imine moieties were prepared by condensation of dipyrrolylmethane dicarbaldehyde with diethylene triamine. The incorporation of flexible ethylene moieties endows the macrocycle with unprecedented flexibility and ability to accommodate numerous phosphorus oxyanions from orthophosphate to large anions such as ATP or phosphonate glyphosate. The anion binding was elucidated by NMR titrations, low&#8208;temperature NMR, and NOESY NMR. The incorporation of dansyl fluorophore enables sensing of anions using the fluorescence signal, whereas the changes in fluorescence intensity, width of the fluorescence band, and position of the maxima are analyte&#8208;specific and useful in recognition and identification of eleven different P&#8208;oxyanions in water. The affinity (Kassoc) for Na+ salts was H2PO4&#8722; &#8776; Methylphosphonate&#160;&gt;&#160;H2P2O72&#8722; &gt; Phenylphosphonate&#8208;&#160;&gt;&#160;Glyphosate2&#8208;&#160;&gt;&#160;AMP2&#8208; &gt; ADP2&#8722; &gt; ATP2&#8722;. Interestingly, phosphonates, including methylphosphonate and glyphosate anions, were also found to display a strong affinity (Kassoc&#160;&#8764;106 M&#8722;1) while halides, nitrate, carbonates, or hydrogen sulfate did not show a significant affinity. The determined fluorescence spectral parameters were used to classify the 12 analytes (11 anions and water) using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Quantification was performed using LDA and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the phosphonate concentrations in unknown samples were determined with an error of 3.5% or lower.

     alt="Pyrrole-Imine Macrocycle: Self-Organizing Cross-Reactive Anion Receptor and Sensor"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An imine macrocycle comprising pyrroles as hydrogen-bond donors and an environmentally sensitive fluorophore displays a wide cross-reactive binding, which, in combination with an analyte-specific fluorescence response allows differentiation between ten analytes and their concentrations. Thus, one cross-reactive sensor performs the work of multiple, essentially acting as a &#8220;sensor array of one molecule&#8221;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-organizing macrocyclic receptor-sensors for phosphorus oxyanions, phosphates, and phosphonates comprising imine moieties were prepared by condensation of dipyrrolylmethane dicarbaldehyde with diethylene triamine. The incorporation of flexible ethylene moieties endows the macrocycle with unprecedented flexibility and ability to accommodate numerous phosphorus oxyanions from orthophosphate to large anions such as ATP or phosphonate glyphosate. The anion binding was elucidated by NMR titrations, low-temperature NMR, and NOESY NMR. The incorporation of dansyl fluorophore enables sensing of anions using the fluorescence signal, whereas the changes in fluorescence intensity, width of the fluorescence band, and position of the maxima are analyte-specific and useful in recognition and identification of eleven different P-oxyanions in water. The affinity (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;assoc&lt;/sub&gt;) for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; salts was H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; &#8776; Methylphosphonate&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; Phenylphosphonate&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;Glyphosate&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;AMP&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; ADP&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; ATP&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Beyond Neuroprostanes: Total Synthesis and Epilipidomic Studies of a Novel Cyclopentenone Metabolite of Docosahexaenoic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuroprostanes are bioactive oxylipins from docosahexaenoic acid oxidation, serving as oxidative stress biomarkers. In this work, the enantioselective synthesis of 4&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone and 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP has been accomplished using Michael addition, olefin metatheses, and Wittig olefinations as key steps. Notably, 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP was detected for the first time in trout brains, underscoring its biological significance.








Abstract
Neuroprostanes (NeuroPs) are bioactive oxylipins formed in vivo from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the main polyunsaturated fatty acid of the human brain, by a nonenzymatic auto&#8208;oxidative process as mixtures of regio&#8208; and diastereoisomers. Thus, synthetic material is necessary to unlock their potential as oxidative stress biomarkers as well as to investigate the biological properties of individual NeuroP molecules. Despite recent advances in the field, cyclopentenone&#8208;type NeuroPs have received limited attention. Here, we present an enantioselective total synthesis of 4&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP&#8208;1,4&#8208;lactone and its dehydrated metabolite, 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP. The asymmetric synthesis of the chiral core relies on a robust organocatalyzed Michael addition. The assembly of the full carbon framework was accomplished via selective double olefin metathesis and Wittig olefination. The MS2 spectra of the 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP was carefully studied using molecular network and quantum chemistry software to elucidate its unique fragmentation pattern. Also, preliminary analytical studies showed for the first&#8208;time tangible amounts of 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#916;4,6&#8208;A4&#8208;NeuroP in trout brains.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of DNA Cross&#8208;linkers by Click Chemistry&#8208;Mediated Heterodimerization of Nor&#8208;Tomaymycins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click chemistry promises a simple method to produce pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD)&#8208;based DNA binders. DNA binding and covalent crosslinking capabilities have been validated for &#8216;clicked&#8217; PBD heterodimers using thermal denaturation analysis, mass spectrometry and DNase I footprinting. One dimer induced strong DNA cross&#8208;linking and cellular cytotoxicity, indicating the future potential for dimerization in living cells.








Abstract
The covalent cross&#8208;linking of DNA duplex strands by small molecule drugs is a validated mechanism in anticancer therapy. The pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) have been established as potent DNA binders that can achieve inter&#8208; and intrastrand DNA cross&#8208;links when dimerized, and have been used as cytotoxic payloads in multiple antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). In this study, we explore the potential of click chemistry to obtain PBD heterodimers. The heterodimers D1&#8211;D4 were prepared by copper catalyzed or strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions (SPAACs) from the corresponding monomers M1 &#8211; M4 and MbA. The interactions of monomers and dimers with DNA were evaluated by DNA thermal denaturation analysis, a newly developed mass spectrometry&#8208;based method for the detection of single stand and double strand modifications, and by DNase I footprinting. All methods demonstrated the DNA binding and cross&#8208;linking capabilities of D1. Testing for cytotoxicity in three cell lines revealed that the monomers M1 and M4 and the dimers D1 and D4 were the most potent. The click chemistry approach opens an easy access to larger libraries of PBD&#8208;based DNA binders, including the option for dimerization in live cells.

         <title>Alternating Orthogonal Switching in a Thiophenyl&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;Bis&#8208;Azobenzene Switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs computational calculations and ultrafast spectroscopy to design and probe alternate isomerization in a bis&#8208;azobenzene molecule. The phenyl&#8208; and thiophenylazobenzene moieties exhibit independent switching under different wavelengths, advancing multi&#8208;photoswitch applications.








Abstract
To design efficient molecular information storage systems with multi&#8208;photoswitchable entities, orthogonal isomerization of the different switchable moieties is essential. Various challenges, like unintentional energy transfer, spectral overlap, and other energy dissipation channels, have to be addressed by intelligent molecule design. In this context, we took advantage of calculations to design a bis&#8208;azobenzene switch, which consists of a phenyl&#8208; and a thiophenylazobenzene moiety in meta&#8208;connection to reduce &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Ultrafast spectroscopy and computational studies confirmed that this bis&#8208;photoswitch exhibits alternating orthogonal switching behavior when irradiated with light of different wavelengths. These results represent a significant advancement toward the development of efficient and adaptable organic multi&#8208;photoswitches for applications, such as information storage, molecular machines, or smart materials.

         <title>Circular Dichroism and Multiphoton Circularly Polarized Luminescence Switching Using a Bis&#8208;perylene Diimide Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral and configurationally stable bis&#8208;perylene diimide macrocycle is reported, which exhibits switchable circular dichroism (CD) and multiphoton circularly polarized luminescence (MP&#8208;CPL). This behavior is realized due to the macrocycle's tuneable chiral conformation, which impacts the intrinsic and supramolecular helicity of the perylene diimide dimer.








Abstract
Chiroptical switches exhibit stimuli&#8208;induced changes in the sign or strength of their circular dichroism (CD) or circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and are materials with significant potential for chiroptical sensing and biological imaging. However, the chromophores used in chiroptical materials usually require excitation by ultraviolet or visible light, which results in higher cytotoxicity and lower penetration compared to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoexcitation. This can be overcome by multiphoton excitation, yet multiphoton CPL (MP&#8208;CPL) has been challenging to measure in organic emitters. Core&#8208;twisted perylene diimides (PDIs) are excellent chromophores with which to develop MP&#8208;CPL emitters due to a chiral &#960;&#8208;system capable of two&#8208;photon absorption. Furthermore, the integration of these chiral PDIs into stimuli&#8208;responsive macrocycles affords configurational stability and the potential for chiroptical switching, due to the chromophore's tuneable chiral conformation. In this work we report a chiral bis&#8208;PDI macrocycle with stable, yet conformationally dynamic, enantiomers, and in doing so realize a novel chiroptical material that combines switchable CD and MP&#8208;CPL for the first time.

Core-twisted perylene diimides (PDIs) are excellent chromophores with which to develop MP-CPL emitters due to a chiral &#960;-system capable of two-photon absorption. Furthermore, the integration of these chiral PDIs into stimuli-responsive macrocycles affords configurational stability and the potential for chiroptical switching, due to the chromophore's tuneable chiral conformation. In this work we report a chiral bis-PDI macrocycle with stable, yet conformationally dynamic, enantiomers, and in doing so realize a novel chiroptical material that combines switchable CD and MP-CPL for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zincophilic MOF Protective Layer for Stable Zinc Anodes in Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are under the spotlight due to their substantial potential, abundant natural resources, inherent safety, and high specific capacity. However, uncontrollable zinc dendrite growth and side reactions on the zinc surface hinder the application of ZIBs. In this article, a uniform copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) coating layer was fabricated on a zinc metal surface (CuZIF@Zn) to serve as a protective interface. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques were employed to study the electrode structure before and after cycling. With its special structure, the MOF interfacial layer acts as an effective barrier layer to isolate the zinc anode from water molecules and electrolyte, thereby suppressing interfacial side reactions and passivation. Additionally, the abundance of zincophilic sites in the CuZIF layer ensures uniform deposition of Zn2+ while effectively inhibiting the growth of dendritic structures. Consequently, the CuZIF@Zn//CuZIF@Zn symmetric batteries exhibited cycling stability over 1000 cycles at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, attributed to the protective layer. Furthermore, a full cell incorporating an MnO2 cathode maintained 189 mAh g&#8722;1 over 700 cycles, demonstrating remarkable long&#8208;term cycling performance.

         <title>Interfacial Co&#8208;Operativity Enables Ultrafast Charge Transfer Within the Co&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogue|Zno Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This combined spectroscopic study shows that when the interfacial composition of PBA|ZnO heterostructure is engineered via a facile synthetic protocol the interfacial CT is promoted by a cooperative mechanism. In this mechanism, pre&#8208;existing oxidized PBA units at the interface facilitate structural rearrangements within the coordination network, thereby lowering the kinetic barrier of the process and improving its water oxidation efficiency.








Abstract
Heterostructures of Cobalt&#8208;Iron (Co&#8208;Fe) Prussian blue analogues (PBA) and inorganic semiconductors are attractive materials for photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Their efficiency is rooted in the charge transfer (CT) at the PBA|semiconductor interface. The interfacial CT, however, often suffers from sluggish kinetics, optimization of which has been elusive. In this work, we investigate PBA|ZnO heterostructures spectroscopically and show that tuning the interfacial composition of the heterostructure presents a synthetic handle to significantly improve interfacial CT. We employ ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy to probe the CT kinetics, while interface&#8208;sensitive vibrational spectroscopy, that is, time&#8208;resolved and in&#8208;situ vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG), sheds light on the molecular response to the CT across the interface. These measurements reveal that cooperative intermolecular interactions at the PBA|ZnO interface are key to achieving efficient CT. Furthermore, we relate the CT observed on ps&#8208;timescales to the functional properties of the PBA|ZnO heterostructure in terms of photocatalytic water oxidation, which increases by about 200% in absolute yield as compared to a heterostructure without interfacial co&#8208;operativity. Thus, this work presents for the first time a molecular picture of a PBA|ZnO interface and offers a novel perspective to optimize the CT dynamics in PBA|semiconductor heterostructures by tuning the interfacial chemical structure of PBA.

         <title>Steric and Geometric Tuning of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Antennae in Europium(III) Complexes for Selective ADP Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present four new macrocyclic Eu(III) complexes and demonstrate how ligand structure and positional tuning of &#960;&#8208;conjugated antennae modulate steric demand and anion binding site geometry. This enables size and shape complementarity for selective ADP recognition in water over competing phosphoanions.









Abstract
The selective recognition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in water presents a significant challenge for synthetic supramolecular chemistry, driven by its biological importance in cellular energy transfer and enzymatic signaling pathways. Discriminating ADP from structurally similar anions such as ATP requires a high degree of host&#8211;guest complementarity. We recently developed [Eu.ADPGlow]&#8722;, a luminescent Eu(III) complex bearing two 6&#8208;substituted quinolyl&#8208;phenoxyacetate arms, which create a binding site at the central Eu(III) ion that accommodates ADP. Binding induces a tight interaction in water, involving both metal coordination and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, switching the emission on with a 33&#8208;fold enhancement. Here, we examine how systematic changes in ligand geometry influence anion selectivity, by synthesizing four new Eu(III) complexes with pendant arms at the 4&#8208; or 7&#8208;positions of the quinoline scaffold. The 4&#8208;substituted systems provide a more accessible binding site and bind ADP, ATP, and AMP with limited selectivity between them, while the 7&#8208;substituted analogues impose steric hindrance at the Eu(III) center, resulting in minimal response to all tested anions. Only the 6&#8208;substituted complex [Eu.ADPGlow]&#8722; achieves optimal geometrical complementarity for ADP binding. These findings reinforce the importance of steric and geometric control in the design of selective lanthanide probes for biological anions in water.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Plasmon&#8208; Induced Hole Injection in Electroactive Luminescent Monolayers on Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the ability of plasmons to switch on the fluorescence of molecular monolayers through a hole injection process, in combination with an electrochemical reduction triggered at the tip and transferred to the monolayer by a redox mediator.








Abstract
A dual and simultaneous modulation of fluorescence intensity and electrochemical current induced by plasmon activation is demonstrated using a combination of electrochemical (SECM) and fluorescence microscopies, employing fluorescent redox monolayers grafted onto gold nanoparticles. The observed electrochemical and optical responses are fully consistent with a direct hole injection from the plasmonically excited metallic nanoparticles into the grafted monolayer. In particular, an unprecedented fluorescence intensity enhancement occurs upon simultaneous electroreduction at the tip and plasmon activation, whereas each process taken separately leads to a fluorescence quenching. The electrochemical current enhancement is significantly larger for functionalized nanoparticles compared to bare ones under plasmon activation, opening the route toward new strategies in photoelectrocatalysis.

         <title>Intepirdine Derivatives Possessing Dual 5HT6 Antagonism / HDAC6 Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of developing therapies for dementias and cognitive decline, potent dual acting molecules targeting the GPCR 5HT6 and the enzyme HDAC6 with favorable BBB penetration profile were designed and synthesised.








Abstract
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) impacts significantly the quality of life of people aged over 65 years old, while millions more suffer from other types of dementia, yet no effective drugs exist. The few approved drugs in this area address mostly the associated symptoms, while several selective agents acting on promising targets have failed in clinical trials. The complexity of neurodegenerative diseases has prompted multitargeting ligands as the new paradigm, where more than one biological mechanism may be perturbed synergistically. In this context, we explored the design and synthesis of dual 5&#8208;&#919;&#932;6&#160;antagonists / HDAC6 inhibitors since these actions have been individually demonstrated to elicit cognitive&#8208;enhancing effects. Prototypes with this dual action on a GPCR and an enzyme were designed and synthesized by tethering an aryl&#8208;hydroxamic acid unit, an established pharmacophore for HDAC6 inhibition, to the piperazine of intepirdine, a potent 5&#8208;&#919;&#932;6&#160;antagonist.&#160;A new gram&#8208;scale synthesis of intepirdine was&#160;developed&#160;followed&#160;by&#160;attaching&#160;different types of arylhydroxamic acids.&#160;Derivative RG&#8208;283AG emerged to possess sub&#8208;micromolar potency toward HDAC6 inhibition (IC50&#160;0.54 &#956;&#956;), nanomolar affinity (Ki&#160;0.7&#160;nM) for 5&#8208;HT6&#160;receptor and favorable BBB penetration capacity, thus constituting the first example of a dual&#8208;acting 5&#8208;&#919;&#932;6&#160;/ HDAC6 ligand with potential cognitive&#8208;enhancing properties.

Prototypes with this dual action on a GPCR and an enzyme were designed and synthesized by tethering an aryl-hydroxamic acid unit, an established pharmacophore for HDAC6 inhibition, to the piperazine of intepirdine, a potent 5-&#919;&#932;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;antagonist.&#160;A new gram-scale synthesis of intepirdine was&#160;developed&#160;followed&#160;by&#160;attaching&#160;different types of arylhydroxamic acids.&#160;Derivative RG-283AG emerged to possess sub-micromolar potency toward HDAC6 inhibition (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;0.54 &#956;&#956;), nanomolar affinity (K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;0.7&#160;nM) for 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;receptor and favorable BBB penetration capacity, thus constituting the first example of a dual-acting 5-&#919;&#932;&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;/ HDAC6 ligand with potential cognitive-enhancing properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Based Photo&#8208;Antibiotics: Light&#8208;Driven Eradication of Bacterial Biofilm and Rapid Healing of Infective Wounds in Wistar Rat</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the development of biocompatible&#160;Ru(II)&#8208;based photo&#8208;antibiotics that increase oxidative stress via ROS generation (both type I and type II pathways) and NADH oxidation, killing bacterial cells and eradicating bacterial biofilm with a novel mechanism. Moreover, the lead photo&#8208;antibiotics eradicated the gram&#8208;negative bacterial colony from the infected wounds in a rat model within 3 days and healed the wound completely within 9 days, bridging the gap between aPDT outcomes and clinical trials.








Abstract
Three novel Ru(II)&#8208;based photoantibiotics,&#160;viz., [Ru(phtpy)(N,N,N)2](PF6)2, where N,N,N&#160;=&#160;4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (phtpy, Ru1), 4&#8208;([2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridin]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline (NMe2tpy, Ru2), trifluoromethylphenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (CF3tpy, Ru3) were developed with excellent photostability for visible light&#8208;activated antibacterial activities and infective wound healing. Ru1&#8208;Ru3&#160;exhibited an absorption in the 400&#8211;600&#160;nm range, beneficial for antibacterial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) application. Upon visible light exposure (400&#8208;700&#160;nm),&#160;Ru1&#8208;Ru3&#160;inhibited bacterial growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), due to the effects of oxidative stress via ROS generation and photo&#8208;oxidation of NADH. Ru3 was identified as a lead antibiotic that further showed antibiofilm activities against E. coli under visible light exposure. Ru3 was found to be biocompatible against rat red blood cells and human embryonic kidney cells. Ru3&#160;+&#160;light promoted rapid healing of infected wounds within 9 days in an E. coli&#8208;induced rat model, highlighting its potential future use in healthcare.

         <title>Substrate Epoxidation Catalyzed by the Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase Dapdiamide Biosynthesis Enzyme C. Why Is the Substrate Tethered?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work a computational study shows the differences in binding and catalysis of a nonheme iron oxygenase with tethered versus nontethered substrate. The tethered substrate is positioned in an ideal orientation near the active site, while the nontethered substrate shows more dynamics and is not positioned well for double bond epoxidation.









Abstract
Enzymes usually react with a free substrate, although some examples have appeared in the literature of enzymes that utilize a substrate tethered to a protein carrier. However, it is not clear what advantage the tethering has, and therefore a computational study was performed. In particular, we report here the first computational study on the nonheme iron dioxygenase involved in the epoxidation reaction during the dapdiamide biosynthesis (DdaC) and investigate tethered and nontethered substrates. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the protein carrier applies pressure onto the surface of the protein and influences the fold and active site description and leads to differences in substrate&#8208;oxidant interactions. Quantum chemical calculations give much lower epoxidation barriers for the activation of the tethered substrate by 7&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 over the nontethered substrate and highlight the advantage of a tethered substrate in catalysis.

         <title>Nucleoside Reactions Shed Light on the Chemical Processes Underlying Interstrand Cross&#8208;Link Formation at Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Sites in Duplex DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA can give rise to interstrand cross&#8208;links via reactions of the ring&#8208;opened AP&#8208;aldehyde residue with the exocyclic amino groups of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine, 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytosine residues (dA, dG, and dC) on the opposing strand to give imine/N&#8208;glycosylamine linkages. Endogenous AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links in cellular DNA could contribute to cancer, aging, and neurodegeneration. The yields of AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links produced by the various nucleobases vary widely, and, until now, it remained unclear whether these differences might simply reflect differences in the inherent reactivities of the nucleobases. To shed light on this question, we examined reactions of a nucleosidic AP model compound, 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;O&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;ribofuranose (1), with the canonical nucleosides (dA, dG, and dC) and the noncanonical nucleoside, 2&#8208;aminopurine&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyriboside (2AP). The trends observed for the equilibrium yields of the nucleoside cross&#8208;links did not mirror yields of the respective cross&#8208;links observed in the context of duplex DNA. The results provide evidence that the inherent reactivity of the nucleobases alone does not determine yields of AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links in duplex DNA. Rather, the differences in yields for the various AP&#8208;derived cross&#8208;links must reflect effects exerted by the 3D structure of double helical DNA on the cross&#8208;linking processes.

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in photocatalytic CO2 reduction toward multi&#8208;carbon products, emphasizing key advances in catalyst design. Strategies including atomic site dispersion, co&#8208;catalyst integration, defect engineering, and utilization of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are discussed to promote C&#8211;C coupling, offering insights into selective solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction represents a sustainable pathway for mitigating carbon emissions and producing renewable chemicals by utilizing solar energy. While extensive research has been dedicated to single&#8208;carbon (C1) products, the selective formation of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) compounds, such as ethylene, ethane, ethanol and acetic acid, has garnered increasing attention due to their higher energy density and broader industrial relevance. However, achieving efficient C&#9472;C coupling under mild photocatalytic conditions remains a formidable challenge, hindered by complex reaction pathways, sluggish kinetics and competitive side reactions. In this review, recent advances in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products was systematically summarized, focusing on fundamental reaction mechanisms, rational photocatalyst design strategies, including atomically dispersed active sites, cocatalyst loading, defect engineering, and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). By bridging mechanistic understanding with materials innovation, this review provides a comprehensive framework for guiding the development of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic systems for efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion, contributing to sustainable carbon utilization and circular chemical economy.

This study presents the synthesis, physical characterization, and transport as well as electrochemical properties of a novel class of ten ionic liquids (ILs). The ILs are created with two biomass derived anions such as furan&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [FuA] and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [HFuA] coupled to a range of nitrogen heterocyclic cations, for which the nature of cation controlled their transport and electrochemical properties. 








Abstract
Here we present the synthesis, physical characterization, and transport as well as electrochemical properties of a novel class of ten ionic liquids (ILs) derived from biomass. Two biomass derived anions such as furan&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [FuA] and tetrahydrofuran&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate [HFuA] are coupled to a range of nitrogen heterocyclic cations to create the ILs, for which the nature of cation controlled their properties. For instance, the thermal decomposition temperature ranges from 183 to 259&#160;&#176;C, the glass transition temperature from&#160;&#8722;&#160;47 to&#160;&#8722;&#160;70&#160;&#176;C, and the ionic conductivity from 0.002 to 1.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at 20&#160;&#176;C. The supercapacitors prepared using [EPy][FuA] and [EMPip][FuA] exhibited specific capacitances of 99 F g&#8722;1 and 70 F g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, respectively. The [EPy][FuA]&#8208;based supercapacitor achieved an energy density of 56&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 as well as a power density of 410&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, while the [EMPip][FuA]&#8208;based supercapacitor achieved an energy density of 36&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a power density of 360&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1. In addition, the supercapacitors retained 98% and 94% of their initial capacitances after 6000 cycles, for [EPy][FuA] and [EMPip][FuA] electrolytes, respectively.

         <title>Graphene Quantum Dots Drive Spontaneous Metal Reduction to Form Stable and Electroactive Core&#8208;Shell Nanocolloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a spontaneous synthesis of metal (Au, Pt, and Ag) enveloped by crystalline graphene&#8208;quantum dots (GQDs). Aromatic and functional sp2 and sp3 hybridized carbons, within the GQDs shell, play a crucial role upon the synthesis, electronic distribution at the interface, and conductive sites for improving the electrocatalytic response. Au nanohybrids demonstrated two&#8208;fold increase in current density with respect to conventional citrate&#8208;coated Au nanoparticles. This was attributed to conductive sp2&#8208;carbons at the shell and the gain of charge electron density at the surface of Au as demonstrated by DFT calculations.








Abstract
This work demonstrates a spontaneous synthesis of &#8764;8.0, &#8764;7.0, and &#8764;3.0&#160;nm diameter Au, Ag, and Pt cores; respectively, wrapped by as&#8208;synthesized crystalline graphene&#8208;quantum dots (GQDs). Functional sp2&#8208; and sp3&#8208;hybridized carbons play a crucial role upon the synthesis, electronic distribution at the interface, and conductive sites for improving the electrocatalytic response. Au nanohybrids (NHs) demonstrated two&#8208;fold increase in current density with respect to conventional citrate&#8208;coated Au nanoparticles. This was attributed to conductive sp2&#8208; hybridized carbons and the gain of charge density at the surface of Au as demonstrated by DFT calculations. Due to the sp3&#8208;carbons at the shell, these NHs also behave like simple chemical compounds because they can be precipitated, stored for long periods of time, and redispersed without apparent changes in their properties. The resultant nanocolloids exhibit exceptional stability under harsh conditions. These attributes make them useful NHs with great potential for broad applications.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Conversion in Spin Crossover Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion properties of SCO metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are investigated for the first time, offering novel insights into the development of intelligent multifunctional materials.








Abstract
The synthesis of multifunctional materials that exhibit two or more distinct physicochemical properties is critical for the development of advanced smart materials. To date, the research regarding the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal properties of spin crossover (SCO) materials remains scarce. Here, we synthesized an inverse&#8208;Hofmann&#8208;type cationic framework, [Fe{Ag(CN)2}(TTF(py)4)]+ (1, TTF(py)4&#160;=&#160;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)tetrathiafulvalene), which exhibits hysteretic SCO behavior. By introducing p&#8208;aminoazobenzene (Azo&#8208;NH2) and pyrene (Pyr) into 1, two solvent&#8208;free derivatives, 1@Azo&#8208;NH2 and 1@Pyr, incorporating free radicals were generated. NIR&#8208;II photothermal experiments revealed the outstanding photothermal properties of 1@Azo&#8208;NH2 and 1@Pyr under 1064&#160;nm laser irradiation. Solar&#8208;driven water evaporation experiment demonstrated that 1@Pyr achieved a water evaporation rate of 0.9197&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 with an efficiency of 63.9%. This represents the first demonstration of outstanding NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion performance in an inverse&#8208;Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating free radicals generated through host&#8208;guest interactions. Our findings underscore the critical importance of incorporating NIR absorption units into SCO systems, providing new insights for the development of intelligent multifunctional materials.

Abstract
The impact of purine, 7&#8208;deazapurine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazapurine heterocyclic skeletons on the stability of the xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pair is reported. Beyond that, base&#8208;pairing of xanthine nucleosides opposite canonical nucleobases is studied. To this end, a building block of 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyxanthosine was prepared using 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine as starting material. A simplified synthesis for large&#8208;scale production is presented for the phosphoramidite of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;7&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad). Hybridization of oligonucleotides gave duplexes containing single or multiple incorporations of xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine base pairs with different combinations of nucleobases. From melting curves and Tm values, it became apparent that the most stable duplexes contained base pairs of 2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad with xanthine nucleosides. Under these, the 7&#8208;deazaxanthine&#8208;2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad base pair reached the stability of dT&#8208;2&#8208;NH2Br7c7z8Ad and dG&#8208;dC pairs. 7&#8208;Deazaxanthine located opposite 2&#8208;aminoadenine residues resulted in higher duplex stability compared to xanthine or 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaxanthine. For 2&#8208;aminoadenine residues, the base pair stability followed the order 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;deazaadenine&#160;&gt;&#160;2&#8208;aminoadenine&#160;&gt;&#160;7&#8208;deazaadenine. The impact of pK values became obvious from the increased stability of xanthine&#8208;2&#8208;aminoadenine pairs by decreasing the pH. Single incorporations of xanthine residues opposite canonical nucleobases displayed inhomogeneous pairing properties. Tracts of three xanthine residues in front of adenine and guanine furnished stable duplexes, whereas with cytosine and thymine, duplex formation was hindered.

&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; values, it became apparent that the most stable duplexes contained base pairs of 2-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;z&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; with xanthine nucleosides. Under these, the 7-deazaxanthine-2-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;z&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; base pair reached the stability of dT-2-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;c&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;z&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and dG-dC pairs. 7-Deazaxanthine located opposite 2-aminoadenine residues resulted in higher duplex stability compared to xanthine or 8-aza-7-deazaxanthine. For 2-aminoadenine residues, the base pair stability followed the order 2-amino-8-aza-7-bromo-7-deazaadenine&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;2-aminoadenine&#160;&amp;gt;&#160;7-deazaadenine. The impact of p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; values became obvious from the increased stability of xanthine-2-aminoadenine pairs by decreasing the pH. Single incorporations of xanthine residues opposite canonical nucleobases displayed inhomogeneous pairing properties. Tracts of three xanthine residues in front of adenine and guanine furnished stable duplexes, whereas with cytosine and thymine, duplex formation was hindered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Anthraquinone Mono&#8208; and Diboron Complexes with Near&#8208;Infrared Panchromatic Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anthraquinone boron complexes bearing &#946;&#8208;iminoenolate ligand(s) exhibit strongly substituent&#8208;dependent absorption properties. Unsubstituted monoboron and diboron complexes show sharp UV&#8211;Vis&#8211;NIR absorption spectra resulting from increased molecular rigidity induced by boron coordination. In contrast, dimethylamino&#8208;substituted complexes display near&#8208;infrared (NIR) panchromatic absorption, attributed to enhanced intramolecular charge transfer and multiple electronic transitions.








Abstract
Anthraquinone monoboron complexes 3 and 4, possessing a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structure, and diboron complexes 7 and 8, featuring a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) structure, were readily synthesized in two steps from commercially available reagents. These boron complexes adopt a &#946;&#8208;iminoenolate structure and their absorption properties are markedly affected by the type of the substituent groups. The unsubstituted monoboron complex 3 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;3,950 cm&#8722;1) and diboron complex 7 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;2,510 cm&#8722;1) exhibited sharp UV&#8211;Vis&#8211;NIR absorption spectra, which can be attributed to increased molecular rigidity induced by boron coordination. In contrast, the dimethylamino&#8208;substituted monoboron complex 4 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;7,580 cm&#8722;1) and diboron complex 8 (fwhm&#160;=&#160;8,770 cm&#8722;1) showed broad absorption bands due to the enhanced intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) character. Dimethylamino&#8208;substituted monoboron complex 4 and diboron complex 8 exhibited panchromatic absorption ranging from 400&#160;nm to 1,000&#160;nm and 400&#160;nm to 1,250&#160;nm, respectively. The panchromatic absorption of the dimethylamino&#8208;substituted boron complexes 4 and 8 is attributed not only to the enhanced ICT character but also to the combination of multiple transitions.

Showcasing sono&#8208; and mechanochemistry: A sonochemistry&#8208; and mechanochemistry&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;synthetic approach for biologically and synthetically promising cyanomethyl carboxylates as a rapid, high&#8208;yielding, and robust alternative synthetic protocol under metal catalyst&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions.








Abstract
We herein disclose a dual synthetic approach involving sonochemical and mechanochemical strategies for a diverse series of cyanomethyl esters of carboxylic acids. Both synthetic protocols offer a straightforward, efficient, and practical alternative to preparing this important class of biologically and synthetically promising organic compounds. Significant advantages of the newly developed methods include mild reaction conditions, avoidance of any metal catalysts and external oxidants, shorter reaction times (in minutes), good to excellent yields, broad substrate scope and tolerance of other various functional groups, gram&#8208;scale applicability, and reusability of the solid surface.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Induced Stabilization and Folding Pathways of &#945;&#8208;Helical Peptides: A Computational Investigation Using Steered Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employed molecular simulations to investigate the stabilization of &#945;&#8208;helical structures in HFIP compared to aqueous environments. SMD simulations demonstrated the stretching polypeptide chains to effectively preserve &#945;&#8208;helical conformations and enhance structural stability through solvation effects.








Abstract
Fluorinated polar solvents, such as hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP), are known to denature proteins into &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;rich structures, a phenomenon of interest in protein engineering and fiber science. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a valuable approach to explore protein folding mechanisms. In the present study, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations were conducted to stretch the polypeptide models along the &#945;&#8208;helix axis in different solvents. The potential of mean force (PMF) associated with nonequilibrium stretching of the polypeptide chain was higher in HFIP than in water and varied depending on amino acid composition and degree of polymerization. HFIP molecules preferentially concentrated in grooves of &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptides. Stretching the polypeptides in HFIP resulted in the formation of 310&#8208;helix structures, suggesting that local solvation enhances structural stability. Additional SMD simulations of Trp&#8208;cage, a mini&#8208;protein driven by hydrophobic collapse in protein folding, showed partial unfolding of the &#945;&#8208;helix region and global extension of both termini. The resulting PMF profiles indicate that &#945;&#8208;helices are formed in the early stages of Trp&#8208;cage folding. This study offers an analytical framework that can be extended to more complex amino acid sequences and proteins with diverse structural motifs. HFIP appears to play a central role in the &#945;&#8208;helical transformation of higher&#8208;order protein structures.

         <title>Phytic Acid Assisted Preparation of Cu3P/Cu@C Composites as High Performance Anodes for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyaniline was polymerized and deposited on the surface of Cu nanowire@carbon (C) nanocore&#8208;shells, and utilizing phytic acid as phosphorus source, a unique Cu3P/Cu@C composite spherical structure with with N,P&#8208;codoped graphitic carbon nanotubes entwined has been fabricated through a simple high&#8208;temperature annealing. Such porous and doped Cu3P&#8208;carbon anodes show excellent rate capability with ultra&#8208;long service life at current density up to 2000 mA/g.








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based anodes show new perspectives in high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but harsh synthesis and severe capacity attenuation seriously preclude their practical application. Here, Cu nanowire@carbon (C) nanocore&#8208;shells are designed to utilize as sacrificial templates for polyaniline loading, and with the assistance of phytic acid (PA), a novel Cu3P/Cu@C microsphere composite structure is successfully constructed via direct thermal annealing, in which heteroatom&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nanotubes are wounded with each other and firmly entangled on spheres. The polyaniline polymerization by (NH4)2S2O8 and the addition of PA are indispensable for the unique Cu3P sphere formation. Both the spherical Cu3P structure and its doped carbon encapsulating could largely alleviate volume expansion during lithium storage, while the intertwined carbon nanotubes provide fast transport channels for Li+. Therefore, as anode, it exhibits relatively stable cyclic performance, and after 10,000 cycles at an ultra&#8208;high rate of 2000 mA/g, it still maintain a capacity of 278.57 mAh/g with capacity retention of 73.12%. Through analysis, large specific surface area and multi&#8208;level pore distribution of the optimized Cu3P&#8208;carbon anode, and the extended interlayer spacing of doped carbon are conducive to the reversible intercalation and adsorption of Li+. Electrochemical mechanism analysis also confirms its dramatic surface pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution and excellent reaction kinetics.

         <title>A 19F&#8208;ATCUN Peptide NMR Probe for Selective Cu2+ or Ni2+ Sensing in Complex Biological Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the design and synthesis of ratiometric 19F&#8208;ATCUN (Xxx&#8208;Zzz&#8208;His) peptide probes for the selective and reversible detection of Ni2&#8314; and Cu2&#8314; by 19F NMR spectroscopy. In contrast to fluorescence&#8208;based approaches, 19F NMR enables background&#8208;free detection in biological media, due to the absence of fluorine in native biomolecules. The probes remain stable and functional in complex cell media (DMEM), enabling the detection of Cu2&#8314; and Ni2&#8314; by 19F NMR with a limit of detection (LOD) of 4&#160;&#181;M and quantification (LOQ) of 10&#160;&#181;M, relevant for studying copper&#8208;related pathologies.

         <title>Mechanochemical Preferential Bromination at the &#945;&#8208;Position of Activated Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study focuses on the mechanochemical pathway for &#945;&#8208;bromination of &#946;&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes. This uses N&#8208;bromosuccinimide as a mild brominating precursor and highlights the tolerance and limitations of functional groups used. This applies on gram scale synthesis and production of various useful intermediates.








Abstract
This study is the exploration of a solvent&#8208;free, mechanochemically enabled sustainable pathway for rapid and preferential selective &#945;&#8208;bromination of &#946;&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes using N&#8208;bromosuccinimide. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and diverse post&#8208;functionalizations demonstrate the versatility of the &#945;&#8208;brominated &#946;&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes in organic synthesis, pharmaceuticals, materials, and catalysis. This green and environment&#8208;benign approach, having E&#8208;factor of 0.5, offers high yields up to 98% within 30 minutes and highlights broad functional electron&#8208;donating groups (EDGs) along with limitations of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWGs).

         <title>Photoswitchable Merocyanine&#8208;Amphiphiles with Programmable Self&#8208;Assembly Times</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A merocyanine&#8208;based amphiphile self&#8208;assembles in water to form visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive ellipsoids that can be disassembled with visible light and reform abruptly &#8764;70&#160;minutes after the light is switched off. The kinetics of the light&#8208;induced assembly/disassembly process is controllable by incorporating different co&#8208;surfactants.








Abstract
A merocyanine&#8208;based amphiphile was self&#8208;assembled into ellipsoids that can be disassembled by irradiation with visible light and reassemble in the dark after a delay of &#8764;70&#160;minutes. Above a threshold concentration, the reassembly occurs when the ratio of protonated merocyanine to spiropyran reaches 7:3, suggesting both isomers are involved in the assembly. The thermal isomerization of the amphiphile when assembled (half&#8208;life &#8764;13&#160;minutes) is significantly slower than that in dilute solution (half&#8208;life &#8764;3.6&#160;minutes). The self&#8208;assembly behavior was confirmed by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS). The delay between the isomerization and the assembly processes can be tuned between minutes and hours by adding differently charged co&#8208;surfactants.

         <title>Cyanostilbenes as Selective Chloride Carriers Relying on CH&#8208;anion Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript presents a series of eight small compounds based on the &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbene motif and with different substituents. Three of these compounds show good rates of chloride transport, as well as selectivity for chloride over hydroxide, bicarbonate, and fluoride anions.








Abstract
Achieving selectivity is one of the challenges in developing anion receptors for transmembrane transport. This can be achieved through larger molecular designs that encapsulate the anion efficiently or by using alternative binding motifs instead of the most commonly used NH&#8208;based hydrogen bond donors. In this study, we present a series of small chloride receptors based on &#945;&#8208;cyanostilbenes that use CH&#8208;based hydrogen bonds. By varying the substituents, we discovered that the compound containing four trifluoromethyl groups and a nitro group in addition to the two cyano groups exhibited the greatest affinity for chloride and the fastest chloride transport rates, surpassing the performance of reported triazole&#8208;based compound. Furthermore, this compound showed clear selectivity for transporting chloride over hydroxide, bicarbonate, and fluoride anions. The activity, selectivity, and deliverability of this compound make it a promising candidate for the treatment of chloride channelopathies.

         <title>Navigating Scholl&#8208;Type Oxidative Coupling: An Electronic Programming Toward Path Revelation, Selectivity, and Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl substituents navigate the course of Scholl&#8208;type oxidative coupling in tetraarylthiophenes, enabling selective mono&#8208; versus dual cyclizations via electronic step discrimination and control. Guided by Hammett &#963;p constants, this study deciphers reactivity trends, face selectivity, excellent control, and coupling pathways&#8212;offering a predictive blueprint for regioselective &#960;&#8208;architecture construction.








Abstract
Scholl&#8208;type oxidative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling is a powerful strategy for constructing extended &#960;&#8208;systems, yet achieving regioselectivity and stepwise control remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report a systematic study on tetraarylthiophene (TAT) frameworks, revealing how subtle electronic effects of aryl substituents govern C&#9472;C bond formation efficiency, selectivity, and pathways. Guided by electrochemical potentials and Hammett &#963;p constants, we establish a reactivity trend&#8212;OMe&#160;&gt;&#160;Me&#160;&gt;&#160;tBu&#160;&gt;&#160;H&#160;&gt;&#160;Ph&#160;&gt;&#160;F&#160;&gt;&#160;Cl&#160;&gt;&#160;CHO&#160;&gt;&#160;CF3&#8212;revealing that electron&#8208;rich aryls promote efficient coupling, while electron&#8208;deficient groups suppress reactivity. Crucially, face&#8208;selective mono&#8208;cyclization products (PTs) are achieved by electronic step discrimination, where strategically pairing electronically distinct aryls steers homo&#8208; versus cross&#8208;coupling outcomes, enabling precise control over sequential couplings. Our findings unveil a simple yet powerful electronic map to predict coupling outcomes, product evolution, and opens a rational path to design regioselective oxidative cyclizations in polyaryl architectures toward precise &#960;&#8208;frameworks.

Our findings unveil a simple yet powerful electronic map to predict coupling outcomes, product evolution, and opens a rational path to design regioselective oxidative cyclizations in polyaryl architectures toward precise &#960;-frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Indeno[2.1&#8208;b]fluorenes and fluoreno[2,3&#8208;b]fluorenes having (trialkylsilyl)ethynyl groups dimerize spontaneously to yield the cyclodimers in the yields ranging from virtually zero to quantitative depending on the alkyl group. The regioselectivity of the bond formation (Head versus Tail) is also dependent on the alkyl group. These remarkable effects are attributed to the attractive London dispersion force between the &#960;&#8208; system and the alkyl groups.








Abstract
We present herein a systematic study on the cyclodimerization of (trialkylsilyl)ethynyl&#8208;substituted derivatives of indeno[2.1&#8208;b]fluorene and fluoreno[2,3&#8208;b]fluorene, which incorporate an open&#8208;shell meta&#8208;quinodimethane (m&#8208;QDM) unit. Our investigation focuses on the influence of different alkyl groups (methyl, isopropyl, or cyclohexyl) attached to the silyl moiety. Upon generation from the precursor diols via treatment with SnCl2, these m&#8208;QDM derivatives yielded cyclodimers with an anti&#8208;configuration. The reaction yields varied significantly, ranging from virtually zero to quantitative, depending on the steric bulk of the alkyl group. Furthermore, the regioselectivity of bond formation (Head versus Tail) with respect to the ethynyl&#8211;allenyl radical resonance forms was also notably affected by the choice of alkyl group. These remarkable observations are attributed to attractive London dispersion forces operating between the &#960;&#8208;system and the alkyl groups. Crucially, the degree of size matching between these components dictates both the dimerization efficiency and the regioselectivity of the bond&#8208;forming process.

         <title>Coacervate Vesicles as Adaptive Platforms for Synthetic Biology and Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coacervate vesicles are emerging protocells that merge coacervates&#8217; functionality within membranised architectures. Their diverse formation mechanisms from coacervate droplets yield tunable, responsive systems with broad potential, from synthetic biology to smart materials, offering a powerful, programmable platform for next&#8208;generation bioinspired technologies.








Abstract
Coacervate vesicles represent a versatile and emerging class of protocells that combine the dynamic properties of coacervate microdroplets with the structural advantages of membrane&#8208;bound systems. Leveraging features such as selective molecular uptake, enhanced reactivity, and dynamicity, they offer a promising platform for both fundamental research and technological applications in synthetic biology. In this concept, we introduce a classification of coacervate vesicles based on their formation mechanisms and energetic landscapes, highlighting how their formation routes give rise to protocells with distinct structural and dynamic properties. Furthermore, we explore how these features translate into potential applications, including artificial life&#8208;like systems, complex communication networks, adaptive soft materials, and smart drug&#8208;delivery platforms. While the field is still in its infancy, the simplicity, versatility, and programmability of coacervate vesicles position them as a powerful framework for engineering next&#8208;generation synthetic life&#8208;like systems.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity of a 1&#8208;Stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC Complex: A Heavier Group&#8208;14 Analogue of Vinylidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the synthesis, structural characterization, and reactivity of the first stable 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex, that is, a neutral monomeric compound with a C&#160;=&#160;Sn &#960;&#8208;bond, which is a heavier group&#8208;14 analogue of vinylidene. The vinylidene&#8208;type character of the molecule was confirmed by spectroscopic means, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, theoretical calculations, and a reactivity study.








Abstract
The first stable 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex with bulky silyl substituents has been obtained from the retro&#8208;dimerization of cyclic 1,3&#8208;bis(stannylene) with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). To accomplish the retro&#8208;dimerization of cyclic 1,3&#8208;bis(stannylene), a suitably sized NHC is required. Both in the solid state and in solution, 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex is characterized by the presence of a C&#160;=&#160;Sn &#960; bond. When treated with SnCl2, 1&#8208;stannavinylidene&#8208;NHC complex undergoes an addition reaction to afford the corresponding stable gem&#8208;bis(chlorostannylene).

         <title>Aromatic Wall Extension of Glycoluril&#8208;Derived Molecular Clips Enhances Binding of Planar Aromatic Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the length of the aromatic walls of methylene&#8208;bridged glycoluril&#8208;dimer&#8208;derived molecular clips on their binding affinity toward a panel of planar aromatic cations is reported. We find that anthracene&#8208;walled host H2 generally binds&#160;&#8776;&#160;10&#8208;fold stronger to a specific guest than naphthalene&#8208;walled H1.








Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of a new methylene&#8208;bridged glycoluril dimer featuring anthracene walls (H2). H2 displays good solubility in water (&#8805;7&#160;mM) but undergoes self&#8208;association at concentrations above 2&#160;mM. 1H NMR experiments establish that H2 binds cationic dyes inside its cavity with a &#960;&#8208;stacked geometry that places the cationic residues at the ureidyl carbonyl portals of H2. The binding constants of both naphthalene&#8208;walled clip H1 and anthracene&#8208;walled clip H2 toward a panel of dyes were measured by direct or competitive UV/Vis or fluorescence titrations in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Binding constants cover the range from 103 &#8211; 108 M&#8722;1. Dyes that feature cationic NMe2 groups bind more strongly than analogous dyes with cationic NH2 groups. We find that &#960;&#8208;extension of the aromatic walls from H1 to H2 generally results in an&#160;&#8776;&#160;10&#8208;fold increase in binding affinity. Host&#8226;guest complexes of H1 and H2 with planar cationic dyes benefit from substantial cation&#8208;&#960; interactions.

         <title>3&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;Extended TNA: De Novo Synthesis, Enhanced Exonuclease Resistance, and Functional siRNA 3&#8242;&#8208;Overhang Modifications Without Compromising Gene Silencing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized 3&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;extended TNA analogs (ApioNA and BpioNA) through asymmetric aldol synthesis. These analogs, modified at the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminal of oligonucleotides, display significant exonuclease resistance, particularly BpioNA, which has a 60&#8208;fold increase in half&#8208;life compared to dT. Furthermore, both analogs maintain full gene&#8208;silencing efficacy when integrated into the 3&#8242;&#8208;overhang positions of siRNA, highlighting their potential in nucleic acid therapeutics.








Abstract
The 3&#8242;&#8208;overhang of siRNAs is crucial for RISC assembly and stability, yet it is susceptible to nuclease degradation, significantly limiting its therapeutic applications. To address this challenge, we developed 3&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;extended threose nucleic acid (TNA) analogs (ApioNA and BpioNA) using an asymmetric aldol synthesis strategy. Our results demonstrate that the BpioNA modification provides exceptional nuclease resistance, exhibiting a 60&#8208;fold increase in half&#8208;life compared to dT, while maintaining full gene silencing activity. Structural modeling revealed that these novel analogs preserve critical interactions with the Ago2 PAZ domain through adaptive binding geometries. This work not only addresses the stability&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off in siRNA design but also provides fundamental insights into the structure&#8208;activity relationships (SARs) at the 3&#8242;&#8208;terminus, paving the way for the development of durable RNAi therapeutics.

&lt;p&gt;We designed and synthesized 3&#8242;-C-extended TNA analogs (ApioNA and BpioNA) through asymmetric aldol synthesis. These analogs, modified at the 3&#8242;-terminal of oligonucleotides, display significant exonuclease resistance, particularly BpioNA, which has a 60-fold increase in half-life compared to dT. Furthermore, both analogs maintain full gene-silencing efficacy when integrated into the 3&#8242;-overhang positions of siRNA, highlighting their potential in nucleic acid therapeutics.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Synthesis of Redox&#8208;Active o&#8208;Hydroquinone Metabolite of Flufenamic Acid on MWCNT Surface: Lifespan Extension in C. elegans via SOD Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an electrochemical strategy to generate the redox&#8208;active flufenamic acid&#8208;drug metabolite, FFA&#8208;Redox, which extends the lifespan of C. elegans worm&#8208;by up to 80% under pathogenic infection. The metabolite reduces intracellular ROS levels and enhances superoxide dismutase expression, suggesting a potent antioxidant&#8208;driven &#8220;de&#8208;aging&#8221; mechanism with promising biomedical potential.








Abstract
The search for drugs that extend lifespan in human&#8208;like biological models is a frontier area in biomedical research. In this study, we report a novel electrochemical approach using flufenamic acid (FFA), a widely known nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID), to generate and detect its pharmacologically active metabolites. Electrochemical oxidation of FFA on multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes(MWCNT)&#8208;modified electrode yielded hydroxylated derivatives, primarily 4&#8208;hydroxy FFA (m/z 297.05&#160;g/mol) and a polyhydroxylated product termed FFA&#8208;Redox (m/z 243.05&#160;g/mol), as surface&#8208;confined species (MWCNT@FFA&#8208;Redox). To establish biological relevance, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) were exposed to FFA, resulting in in vivo formation of metabolites identical to those generated electrochemically. This confirmed the physiological significance of the electrosynthesized compounds. Lifespan assays demonstrated that FFA&#8208;Redox prolonged the survival of C. elegans by up to 40% under Klebsiella pneumoniae infection and by up to 80% under Staphylococcus aureus infection. This protective effect was attributed to reduced levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistic insights suggest that FFA&#8208;Redox induces a &#8220;de&#8208;aging&#8221; response by enhancing the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a key antioxidant enzyme activated during oxidative stress.

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>
