         <title>Origin of the different reactivity of the high&#8208;valent coinage&#8208;metal complexes [RCuIIIMe3]&#8722; and [RAgIIIMe3]&#8722; (R = allyl)</title>

         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent tetraalkylcuprates(III) and &#8208;argentates(III) are key intermediates of copper and silver&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C coupling reactions. Here, we investigate the previously reported contrasting reactivity of [RM  III  Me  3  ]  &#8722;  complexes (M = Cu, Ag and R = allyl) with energy&#8208;dependent collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments, advanced quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and kinetic computations. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments confirmed the preferred formation of the [RCuMe]  &#8722;  anion upon collisional activation of the cuprate(III) species, consistent with a homo&#8208;coupling reaction, whereas the silver analogue primarily yielded [AgMe  2  ]  &#8722;  , consistent with a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. For both complexes, density functional theory calculations identified one mechanism for homo coupling and four different ones for cross coupling. Of these pathways, an unprecedented concerted  outer&#8208;sphere  cross coupling is of particular interest, because it can explain the formation of [AgMe  2  ]  &#8722;  from the argentate(III) species. Remarkably, the different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two [RM  III  Me  3  ]  &#8722;  complexes become only apparent when properly accounting for the multi&#8208;configurational character of the wave function for the key transition state of [RAgMe  3  ]  &#8722;  . Backed by the obtained detailed mechanistic insight for the gas&#8208;phase reactions, we propose that the previously observed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of the silver complex in solution proceeds via the  outer&#8208;sphere  mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; Nanozyme and Natural Enzyme Symbiotic System of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8208;GOx for Cervical Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cervical cancer, as a common malignant tumor of reproductive system, seriously threatens women's life and health. Traditional treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, are difficult to cure cervical cancer. Fortunately, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated catalytic therapy with high efficiency and reduced off&#8208;target toxicity has emerged as a novel treatment model. Herein, we designed &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme and natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu  2&#8208;x  Se&#8208;GOx for TME&#8208;triggered cascaded catalytic enhanced cancer treatment. In response to unique TME, the Cu  2&#8208;x  Se with catalase activity could effectively catalyze over&#8208;expressed H  2  O  2  in cancer cells into O  2  . Subsequently, the glucose oxidase (GOx) could deplete intracellular glucose under the assistance of O  2  , which not only achieves starvation therapy, but also regenerates H  2  O  2  to boost the generation of highly cytotoxic &#183;OH due to the peroxidase activity of Cu  2&#8208;x  Se. Moreover, although glutathione (GSH) as a free radical scavenger is overexpressed in tumor cells, the Cu  2&#8208;x  Se with glutathione oxidase activity could effectively consume GSH for enhanced ROS production. Thus, the &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme@natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu  2&#8208;x  Se&#8208;GOx could significantly induce ROS accumulation at the tumor regions, which provides a potential approach for the treatment of cervical cancer.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new class of large&#8208;but&#8208;flexible Pd&#8211;BIAN&#8211;NHC catalysts (BIAN = acenaphthoimidazolylidene, NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) has been rationally designed to enable the challenging Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of coordinating heterocycles. This robust class of BIAN&#8211;NHC catalysts permits cross&#8208;coupling of a variety of heterocycles with aryl, alkyl and heteroarylamines under practical aerobic conditions, including historically challenging oxazoles and thiazoles as well as electron&#8208;deficient heterocycles containing multiple heteroatoms with BIAN&#8211;INon (N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di(4&#8208;heptyl)phenyl)&#8208;7H&#8208;acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;d]imidazol&#8208;8&#8208;ylidene) as the most effective ligand. Studies on the ligand structure and electronic properties of the carbene center are reported. The study should facilitate the discovery of even more active catalyst systems based on the unique BIAN&#8211;NHC scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Electronegativity and the Bridging of Chemical Bonding Concepts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The orbital and the density, hand in hand: Three perspectives for conceptualizing chemical bonding are connected here within one framework: experimental quantum chemistry. A new definition for atoms inside molecules leads to quantification of atomic energy, partial charge, and in&#8208;situ electronegativity. Predictions follow, of pKa, of electronegativity inversions in polar bonds, and of hydrogen stabilization&#8208;driven electron&#8208;deficient bonding in diborane.







Abstract
One challenge in chemistry is the plethora of often disparate models for rationalizing the electronic structure of molecules. Chemical concepts abound, but their connections are often frail. This work describes a quantum&#8208;mechanical framework that enables a combination of ideas from three approaches common for the analysis of chemical bonds: energy decomposition analysis (EDA), quantum chemical topology, and molecular orbital (MO) theory. The glue to our theory is the electron energy density, interpretable as one part electrons and one part electronegativity. We present a three&#8208;dimensional analysis of the electron energy density and use it to redefine what constitutes an atom in a molecule. Definitions of atomic partial charge and electronegativity follow in a way that connects these concepts to the total energy of a molecule. The formation of polar bonds is predicted to cause inversion of electronegativity, and a new perspective of bonding in diborane and guanine&#8722;cytosine base&#8208;pairing is presented. The electronegativity of atoms inside molecules is shown to be predictive of pKa.

         <title>Fluorescent Benzothiadiazole Derivatives as Fluorescence Imaging Dyes: A Decade of New Generation Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Go bio! The use of fluorescent benzothiadiazole small molecules as bioimaging probes has been reviewed. After more than a decade since the first application in cell&#8208;imaging experiments, a huge evolution in their utilization has been noted. Still, there is much room for improvements, creative ideas, and advances in the use of these dyes.







Abstract
The current review describes advances in the use of fluorescent 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) derivatives after nearly one decade since the first description of bioimaging experiments using this class of fluorogenic dyes. The review describes the use of BTD&#8208;containing fluorophores applied as, inter alia, bioprobes for imaging cell nuclei, mitochondria, lipid droplets, sensors, markers for proteins and related events, biological processes and activities, lysosomes, plasma membranes, multicellular models, and animals. A number of physicochemical and photophysical properties commonly observed for BTD fluorogenic structures are also described.

         <title>Cobaloxime Complex Salts: Synthesis, Patterning on Carbon Nanomembranes and Heterogeneous Hydrogen Evolution Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The setup for operando measurement of hydrogen evolution under illumination is shown in the cover feature picture. Various cobaloxime catalysts were deposited onto solid support (carbon nanomembranes) and evaluated with respect to their hydrogen evolution reaction by using Pd microsensors. The structure of the most efficient cobalt&#8208;based double salt complex is depicted in the foreground. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. von&#8197;Delius, C. Kranz, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102778). Photo credit: Elvira Eberhardt, Ulm University.

         <title>Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxofacyclines: Unique Myxobacterial Polyketides Featuring Varying and Rare Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Myxobacteria are not only known for their complex &#8220;social behavior&#8221; including the formation of fruiting bodies, but also for being a prolific source of natural products. We describe the discovery and isolation of the myxofacycline natural product family, which feature either an isoxazole, a 4&#8208;pyrimidinole or a 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrrol&#8208;3&#8208;one heterocycle. Intriguingly, mutagenesis of the producer strain and heterologous expression of the identified biosynthetic genes revealed that all three heterocycles originate from the same biosynthetic pathway, thus suggesting an unique biochemistry to synthesize (secondary) metabolites with exceptional scaffolds and heterocycles. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. M&#252;ller et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103095).

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Pyrazine&#8208;Fused Carbene Au(I) Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel gold(I)&#8208;carbene complex shows high efficiency thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and sub&#8208;microsecond emission lifetime. The use of conventional pyrazine&#8208;fused nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand as the acceptor provides an alternative molecular design to TADF Au(I) carbene emitters.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is conceived to inherit the advantages of both phosphorescent metal complexes and purely organic TADF compounds for high&#8208;performance electroluminescence. Herein a panel of new TADF Au(I) emitters has been designed and synthesized by using carbazole and pyrazine&#8208;fused nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as the donor and acceptor ligands, respectively. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures show linear molecular shape and coplanar arrangement of the donor and acceptor with small dihedral angles of &lt;6.5&#176;. The coplanar orientation and appropriate separation of the HOMO and LUMO in this type of molecules favour the formation of charge&#8208;transfer excited state with appreciable oscillator strength. Together with a minor but essential heavy atom effect of Au ion, the complexes in doped films exhibit highly efficient (&#934;&#8764;0.9) and short&#8208;lived (&lt;1 &#956;s) green emissions via TADF. Computational studies on this class of emitters have been performed to decipher the key reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) pathway. In addition to a small energy splitting between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST), the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect is found to be larger at a specific torsion angle between the donor and acceptor planes which favours the RISC process the most. This work provides an alternative molecular design to TADF Au(I) carbene emitters for OLED application.

         <title>Bipyridine&#8208;Modified DNA Three&#8208;Way Junctions with Amide Linkers: Metal&#8208;Dependent Structure Induction and Self&#8208;Sorting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipyridine&#8208;modified DNA three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) structure has been synthesized from three DNA strands modified with a bipyridine (bpy) ligand via a stable amide linker. The bpy&#8208;modified 3WJ was thermally stabilized by the formation of an interstrand NiII(bpy)3 complex. Structural induction of the 3WJs and the duplexes was achieved by adding or removing NiII ions. NiII&#8208;mediated self&#8208;sorting of 3WJs was also demonstrated by using the bpy&#8208;modified strands and their unmodified counterparts. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Takezawa, S. Sakakibara, and M. Shionoya (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102977).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A bipyridine-modified DNA three-way junction&lt;/b&gt; (3WJ) structure has been synthesized from three DNA strands modified with a bipyridine (bpy) ligand via a stable amide linker. The bpy-modified 3WJ was thermally stabilized by the formation of an interstrand Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; complex. Structural induction of the 3WJs and the duplexes was achieved by adding or removing Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated self-sorting of 3WJs was also demonstrated by using the bpy-modified strands and their unmodified counterparts.

         <title>CD Stretching Modes are Sensitive to the Microenvironment in Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Use of perdeuterated surface&#8208;active ionic liquids allows for the in&#8197;situ IR spectroscopic differentiation between alkyl chains exposed to a polar microenvironment of the ions and those agglomerated via van der Waals interactions into nonpolar regions. In the monolayer film, the segregation phenomenon depends on the electrode potential.







Abstract
Knowledge of the structure of the electrical double layer in ionic liquids (IL) is crucial for their applications in electrochemical technologies. We report the synthesis and applicability of an imidazolium&#8208;based amphiphilic ionic liquid with a perdeuterated alkyl chain for studies of electric potential&#8208;dependent rearrangements, and changes in the microenvironment in a monolayer on a Au(111) surface. Electrochemical measurements show two states of the organization of ions on the electrode surface. In situ IR spectroscopy shows that the alkyl chains in imidazolium cations change their orientation depending on the adsorption state. The methylene&#8208;d2 stretching modes in the perdeuterated IL display a reversible, potential&#8208;dependent appearance of a new band. The presence of this mode also depends on the anion in the IL. Supported by quantum chemical calculations, this new mode is assigned to a second &#957;as(CD2) band in alkyl&#8208;chain fragments embedded in a polar environment of the anions/solvent present in the vicinity of the imidazolium cation and electrode. It is a measure of the potential&#8208;dependent segregation between polar and nonpolar environments in the layers of an IL closest to the electrode.

         <title>Shorter Alkyl Chains Enhance Molecular Diffusion and Electron Transfer Kinetics between Photosensitisers and Catalysts in CO2&#8208;Reducing Photocatalytic Liposomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Ru photosensitisers (RuCn) and Re catalysts (ReCn) covalently functionalised with alkyl chains of different lengths (n=9, 12, 15, 17, and 19) were immobilised on liposomes to perform photocatalytic CO2 reduction using ascorbate (HAsc&#8722;) as electron donor. A higher turnover number for CO production (TONCO) was found for systems with shorter alkyl tails, which was due to the higher mobility of the molecules on the lipid bilayer, leading to faster electron transfer between RuCn and ReCn.







Abstract
Covalent functionalisation with alkyl tails is a common method for supporting molecular catalysts and photosensitisers onto lipid bilayers, but the influence of the alkyl chain length on the photocatalytic performances of the resulting liposomes is not well understood. In this work, we first prepared a series of rhenium&#8208;based CO2&#8208;reduction catalysts [Re(4,4&#8217;&#8208;(CnH2n+1)2&#8208;bpy)(CO)3Cl] (ReCn; 4,4&#8217;&#8208;(CnH2n+1)2&#8208;bpy=4,4&#8217;&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) and ruthenium&#8208;based photosensitisers [Ru(bpy)2(4,4&#8217;&#8208;(CnH2n+1)2&#8208;bpy)](PF6)2 (RuCn) with different alkyl chain lengths (n=0, 9, 12, 15, 17, and 19). We then prepared a series of PEGylated DPPC liposomes containing RuCn and ReCn, hereafter noted Cn, to perform photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the presence of sodium ascorbate. The photocatalytic performance of the Cn liposomes was found to depend on the alkyl tail length, as the turnover number for CO (TON) was inversely correlated to the alkyl chain length, with a more than fivefold higher CO production (TON=14.5) for the C9 liposomes, compared to C19 (TON=2.8). Based on immobilisation efficiency quantification, diffusion kinetics, and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, we identified the main reason for this trend: two types of membrane&#8208;bound RuCn species can be found in the membrane, either deeply buried in the bilayer and diffusing slowly, or less buried with much faster diffusion kinetics. Our data suggest that the higher photocatalytic performance of the C9 system is due to the higher fraction of the more mobile and less buried molecular species, which leads to enhanced electron transfer kinetics between RuC9 and ReC9.

In this scaffold, the aniline NH proton is forced into close proximity with the nearby fluorine (  d  H,F  ~2.0 &#197;, &#8736; ~138&#176;), and a through&#8208;space interaction is observed by NMR spectroscopy with couplings (  1h  J  NH,F  ) of 19 &#177; 1 Hz. We used a combination of experimental (NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography) and theoretical methods (DFT calculations) for the characterization of this weak interaction. In particular, we investigated the effect of conformational rigidity and steric compression on coupling. We used this scaffold for the direct comparison of fluoride (F) with methoxy (OMe) as HB acceptors, and we probed the susceptibility of the NH  &#8230;  F interaction to changes in electron distribution and resonance by preparing a series of molecules with different electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups in the positions para to the NH and F. Our results support the idea that fluorine can act as a weak HB acceptor, and the HB strength can be modulated via additive and linear electronic substituent effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Pivotal Role of Holes in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction on TiO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Evidence is provided that in a gas&#8208;solid photocatalytic reaction the removal of photogenerated holes from a titania (TiO  2  ) photocatalyst is always detrimental for photocatalytic CO  2  reduction. The coupling of the reaction to a sacrificial oxidation reaction hinders or entirely prohibits the formation of CH  4  as a reduction product. This agrees with earlier work in which the detrimental effect of oxygen&#8208;evolving cocatalysts was demonstrated. Photocatalytic alcohol oxidation or even overall water splitting proceeds in these reaction systems, but carbon&#8208;containing products from CO  2  reduction are no longer observed. H  2  addition is also detrimental, either because it scavenges holes or because it is not an efficient proton donor on TiO  2  . The results are discussed in light of previously suggested reaction mechanisms for photocatalytic CO  2  reduction. The formation of CH  4  from CO  2  is likely not a linear sequence of reduction steps but includes oxidative elementary steps. Furthermore, new hypotheses on the origin of the required protons are suggested.</dc:description>

         <title>DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG Adducts of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene: Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Formation in 1,2,3,4&#8208;Diepoxybutane Treated DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metabolic activation of the human carcinogen 1,3&#8208;butadiene (BD) by cytochrome 450 monooxygenases gives rise to a genotoxic diepoxide, 1,2,3,4&#8208;diepoxybutane (DEB). This reactive electrophile alkylates guanine bases in DNA to produce N7&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;dG (N7&#8208;HEB&#8208;dG) adducts. Because of the positive charge at the N7 position of the purine heterocycle, N7&#8208;HEB&#8208;dG adducts are inherently unstable and can undergo spontaneous depurination or base&#8208;catalyzed imidazole ring opening to give  N  6  &#8208;[2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;  erythro  &#8208;pentofuranosyl]&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;5&#8208;  N  &#8208;1&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propan&#8208;1&#8208;ol&#8208;formamidopyrimidine (DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG) adducts. Here we report the first synthesis and structural characterization of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG adducts. Authentic standards of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG and its  15  N  3  &#8208;labeled analogue were used for the development of a quantitative nanoLC&#8208;ESI  +  &#8208;HRMS/MS method, allowing for adduct detection in DEB&#8208;treated calf thymus DNA. DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG formation in DNA was dependent on DEB concentration and pH, with higher numbers observed under alkaline conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemistry on the complex: derivatization of TiO4N2&#8208;based complexes and application to multi&#8208;step synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry on octahedral TiO4N2&#8208;complexes is described. The Ti(IV)&#8208;based precursors are composed of two ligands 6,6&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenolato (1) and one substituted 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligand (2&#8208;5). The application of imine condensation, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;C bond formation or copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition allowed the grafting of various new groups onto these species. In particular Sonogashira reactions permitted to observe an excellent conversion of the starting complexes. This systematic study enabled to compile the factors required to preserve the framework of the complexes in the course of a chemical transformation. Thanks to this chemistry realized on the complex, the Ti(1)2 fragment was used as a protecting group to develop a multi&#8208;step synthesis of a bis&#8208;phenanthroline compound (12), for which the synthesis without this protection failed. Thus, a dinuclear complex [Ti2(1)4(12)] was first prepared starting from complex precursor bearing an acetylenic function via a Hay coupling reaction. This was followed by a deprotection step affording 12. Overall, this work illustrates how the Ti(1)2 fragment could be an useful tool for the preparation of unprecedented diimine compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Merging of a perylene moiety enables a Ru(II) photosensitizer with long&#8208;lived excited states and the efficient production of singlet oxygen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multichromophoric systems based on a Ru(II) polypyridine moiety containing an additional organic chromophore are of increasing interest with respect to different light&#8208;driven applications. Here, we present the synthesis and detailed characterization of a novel Ru(II) photosensitizer, namely [(tbbpy)  2  Ru((2&#8208;(perylen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;  f  ][1,10]&#8208;phenanthrolline))](PF  6  )  2  RuipPer  , that includes a merged perylene dye in the back of the ip ligand. This complex features two emissive excited states as well as a long&#8208;lived dark state (8 &#181;s) in acetonitrile solution. Compared to prototype [(bpy)  3  Ru]  2+  &#8208;like complexes a strongly altered absorption (&#949;&#160;=&#160;50.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10  3  M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  at 467&#160;nm) and emission behavior caused by the introduction of the perylene unit is found. Following a combination of spectroelectrochemistry and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy was used to elucidate the nature of the excited states. Finally, this photosensitizer was successfully used for the efficient formation of reactive singlet oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing efficient small molecule acceptors with sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen at different positions by density functional theory calculations, molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical structure of small molecule acceptors determines their performance in organic solar cells. Multiscale simulations are necessary to avoid trial&#8208;and&#8208;error based design, ultimately to save time and resources. Herein, the effect of sp  2  &#8208;hybridized nitrogen substitution at the inner or the outmost position of central core, side chain, and terminal group of small molecule acceptors is investigated using multiscale computational modelling. Quantum chemical analysis is used to study the electronic behavior. Nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping has significantly decreased the electron&#8208;reorganization energy. No big change is observed in transfer integral and excited state behavior. However, nitrogen substitution at terminal group position is good way to improve electron&#8208;mobility. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of newly designed acceptors is predicted using machine learning. Molecular dynamics simulations are also performed to explore the dynamics of acceptor and their blends with PBDB&#8208;T polymer donor. Florgy&#8208;Huggins parameter is calculated to study the mixing of designed small molecule acceptors with PBDB&#8208;T. Radial distribution function has indicated that PBDB&#8208;T has showed a closer packing with N3 and N4. From all analysis, it is found that nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping group is a better strategy to design efficient small molecule acceptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the Supramolecular Copolymerization of N&#8208; and C&#8208;Centered Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamides: The Role of Parallel and Antiparallel Packing of Amide Groups in the copolymer microstructure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An in&#8208;depth study of the supramolecular copolymerization behavior of N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamides (N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs) is conducted in methylcyclohexane and in the solid state. The connectivity of the amide groups in the BTAs differs, and mixing N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs results in supramolecular copolymers with a blocky microstructure in solution. The blocky microstructure results from the formation of weaker and less organized, antiparallel hydrogen bonds between N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs. In methylcyclohexane, the helical threefold hydrogen&#8208;bonding network present in C&#8208; and N&#8208;BTAs is retained in the mixtures. In the solid state, in contrast, the hydrogen bonds of pure BTAs as well as their mixtures organize in a sheet&#8208;like pattern, and in the mixtures long&#8208;range order is lost. Drop&#8208;casting to kinetically trap the solution microstructures shows that C&#8208;BTAs retain the helical hydrogen bonds, but N&#8208;BTAs immediately adopt the sheet&#8208;like pattern, a direct consequence of the lower stabilization energy of the helical hydrogen bonds. In the copolymers, the stability of the helical aggregates depends on the copolymer composition, and helical aggregates are only preserved when a high amount of C&#8208;BTAs is present. The method outlined here is generally applicable to elucidate copolymerization behavior of supramolecular monomers both in solution as well as in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Joint Venture of Metal Cluster and Amphiphilic Cationic Minidendron Resulting in NIR Emissive Lamellar Ionic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic red&#8208;NIR emissive materials are particularly relevant in many fields like optoelectronic, bioimaging or solar cells. Benefiting from their emission in devices implies their integration in easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle materials like liquid crystals, whose long&#8208;range ordering and self&#8208;healing abilities could be exploited and influence emission. Herein, we present red&#8208;NIR emissive hybrid materials obtained with phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum cluster anions electrostatically associated with amphiphilic guanidinium minidendrons. Polarized optical microscopy and X&#8208;ray analysis show that while the minidendron chloride salts self&#8208;organize into columnar phases, their association with the dianionic metal cluster leads to layered phases. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved emission investigations demonstrate the influence of the minidendron alkyl chain length on the phosphorescence of the metal cluster core.</dc:description>

         <title>Imidazolyl&#8208;phenylcarbazole&#8208;based Host Materials and Their Use for Co&#8208;host Designs in Phosphorescent OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, owing to the demand for high&#8208;efficiency phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting devices (PhOLEDs), many studies have been conducted on the development of bipolar host materials. A series of imidazolyl&#8208;phenylcarbazole&#8208;based host materials,  i.e.  ,  im&#8208;CzP  ,  im&#8208;CzPCz  ,  im&#8208;CzP  t  Bu  , and  im&#8208;OCzP  , were synthesized to obtain high&#8208;efficiency green and red&#8208;emitting PhOLEDs. With  im&#8208;OCzP  as the host, satisfactory peak efficiencies of 22.2 (77.0 cd A  &#8208;1  and 93.1 lm W  &#8208;1  ) and 14.1% (9.0 cd A  &#8208;1  and 10.1 lm W  &#8208;1  ) could be obtained, respectively. To further improve the performance of the devices, an electron transport material, bis&#8208;4,6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;3&#8208;pyridylphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;methylpyrimidine (B3PyMPM) was selected to construct a co&#8208;hosted system. The efficiency of  im&#8208;OCzP  combined with B3PyMPM forming co&#8208;hosts could also achieve high values of 23.0 (80.0 cd A  &#8208;1  and 98.8 lm W  &#8208;1  ) and 16.5% (10.2 cd A  &#8208;1  and 13.4 lm W  &#8208;1  ) for green and red PhOLEDs, respectively. These results exhibited that the proposed bipolar hosts have great flexibility in adjusting the carrier balance of EML in OLEDs, demonstrating their ingenious design and high potential.</dc:description>

         <title>A Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylative Hiyama Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of diaryl sulfones from aryl silanes, SO2 surrogate, and aryl iodides is performed thanks to an air&#8208;stable Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylative Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling. Experimental and theoretical studies support a Cu(I)/Cu(III)&#8208;based mechanism with fast insertion of the small molecule into the Cu&#8722;C bond of a copper&#8208;aryl intermediate.







Abstract
An air&#8208;tolerant Cu&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylative Hiyama cross&#8208;coupling reaction enabling the formation of diaryl sulfones is described. Starting from aryl silanes, DABSO and aryliodides, the reaction tolerates a large variety of polar functional groups (amines, ketones, esters, aldehydes). Control experiments coupled with DFT calculations shed light on the mechanism, characterized by the formation of a Cu(I)&#8208;sulfinate intermediate via fast insertion of a SO2 molecule.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Heck&#8208;Type Reactions of Allenes for Stereoselective Syntheses of Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereoselective synthesis of (Z,E)&#8208;dienes from allenes is described. The method employs a Heck&#8208;type reaction catalyzed by tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium, Pd2dba3 and a CyJohnPhos ligand and does not require a leaving or directing group on the allene. The stereochemistry of both olefins of the diene is set simultaneously using both A1,3 strain and eclipsing interactions during the &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination to give (Z,E)&#8201;:&#8201;(E,E) dienes in good selectivity. The method also provides regiocontrolled access to 2,4&#8208;dienoates and dienamides.







Abstract
A highly stereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;type reaction of allenes in which the stereochemistry of both olefins is set simultaneously was developed. The ligand CyJohnPhos was crucial to achieving stereoselectivity, while minimizing isomerization of the starting material through hydropalladation. The stereodetermining factors were proposed to be A1,3 strain between the catalyst and allene substituent, which influences the &#963;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;&#963; equilibrium of the coupled allene intermediate, as well as eclipsing interactions of R groups in the &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. Good functional group tolerance and stereoselectivities for formation of the Z,E isomer were demonstrated. The methodology was further expanded to include the regioselective formation of 2,4&#8208;dienoates and 2,4&#8208;dienamides with a variety of substitution patterns, albeit in reduced stereoselectivities favoring the E,E isomer. A plausible mechanism is proposed to account for the observed selectivities and substituent effects.

         <title>Synthesis of Benzoisoselenazolones via Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Annulative Selenation by Using Elemental Selenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed direct selenium annulation by using stable and tractable elemental selenium is developed. A series of benzamides as well as acrylamides were successfully coupled with selenium under mild reaction conditions to give isoselenazolone derivatives. An unprecedented selenation mechanism involving an electrophilic Se(IV) species as the reactive selenium donor is proposed based on the designed control experiments, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and computational study.







Abstract
Isoselenazolone derivatives have attracted significant research interest because of their potent therapeutic activities and indispensable applications in organic synthesis. Efficient construction of functionalized isoselenazolone scaffolds is still challenging, and thus new synthetic approaches with improved operational simplicity have been of particular interest. In this manuscript, we introduce a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct selenium annulation by using stable and tractable elemental selenium. A series of benzamides as well as acrylamides were successfully coupled with selenium under mild reaction conditions, and the obtained isoselenazolones could be pivotal synthetic precursors for several organoselenium compounds. Based on the designed control experiments and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, we propose an unprecedented selenation mechanism involving a highly electrophilic Se(IV) species as the reactive selenium donor.

     alt="Synthesis of Benzoisoselenazolones via Rh(III)-Catalyzed Direct Annulative Selenation by Using Elemental Selenium"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Rh(III)-catalyzed&lt;/b&gt; direct selenium annulation by using stable and tractable elemental selenium is developed. A series of benzamides as well as acrylamides were successfully coupled with selenium under mild reaction conditions to give isoselenazolone derivatives. An unprecedented selenation mechanism involving an electrophilic Se(IV) species as the reactive selenium donor is proposed based on the designed control experiments, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and computational study.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isoselenazolone derivatives have attracted significant research interest because of their potent therapeutic activities and indispensable applications in organic synthesis. Efficient construction of functionalized isoselenazolone scaffolds is still challenging, and thus new synthetic approaches with improved operational simplicity have been of particular interest. In this manuscript, we introduce a rhodium-catalyzed direct selenium annulation by using stable and tractable elemental selenium. A series of benzamides as well as acrylamides were successfully coupled with selenium under mild reaction conditions, and the obtained isoselenazolones could be pivotal synthetic precursors for several organoselenium compounds. Based on the designed control experiments and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, we propose an unprecedented selenation mechanism involving a highly electrophilic Se(IV) species as the reactive selenium donor. The reaction mechanism was further verified by a computational study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Variable Luminescence and Chromaticity of Homoleptic Frameworks of the Lanthanides together with Pyridylpyrazolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
White&#8208;light emission can be achieved, according to the RGB concept, by deliberate mixing of different trivalent Ln3+ ions in homoleptic Ln&#8208;coordination polymers. Thereby, single&#8208;color emitters can be tuned to an additive chromaticity of red (Eu3+), green (Tb3+), and blue (backbone) to give white light. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. M&#252;ller&#8208;Buschbaum et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103068).

         <title>Multifunctional Polyoxometalate Platforms for Supramolecular Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular visible light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution by a covalently linked POM/Pt&#8208;complex is reported. Electrostatic interactions in solution between the anionic POM and a cationic Ir&#8208;based photosensitizer are utilized to enable electron&#8208;transfer and H2 evolution. Reactivity enhancement by ligand exchange on the Pt&#8208;complex is possible. Photophysical and theoretical studies shed light on the underlying reaction mechanisms.







Abstract
Multifunctional supramolecular systems are a central research topic in light&#8208;driven solar energy conversion. Here, we report a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based supramolecular dyad, where two platinum&#8208;complex hydrogen evolution catalysts are covalently anchored to an Anderson polyoxomolybdate anion. Supramolecular electrostatic coupling of the system to an iridium photosensitizer enables visible light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution. Combined theory and experiment demonstrate the multifunctionality of the POM, which acts as photosensitizer/catalyst&#8208;binding&#8208;site[1] and facilitates light&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer and catalytic turnover. Chemical modification of the Pt&#8208;catalyst site leads to increased hydrogen evolution reactivity. Mechanistic studies shed light on the role of the individual components and provide a molecular understanding of the interactions which govern stability and reactivity. The system could serve as a blueprint for multifunctional polyoxometalates in energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Synthesis, structures, and properties of helically fused anthraquinones with unusually close carbonyl&#8211;carbonyl contacts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;deficient aromatic ketones consisting of three fused anthraquinone units were synthesized by oxidation of the corresponding fused anthracenes. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that these compounds had nonplanar helical structures with unusual contacts, C=O&#183;&#183;&#183;C=O 2.467 &#197;, between the inner carbonyl groups. The role of n&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;* interactions in the short contacts was evaluated using a noncovalent interaction plot and natural bond orbital analysis. The dynamic process involving helical inversion was observed by the variable temperature  1  H NMR measurement of a derivative with 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl groups, and the barrier was estimated to be 77 kJ mol  &#8211;1  . DFT calculations indicated that the helical inversion proceeded via a multistep mechanism. The characteristic spectroscopic and electrochemical data due to the electron&#8208;deficient anthraquinone units and the sterically congested carbonyl groups are discussed with the aid of DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Changing the length of the side chains in a series of cobalt complexes changed the melting temperature and allowed the synchronicity of the valence tautomerism and solid&#8211;liquid transition to be controlled. The three complexes exhibit distinct macroscopic transitions from the crystalline phase to violet, blueish, or green liquids; this is represented in the figure by the degree of hand&#8208;holding between the two children jumping in the lavender field.

Switching site&#8208;selectivity: Regiodivergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed arylation of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions of the alkyl side&#8208;chain of heteroaromatic ketones is reported. The presence of a pyridone ligand orients the selectivity towards &#946;&#8208;arylation, while its absence leads to &#945;&#8208;arylation. Mechanistic studies suggest that &#945;&#8208;arylation follows a C&#8722;H activation pathway, whereas &#946;&#8208;arylation takes place through a C&#8722;H activation/desaturation/conjugate addition manifold. The method developed is mild and allows further functionalization of the products.







Abstract
A ligand&#8208;controlled site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of heteroaromatic ketones has been developed using Pd catalysis. The reaction occurred selectively at the &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;position of the ketone side&#8208;chain. The switch from &#945;&#8208; to &#946;&#8208;arylation was realized by addition of a pyridone ligand. The &#945;&#8208;arylation process showed broad scope and high site&#8208; and chemoselectivity, whereas the &#946;&#8208;arylation was more limited. Mechanistic investigations suggested that &#945;&#8208;arylation occurs through C&#8722;H activation/oxidative addition/reductive elimination whereas &#946;&#8208;arylation involves desaturation and aryl insertion.

Cyclodimers and cyclotrimers of 2,3&#8208;bisalkynylated anthracenes, phenanzines and diazatetracenes were synthesized through Glaser coupling. They display comparable optoelectronic properties but differ dramatically with respect to their solid&#8208;state packing. Intermolecular interactions are fundamental for charge transfer in thin film transistors, and the diazatetracene trimer exhibits charge transfer mobilities an order of magnitude higher than its dimeric congener.

         <title>Strong Ligand Stabilization Based on &#960;&#8208;Extension in a Series of Ruthenium Terpyridine Water Oxidation Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between the stability of a monodentate chloride ligand and the catalytic water oxidation performance of a set of ruthenium(II) terpyridine complexes based on &#960;&#8208;extension of a bipyridine is investigated. The findings are supported by theoretical calculations and show a significant dependence of the stability of the chloride ligand on the &#960;&#8208;extension and, hence, a decrease in the catalytic turnover number and turnover frequency.







Abstract
The substitution behavior of the monodentate Cl ligand of a series of ruthenium(II) terpyridine complexes (terpyridine (tpy)=2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine) has been investigated. 1H&#8197;NMR kinetic experiments of the dissociation of the chloro ligand in D2O for the complexes [Ru(tpy)(bpy)Cl]Cl (1, bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) and [Ru(tpy)(dppz)Cl]Cl (2, dppz=dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine) as well as the binuclear complex [Ru(bpy)2(tpphz)Ru(tpy)Cl]Cl3 (3&#8201;b, tpphz=tetrapyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c:3&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;h:2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;j]phenazine) were conducted, showing increased stability of the chloride ligand for compounds 2 and 3 due to the extended &#960;&#8208;system. Compounds 1&#8211;5 (4=[Ru(tbbpy)2(tpphz)Ru(tpy)Cl](PF6)3, 5=[Ru(bpy)2(tpphz)Ru(tpy)(C3H8OS)/(H2O)](PF6)3, tbbpy=4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine) are tested for their ability to run water oxidation catalysis (WOC) using cerium(IV) as sacrificial oxidant. The WOC experiments suggest that the stability of monodentate (chloride) ligand strongly correlates to catalytic performance, which follows the trend 1&gt;2&gt;5&#8805;3&gt;4. This is also substantiated by quantum chemical calculations, which indicate a stronger binding for the chloride ligand based on the extended &#960;&#8208;systems in compounds 2 and 3. Additionally, a theoretical model of the mechanism of the oxygen evolution of compounds 1 and 2 is presented; this suggests no differences in the elementary steps of the catalytic cycle within the bpy to the dppz complex, thus suggesting that differences in the catalytic performance are indeed based on ligand stability. Due to the presence of a photosensitizer and a catalytic unit, binuclear complexes 3 and 4 were tested for photocatalytic water oxidation. The bridging ligand architecture, however, inhibits the effective electron&#8208;transfer cascade that would allow photocatalysis to run efficiently. The findings of this study can elucidate critical factors in catalyst design.

         <title>Tuning Ruthenium Carbene Complexes for Selective P&#8722;H Activation through Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal ligand cooperation. Two different iminophosphoryl&#8208;substituted methandiide&#8208;derived carbene complexes have been applied in the P&#8722;H bond activation of secondary phosphines. Surprisingly versatile reaction outcomes were observed depending on the imine substituent at the methandiide ligand and the phosphine used. While more&#8208;electron&#8208;rich combinations led to either cyclometallation or an imine transfer, electron&#8208;poor combinations enabled selective P&#8722;H bond activation, thus impressively demonstrating the importance of tuning the M=C in this type of carbene complex for bond activation.







Abstract
The use of iminophosphoryl&#8208;tethered ruthenium carbene complexes to activate secondary phosphine P&#8722;H bonds is reported. Complexes of type [(p&#8208;cymene)&#8208;RuC(SO2Ph)(PPh2NR)] (with R = SiMe3 or 4&#8208;C6H4&#8722;NO2) were found to exhibit different reactivities depending on the electronics of the applied phosphine and the substituent at the iminophosphoryl moiety. Hence, the electron&#8208;rich silyl&#8208;substituted complex undergoes cyclometallation or shift of the imine moiety after cooperative activation of the P&#8722;H bond across the M=C linkage, depending on the electronics of the applied phosphine. Deuteration experiments and computational studies proved that cyclometallation is initiated by the activation process at the M=C bond and triggered by the high electron density at the metal in the phosphido intermediates.

     alt="Tuning Ruthenium Carbene Complexes for Selective P&#8722;H Activation through Metal-Ligand Cooperation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal ligand cooperation. Two different iminophosphoryl-substituted methandiide-derived carbene complexes have been applied in the P&#8722;H bond activation of secondary phosphines. Surprisingly versatile reaction outcomes were observed depending on the imine substituent at the methandiide ligand and the phosphine used. While more-electron-rich combinations led to either cyclometallation or an imine transfer, electron-poor combinations enabled selective P&#8722;H bond activation, thus impressively demonstrating the importance of tuning the M=C in this type of carbene complex for bond activation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of iminophosphoryl-tethered ruthenium carbene complexes to activate secondary phosphine P&#8722;H bonds is reported. Complexes of type [(&lt;i&gt;p-&lt;/i&gt;cymene)-RuC(SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NR)] (with R = SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or 4-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) were found to exhibit different reactivities depending on the electronics of the applied phosphine and the substituent at the iminophosphoryl moiety. Hence, the electron-rich silyl-substituted complex undergoes cyclometallation or shift of the imine moiety after cooperative activation of the P&#8722;H bond across the M=C linkage, depending on the electronics of the applied phosphine. Deuteration experiments and computational studies proved that cyclometallation is initiated by the activation process at the M=C bond and triggered by the high electron density at the metal in the phosphido intermediates. Consistently, replacement of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) group by the electron-withdrawing 4-nitrophenyl substituent allowed the selective cooperative P&#8722;H activation to form stable activation products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

More complex than expected: Photochemical hydrogen evolution in Al+(H2O)n involves conical intersections, multiple intersystem crossings between singlet and triplet surfaces, and electron transfer. Three neutral photoproducts are observed&#8212;hydrogen atoms, hydrogen molecules, and water. For the Al+(H2O)2 cluster, we show how a hydrogen radical is ejected and dictates reactivity. Our results underline the multitude of pathways in photochemistry of these seemingly simple ions. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. On&#269;&#225;k, M.&#8197;K. Beyer et&#8197;al.

         <title>Probing the Boundaries between Lewis&#8208;Basic and Redox Behavior of a Parent Borylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophile or nucleophile: A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208; and PMe3&#8208;stabilized parent borylene acts both as a Lewis base and reducing agent towards group 13 trihalides (EX3, E=B, Al, Ga, In, X=F, Cl, Br, I), yielding borylene&#8208;EX3 adducts and the boryl radical cation. Halide abstraction converts the borylene&#8208;BX3 adducts to the unsymmetrical borylboronium species. Computations probe the bond dissociation energy and electronic nature of the B&#8211;E bonds in the Lewis adducts.







Abstract
The parent borylene (CAAC)(Me3P)BH, 1 (CAAC=cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene), acts both as a Lewis base and one&#8208;electron reducing agent towards group 13 trichlorides (ECl3, E=B, Al, Ga, In), yielding the adducts 1&#8208;ECl3 and increasing proportions of the radical cation [1]&#8226;+ for the heavier group 13 analogues. With boron trihalides (BX3, X=F, Cl, Br, I) 1 undergoes sequential adduct formation and halide abstraction reactions to yield borylboronium cations and shows an increasing tendency towards redox processes for the heavier halides. Calculations confirm that 1 acts as a strong Lewis base towards EX3 and show a marked increase in the B&#8722;E bond dissociation energies down both group 13 and the halide group.

         <title>Negishi Cross&#8208;Coupling Provides Alkylated Tryptophans and Tryptophan Regioisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;canonical amino acids. The portfolio of possible late&#8208;stage derivatisations of biocatalytically halogenated tryptophan has been expanded by Palladium&#8208;catalysed Negishi cross coupling for a direct alkylation of bromotryptophan and the synthesis of tryptophan regioisomers from bromoindole derivatives.







Abstract
Mild transition&#8208;metal catalysed cross&#8208;couplings enable direct functionalisation of biocatalytically halogenated tryptophans with alkyl iodides, representing a new alternative for late&#8208;stage derivatisations of halogenated aromatic amino acids. Moreover, this strategy enables preparation of (homo)tryptophan regioisomers in a simple two&#8208;step synthesis using a Pd&#8208;catalysed Negishi cross coupling. This method provides access to non&#8208;canonical constitutional surrogates of tryptophan, ready for use in peptide synthesis.

         <title>Enhancing the Catalytic Activity of MOF&#8208;808 Towards Peptide Bond Hydrolysis through Synthetic Modulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of MOFs in catalysis is largely derived from structural features, and much work has focused on introducing structural changes such as defects or ligand functionalisation to boost the reactivity of the MOF. However, the effects of different parameters chosen for the synthesis on the catalytic reactivity of the resulting MOF remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the role of metal precursor on the reactivity of Zr&#8208;based MOF&#8208;808 towards the hydrolysis of the peptide bond in the glycylglycine model substrate. In addition, the effect of synthesis temperature and duration has been also investigated. Surprisingly, the metal precursor was found to have a large influence on the reactivity of the MOF, surpassing the effect of particle size or number of defects. Additionally, we show that by careful selection of the Zr&#8208;salt precursor and temperature used in MOF syntheses equally active MOF catalysts could be obtained after a 20 minute synthesis compared to 24 h synthesis.</dc:description>

Ag clusters protected by metal&#8208;oxo modules have emerged as the new stars of silver nanoclusters, exhibiting enhanced and unique properties. Three types of metal&#8208;oxo modules are identified in these systems. Some insights into fabricating such clusters and problems to be solved are discussed in this Concept article.







Abstract
Monodisperse and atomically precise Ag nanoclusters have attracted considerable recent research interest. A conventional silver cluster usually consists of a silver metallic kernel and an organic peripheral ligand shell. Nevertheless, the present inevitable problem is the unsatisfied stability of such nanoclusters. In this concept, we will give an introduction to Ag clusters protected by metal&#8208;oxo modules, which exhibit enhanced stability and unique properties. Accordingly, three different types of clusters are summarized: (1) Ag clusters protected by mononuclear oxometallates; (2) Ag clusters protected by block&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters; (3) Ag clusters protected by hollow&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters. The aim of this concept is to offer possible general guidance and insight into future rational design of more metal&#8208;oxo clusters protected silver clusters or even other coinage metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Dinuclear Au(I), Au(II) and Au(III) Complexes with (CF2)n Chains: Insights into The Role of Aurophilic Interactions in the Au(I) Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 63, Page 15815-15822, November 11, 2021. </description>

Aurophilic interactions promote the oxidation of AuI2 compounds to give complexes containing a AuII&#8208;AuII bond instead of AuIII2 or mixed&#8208;valent species. The obtained AuII complexes undergo thermal or photochemical elimination of R3PAuX to give AuIII perfluorinated auracyclic complexes through radical intermediates.







Abstract
New dinuclear Au(I), Au(II) and Au(III) complexes containing (CF2)n bridging chains were obtained. Metallomacrocycles [Au2{&#956;&#8208;(CF2)4}{&#956;&#8208;diphosphine}] show an uncommon figure&#8208;eight structure, the helicity inversion barrier of which is influenced by aurophilic interactions and steric constraints imposed by the diphosphine. Halogenation of LAu(CF2)4AuL (L=PPh3, PMe3, (dppf)1/2, (binap)1/2) gave [Au(II)]2 species, some of which display unprecedented folded structures with Au&#8722;Au bonds. Aurophilic interactions facilitate this oxidation process by preorganizing the starting [Au(I)]2 complexes and lowering its redox potential. The obtained [Au(II)]2 complexes undergo thermal or photochemical elimination of R3PAuX to give Au(III) perfluorinated auracycles. Evidence of a radical mechanism for these decomposition reactions was obtained.

Stop gap: Donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor organic semiconductors consisting of a highly electron&#8208;deficient naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,7&#8208;dione quinoidal acceptor and oligothiophene donors show very small optical energy gaps of down to 0.72&#8197;eV in the solid state, due to an efficient intramolecular interaction between the quinoidal acceptor and the aromatic donors that significantly enhances the backbone resonance and reduces the bond length alternation.







Abstract
Organic semiconductors with very small optical energy gaps have attracted a lot of attention for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;active optoelectronic applications. Herein, we present a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8722;A&#8722;D) organic semiconductors consisting of a highly electron&#8208;deficient naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,7&#8208;dione quinoidal acceptor and oligothiophene donors that show very small optical energy gaps of down to 0.72&#8197;eV in the solid state. Investigation of the physicochemical properties of the D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecules as well as theoretical calculations of their electronic structures revealed an efficient intramolecular interaction between the quinoidal acceptor and the aromatic oligothiophene donors in the D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecules; this significantly enhances the backbone resonance and thus reduces the bond length alternation along the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones. Despite the very small optical energy gaps, the D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecules have low&#8208;lying frontier orbital energy levels that give rise to air&#8208;stable ambipolar carrier transport properties with hole and electron mobilities of up to 0.026 and 0.043&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, in field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Diphosphino&#8208;Functionalized 1,8&#8208;Naphthyridines: a Multifaceted Ligand Platform for Boranes and Diboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 63, Page 15751-15756, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five diphosphino&#8208;functionalized 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine (NDP)&#8208;based boron compounds were synthesized via two different methods: direct coordination and salt elimination. In these NDP&#8208;based boron compounds, NDP behaves as a flexible, multifaceted ligand. For example, it functions as a tridentate ligand toward B2Br4 and as a bidentate ligand for BBr3. Furthermore, NDP binds through only one nitrogen to a diaminodiborane to furnish tri&#8208; and tetraamino diboranes.







Abstract
A 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine diphosphine (NDP) reacts with boron&#8208;containing Lewis acids to generate complexes featuring a number of different naphthyridine bonding modes. When exposed to diborane B2Br4, NDP underwent self&#8208;deprotonation to afford [NDP&#8208;B2Br3]Br, an unsymmetrical diborane comprised of four fused rings. The reaction of two equivalents of monoborane BBr3 and NDP in a non&#8208;polar solvent provided the simple phosphine&#8208;borane adduct [NDP(BBr3)2], which then underwent intramolecular halide abstraction to furnish the salt [NDP&#8208;BBr2][BBr4], featuring a different coordination mode from that of [NDP&#8208;B2Br3]Br. Direct deprotonation of NDP by KHMDS or PhCH2K generates mono&#8208; and dipotassium reagents, respectively. The monopotassium reagent reacts with one or half an equivalent of B2(NMe2)2Cl2 to afford NDP&#8208;based diboranes with three or four amino substituents.

New scaffolds obtained by Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions between heteroaromatic, trifluoromethylphenyl ketone and electron rich or fluorinated alkenes to give corresponding oxetanes. The uncommon regioselectivity with the fluorinated alkenes is explained by the relative stabilities of 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediates of this Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction. A metathesis (photo&#8208;Wittig reaction) yields amide isosteres.







Abstract
In the context of new scaffolds obtained by photochemical reactions, Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reactions between heteroaromatic, trifluoromethylphenyl ketone and electron rich alkenes to give oxetanes are described. A comprehensive study has then been carried out on the reaction of aromatic ketones with fluorinated alkenes. Depending on the substitution pattern at the oxetane ring, a metathesis reaction is described as a minor side process to give mono fluorinated alkenes. Overall, this last reaction corresponds to a photo&#8208;Wittig reaction and yield amid isosteres. In order to explain the uncommon regioselectivity of the Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction with these alkenes, electrostatic&#8208;potential derived charges (ESP) have been determined. In a second computational study, the relative stabilities of the typical 1,4&#8208;diradical intermediates of the Patern&#242;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction have been determined. The results well explain the regioselectivity. Further transformations of the oxetanes or previous functionalization of the fluoroalkenes open perspectives for oxetanes as core structures for biologically active compounds.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Azahelicenes and Diaza[8]circulenes through the Intramolecular Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 63, Page 15699-15705, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular Scholl reaction of carbazole derivatives afforded highly strained azahelicenes and azahepta[8]circulene, which was transformed into dibenzodiaza[8]circulenes. The diaza[8]circulene structure was characterized for the first time by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which revealed the saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated polyaromatics.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based aza[7]helicenes and hetero[9]helicenes were successfully obtained via the intramolecular Scholl reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl)carbazole congeners, while the reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(naphthylphenyl)&#8208;appended carbazole gave a triple helicene via an unexpected simultaneous double aryl rearrangement. DFT calculations suggested that the rearrangement proceeded via an arenium cation intermediate. In addition, the reaction of methoxy&#8208;appended substrate gave an azahepta[8]circulene via the concurrent C&#8722;C bond formation. These helical dyes showed circularly polarized luminescence. The azahepta[8]circulene was further transformed into deeply saddle&#8208;distorted dibenzodiaza[8]circulenes as the first example of its solution&#8208;based synthesis and unambiguous structural determination.

         <title>Additive and Emergent Catalytic Properties of Dimeric Unnatural Amino Acid Derivatives: Aldol and Conjugate Additions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 63, Page 15671-15687, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monomeric and dimeric organocatalysts behave differently: Aldol and Michael reactions catalysed by &#947;&#8208;dipeptides derived from densely substituted unnatural proline derivatives show different behaviours. In aldol reactions an additive scheme is observed, whereas in conjugate reactions the catalytic activity of these dipeptides constitutes an emergent property. Experimental, kinetic and computational studies are reported to understand these phenomena.







Abstract
Different densely substituted L&#8208; and D&#8208;proline esters were prepared by asymmetric (3+2) cycloaddition reactions catalyzed by conveniently selected EhuPhos chiral ligands. The &#947;&#8208;nitro&#8208;2&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl pyrrolidines thus obtained in either their endo or exo forms were functionalized and coupled to yield the corresponding &#947;&#8208;dipeptides. The catalytic properties of these latter dimers were examined using aldol and conjugate additions as case studies. When aldol reactions were analyzed, an additive behavior in terms of stereocontrol was observed on going from the monomers to the dimers. In contrast, in the case of the conjugate additions between ketones and nitroalkenes, the monomers did not catalyze this reaction, whereas the different &#947;&#8208;dipeptides promoted the formation of the corresponding Michael adducts. Therefore, in this latter case emergent catalytic properties were observed for these novel &#947;&#8208;dipeptides based on unnatural proline derivatives. Under certain conditions stoichiometric amounts of ketone, acid and nitroalkene), formation of N&#8208;acyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxooctahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indoles was observed.

A novel 2D organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite: (IPA)2(FA)Pb2I7 (1, IPA+=C3H9NI+, FA+=CN2H5+), undergoes a solid reversible phase transition with Tc of 382&#8197;K accompanied by giant entropy change of 40&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1. Further optical investigations indicate that 1 reveals a narrow direct bandgap (2.024&#8197;eV) and a superior photoluminescence (PL) emission.







Abstract
The multifunctional two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have potential applications in many fields, such as, semiconductor, energy storage and fluorescent device etc. Here, a 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) perovskite (IPA)2(FA)Pb2I7 (1, IPA+=C3H9NI+, FA+=CN2H5+) is determined for its photophysical properties. Strikingly, 1 reveals a solid reversible phase transition with Tc of 382&#8197;K accompanied by giant entropy change of 40&#8197;J&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1. Further optical investigations indicate that 1 reveals a narrow direct bandgap (2.024&#8197;eV) attributed to the slight bending of I&#8722;Pb&#8208;I edge and inorganic [Pb2I7]n layer and a superior photoluminescence (PL) emission with super long lifetime of 0.1607&#8197;ms. It is believed that this work will pave an avenue to further design multifunctional semiconductors that combines energy storage and photoelectric materials.

Switching between paths: Ruthenium&#8208; and copper&#8208;catalyzed propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohol derivatives have been achieved by using N&#8208;monosubstituted hydrazones as ambident nucleophiles, whose nucleophilicity is switched between carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;centered ones by two different catalytic systems, affording propargylic alkylated products and propargylic aminated products, respectively.







Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208; and copper&#8208;catalyzed propargylic substitution reactions of propargylic alcohol derivatives with N&#8208;monosubstituted hydrazones as ambident nucleophiles are achieved in which N&#8208;monosubstituted hydrazones exhibit impressive different reactivities depending on different catalytic systems, behaving as carbon&#8208;centered nucleophiles to give the corresponding propargylic alkylated products in ruthenium catalysis, or as nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophiles to afford the corresponding propargylic aminated products in copper catalysis. DFT calculations were carried out to investigate the detailed reaction pathways of these two systems. Further transformation of propargylic substituted products affords the corresponding multisubstituted pyrazoles as cyclization products in good to high yields.

         <title>Regulating Lithium Plating and Stripping by Using Vertically Aligned Graphene/CNT Channels Decorated with ZnO Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 63, Page 15706-15715, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li host material that features vertically aligned channels composed of graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and decorated ZnO particles (designated ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C) has been prepared by using an ice&#8208;template method through oriented freezing. The Li host material not only suppresses the formation of Li dendrites but also reduces the overpotential of Li nucleation. The usability of ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C as Li host was confirmed in full cells with a LiFePO4 cathode.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is regarded as the ultimate anode material for use in Li batteries due to its high theoretical capacity (3860&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, the Li dendrites that are generated during iterative Li plating/stripping cycles cause poor cycling stability and even present safety risks, and thus severely handicap the commercial utility of Li metal anodes. Herein, we describe a graphene and carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;based Li host material that features vertically aligned channels with attached ZnO particles (designated ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C) and show that the material effectively regulates Li plating and stripping. ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C is prepared from an aqueous suspension of Zn(OAc)2, CNTs, and graphene oxide by using ice to template channel growth. ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C was found to be mechanically robust and capable of guiding Li deposition on the inner walls of the channels without the formation of Li dendrites. When used as an electrode, the material exhibits relatively low polarization for Li plating, fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion, and high Coulombic efficiency, even over hundreds of Li plating/stripping cycles. Moreover, full cells prepared with ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C as Li host and LiFePO4 as cathode exhibit outstanding performance in terms of specific capacity (155.9&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), rate performance (91.8&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8197;C), cycling stability (109.4&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C after 800 cycles). The methodology described can be readily adapted to enable the use of carbon&#8208;based electrodes with well&#8208;defined channels in a wide range of contemporary applications that pertain to energy storage and delivery.

In this manuscript, three different morphology (nanorods, nanofibers and nanosheets) of Cu&#8208;MOP assemblies were obtained by adjusting binary solvent mixture of N, N&#8208;Dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol. Experimental results revealed that the Cu&#8208;MOPs nanofibers morphology with the highest peroxidase mimetic activity among these three assemblies, which is benefited for establishing the relationship between morphology and catalytic performance. The present study constitutes a facile step toward the development of modulation of morphology and functionality of MOP for biomedical application.







Abstract
The morphology of nanomaterials (geometric shape and dimension) play a significant role in its various physical and chemical properties. Thus, it is essential to link morphology with performance in specific applications. For this purpose, the morphology of copper metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (Cu&#8208;MOP) can be modulated through distinct assembly process, which facilitates the exploration of the relationship between morphology and catalytic performance. In this work, the assemblies of Cu&#8208;MOP with three different morphologies (nanorods, nanofibers and nanosheets) were facilely prepared by the variation of solvent mixture of N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol, revealed the important role of the interaction between the surface group and the solvent on the morphology of these assemblies. Cu&#8208;MOP nanofibers exhibited the highest mimetic peroxidase enzyme activity over the Cu&#8208;MOP nanosheets and nanorods, which have been utilized in the detection of glucose. Cu&#8208;MOPs assemblies with tunable morphology accompanied with adjustable mimic peroxidase activity, had great potential applications in the field of bioanalytical chemistry and biomedicals.

The reorganization of the coordination sphere of the [(C&#8201;N&#8201;C)AuL]+ scaffold led to the establishment of the [(C&#8201;C)Au(N&#8201;N)]+ family with a preserved redox stability but an enhanced reactivity toward biomolecules making it a new class of organogold anticancer agent.







Abstract
A library of eleven cationic gold(III) complexes of the general formula [(C&#8201;C)Au(N&#8201;N)]+ when C&#8201;C is either biphenyl or 4,4&#8217;&#8208;ditertbutyldiphenyl and N&#8201;N is a bipyridine, phenanthroline or dipyridylamine derivative have been synthesized and characterized. Contrasting effects on the viability of the triple negative breast cancer cells MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 was observed from a preliminary screening. The antiproliferative activity of the seven most active complexes were further assayed on a larger panel of human cancer cells as well as on non&#8208;cancerous cells for comparison. Two complexes stood out for being either highly active or highly selective. Eventually, reactivity studies with biologically meaningful amino acids, glutathione, higher order DNA structures and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) revealed a markedly different behavior from that of the well&#8208;known coordinatively isomeric [(C&#8201;N&#8201;C)Au(NHC)]+ structure. This makes the [(C&#8201;C)Au(N&#8201;N)]+ complexes a new class of organogold compounds with an original mode of action.

Understanding the molecular basis of the broad specificity of cellodextrin phosphorylase (CDP) from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum, can facilitate the generation of highly diverse CDP&#8208;catalysed cellulose&#8208;based structures. Here, NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling allowed to understand how CDP is able to bind non&#8208;natural chemically modified donors and acceptors with different binding epitopes, revealing the structural requirements for CDP ligands, which will enable exploitation of CDP to produce novel materials of high biotechnological interest.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;1&#8594;4&#8208;Glucan polysaccharides like cellulose, derivatives and analogues, are attracting attention due to their unique physicochemical properties, as ideal candidates for many different applications in biotechnology. Access to these polysaccharides with a high level of purity at scale is still challenging, and eco&#8208;friendly alternatives by using enzymes in&#8197;vitro are highly desirable. One prominent candidate enzyme is cellodextrin phosphorylase (CDP) from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum, which is able to yield cellulose oligomers from short cellodextrins and &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose 1&#8208;phosphate (Glc&#8208;1&#8208;P) as substrates. Remarkably, its broad specificity towards donors and acceptors allows the generation of highly diverse cellulose&#8208;based structures to produce novel materials. However, to fully exploit this CDP broad specificity, a detailed understanding of the molecular recognition of substrates by this enzyme in solution is needed. Herein, we provide a detailed investigation of the molecular recognition of ligands by CDP in solution by saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy, tr&#8208;NOESY and protein&#8208;ligand docking. Our results, discussed in the context of previous reaction kinetics data in the literature, allow a better understanding of the structural basis of the broad binding specificity of this biotechnologically relevant enzyme.

Enantiodivergent one&#8208;pot synthesis of axially chiral biaryls was developed using a catalytic amount of a chiral source. A domino organocatalyst&#8208;mediated enantioselective Michael/aldol condensation and enantiodivergent central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion afforded chiral biaryls with excellent enantioselectivity in a single reaction vessel. A plausible reaction mechanism for the enantiodivergence was proposed.







Abstract
Enantiodivergent one&#8208;pot synthesis of biaryls was developed using a catalytic amount of a single chiral source. A domino organocatalyst&#8208;mediated enantioselective Michael reaction and aldol condensation provided centrally chiral dihydronaphthalenes with excellent enantioselectivity, from which an enantiodivergent chirality conversion from central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality was achieved. Both enantiomers of biaryls were obtained with excellent enantioselectivity. All transformations can be conducted in a single reaction vessel. A plausible reaction mechanism for the enantiodivergence is proposed.

         <title>Construction of CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Enhancing H2 Evolution Activity Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 63, Page 15795-15805, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoS2 formed an S&#8208;type heterojunction. The mixed interface structure between them provided a new hydrogen&#8208;producing active center for each. In addition, the S&#8208;type heterojunction electron transfer mechanism not only promoted the separation of electrons (e&#8722;) and holes (h+) between Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoS2, but also retained electrons with strong reducibility, thereby promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In the field of photocatalysis, building a heterojunction is an effective way to promote electron transfer and enhance the reducibility of electrons. Herein, the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst (CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S) of CoS2 nanospheres modified Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution was synthesized and studied. The H2 evolution rate of the composite catalyst reached 25.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which was 3.26&#8197;times that of single Zn0.5Cd0.5S, whereas pure CoS2 showed almost no hydrogen production activity. Moreover, CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S had excellent stability and the hydrogen production rate after six cycles of experiments only dropped by 6.19&#8201;%. In addition, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical experiments had effectively proved that the photogenerated carrier transfer rate of CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S was better than CoS2 or Zn0.5Cd0.5S single catalyst. In this study, the synthesized CoS2 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S were both n&#8208;type semiconductors. After close contact, they followed an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction electron transfer mechanism, which not only promoted the separation of their respective holes and electrons, but also retained a stronger reduction potential, thus promoting the reduction of H+ protons in photocatalytic experiments. In short, this work provided a new basis for the construction of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction in addition to being used for photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Highly Efficient Simulated Solar Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Degradation of 4&#8208;Nitrophenol over CdS/Carbon/MoSx Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 63, Page 15806-15814, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalytic system is readily synthesized through a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal process. The CdS/MoSx heterojunction using ascorbic acid&#8208;derived carbon as cocatalyst degrades 4&#8208;nitrophenol about 9 times faster than neat CdS. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of an organic pollutant originates from efficient charge separation in the formed heterojunctions.







Abstract
Among the various organic pollutants and industrial chemicals, 4&#8208;nitrophenol has been one of the most monitored substances in aqueous environments, due to its enhanced solubility in such systems. This research reports for the first time the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of CdS/carbon/MoSx hybrids and the subsequent utilization of such systems as photocatalysts for 4&#8208;nitrophenol degradation. The hybrids demonstrated a variable photocatalytic activity, by using a variety of organic substances as precursors for the solvothermal carbonization step. By using ascorbic acid as precursor, the corresponding ternary composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity, with the 4&#8208;nitrophenol concentration been almost quantitatively decayed within 45&#8197;min of irradiation. This could be ascribed due to the generation of a high population of heterojunctions as well as the chemical speciation of Mo&#8208;based nanostructures. Such ternary hybrids may be utilized as potential photocatalytic systems in processes, where removal of toxic water&#8208;soluble substances is the key issue.

         <title>Polycationic Redox&#8208;Active Cyclophanes with Integrated Electron&#8208;Rich Diboron Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 63, Page 15737-15750, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclophanes and macrocyclic cages are of interest for a variety of applications. In this work, it is shown that the integration of electron rich diboron units into polycationic cyclophanes and macrocyclic cages with bi&#8208; and trispyridine electron&#8208;acceptor units leads to novel donor&#8208;acceptor compounds with intriguing optical and redox properties.







Abstract
Cationic cyclophanes are widely used in a variety of applications in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work the authors systematically study the integration of electron&#8208;rich diboron units with BII atoms into polycationic cyclophanes with viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;acceptor units.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cyclophanes&lt;/b&gt; and macrocyclic cages are of interest for a variety of applications. In this work, it is shown that the integration of electron rich diboron units into polycationic cyclophanes and macrocyclic cages with bi- and trispyridine electron-acceptor units leads to novel donor-acceptor compounds with intriguing optical and redox properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cationic cyclophanes are widely used in a variety of applications in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work the authors systematically study the integration of electron-rich diboron units with B&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; atoms into polycationic cyclophanes with viologen-like electron-acceptor units. They also report a first hexacationic cage-compound in which three diboron units connect two tris(4-pyridyl)triazine acceptor units. Moreover, di- and tetracationic open-structure compounds, in which one diboron unit connects two bispyridyl groups, were synthesized and the properties compared to those of the corresponding closed structures (cyclophanes). The combination of diboron electron-donor units and bi- or oligopyridyl electron-acceptor units leads to intriguing optical and redox properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Investigation on Optical and Biological Properties of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;Dimethylaminophenyl)benzothiazole Based Cycloplatinated Complexes</title>

Biocompatible photosensitizers: Mono&#8208; and dinuclear cycloplatinated complexes featuring the donor&#8211;acceptor 2&#8208;(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)benzothiazolyl ligand (Me2N&#8208;pbt) and biologically active phosphines show dual emission and photoinduced phosphorescence generating 1O2, with potential applications in theranostics and photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The optical and biological properties of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)benzothiazole cycloplatinated complexes featuring bioactive ligands ([{Pt(Me2N&#8208;pbt)(C6F5)}L] [L=Me2N&#8208;pbtH 1, p&#8208;dpbH (4&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)benzoic acid) 2, o&#8208;dpbH (2&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)benzoic acid) 3), [Pt(Me2N&#8208;pbt)(o&#8208;dpb)] 4, [{Pt(Me2N&#8208;pbt)(C6F5)}2(&#956;&#8208;PRnP)] [PR4P=O(CH2CH2OC(O)C6H4PPh2)2 5, PR12P=O{(CH2CH2O)3C(O)C6H4PPh2}2 6] are presented. Complexes 1&#8211;6 display 1ILCT and metal&#8208;perturbed 3ILCT dual emissions. The ratio between both bands is excitation dependent, accomplishing warm&#8208;white emissions for 2, 5 and 6. The phosphorescent emission is lost in aerated solutions owing to photoinduced electron transfer to 3O2 and the formation of 1O2, as confirmed in complexes 2 and 4. They also exhibit photoinduced phosphorescence enhancement in non&#8208;degassed DMSO due to local oxidation of DMSO by sensitized 1O2, which causes a local degassing. Me2N&#8208;pbtH and the complexes specifically accumulate in the Golgi apparatus, although only 2, 3 and 6 were active against A549 and HeLa cancer cell lines, 6 being highly selective in respect to nontumoral cells. The potential photodynamic property of these complexes was demonstrated with complex 4.

         <title>Cover Feature: Additive and Emergent Catalytic Properties of Dimeric Unnatural Amino Acid Derivatives: Aldol and Conjugate Additions (Chem. Eur. J. 63/2021)</title>

Dimeric unnatural prolines can show emergent catalytic properties with respect to their monomeric analogues. When aldol reactions are studied, both monomeric and dimeric organocatalysts behave similarly, the stereocontrol shown by the dimers being additive with respect to their monomeric components. However, the ability of the dimers to promote Michael reactions constitutes a catalytic property not shown by the constituent monomers. This cover represents the emergent catalytic properties of this kind of unnatural &#947;&#8208;dipeptides. More information can be found in the Full Paper by F.&#8197;P. Coss&#237;o et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102394).

         <title>Frontispiece: Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkoxylation of Alkynes: An Overview</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 63, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The past few decades have seen the emergence of cascade reactions involving hydroalkoxylation of alkyne as a reliable method for the synthesis of various oxygen&#8208;bearing complex scaffolds. In this context, reactions such as cycloaddition reaction, Prins cyclization, Michael addition reaction etc. have been successfully coupled with hydroalkoxylation for the rapid construction of these complex motifs. The review by S.&#8197;K. Nanda and R. Mallikon page 15571&#8197;ff. provides an insight into these cascade reactions focusing on the developments in the last decade.

         <dc:description>
Ag clusters have attracted considerable recent research interest but unfortunately suffered from inevitable poor stability. In this Concept, we will introduce Ag clusters protected by three different types of metal&#8208;oxo modules, exhibiting improved stability and some unique properties. Some insights into fabricating such hybrid clusters and problems to be solved for the future development of this field are put forward. Read more in the Concept by L. Zhang, J. Zhang et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;15563&#8197;ff.

Near&#8208;infrared absorbing properties are of great interest in organic semiconducting materials for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;active optoelectronic applications. A series of thienoquinoid&#8208;containing molecules are presented that show very small optical energy gaps of down to 0.72&#8197;eV, corresponding to a wavelength of 1700&#8197;nm. The key to the very small optical energy gaps is an efficient quinoid&#8208;aromatic resonance along the conjugated backbones that significantly reduces the bond length alternation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Kawabata and K. Takimiya (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102663).

Atom size, not electronegativity difference, determines C&#8722;X bond strength, which weakens from X=F to I. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103544), M. Bickelhaupt et&#8197;al. reveal that, as the atom size increases, it is the increase in steric Pauli repulsion that weakens the C&#8722;X bond, and not the weakening of the orbital interaction (which, in fact, strengthens it!), as is traditionally considered in the electronegativity model. With state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT calculations, they provide compelling evidence to challenge the electronegativity model.

         <title>Development of the Peripheral Functionalization Chemistry of meso&#8208;Free Corroles</title>

         <dc:description>
Since reliable synthetic methods for meso&#8208;free corroles were developed, the peripheral functionalization chemistry of corroles has blossomed again. In this Minireview, classical electrophilic reactions, SNAr reactions, and unique oxidation behavior are introduced, and their impact on the structures, electronic states, optical properties, and aromaticities of corroles are highlighted.







Abstract
In contrast to the extensive development of the meso&#8208;functionalization of porphyrins, that of corroles had rarely been explored until the development of practical synthetic methods for meso&#8208;free corroles in 2015. The ready availability of meso&#8208;free corroles opened up meso&#8208;functionalization chemistry of corroles, giving rise to successful synthesis of various meso&#8208;substituted corroles such as meso&#8208;halogen, meso&#8208;nitro, meso&#8208;amino, meso&#8208;oxo, and meso&#8208;iminocorroles as well as meso&#8211;meso&#8208;linked corrole dimers and corrole tapes. In some cases, 2NH corroles exist as stable or transient radical species. The impact of meso&#8208;functionalization on the structures, electronic properties, optical characteristics, and aromaticity of corroles are highlighted in this Minireview.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroalkoxylation of Alkynes: An Overview</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 63, Page 15571-15604, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has come fore as one of the reliable method for the construction of oxygen bearing entities. In this domain, plethora of strategies describing hydroalkoxylation/hydroalkoxylation accompanied cascade reactions of alkynes have been reported for the construction of oxygen bearing complex heterocycles in a diastereo&#8208; as well as enantioselective manner.







Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;bearing motifs, mainly the congener heterocycles are ubiquitous due to their presence in various natural products and bioactive scaffolds. Although in literature, several strategies have been developed for their synthesis, hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has come forward as a method of choice and has been used extensively. In particular, hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has gained enormous attention from the synthetic community due to the rapid access to a very useful and reactive synthetic intermediate like &#8216;enol ether&#8217;. Furthermore, to manifold the utility of these methods, reports have been developed elaborating the generation of &#8216;enol ether&#8217; using hydroalkoxylation and their usage in various reactions in cascade or tandem manner. This review focuses on recent development on the hydroalkoxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of oxygen&#8208;containing entities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hydroalkoxylation of alkynes&lt;/b&gt; has come fore as one of the reliable method for the construction of oxygen bearing entities. In this domain, plethora of strategies describing hydroalkoxylation/hydroalkoxylation accompanied cascade reactions of alkynes have been reported for the construction of oxygen bearing complex heterocycles in a diastereo- as well as enantioselective manner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen-bearing motifs, mainly the congener heterocycles are ubiquitous due to their presence in various natural products and bioactive scaffolds. Although in literature, several strategies have been developed for their synthesis, hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has come forward as a method of choice and has been used extensively. In particular, hydroalkoxylation of alkynes has gained enormous attention from the synthetic community due to the rapid access to a very useful and reactive synthetic intermediate like &#8216;enol ether&#8217;. Furthermore, to manifold the utility of these methods, reports have been developed elaborating the generation of &#8216;enol ether&#8217; using hydroalkoxylation and their usage in various reactions in cascade or tandem manner. This review focuses on recent development on the hydroalkoxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of oxygen-containing entities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Ruthenium and enzyme catalysis were combined in a one&#8208;pot procedure to achieve efficient DYKAT of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxyketones. This newly developed protocol offers straightforward access to enantiomerically pure and diastereomerically enriched &#946;&#8208;oxoacetates in high yields by employing a ruthenium&#8208;based racemization catalyst for efficient racemization&#8208;epimerization of substrates via formation of non&#8208;chiral 1,3&#8208;diketone intermediates.







Abstract
Herein we report on the development and application of chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformation (DYKAT) of &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;hydroxyketones (&#946;&#8208;HKs), using Candida antartica lipase B (CALB) as transesterification catalyst and a ruthenium complex as epimerization catalyst. An operationally simple protocol allows for an efficient preparation of highly enantiomerically enriched &#945;&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;oxoacetates. The products were obtained in yields up to 95&#8201;% with good diastereomeric ratios.

         <title>Stereoselective Direct N&#8208;Trifluoropropenylation of Heterocycles with a Hypervalent Iodonium Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 63, Page 15638-15643, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
E&#8208;selective trifluoropropenylation of versatile N&#8208;heterocycles was developed with the utilization of trifluoropropenyliodonium salts. The procedure enables the straightforward direct introduction of the trifluoroalkenyl moiety into heterocyclic scaffolds under simple and mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
The availability and synthesis of fluorinated enamine derivatives such as N&#8208;(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropenyl)heterocycles are challenging, especially through direct functionalization of the heterocyclic scaffold. Herein, a stereoselective N&#8208;trifluoropropenylation method based on the use of a bench&#8208;stable trifluoropropenyl iodonium salt is described. This reagent enables the straightforward trifluoropropenylation of various N&#8208;heterocycles under mild reaction conditions, providing trifluoromethyl enamine type moieties with high stereoselectivity and efficiency.

         <title>The Chemical Bond: When Atom Size Instead of Electronegativity Difference Determines Trend in Bond Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 63, Page 15616-15622, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paradigm Switch! Chemical bonds in general become stronger as the electronegativity difference across the bond increases. This correlation has hitherto been considered causal but, here, we show it is not in some remarkable cases. For example, carbon&#8722;halogen bonds become weaker from C&#8722;F to C&#8722;I, despite stronger (not weaker) orbital interactions as the bond overlap increases, because of stronger Pauli repulsion with the larger, more electron&#8208;rich halogen.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically analyzed element&#8722;element bonds of archetypal HnX&#8722;YHn molecules (X, Y=C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, I), using density functional theory. One purpose is to obtain a set of consistent homolytic bond dissociation energies (BDE) for establishing accurate trends across the periodic table. The main objective is to elucidate the underlying physical factors behind these chemical bonding trends. On one hand, we confirm that, along a period (e.&#8201;g., from C&#8722;C to C&#8722;F), bonds strengthen because the electronegativity difference across the bond increases. But, down a period, our findings constitute a paradigm shift. From C&#8722;F to C&#8722;I, for example, bonds do become weaker, however, not because of the decreasing electronegativity difference. Instead, we show that the effective atom size (via steric Pauli repulsion) is the causal factor behind bond weakening in this series, and behind the weakening in orbital interactions at the equilibrium distance. We discuss the actual bonding mechanism and the importance of analyzing this mechanism as a function of the bond distance.

Four synthetic FPP analogues were converted by three robust bacterial sesquiterpene synthases, yielding previously unknown compounds with high stereoselectivity, which demonstrates that this approach can open the doors to chemical terra incognita. The altered or partially blocked reactivity in the substrates also gave interesting insights into the enzyme mechanisms which adds to our understanding of terpene biosynthesis.







Abstract
Four synthetic farnesyl diphosphate analogues were enzymatically converted with three bacterial sesquiterpene synthases, including &#946;&#8208;himachalene synthase (HcS) and (Z)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;bisabolene synthase (BbS) from Cryptosporangium arvum, and germacrene A synthase (SmTS6) from Streptomyces mobaraensis. These enzyme reactions not only yielded several previously unknown compounds, showing that this approach opened the door to a new chemical space, but substrates with blocked or altered reactivities also gave interesting insights into the cyclisation mechanisms and the potential to catalyse reactions with different initial cyclisation modes.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Alkylidene Phthalides by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Domino C&#8722;H Acylation/Annulation of Benzamides with Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 63, Page 15628-15633, November 11, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 8&#8208;aminoquinolin&#8208;derived benzamides with aliphatic carboxylic acids is described. This reaction goes through 8&#8208;aminoquinolin&#8208;directed C&#8722;H acylation of benzamides using acyl fluorides generated by carboxylic acids as carbonyl sources and concomitant conversion of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;derived amide into lactone. This synthetic method exhibited broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity for Z&#8208;isomers.







Abstract
The Rh&#8208;catalyzed ortho&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H functionalization of 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;derived benzamides with aliphatic acyl fluorides generated in&#8197;situ from the corresponding acids has been developed. This reaction initiated with 8&#8208;aminoquinoline&#8208;directed ortho&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H acylation, which was accompanied by subsequent intramolecular nucleophilic acyl substitution of amide group to produce alkylidene phthalides This approach exhibits high stereo&#8208;selectivity for Z&#8208;isomer products, and tolerates a variety of functional groups as well as aliphatic carboxylic acids with diverse structural scaffolds.

     alt="Facile Synthesis of Alkylidene Phthalides by Rhodium-Catalyzed Domino C&#8722;H Acylation/Annulation of Benzamides with Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Rh-catalyzed domino reaction of 8-aminoquinolin-derived benzamides with aliphatic carboxylic acids is described. This reaction goes through 8-aminoquinolin-directed C&#8722;H acylation of benzamides using acyl fluorides generated by carboxylic acids as carbonyl sources and concomitant conversion of 8-aminoquinoline-derived amide into lactone. This synthetic method exhibited broad substrate scope and excellent stereoselectivity for &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-isomers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rh-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H functionalization of 8-aminoquinoline-derived benzamides with aliphatic acyl fluorides generated in&#8197;situ from the corresponding acids has been developed. This reaction initiated with 8-aminoquinoline-directed &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H acylation, which was accompanied by subsequent intramolecular nucleophilic acyl substitution of amide group to produce alkylidene phthalides This approach exhibits high stereo-selectivity for &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-isomer products, and tolerates a variety of functional groups as well as aliphatic carboxylic acids with diverse structural scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Core subjects: Two new early transition metal (Zr or Hf)&#8211;protected octaborane derivatives, [(Cp2MBH3)2B8H6] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5; M=Zr (1&#8208;Zr) and Hf (1&#8208;Hf)) have been isolated and structurally characterized. The solid&#8208;state structures of both 1&#8208;Zr and 1&#8208;Hf comprise a B8 dodecahedron core protected by {Cp2MBH3} moieties on both sides of the cluster. The spectroscopic data also validate the intactness of the B8 dodecahedron core in the solution as well.







Abstract
Despite the synthesis and structural characterization of closo&#8208;hydroborate dianions, [BnHn]2&#8722; (n=6&#8211;12) more than 50&#8197;years ago, some ambiguity remains about the structure of [B8H8]2&#8722;. Although the solid&#8208;state structure of [B8H8]2&#8722; was established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray studies in 1969, fast rearrangements in solution at accessible temperatures prevented its detailed characterization. We therefore stabilized a derivative of [B8H8]2&#8722; by using Cp2MBH3 and structurally characterized two new octaborane analogues, [(Cp2MBH3)2B8H6] (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5; M=Zr (1&#8208;Zr) and Hf (1&#8208;Hf)), so that the dynamics of the B8 skeleton were arrested. The solid&#8208;state structures of both 1&#8208;Zr and 1&#8208;Hf comprise a dodecahedron core protected by {Cp2MBH3} moieties on both sides of the cluster. Spectroscopic characterization (11B NMR) validates the intactness of the B8 dodecahedron core in solution as well. Theoretical calculations establish that the two exo&#8208;{Cp2MBH3} fragments provide structural and electronic structural stability to the B8 core and its intact dodecahedral dianionic nature. Furthermore, we propose isodesmic equations for the formation of higher analogues of the Bn core (n&gt;8) guarded by different group 4 transition metals. Our analysis suggests that, as we move to higher polyhedra (n&gt;10), the formation becomes unfavourable irrespective of metal.

         <title>Perfluoroaryl and perfluoroheteroaryl reagents as emerging new tools for peptide synthesis, modification and bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides and proteins are becoming increasingly valuable as medicines, diagnostic agents and as tools for biomedical sciences. Much of this has been underpinned by the emergence of new methods for the manipulation and augmentation of native biomolecules. Perfluoroaromatic reagents are perhaps one of the most diverse and exciting tools with which to modify peptides and proteins, due principally to their nucleophilic substitution chemistry, high electron deficiency and the ability for their reactivity to be tuned towards specific nucleophiles. As discussed in this minireview, in recent years, perfluoroaromatic reagents have found applications as protecting groups or activating groups in peptide synthesis and as orthogonal handles for peptide modification. Furthermore, they have applications in chemoselective &#8216;tagging&#8217;, stapling and bioconjugation of peptides and proteins, as well as tuning of &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; properties. This review will also explore possible future applications of these reagents in biological chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling of photoactive transition metal complexes to a functional polymer matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conductive polymers represent a promising alternative to semiconducting oxide electrodes typically used in dye&#8208;sensitized cathodes as they more easily allow a tuning of the physicochemical properties. This can then also be very beneficial for using them in light&#8208;driven catalysis. In this computational study, we address the coupling of Ru&#8208;based photosensitizers to a polymer matrix by combining two different first&#8208;principles electronic structure approaches. We use a periodic density functional theory code to properly account for the delocalized nature of the electronic states in the polymer. These ground state investigations are complemented by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory simulations to assess the Franck&#8208;Condon photophysics of the present photoactive hybrid material based on a molecular model system. Our results are consistent with recent experimental observations and allow to elucidate the light&#8208;driven redox chemical processes &#8211; eventually leading to charge separation &#8211; in the present functional hybrid systems with potential application as photocathode materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>(&#8210;)&#8208;Fusaequisin A is an irregularly assembled polyketide isolated from the ascomycete  Fusarium equiseti  . Fusaequisin A shares a carbon backbone with curvicollide C from the ascomycete  Podospora curvicolla  but its absolute configuration remained hitherto unsettled. Herein, we document the total synthesis of (&#8210;)&#8208;fusaequisin A and its 4&#8208;  O  &#8208;desmethyl derivative following a central&#8208;to&#8208;lateral building block strategy. Catalytic asymmetric Claisen rearrangement, Julia&#8210;Kocienski olefination and olefin cross&#8208;metathesis served as key C/C&#8208;connecting transformations. The constitution and absolute configuration of (&#8210;)&#8208;fusaequisin A was deduced and the original structural assignment was adjusted.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Scissors for Tailor&#8208;Made Modification of Siloxane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled design of functional oligosiloxanes is an important topic in current research. A consecutive Si&#8211;O&#8211;Si bond cleavage/formation using siloxanes that are substituted with 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene derivatives acting as molecular scissors is presented. The method allows to cut at certain positions of a siloxane scaffold forming a cyclic diaminosilane or &#8208;siloxane intermediate and then to introduce new functional siloxy units. The procedure could be extended to a direct one&#8208;step cleavage of chlorooligosiloxanes. Both siloxane formation and cleavage proceed with good to excellent yields, high regioselectivity, and great variability of the siloxy units. Control of the selectivity is achieved by the choice of the amino substituent. Insight into the mechanism was provided by low temperature NMR studies and the isolation of a lithiated intermediate.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis, characterization and reactivity studies of the NHC&#8208;stabilized complex IDipp&#8226;GeH  2  BH  2  OTf (  1  ) (IDipp&#160;= 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are reported.

         <title>On the Supra&#8208;LUMO Interaction: Case Study of a Sudden Change of Electronic Structure as a Functional Emergence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synergistic functioning of redox&#8208;active components that emerges from prototypical 2,2'&#8208;di(  N  &#8208;methylpyrid&#8208;4&#8208;ylium)&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl is described. Interestingly, even if a&#160;  trans  conformation of the native assembly is expected, due to electrostatic repulsion between cationic pyridinium units, we demonstrate that&#160;  cis  conformation is equally energy&#8208;stabilized on account of a peculiar LUMO (SupLUMO) that develops through space, encompassing the two pyridiniums in a single, made&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8208;piece, electronic entity (superelectrophoric behavior). This SupLUMO emergence originates in a sudden change of electronic structure. This finding is substantiated by solid state (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction) and solution (NOE&#8208;NMR and UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR spectroelectrochemistry) studies, combined with electronic structure computations. Electrochemistry shows that electron transfers are so strongly correlated that two&#8208;electron reduction manifests itself as a single&#8208;step process with a large potential inversion consistent with inner creation of a carbon&#8208;carbon bond (digital simulation). The redox&#8208;gated covalent bond, serving as electron reservoir, was studied via atropisomerism of the reduction product (VT&#8208;NMR).&#160;  Trans  and&#160;  cis  native species are worth considered as intrinsically different, that is, as doubly&#8208;electrophoric and singly&#8208;superelectrophoric assemblies, beyond conformational isomerism. Importantly, the through&#8208;space&#8208;mediated SupLUMO may come in complement of other weak interactions encountered in Supramolecular Chemistry as a tool for the design of electroactive architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Tolerant Sulfate Tetrahedral Cages from Anion&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands L2 and L3 assemble with sulfate anions to give the first A4L4&#8208;type sulfate tetrahedral cages. The existence of A4L4 cages in solution is sensitive to the stoichiometry of the sulfate and internal guest; they can transform to A3L2 and A3L1 with increasing amounts of sulfate anion. Most noticeably, the A4L4 cages exhibit greater resistance to both Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acids than the corresponding phosphate cages.







Abstract
Supramolecular cages have been constructed by anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) in recent years and have shown unique host&#8208;guest interactions. However, most of the reported cages are made of the phosphate ion (PO43&#8722;); other anions have rarely been explored. Here we show for the first time that the sulfate ion (SO42&#8722;) is also able to form the A4L4 tetrahedral motif with tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands, but this is dependent on the stoichiometry of the sulfate ion (in solution). Notably, the sulfate cages display enhanced resistance for both Br&#248;nsted (pH as low as 4.3 in acetone containing 15&#8201;% water) and Lewis acids (metal complexes) compared to the corresponding phosphate cages, and thus could find applications where an acidic (proton or metals) environment is required.

         <title>Synergy of Iron Doping and Cyano Groups for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production over C3N4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe doping improves the absorption of visible light and the conductivity of the material, and promotes the dissociation of excitons, thereby improving the photocatalytic activity. The internal donor&#8208;acceptor system formed by cyano groups and Fe&#8208;doped sites enhanced charge carrier separation and inhibited the radiation recombination of e&#8722;&#8208;h+ pairs. The porous structure provides a higher specific surface area and pore structure, which provides a large number of active sites for the photocatalytic reaction.







Abstract
Improving the insufficient carrier separation dynamics is still of significance in carbon nitride (C3N4) research. Extensive research has been devoted to improving the carrier separation efficiency through a single strategy, while ignoring the synergistic enhancement effect produced by coupling two or more conventional strategies. Herein, we reported the fabrication of cyano group&#8208;containing Fe&#8208;doped C3N4 porous materials via direct co&#8208;calcination of iron acetylacetonate and melamine for synergistically improving the photocatalytic performance. Iron acetylacetonate can promote the generation of cyano groups and form Fe&#8208;doping in C3N4, thereby increasing the visible&#8208;light absorption and reactive sites. Further, the internal donor&#8208;acceptor system formed by cyano groups and Fe&#8208;doped sites promoted charge carrier separation and inhibited the radiation recombination of e&#8722;&#8208;h+ pairs. The optimized photocatalytic activity of Fe&#8722;CN&#8208;2 sample was 4.5 times of bulk C3N4 (BCN).

         <title>Rhoda&#8208;Electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H Methylation and Paired Electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H Ethylation and Propylation</title>

         <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H alkylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes has been established by using sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly electrocatalytic approaches. As a result, several arenes, including biologically relevant purines, diazepam, and amino acids were selectively methylated. Finally, an example of an unprecedented, paired electrolysis approach leading to ethylated and propylated arenes was also discovered.







Abstract
The use of electricity over traditional stoichiometric oxidants is a promising strategy for sustainable molecular assembly. Herein, we describe the rhoda&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8722;H activation/alkylation of several N&#8208;heteroarenes. This catalytic approach has been successfully applied to several arenes, including biologically relevant purines, diazepam, and amino acids. The versatile C&#8722;H alkylation featured water as a co&#8208;solvent and user&#8208;friendly trifluoroborates as alkylating agents. Finally, the rhoda&#8208;electrocatalysis with unsaturated organotrifluoroborates proceeded by paired electrolysis.

1,7&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted aza&#8208;BODIPYs (tBu&#8208;azaBDPs) were successfully prepared for the first time. Although the low&#8208;barrier rotation of the distal &#8208;tBu groups in tBu&#8208;azaBDPs results in low quantum yield, photothermal conversion efficiency and single oxygen generation ability of tBu&#8208;azaBDPs are effective than those of Ph&#8208;azaBDP, which is highly desirable for a photothermal&#8208;photodynamic therapy agent.







Abstract
1,7&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;substituted aza&#8208;BODIPYs (tBu&#8208;azaBDP) were successfully obtained for the first time. The structures of tBu&#8208;azaBDP and Ph&#8208;azaBDP were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis, and tBu&#8208;azaBDP 2 is more twisted than Ph&#8208;azaBDP 5. tBu&#8208;azaBDPs have significant photo&#8208;stability and enhanced water solubility. tBu&#8208;azaBDPs possess excellent optical properties, such as high molar extinction coefficients, broad full width half maxima, and large Stokes shifts, which is comparable to those of the parent dye Ph&#8208;azaBDP. Although the low&#8208;barrier rotation of the distal &#8208;tBu groups in tBu&#8208;azaBDPs results in low quantum yield, photothermal conversion efficiency and singlet oxygen generation ability of tBu&#8208;azaBDPs are more effective than those of Ph&#8208;azaBDP, which is highly desirable for a photothermal&#8208;photodynamic therapy agent.

         <title>Domino Dehydrative &#960;&#8208;Extension: A Facile Path to Extended Perylenes and Terrylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards nanographenes: Domino&#8208;DPEX (dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extension) is a new synthetic approach to extended nanographenes containing a perylene or terrylene core. The pronounced regioselctivity towards aldehyde groups in different positions makes DPEX an excellent tool for implementing pre&#8208;programmed multiple annulation of simple precursors of elusive nanographenes. This approach enables the formation of up to five C&#8722;C bonds in one&#8208;step in up to 94&#8201;% per C&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
Herein, we report a new method for synthesis of extended perylenes and terrylenes. The technique is based on the cascade dehydrative &#960;&#8208;extensions (DPEX) of aryl aldehydes, in which stepwise annulations activate previously &#8220;dormant&#8221; substituents. Two&#8208; and fourfold cyclizations of 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehydes offer a rapid path to unsymmetrical perylenes and elusive terrylene derivatives, respectively. DPEX of 3,3&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(phenanthrene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl)bis (([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde)) leads to the biradical structure, which proceeds in&#8197;situ into oxidative electrocyclization at room temperature. The described domino process complements and expands DPEX approach to a large family of fused acenes and related PAHs.

         <title>Multiple Regulation Effects of Ammonium Acetate on ZnO Growth Process in Chemical Bath Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final morphology of ZnO generally involves nucleation, Ostwald ripening and self&#8208;assembly process. Herein, the nucleation experienced the Zn2+&#8208;layered basic zinc salts (LBZs)&#8208;ZnO process, while the self&#8208;assembled unit changed from urchin&#8208;shaped to rod&#8208;shaped and gradually a fully coupled twin&#8208;shaped structure with the increasing concentration of ammonium acetate. The whole growth process clarifies the roles of ammonium acetate in the growth mechanism of ZnO, which may further benefit the optimal synthesis of functional structures.







Abstract
Chemical bath deposition method has been used to synthesize a variety of ZnO morphology structures. However, the specificity and interaction of acetate and ammonium ions with ZnO crystal during the growth process remain elusive. This study contributes to understand the roles of ammonium acetate on the growth mechanism of ZnO in Zn(NO3)2&#8208;HMTA system. The growth process indicates that the nucleation experienced Zn2+&#8208;layered basic zinc salts (LBZs)&#8208;ZnO process, while the self&#8208;assembled unit changed from urchin&#8208;shaped, rod&#8208;shaped to a fully coupled twin&#8208;shaped structure with increasing ammonium acetate concentration. Ammonium acetate dominates the growth process by combing the ligand&#8208;ligand interaction of acetate ions binding to the same Zn&#8208;rich (0001) polar surface and ammonium ions regulating hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) hydrolysis. Relatively regular hexagonal wurtzite structure and a dissolve&#8208;renucleation&#8208;regrowth process which retains the twin&#8208;shaped template and renucleates at the same position are observed at &#8764;10&#8197;mM ammonium acetate. Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) measurements show that the uniform hexagonal ZnO rods (Y&#8208;10, the sample named as Y&#8208;x (x represents x mM ammonium acetate, herein, x is 10&#8197;mM)) have a maximum photocurrent density of 1.54&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;V (vs. RHE), much higher than that of the dumbbell&#8208;shaped ZnO rods (Y&#8208;50, 0.20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at the same voltage. These results provide a further explanation of morphology regulation mechanisms on ZnO synthesis processes and pave the road for more practical applications.

         <title>Tubular Structures of Calcium Carbonate: Formation, Characterization, and Implications in Natural Mineral Environments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium carbonate chemical gardens are tubular mineral structures precipitated upon the addition of sodium carbonate solution to calcium chloride pellets. The tubes are composed of texturally distinct bilayers of aggregates of rhombohedral and cone&#8208;shaped calcite on their exterior and interior surfaces, respectively. These highly crystalline and dense bilayers prohibit the development of significant electrochemical potential differences across the tube walls. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Kellermeier, J.&#8197;M. Garc&#237;a&#8208;Ruiz et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101417).

         <title>Fast and Efficient Postsynthetic DNA Labeling in Cells by Means of Strain&#8208;Promoted Sydnone&#8208;Alkyne Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA strands, modified with the novel bioorthogonal reporter sydnone, undergo fast and efficient labeling with cyclooctyne&#8211;dye conjugates, both in vitro and in HeLa cells. These results show that sydnones are versatile bioorthogonal tags and have the premise to become essential tools for tracking DNA and potentially RNA in living cells. More information can be found in the Communication by F. Friscourt, H.&#8208;A. Wagenknecht et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103026).

         <title>Being positive is not everything &#8211; experimental and computational studies on the selectivity of a self&#8208;assembled, multiple redox&#8208;state, receptor that binds anions with up to picomolar affinities</title>

         <dc:description>The interaction of the self&#8208;assembled trinuclear ruthenium bowl  1  3+  , that displays three other accessible oxidation states, with oxo&#8208;anions is investigated. Using a combination of NMR and electrochemical experimental data, estimates of the binding affinities of  1  4+  ,  1  5+  , and  1  6+  for both halide and oxo&#8208;anions were derived. This analysis revealed that, across the range of oxidation states of the host, both high anion binding affinities (&gt;10  9  M  &#8211;1  for specific guests bound to  1  6+  ) and high selectivities (a range of &gt;10  7  M  &#8211;1  ) were observed. As the crystal structure of binding of the hexafluorophosphate anion revealed that the host has two potential binding sites (named the &#945; and &#946; pockets), the host&#8208;guest properties of both putative binding sites of the bowl, in all of its four oxidation states, were investigated through detailed quantum&#8208;based computational studies. These studies revealed that, due to the interplay of electrostatically assisted hydrogen&#8208;bonding and anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, binding to the &#945; pocket is generally preferred, except for the case of the relatively large and lipophilic hexafluorophosphate anionic guest and the host in the highest oxidation states, where the &#946; pocket becomes relatively favourable. This analysis confirms that host&#8208;guest interactions involving structurally complex supramolecular architectures are driven by a combination of non&#8208;covalent interactions and, even in the case of charged binding pairs, electrostatics alone cannot accurately define these recognition processes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Biomimetic oxidation of primary amines to carboxylic acids has been developed where the copper&#8208;containing amine oxidase (CuAO)&#8208;like o&#8208;NQ&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation was combined with the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)&#8208;like TBHP&#8208;mediated imine oxidation protocol. Notably, the current tandem oxidation strategy provides a new mechanistic insight into the imine intermediate and the seemingly simple TBHP&#8208;mediated oxidation pathways of imines.

         <title>Highly Efficient Ir(III)&#8208;coumarin Photo&#8208;redox Catalyst for Synergetic Multi&#8208;mode Cancer Photo&#8208;therapy</title>

         <dc:description>Novel Ir(III) photo&#8208;redox catalysts [Ir(C^N) 2 (N^N^N)] + ( Ir1&#8208;4 ) employing bidentate terpyridine&#8208;based ligands were synthesized and evaluated for photo&#8208;catalytic cancer therapy. The coumarin functionalized photo&#8208;catalysts ( Ir1 &#8208; Ir3 ) showed excellent photo&#8208;stability with strong visible light absorption between 400&#8208;550 nm. Upon light irradiation (465 and 525 nm), Ir1 &#8208; Ir3 synergistically generated singlet oxygen and induced rapidly photo&#8208;catalytic oxidation of cellular coenzymes NAD(P)H. Ir1 &#8208; Ir3 showed time&#8208;dependent cellular uptake with excellent intracellular retention efficiency. Upon green light irradiation (525 nm), Ir2 provided a much higher photo&#8208;index (PI = 793) than the clinically used photosensitizer, 5&#8208;aminolevulinicacid (5&#8208;ALA, PI &gt; 30) against HeLa cancer cells. The observed necro&#8208;apoptotic anticancer activity of Ir2 was due to the photo&#8208;triggered intracellular redox imbalance (by NAD(P)H oxidation and ROS generation) and change in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Remarkably, Ir2 showed in&#8208;vivo photo&#8208;induced catalytic anticancer activity in mouse models.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvothermal synthesis of [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#183;2H2O with magnetically frustrated [Cr7S8]5+ double&#8208;cubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel transition metal chalcohalide [Cr7S8(en)8Cl2]Cl3&#183;2H2O, with [Cr7S8]5+ dicubane cationic clusters has been synthesized by a low temperature solvothermal method using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ethylenediamine (en) solvents. Ethylenediamine ligand exhibits bi&#8208; and monodentate coordination modes, in the latter case ethylenediamine coordinates to Cr atoms of adjacent clusters, giving rise to a 2D polymeric structure. Although magnetic susceptibility shows no magnetic ordering down to 1.8 K, highly negative Weiss constant, q &#160;= &#8211;224(2) K, obtained from Curie&#8208;Weiss fit of inverse susceptibility suggests strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions between S = 3/2 Cr(III) centers. Due to the complexity of the system with (2S + 1)7 = 16384 microstates from seven Cr3+ centers, a simplified model with only two exchange constants was used for simulations. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations yielded the two exchange constants to be J1 = &#8211;21.4 cm&#8211;1 and J2 = &#8211;30.2 cm&#8211;1, confirming competing AFM coupling between the shared Cr3+ center and the peripheral Cr3+ ions of the dicubane cluster. The best simulation of the experimental data was obtained with J1 = &#8211;20.0 cm&#8211;1 and J2 = &#8211;21.0 cm&#8211;1, in agreement with the slightly stronger AFM exchange within the triangles of the peripheral Cr3+ ions as compared to the AFM exchange between the central and peripheral Cr3+ ions. This compound can be used to explore the synthesis of magnetically frustrated systems of polymeric nature, containing dicubane transition meta&#8208;chalcogenide cations and charge balancing halide anions</dc:description>

         <title>A Phosphorus Based Pacman Dication Generated by Cooperative Self&#8208;Activation of a Pacman Phosphane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formal coordination of phosphorus(III) by a calix[4]pyrrole Schiff base ligand was achieved via the reaction of this ligand with PCl3 under basic conditions. The reaction product adopts a Pacman conformation with two P&#8209;Cl moieties, one in exo and one in endo position. It represents the first non&#8208;metal compound of calix[4]pyrrole Schiff base ligands and of Pacman ligands in general. The spatial neighborhood of the two P atoms enables cooperative reactions. As a first example, the chloride abstraction with AgOTf is presented, yielding a macrocyclic dication with two embedded phosphorus(III) monocations, which both undergo a cooperative, internal activation reaction with an adjacent C=N double bond. This intramolecular redox process affords two pentacoordinated phosphorus(V) centers within the Pacman dication. All reaction products were fully characterized and all results are supported by computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive Structural Analysis of the Bitter Components in Beer by the HPLC&#8208;assisted Crystalline Sponge Method</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trans&#8208;iso&#8208;&#945;&#8208;acid is one of the main contributors to the bitter taste of fresh beer and is known to transform into various derivatives during beer aging. Structural characterization of the derivatives has however been a challenging task because of the formation of too many components. Here, we report that most of the transformation products of trans&#8208;iso&#8208;&#945;&#8208;acid, isolated in this study in only small quantities by HPLC, can be structurally analyzed with the crystalline sponge method. Thirteen compounds, including eight that were previously unreported, have been successfully isolated and analyzed with complete assignment of their absolute configuration. This provides an improved understanding of the chemical transformations that occur during beer aging.</dc:description>

         <title>Unfused Nonfullerene Acceptors based on Simple Dipolar Merocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Merocyanine (MC) dyes exhibit facile synthesis and attractive optical properties, making them widely studied as the donor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, for the first time, simple indole&#8208;based MCs are successfully designed as unfused nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) for OSCs by forming dimers with A&#8208;D&#8208;&amp;pi;&#8208;D&#8208;A structure, which possess enhanced photostability compared to well&#8208;known ITIC acceptor and high electron mobility in blend films. When blended with P3HT donor, one of dimers, i. e. &lt;bold&gt;Z2&lt;/bold&gt;, shows a good cell efficiency of 3.53%, which outperforms the performance of most of P3HT/NFA blends, particularly for unfused systems, and thus indicates good potential of simple MCs as NFAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into proton dynamics in photofunctional salt&#8211;cocrystal continuum: Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray, neutron diffraction, and Hirshfeld atom refinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and theoretical calculations were used to investigate the relationship between optical properties and the degree of protonation in acid&#8208;base complexes. We prepared five acid&#8208;base complexes using pyridine&#8208;modified pyrrolopyrrole derivative and salicylic acid. Two of the prepared acid&#8208;base complexes were polymorphs of guest&#8208;free crystals with green emission, while the other three were guest inclusion crystals with yellow emission containing CH  2  Cl  2  , CH  2  Br  2  , or C  2  H  4  Cl  2  . The presence or absence of guests caused emission color to change, altering the hydrogen bond strength between the acid&#8208;base complexes. The accurate N&#183;&#183;&#183;H distances between the pyridyl moiety and the carboxy group in the temperature range of 123 K to 273 K were 1.40 &#197; for the guest&#8208;free crystals and 1.25 &#197; for the guest inclusion crystals. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between photofunction and proton dynamics in acid&#8208;base complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of NH3&#8208;TPD Profiles for CuSSZ&#8208;13 SCR Catalyst of Controlled Al Distribution &#8211; Complexity Resolved by First Principles Thermodynamics of NH3 Desorption, IR and EPR Insight into Cu Speciation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NH3  temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (NH3&#8208;TPD)&#160;is frequently used for probing the nature of the active sites in CuSSZ&#8208;13 zeolite for selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx. Herein, we propose interpretation of NH3&#8208;TPD results, which takes into account the temperature&#8208;induced dynamics of NH3  interaction with the active centers. It is based on a comprehensive DFT/GGA+D and first principles thermodynamic (FPT) modeling of NH3  adsorption on single Cu2+, Cu+, [CuOH]+  centers, dimeric [Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Cu]2+, [Cu&#8211;O22&#8211;&#8211;Cu]2+  species, segregated CuO nanocrystals and Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS). Theoretical TPD profiles are compared with the experimental data measured for samples of various Si/Al ratio and distribution of Al within the zeolite framework. Cu&#160;reduction, its relocation, followed by intrazeolite olation processes, which are concomitant with NH3  desorption, were revealed by EPR and IR. DFT/FPT results show that the peaks in the desorption profiles cannot be assigned univocally to the particular Cu and BAS centers, since the observed low&#8208;, medium&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature desorption bands have contributions coming from several species, which dynamically change their speciation and redox states during NH3&#8208;TPD experiment. Thus, the rigorous interpretation of the NH3&#8208;TPD profiles of CuSSZ&#8208;13 in terms of the strength and concentration of the active centers of a particular type is problematic. Nonetheless, useful connections for molecular interpretation of TPD profiles can be established between the individual component peaks and the corresponding ensembles of the adsorption centers.</dc:description>

         <title>PTFE/EP reinforced MOF/SiO2 composite as a superior mechanically robust superhydrophobic agent towards corrosion protection, self&#8208;cleaning and anti&#8208;icing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic resin cross&#8208;linking ZIF&#8208;67/SiO2  superhydrophobic (SHPB) multilayer coating was successfully fabricated on metal substrate. The perfluoro&#8208;octyl&#8208;triethoxy silane (POTS) modified ZIF&#8208;67 and SiO2  coating was applied on primary coated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and epoxy resin (EP) via spray coating method. Here, we present that the robust superhydrophobicity can be realized by structuring surfaces at two different length scales, with a nanostructure design to provide water repellency and a microstructure design to provide durability. The as&#8208;fabricated multilayer coating displayed superior water&#8208;repellency (CA=167.4&#176;), chemical robustness (pH=1&#8208;14) and mechanical durability undergoing 120th linear abrasion or 35th rotatory abrasion cycle. By applying different acidic and basic corrosive media and various weathering conditions, it can still maintain superior&#8208;hydrophobicity. To get a better insight of interaction between inhibitor molecules and metal surface, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed, showing lower energy gap and increased binding energy of ZPS/SiO2/PTFE/EP (ZPS=ZIF&#8208;67+POTS) multilayer coating compared to the ZIF/SiO2/PTFE/EP, thereby supporting the experimental findings. Additionally, such coatings may be useful for applications such as anti&#8208;corrosion, self&#8208;cleaning, and anti&#8208;icing multi&#8208;functionalities.</dc:description>

The as-fabricated multilayer coating displayed superior water-repellency (CA=167.4&#176;), chemical robustness (pH=1-14) and mechanical durability undergoing 120th linear abrasion or 35th rotatory abrasion cycle. By applying different acidic and basic corrosive media and various weathering conditions, it can still maintain superior-hydrophobicity. To get a better insight of interaction between inhibitor molecules and metal surface, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed, showing lower energy gap and increased binding energy of ZPS/SiO2/PTFE/EP (ZPS=ZIF-67+POTS) multilayer coating compared to the ZIF/SiO2/PTFE/EP, thereby supporting the experimental findings. Additionally, such coatings may be useful for applications such as anti-corrosion, self-cleaning, and anti-icing multi-functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Modelling and Simulations of Light Harvesting Decanuclear Ru&#8208;based Dendrimers for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of a decanuclear photo&#8208; and redox&#8208;active dendrimer based on Ru(II) polypyridine subunits, suitable as a light&#8208;harvesting multicomponent species for artificial photosynthesis, has been investigated by means of computer modelling. The compound has the general formula [Ru{(&#956;&#8208;dpp)Ru[(&#956;&#8208;dpp)Ru(bpy)  2  ]  2  }  3  ](PF  6  )  20  (  Ru10  ; bpy =2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine; dpp= 2,3&#8208;bis(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazine). The stability of possible isomers of each monomer was investigated by performing classical molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum mechanics (QM) simulations on each monomer and comparing the results. The number of stable isomers is reduced to 36 with a prevalence of MER isomerism in the central core, as previously observed by NMR experiments. The simulations on decanuclear dendrimers suggest that the stability of the dendrimer is not linked to the stability of the individual monomers composing the dendrimer but rather governed by the steric constrains originated by the multimetallic assembly. Finally, the self&#8208;aggregation of  Ru10  and the distribution of the counterions around the complexes is investigated using Molecular Dynamics both in implicit and explicit acetonitrile solution. In representative examples, with nine and four dendrimers, the calculated pair distribution function for the ruthenium centers suggests a self&#8208;aggregation mechanism where the dendrimers are approaching in small blocks and then aggregate all together. Scanning transmission electron microscopy complements the investigation, supporting the formation of different aggregates at various concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Water on the 2&#8208;Propanol Oxidation Activity of Co&#8208;Substituted LaFe1&#8722;CoxO3 Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of water addition on 2&#8208;propanol oxidation was studied on LaFe1&#8208;xCoxO3 catalysts. After surpassing a Co content threshold (x=0.15) the effect of water on the activity at elevated temperatures is beneficial due to slower Co3+ reduction and the number of hydroxide species on the catalyst surface increased.







Abstract
Perovskites are interesting oxidation catalysts due to their chemical flexibility enabling the tuning of several properties. In this work, we synthesized LaFe1&#8722;xCoxO3 catalysts by co&#8208;precipitation and thermal decomposition, characterized them thoroughly and studied their 2&#8208;propanol oxidation activity under dry and wet conditions to bridge the knowledge gap between gas and liquid phase reactions. Transient tests showed a highly active, unstable low&#8208;temperature (LT) reaction channel in conversion profiles and a stable, less&#8208;active high&#8208;temperature (HT) channel. Cobalt incorporation had a positive effect on the activity. The effect of water was negative on the LT channel, whereas the HT channel activity was boosted for x&gt;0.15. The boost may originate from a slower deactivation rate of the Co3+ sites under wet conditions and a higher amount of hydroxide species on the surface comparing wet to dry feeds. Water addition resulted in a slower deactivation for Co&#8208;rich catalysts and higher activity in the HT channel state.

         <title>Activation of Molecular O2 on CoFe2O4 (001) Surfaces: An Embedded Cluster Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation pathways for dioxygen on the (001) surfaces of inverse spinel CoFe2O4 were investigated using the periodic electrostatic embedded cluster model. Reduction of molecular O2 into superoxide is relatively facile, whereas the subsequent dissociation into reactive monoatomic species is associated with large energy barriers that may limit the rate of oxidation processes. Of the metal&#8208;O species, [FeIII&#8722;O]2+ is thermodynamically most stable.







Abstract
Dioxygen activation pathways on the (001) surfaces of cobalt ferrite, CoFe2O4, were investigated computationally using density functional theory and the hybrid Perdew&#8208;Burke&#8208;Ernzerhof exchange&#8208;correlation functional (PBE0) within the periodic electrostatic embedded cluster model. We considered two terminations: the A&#8208;layer exposing Fe2+ and Co2+ metal sites in tetrahedral and octahedral positions, respectively, and the B&#8208;layer exposing octahedrally coordinated Co3+. On the A&#8208;layer, molecular oxygen is chemisorbed as a superoxide on the Fe monocenter or bridging a Fe&#8722;Co cation pair, whereas on the B&#8208;layer it is adsorbed at the most stable anionic vacancy. Activation is promoted by transfer of electrons provided by the d metal centers onto the adsorbed oxygen. The subsequent dissociation of dioxygen into monoatomic species and surface reoxidation have been identified as the most critical steps that may limit the rate of the oxidation processes. Of the reactive metal&#8208;O species, [FeIII&#8722;O]2+ is thermodynamically most stable, while the oxygen of the Co&#8722;O species may easily migrate across the A&#8208;layer with barriers smaller than the associative desorption.

         <title>Rh(I)/(III)&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes: Effect of Steric Confinement Upon Immobilization on Regio&#8208; and Stereoselectivity in the Hydrosilylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Rh(III) pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and Rh(I) complexes containing chelating N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes have been prepared and used in the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;alkynes. Selected catalysts were immobilized within the mesopores of SBA&#8208;15. The confinement effects either provided by the ligands or the mesoporous support have been studied and allow for hydrosilylation with &#946;(Z)&#8208;selectivity of up to 100&#8201;% with both Rh(I) and Rh(III) complexes.







Abstract
Rh(I) NHC and Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene=pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;ylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Py&#8722;Im), thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;ylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are presented. Selected catalysts were selectively immobilized inside the mesopores of SBA&#8208;15 with average pore diameters of 5.0 and 6.2&#8197;nm. Together with their homogenous progenitors, the immobilized catalysts were used in the hydrosilylation of terminal alkynes. For aromatic alkynes, both the neutral and cationic Rh(I) complexes showed excellent reactivity with exclusive formation of the &#946;(E)&#8208;isomer. For aliphatic alkynes, however, selectivity of the Rh(I) complexes was low. By contrast, the neutral and cationic Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes proved to be highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalysts, allowing for the formation of the thermodynamically less stable &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;vinylsilane isomers at room temperature. Notably, the SBA&#8208;15 immobilized Rh(I) catalysts, in which the pore walls provide an additional confinement, showed excellent &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;selectivity in the hydrosilylation of aliphatic alkynes, too. Also, in the case of 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene, selective formation of the &#946;(Z)&#8208;isomer was observed with a neutral SBA&#8208;15 supported Rh(III) Cp* NHC complex but not with its homogenous counterpart. These are the first examples of high &#946;(Z)&#8208;selectivity in the hydrosilylation of alkynes by confinement generated upon immobilization inside mesoporous silica.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Novel Rh(III)&lt;/b&gt; pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and Rh(I) complexes containing chelating N-heterocyclic carbenes have been prepared and used in the hydrosilylation of 1-alkynes. Selected catalysts were immobilized within the mesopores of SBA-15. The confinement effects either provided by the ligands or the mesoporous support have been studied and allow for hydrosilylation with &#946;(&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-selectivity of up to 100&#8201;% with both Rh(I) and Rh(III) complexes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rh(I) NHC and Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, NHC=N-heterocyclic carbene=pyrid-2-ylimidazol-2-ylidene (Py&#8722;Im), thiophen-2-ylimidazol-2-ylidene) are presented. Selected catalysts were selectively immobilized inside the mesopores of SBA-15 with average pore diameters of 5.0 and 6.2&#8197;nm. Together with their homogenous progenitors, the immobilized catalysts were used in the hydrosilylation of terminal alkynes. For aromatic alkynes, both the neutral and cationic Rh(I) complexes showed excellent reactivity with exclusive formation of the &#946;(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-isomer. For aliphatic alkynes, however, selectivity of the Rh(I) complexes was low. By contrast, the neutral and cationic Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes proved to be highly regio- and stereoselective catalysts, allowing for the formation of the thermodynamically less stable &#946;-(&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-vinylsilane isomers at room temperature. Notably, the SBA-15 immobilized Rh(I) catalysts, in which the pore walls provide an additional confinement, showed excellent &#946;-(&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-selectivity in the hydrosilylation of aliphatic alkynes, too. Also, in the case of 4-aminophenylacetylene, selective formation of the &#946;(&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-isomer was observed with a neutral SBA-15 supported Rh(III) Cp* NHC complex but not with its homogenous counterpart. These are the first examples of high &#946;(&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-selectivity in the hydrosilylation of alkynes by confinement generated upon immobilization inside mesoporous silica.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Methane Activation by (MoO3)5O&#8722; Cluster Anions: The Importance of Orbital Orientation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;H activation of CH4 by the bridging oxygen radical (Ob.&#8722;) over molybdenum oxide cluster anions has been experimentally identified under thermal collision conditions. The empty 2p orbital of Ob.&#8722; is perpendicular to the surface of (MoO3)5O&#8722; cluster that is superior to the (MoO3)6O&#8722; cluster that contains a Ob.&#8722; radical with the empty 2p orbital being parallel to the cluster surface.







Abstract
The reactivity of the molybdenum oxide cluster anion (MoO3)5O&#8722;, bearing an unpaired electron at a bridging oxygen atom (Ob.&#8722;), towards methane under thermal collision conditions has been studied by mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculations. This reaction follows the mechanism of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and is facilitated by the Ob.&#8722; radical center. The reactivity of (MoO3)5O&#8722; can be traced back to the appropriate orientation of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) that is essentially the 2p orbital of the Ob.&#8722; atom. This study not only makes up the blank of thermal methane activation by the Ob.&#8722; radical on negatively charged clusters but also yields new insights into methane activation by the atomic oxygen radical anions.

         <title>Putting Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions at Work for Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence and development of the concept of &#8220;anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis&#8221;, that employing an electron&#8208;deficient &#960; surface for anionic intermediate and transition state stabilization, is illustrated. Different activation modes are presented to highlight the essential contribution of anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, from both ground&#8208;state and transition&#8208;state stabilization to solely transition&#8208;state stabilization, and to cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation.







Abstract
Since its discovery two decades ago, anion&#8208;&#960; interaction has been increasingly recognized as an important driving force. Extensive theoretical and experimental efforts on the ground&#8208;state anion&#8208;&#960; binding and recognition have laid the bases for exploring its relevance in catalysis. Accordingly, the concept of &#8220;anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis&#8221; that employing an electron&#8208;deficient &#960; surface (&#960;&#8208;acidic surface) for anionic reaction intermediate and transition state stabilization has emerged. This article shortly reviews the emergence and development of this concept, aiming to provide an emphasis on the general concept and key progress in this exciting area. To highlight the essential contribution of anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, the contents are organized according to their role engaged in catalytic process, for example from both ground&#8208;state and transition&#8208;state stabilization to solely transition&#8208;state stabilization, mainly by a single &#960;&#8208;face, and to cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation. A concluding remark and outlook on future development of this field is also given.

         <title>Formation of Stable NiIII N&#8208;Confused Porphyrins Aided by a 3&#8208;Ethoxy Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, structures and reactivities of two stable NiIII N&#8208;confused porphyrin complexes 4 and 5 are reported. They were synthesized by oxidation of a NiII intermediate 3 and characterized by MS, UV&#8208;vis and EPR spectroscopy. The structures of 4 and 5 were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The effects of the 3&#8208;ethoxy substitute and the reactivities of 4 and 5 were investigated.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterization, and reactivities of two stable NiIII N&#8208;confused porphyrin (NCP) complexes. Metalation of 3&#8208;OEt NCP 1 with NiCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O in CHCl3/EtOH gave 3&#8208;OEt NiII NCP 3 initially, which was easily oxidized in air to form the NiIII complex of NCP inner C&#8208;oxide 4. Bis&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;modified NiIII complex 5 was synthesized by oxidation of 3 with PIFA in ethanol and CHCl3. The structures of 4 and 5 were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. An unusually long NiIII&#8722;C bond (2.170(9) &#197;) was observed in 4. The g&#8208;factor (g&gt;2.1) observed in the EPR spectra of 4 and 5 further confirmed that they are paramagnetic NiIII complexes. Comparative experiments showed that the 3&#8208;ethoxy group plays an important role in the formation of 4 and 5. Reduction of 4 and 5 with NaBH4 regenerated complex 3.

Masked amino systems: The design of a molecular entity for the auto&#8208;immolative release of fluorophores and its application for the synthesis of two turn&#8208;on fluorophore probes both responding to physiological conditions of H2S is reported (see scheme).







Abstract
Masked trimethyl lock (TML) systems as molecular moieties enabling the bioresponsive release of compounds or dyes in a controlled temporal and spatial manner have been widely applied for the development of drug conjugates, prodrugs or molecular imaging tools. Herein, we report the development of a novel amino trimethyl lock (H2N&#8208;TML) system as an auto&#8208;immolative molecular entity for the release of fluorophores. We designed Cou&#8208;TML&#8208;N3 and MURh&#8208;TML&#8208;N3, two azide&#8208;masked turn&#8208;on fluorophores. The latter was demonstrated to selectively release fluorescent MURh in the presence of physiological concentrations of the redox&#8208;signaling molecule H2S in&#8197;vitro and was successfully applied to image H2S in human cells

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masked trimethyl lock (TML) systems as molecular moieties enabling the bioresponsive release of compounds or dyes in a controlled temporal and spatial manner have been widely applied for the development of drug conjugates, prodrugs or molecular imaging tools. Herein, we report the development of a novel amino trimethyl lock (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-TML) system as an auto-immolative molecular entity for the release of fluorophores. We designed &lt;b&gt;Cou-TML-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;MURh-TML-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, two azide-masked turn-on fluorophores. The latter was demonstrated to selectively release fluorescent MURh in the presence of physiological concentrations of the redox-signaling molecule H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in&#8197;vitro and was successfully applied to image H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in human cells&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative C&#8722;H Silylation of Alkynylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multitasking silanes: Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sp C&#8722;H silylation by a dehydrogenative coupling between silylacetylenes and hydrosilanes is reported. As a result, a variety of complex organosilicon derivatives was obtained. An inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize catalyst can be used due to the dual role of phenylsilane as substrate and activator.







Abstract
Herein, we report that a cobalt catalyst permits the general synthesis of substituted alkynylsilanes through dehydrogenative coupling of alkynylsilanes and hydrosilanes. Several silylated alkynes, including di&#8208; and trisubstituted ones, were prepared in a one&#8208;step procedure. Thirty&#8208;seven compounds were synthesized for the first time by applying our catalyst system. The alkynylsilanes bearing hydrosilyl moieties provide an opportunity for further functionalization (e.&#8201;g., hydrosilylation). The use of primary silanes as substrates and precatalyst activators permits the use of inexpensive and easily accessible 3d metal precatalysts, and avoids the presence of additional activators.

Methanobenzo[7]annulenes. Parts&#8208;per&#8208;million catalyst loading for [3+2]&#8208;annulations. An unprecedented, ppm&#8208;level, catalytic asymmetric [3+2]&#8208;annulation of 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;lawsones with nitroethylenes is reported. It is an efficient, sustainable, catalytic asymmetric annulation reaction for the synthesis of chiral methanobenzo[7]annulenes, which are part of many antibiotics.







Abstract
3&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;lawsones selectively reacted with &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;nitroethylenes under 500 parts&#8208;per&#8208;million (ppm) quinine&#8208;NH&#8208;thiourea&#8208;catalysis to furnish the chiral methanobenzo[7]annulenes in up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee with &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and TON up to 1820 through tandem Michael/Henry [3+2]&#8208;annulations. These asymmetric ppm&#8208;level, catalytic tandem [3+2]&#8208;annulations would be highly inspirational for the design of many more ppm&#8208;level organocatalytic reactions, and at the same time these final molecules are basic skeletons of antibiotics.

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;Aqueous Neptunium(III) Halide Solvates from NpO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neptunium's fundamental chemistry is understudied when compared to the rest of the periodic table and early actinides like uranium and thorium. Therefore, synthesis of starting materials is of utmost importance for investigation of its chemical properties. NpO2 was dissolved in HCl and converted to two novel neptunium(III) solvated halides, NpI3(THF)4 and NpBr3(THF)4. The reported syntheses are convenient and do not require neptunium metal.







Abstract
Two Np(III) halides, NpI3(THF)4 and NpBr3(THF)4, have been prepared and isolated in high yields as described in this work. Starting with neptunia (NpO2), NpCl4(DME)2 was first generated in an updated, higher yielding synthesis than what was previously reported by using HCl/HF. This material was then reduced with KC8, followed by subsequent ligand exchange, to generate NpBr3(THF)4 and NpI3&#8208;(THF)4. Full characterization by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, 1H NMR spectroscopy and electronic absorption spectroscopy confirmed the molecular formulas and oxidation states. These trivalent materials are straightforward to synthesize and can be used as starting materials for non&#8208;aqueous Np(III) chemistry, obviating the need for rare and restricted Np metal and elemental halogens.

Effect of halide substituents on spin and phase transitions in Mn(III) complexes







Abstract
Three tetraphenylborates of mononuclear Mn(III) cation complexes with hexadentate ligands, the products of the reaction between a N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;aminopropyl)ethylenediamine and salicylaldehydes with the different haloid substitutions at the 5 or 3,5 positions, have been synthesized: [Mn(5&#8208;F&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh4 (1), [Mn(3,5&#8208;diCl&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh4 (2) and [Mn(3,5&#8208;Br,Cl&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh4 (3). Their crystal structure, dielectric constant (&#1013;) and magnetic properties have been studied. Ligand substituents have a dramatic effect on the structure and magnetic properties of the complexes. With decreasing temperature, the complex (1) shows a gradual spin crossover from the high&#8208;spin state (HS) to the HS:LS intermediate phase, followed by an abrupt transition to the low&#8208;spin state (LS) without changing the crystal symmetry. The complexes 2 and 3 are isostructural, but have fundamentally different properties. Complex 2 demonstrates two structural phase transitions related to sharp spin crossovers from the HS to the HS:LS intermediate phase at 137&#8197;K and from the intermediate phase to the LS at 87&#8197;K, while complex 3 exhibits only one spin transition from the HS to the HS:LS intermediate phase at 83&#8197;K.

         <title>Ring Size Determines the Conformation, Global Aromaticity and Photophysical Properties of Macrocyclic Oligofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles, there is a trade&#8208;off between the global and local expression of effects such as aromaticity, with the outcome of the trade&#8208;off determined by the geometry and aromaticity of the constituent units. Compared with other aromatic rings, furan aromaticity is relatively low, and therefore global effects in macrocyclic furans are expected to be more pronounced. Following our introduction of macrocyclic oligofuran, we present the first synthesis of a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bifuran macrocycles of various ring sizes, from trimer to hexamer, and characterize them using both computational and experimental methods. The properties of macrocyclic oligofurans change considerably with size: The smaller trimer is rigid, non&#8208;emissive and planar as revealed by its single crystal structure, and displays global antiaromaticity, while the larger pentamer and hexamer are flexible, emissive, have non&#8208;planar structures, and exhibit local aromaticity. The results are supported by NICS and ACID calculations that indicate the global antiaromaticity of planar furan macrocycles, and by transient absorption measurements showing sharp absorption bands for the trimer and only the internal conversion decay pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;emitting Electrochemical Cells Employing Electron Injection/Transport Layers of Ionic Transition Metal Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, perovskites have attracted intense attention due to their high potential in optoelectronic applications. Employing perovskites as the emissive materials of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) shows the advantages of simple fabrication process, low&#8208;voltage operation, compatibility with inert electrodes, along with saturated electroluminescence (EL) emission. Different from previously reported perovskite LECs, in which salts are incorporated in the emissive layer, we separate the ion&#8208;transport layer from the emissive layer in this work. The layer of ionic transition metal complex (iTMC) not only provides mobile ions but also serves as an electron injection/transport layer. Orthogonal solvents are used in spin coating to prevent intermixing of stacked perovskite and iTMC layers. The blue iTMC with high ionization potential is effective in blocking holes from the emissive layer and thus ensures EL color saturation. In addition, the carrier balance of the perovskite/iTMC LECs can be optimized by adjusting the iTMC layer thickness. The optimized external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the CsPbBr3/iTMC LEC reach 6.8%, which is among the highest reported values for perovskite LECs so far. Compared with mixing all components in a single emissive layer, this work successfully demonstrates that separating the layer of ion transport, electron injection and transport from the perovskite emissive layer is more effective in adjusting device carrier balance. As such, solution&#8208;processable perovskite/iTMC LECs open up a new way to realize efficient perovskite LECs.</dc:description>

         <title>Catechol Moiety Integrated Tri&#8208;aryl Type AIEgen for Visual and Quantitative Boronic Acid Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel functional AIEgen based on three compact bound aryl skeletons is designed and synthesized. This tri&#8208;aryl type luminogen (TA&#8208;Catechol) embedded with catechol moiety responds rapidly to series of boronic acids. Real&#8208;time visual and quantitative dual&#8208;mode detection method is established for the first time with modest precision and low detection limit (8.0 &#956;M). Detailed mechanistic discussion identifies tetra&#8208;coordinated boronic species as the key intermediate within sensing procedure. Wide range of organic boronic acids compatible with this strategy is displayed which is promising in high throughput screening technology. Furthermore, solid&#8208;state sensing capability of TA&#8208;Catechol is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>How 5f electron polarizability drives covalency and selectivity in actinide N&#8208;donor complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a series of isostructural tetravalent actinide (Th, U&#8208;Pu) complexes with the  N  &#8208;donor ligand  N  ,  N  '&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis((pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanimine) (H  2  L, H  2  pyren). Structural data from SC&#8208;XRD analysis reveal [An(pyren)  2  ] complexes with different An&#8211;N  imine  vs. An&#8211;N  pyrrolide  bond lengths, respectively. Quantum chemical calculations elucidate the bonding situation, including differences in covalent character of the coordinative bonds. A comparison to the intensely studied analogous  N  ,  N  &#8242;&#8208; ethylene&#8208; bis(salicylideneimine) (H  2  salen) based complexes [An(salen)  2  ] displays on average almost equal electron sharing of pyren or salen with the An(IV), pointing to a potential ligand&#8208;cage&#8208;driven complex stabilization. This is shown in the fixed ligand arrangement of pyren and salen in the respective An(IV) complexes. The overall bond strength of the pure  N  &#8208;donor ligand pyren to An(IV) (An=Th, U, Np, Pu) is slightly weaker compared

to salen, with the exception of the Pa(IV) complex, which exhibits extraordinarily high electron sharing of pyren with Pa(IV). Such an altered ligand preference within the early An(IV) series points to a specificity of the 5  f  1  configuration, which can be explained by polarization effects of the 5  f  electrons, allowing strongest  f  electron backbonding from Pa(IV) (5  f  1  ) to the  N  &#8208;donors of pyren.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the reactivity of substrate for SNAP&#8208;tag expands its application for recognition&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;protein conjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recognition&#8208;driven modification has been emerging as a novel approach to modify biomolecular targets of interest site&#8208;specifically and efficiently. To this end, the protein modular adaptors (MAs) are the ideal reaction model for recognition&#8208;driven modification of DNA, which constitute both a sequence&#8208;specific DNA&#8208;binding domain (DBD) and a self&#8208;ligating protein&#8208;tag. Coupling the DNA recognition by DBD and the chemoselective reaction of protein tag could provide a highly efficient sequence&#8208;specific reaction. However, combination of MA consisting of a reactive protein&#8208;tag and its substrate,  e.g.,  SNAP&#8208;tag and benzyl guanine (BG), revealed rather non&#8208;selective reaction with DNA. Here, we designed new substrates of SNAP&#8208;tag to realize the sequence&#8208;selective rapid closslinking reaction by MAs with SNAP&#8208;tag. The reactions of substrates to SNAP&#8208;tag were verified by kinetic analyses to enable the sequence&#8208;selective crosslinking reaction of MA. The new substrate enables distinctive orthogonality of SNAP&#8208;tag against CLIP&#8208;tag to achieve the orthogonal DNA&#8208;protein cross&#8208;linking reaction by six unique MAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulky PNP ligands blocking metal&#8208;ligand cooperation allow for isolation of Ru(0), and lead to catalytically active Ru complexes in acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized two 4Me&#8208;PNP ligands which block metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) with the Ru center and compared their Ru complex chemistry to their two traditional analogues used in acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation catalysis. The corresponding 4Me&#8208;PNP complexes, which do not undergo dearomatization upon addition of base, allowed us to obtain rare, albeit unstable, 16 electron mono CO Ru(0) complexes. Reactivity with CO and H  2  allows for stabilization and extensive characterization of bis CO Ru(0) 18 electron and Ru(II) cis and trans dihydride species that were also shown to be capable of C(sp2)&#8208;H activation. Reactivity and catalysis are contrasted to non&#8208;methylated Ru(II) species, showing that an MLC pathway is not necessary, with dramatic differences in outcomes during catalysis between  i  Pr and  t  Bu PNP complexes within each of the 4Me and non&#8208;methylated backbone PNP series being observed. Unusual intermediates are characterized in one of the new and one of the traditional complexes, and a common catalysis deactivation pathway was identified.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexibility control of two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers by crystal morphology: Water adsorption and thermal expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layer flexibility in two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (2D&#8208;CPs) contributes to several functional materials as results in anisotropic structural response to external stimuli. Chemical modification is a common technique for modifying layer structures. Herein, we demonstrate that crystal morphology of a cyanide&#8208;bridged 2D&#8208;CP of type [Mn(salen)]  2  [ReN(CN)  4  ] (  1  ) consisting of flexible undulating layers significantly impacts the layer configuration and assembly. Nanoplates of  1  showed an in&#8208;plane contraction of layers with a longer interlayer distance compared to the micrometer&#8208;sized rod&#8208;type particles. These effects by crystal morphology on the structure of the 2D&#8208;CP impacted the structural flexibility, resulting in dual&#8208;functional changes: the enhancement of the sensitivity of structural transformation to water adsorption and modification of anisotropic thermal expansion of  1  . Moreover, the nanoplates incorporated new adsorption sites within the layers, resulting in the uptake of an additional water molecule compared to the micrometer&#8208;sized rods.</dc:description>

N&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide was used as a protecting group and a reagent to selective synthesis of various mono&#8208;N&#8208;substituted hydrazines and hydrazides. In all these reactions, the protecting reagent N&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide was easily regenerated in good yields by the hydrazinolysis. All these transformations showed good functional&#8208;group tolerance and can be used for large scale C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
A new route to synthesis of various mono&#8208;N&#8208;substituted hydrazines and hydrazides by involving in a new C&#8722;N bond formation by using N&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide as a regenerated precursor was invented. Aniline and phenylhydrazines are reproduced upon reacting these individually with 1,8&#8208;naphthalic anhydride followed by hydrazinolysis. The practicality and simplicity of this C&#8722;N dihalo alkanes; developed a synthon for bond formation protocol was exemplified to various hydrazines and hydrazides. N&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide is suitable synthon for transformation for selective formation of mono&#8208;substituted hydrazine and hydrazide derivatives. Those are selective mono&#8208;amidation of hydrazine with acid halides; mono&#8208;N&#8208;substituted hydrazones from aldehydes; synthesis of N&#8208;aminoazacycloalkanes from acetohydrazide scaffold and inserted to hydroxy derivatives; distinct synthesis of N,N&#8208;dibenzylhydrazines and N&#8208;benzylhydrazines from benzyl halides; synthesis of N&#8208;amino&#8208;amino acids from &#945;&#8208;halo esters. Ecofriendly reagent N&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide was regenerated with good yields by the hydrazinolysis in all procedures.

         <title>Expedient Access to Cyanated N&#8208;Heterocycles by Direct Flow&#8208;Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and scalable C(sp2)&#8722;H electrocyanation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles is reported. The protocol employs nBu4NCN as cyanide source and is performed in an undivided cell making it amenable to both batch and flow set&#8208;ups. A total of 44 examples were synthesized in batch and 14 in flow, including privileged drug&#8208;like heterocycles, such as pyrroles, imidazoles, (aza)indoles, and indazoles. The method displays high functional&#8208;group tolerance and, for the first time, allows to directly cyanate unprotected N&#8722;H indoles.







Abstract
Nitriles are recurring motifs in bioactive molecules and versatile functional groups in synthetic chemistry. Despite recent progress, direct introduction of a nitrile moiety in heteroarenes remains challenging. Recent developments in electrochemical reactions pave the way to more practical cyanation protocols. However, currently available methods typically require hazardous cyanide sources, expensive mediators, and often suffer from narrow substrate scope and laborious reaction set&#8208;up. To address the limitations of current synthetic methods, herein, an effective, sustainable, and scalable procedure for the direct C(sp2)&#8722;H cyanation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles with a user&#8208;friendly flow&#8208;electrochemical set&#8208;up is reported. Furthermore, high substrate and functional&#8208;group tolerance is demonstrated, allowing late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug&#8208;like scaffolds, such as natural products and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>4&#8208;Phosphoryl Pyrazolones for Highly Selective Lithium Separation from Alkali Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolone as new type of selective lithium receptors were synthesized. The bi&#8208; and trinuclear lithium complexes relying on co&#8208;ligands (TBPO, TBP and TOPO) are reported for the first time. The unexpected aggregation conversion (from tri&#8208; to binuclear) in different TOPO equiv. was monitored by 31P, 1H and 7Li NMR. High extraction power and selectivity for Li+ at pH &#8764;8.2 show promising application in Li+ recognition and separation.







Abstract
Effective receptors for the separation of Li+ from a mixture with other alkali metal ions under mild conditions remains an important challenge that could benefit from new approaches. In this study, it is demonstrated that the 4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolones, HL2&#8208;HL4, in the presence of the typical industrial organophosphorus co&#8208;ligands tributylphosphine oxide (TBPO), tributylphosphate (TBP) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), are able to selectively recognise and extract lithium ions from aqueous solution. Structural investigations in solution as well as in the solid state reveal the existence of a series of multinuclear Li+ complexes that include dimers (TBPO, TBP) as well as rarely observed trimers (TOPO) and represent the first clear evidence for the synergistic role of the co&#8208;ligands in the extraction process. Our findings are supported by detailed NMR, MS and extraction studies. Liquid&#8208;liquid extraction in the presence of TOPO revealed an unprecedented high Li+ extraction efficiency (78&#8201;%) for HL4 compared to the use of the industrially employed acylpyrazolone HL1 (15&#8201;%) and benzoyl&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroacetone (52&#8201;%) extractants. In addition, a high selectivity for Li+ over Na+, K+ and Cs+ under mild conditions (pH &#8764;8.2) confirms that HL2&#8208;HL4 represent a new class of ligands that are very effective extractants for use in lithium separation.

&lt;p&gt;Effective receptors for the separation of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from a mixture with other alkali metal ions under mild conditions remains an important challenge that could benefit from new approaches. In this study, it is demonstrated that the 4-phosphoryl pyrazolones, H&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-H&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, in the presence of the typical industrial organophosphorus co-ligands tributylphosphine oxide (TBPO), tributylphosphate (TBP) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), are able to selectively recognise and extract lithium ions from aqueous solution. Structural investigations in solution as well as in the solid state reveal the existence of a series of multinuclear Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes that include dimers (TBPO, TBP) as well as rarely observed trimers (TOPO) and represent the first clear evidence for the synergistic role of the co-ligands in the extraction process. Our findings are supported by detailed NMR, MS and extraction studies. Liquid-liquid extraction in the presence of TOPO revealed an unprecedented high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; extraction efficiency (78&#8201;%) for H&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; compared to the use of the industrially employed acylpyrazolone H&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (15&#8201;%) and benzoyl-1,1,1-trifluoroacetone (52&#8201;%) extractants. In addition, a high selectivity for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; over Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; under mild conditions (pH &#8764;8.2) confirms that H&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-H&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; represent a new class of ligands that are very effective extractants for use in lithium separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports the synthesis and study of new pH&#8208;sensitive DB24C8&#8208;based [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles that contain within their axle the following four potential sites of interaction for the DB24C8: ammonium, amine, Weinreb amide and ketone. At the protonated state, the DB24C8 lied around the best ammonium site. After either deprotonation or deprotonation&#8208;then&#8208;carbamoylation of the ammonium, different localizations of the DB24C8 were noticed, depending on both the number and nature of the secondary stations and steric restriction. Unexpectedly, the results indicated that Weinreb amide was not a proper secondary molecular station for the DB24C8. Nevertheless, via its methoxy side&#8208;chain, it slowed down the shuttling of the macrocycle along the threaded axle, therefore partitioning the [2]rotaxane into two translational isomers on the NMR time scale. Regarding the ketone, it was successfully utilized as a secondary molecular station and its weak affinity for the DB24C8 was similar to that of a secondary amine.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Control of Perylene Supramolecular Polymers through Imide Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers design principles to control the structure of perylene diimide (PDI) supramolecular polymers (SMPs) by modifying their imide substituents. How specific designs have been adapted and expanded is discussed, and various strategies to create future PDI motifs for highly controlled, tailored SMPs are highlighted. A focus is put on thermodynamic and kinetic control over 1) morphology, 2) H&#8208; or J&#8208;aggregation, and 3) mechanisms of growth.







Abstract
The number and type of new supramolecular polymer (SMP) systems have increased rapidly in recent years. Some of the key challenges faced for these novel systems include gaining full control over the mode of self&#8208;assembly, the creation of novel architectures and exploring functionality. Here, we provide a critical overview of approaches related to perylene&#8208;based SMPs and discuss progress to exert control over these potentially important SMPs through chemical modification of the imide substituents. Imide substitutions affect self&#8208;assembly behaviour orthogonally to the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of the perylene core, making for a valuable approach to tune SMP properties. Several recent approaches are therefore highlighted, with a focus on controlling 1) morphology, 2) H&#8208; or J&#8208; aggregation, and 3) mechanism of growth and degree of aggregation using thermodynamic and kinetic control. Areas of potential future exploration and application of these functional SMPs are also explored.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Ferroelastic Domain and Phase Transition in a Three&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ observation of ferroelastic domain processing by the thermal and stress in hybrid molecular crystal and the compound shows four dielectric phase transitions caused by the order&#8208;disorder transformation of the (MedabcoF)2+ cations and the Rb8(BF4)124&#8208; framework.







Abstract
Massive efforts have been devoted to designing molecular ferroic materials by molecular modification. For molecular ferroelastic, previous work is focused on the temperature&#8208;dependent ferroelastic domains, however, few are related to controlling the ferroelastic domain by the stress. Inspired by the &#8220;quasi&#8208;spherical theory&#8221; and fluorination effect, we designed a more flexible (MedabcoF)2+ (MedabcoF=1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) cation by introducing a methyl group and a fluorine atom at the two symmetrical ends of the Dabco (1,4&#8208;diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) and synthesized a hybrid 3D perovskite (MedabcoF)Rb(BF4)3 (1) which displays three reversible phase transitions accompanying dual ferroelastic behavior. Besides, it not only exhibits ferroelastic domains switching by the thermal stimulation, and the sensitive reaction of in situ domains under the stress of it is also realized. This work not only achieves a force&#8208;controlled ferroelastic domain but develops a more profound comprehension of the relationship between the thermal motion behavior of guest cations and the intriguing properties of materials.

         <title>Reactivity of the Bicyclic Amido&#8208;Substituted Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with FLP&#8208;Type Character</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amido&#8208;substituted bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound 2 Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with FLP&#8208;type character forms adducts with the carbene NHC
 and with AlBr3. The NHC adduct (3) further coordinates to BH3. Compound 2 displays a very weak Lewis acidic and a strong Lewis basic site. This is confirmed by reaction with Brookharts acid to yield 7. With diphenylacetylene at 111&#8201;&#176;C, formal fragmentation into a silylene and a trisilacyclopropenylidene occurs. Both are trapped with the alkyne to afford 8 and 9.







Abstract
The bicyclic amido&#8208;substituted silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 2 (Mes=Mesityl=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) features enhanced zwitterionic character and different reactivity from the analogous compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Dipp}4 1 (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) due to the smaller mesityl substituents. In a reaction with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene NHC
 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), we observe adduct formation to give Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NHC
 (3). This adduct reacts further with the Lewis acid BH3 to yield the Lewis acid&#8211;base complex Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NHC
&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 (4). Coordination of AlBr3 to 2 leads to the adduct 5. Calculated proton affinities and fluoride ion affinities reveal highly Lewis basic and very weak Lewis acidic character of the low&#8208;valent silicon atoms in 1 and 2. This is confirmed by protonation of 1 and 2 with Brookharts acid yielding 6 and 7. Reaction with diphenylacetylene only occurs at 111&#8201;&#176;C with 2 in toluene and is accompanied by fragmentation of 2 to afford the silacyclopropene 8 and the trisilanorbornadiene species 9.

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective C7 Functionalisation of Indolines and Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective synthesis of C7&#8208;indolino&#8208; and C7&#8208;indolo&#8208;biaryl atropisomers by means of C&#8722;H functionalisation catalysed by our chiral rhodium complex (RhJasCp) is reported. The reaction works for a wide range of substrates and gives excellent yields (up to 92&#8201;%) and very good level of enantioselectivity (up to 90&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, this transformation tolerates a variety of functional groups in both indoles and indolines.







Abstract
Axially chiral atropisomeric compounds are widely applied in asymmetric catalysis and medicinal chemistry. In particular, axially chiral indole&#8208; and indoline&#8208;based frameworks have been recognised as important heterobiaryl classes because they are the core units of bioactive natural alkaloids, chiral ligands and bioactive compounds. Among them, the synthesis of C7&#8208;substituted indole biaryls and the analogous indoline derivatives is particularly challenging, and methods for their efficient synthesis are in high demand. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis is considered one of the most efficient methods to construct atropisomers. Here, we report the enantioselective synthesis of C7&#8208;indolino&#8208; and C7&#8208;indolo biaryl atropisomers by means of C&#8722;H functionalisation catalysed by chiral RhJasCp complexes.

         <title>Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxofacyclines: Unique Myxobacterial Polyketides Featuring Varing and Rare Heterocycles[]**
</title>

Discovering the natural route to &#8220;synthetic&#8221; heterocycles: Myxofacyclines are natural products isolated from myxobacteria. Myxofacyclines A&#8211;D display an isoxazole substructure, myxofacyclines E and F contain 4&#8208;pyrimidinole, and myxofacycline G features another rare 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrol&#8208;3&#8208;one moiety. The isoxazole, 4&#8208;pyrimidinole or 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrrol&#8208;3&#8208;one heterocycle in the myxofacyclines and the underlying biosynthesis are rarely described in natural products. Isolation, structure elucidation, mutagenesis of the producer strain and heterologous expression of the identified biosynthetic genes are presented.







Abstract
A metabolome&#8208;guided screening approach in the novel myxobacterium Corallococcus sp. MCy9072 resulted in the isolation of the unprecedented natural product myxofacycline A, which features a rare isoxazole substructure. Identification and genomic investigation of additional producers alongside targeted gene inactivation experiments and heterologous expression of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster in the host Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 confirmed a noncanonical megaenzyme complex as the biosynthetic origin of myxofacycline A. Induced expression of the respective genes led to significantly increased production titers enabling the identification of six further members of the myxofacycline natural product family. Whereas myxofacyclines A&#8211;D display an isoxazole substructure, intriguingly myxofacyclines E and F were found to contain 4&#8208;pyrimidinole, a heterocycle unprecedented in natural products. Lastly, myxofacycline G features another rare 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrol&#8208;3&#8208;one moiety. In addition to a full structure elucidation, we report the underlying biosynthetic machinery and present a rationale for the formation of all myxofacyclines. Unexpectedly, an extraordinary polyketide synthase&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid was found to produce all three types of heterocycle in these natural products.

         <title>Organo&#8208;Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis</title>

Inner catalysis: Hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysis is implanted into polyoxometalates (POMs) through the insertion of urea into the framework. A likely combination of electron&#8208;withdrawing effects and double activation through the metal&#8208;oxo surface enables urea catalysis in POMs. The organopolyoxometalate catalysts can be recycled and reused several times. Modelling of the urea conformation when grafted to the vanadium crown, and NMR are used to investigate this new POM property.







Abstract
Several urea&#8208;inserted organo&#8208;polyoxometalates (POMs) derived from polyoxotungstovanadate [P2V3W15O61]9&#8722; were prepared. The insertion of the carbonyl into the polyoxometallic framework activates the urea toward Hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysis. This was shown on the Friedel&#8208;Crafts arylation of trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene. Modelling shows that the most stable form of the organo&#8208;POMs features a cis&#8208;trans arrangement of the two N&#8722;H bonds, but that the likely catalytically active trans&#8208;trans form is accessible at room temperature. Finally, it is possible that the oxo substituents next to the vanadium atoms may help the approach of the nucleophile via H&#8208;bonding.

         <title>Synthesis of a Negative Photochrome with High Switching Quantum Yields and Capable of Singlet&#8208;Oxygen Production and Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimethyldihydropyrene photochromic unit bearing electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor substituents has been synthetized and investigated by spectroscopy, electrochemistry and theoretical calculations (spin&#8208;flip TD&#8208;DFT). This system can be reversibly isomerized with very good quantum yields to its corresponding cyclophanediene form when irradiated by red light under inert atmosphere and is able to generate two endoperoxide isomers upon illumination under air. These endoperoxides can thermally release singlet oxygen.







Abstract
A dimethyldihydropyrene (DHP) photochromic unit has been functionalized by donor (triphenylamine group) and acceptor (methylpyridinium) substituents. This compound was characterized by NMR, absorption and emission spectroscopies as well as cyclic voltammetry, and its properties were rationalized by theoretical calculations. The incorporation of both electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;withdrawing groups at the photochromic center allows i) an efficient photo&#8208;isomerization of the system when illuminated at low energy (quantum yield: &#934;c&#8208;o=13.3&#8201;% at &#955;ex=660&#8197;nm), ii) the reversible and quantitative formation of two endoperoxyde isomers when illuminated under aerobic conditions at room temperature, and iii) the storage and production of singlet oxygen. The photo&#8208;isomerization mechanism was also investigated by spin&#8208;flip TD&#8208;DFT (SF&#8208;TD&#8208;DFT) calculations.

         <dc:description>
Chemistry with halogens in positive oxidation states, especially the lighter halogens, is challenging due to their high oxidation potential. An ensemble of halogen +I and +III compounds with a comparatively large ligand system was synthesized and characterized with experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical methods. This study is envisioned as an example for the diverse but sometimes overlooked chemistry of group&#8197;17.







Abstract
A systematic study of halogenate(I/III) anions with polyatomic ligands is presented. The bis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy) halogenates(I) [X(OC4F9)2]&#8722;, X=Cl, Br, I, of chlorine, bromine, and iodine are prepared as their tetraethylammonium salts and characterized with IR, Raman, and NMR spectroscopic methods, as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Spectroscopical data are supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Additionally, the bonding situation of the species in question are analyzed and discussed. Furthermore, the oxidation to the corresponding halogenate(III) derivatives was studied. For [Br(OC4F9)2]&#8722;, oxidation with elemental fluorine gave [BrF2(OC4F9)2]&#8722;. Iodide was directly oxidized by ClOC4F9 to the IIII species [I(OC4F9)4]&#8722;, which is a surprisingly inert anion that might be used as a weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the future. For [Cl(OC4F9)2]&#8722;, the decomposition products of the synthetic approaches towards a chlorine(III) system were analyzed.

         <title>A Novel Route for the Easy Production of Thermochromic VO2 Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
M1&#8208;VO2 nanoparticles with better thermochromic properties than commercial ones are fabricated by a simple, dry, fast, clean and safe method, compatible with VO2 doping, consisting of thermal treatments of V nanoparticles by fast heating and (a) keeping 700&#8201;&#176;C for about 10&#8197;minutes and slow cooling (one cycle); or (b) 625&#8201;&#176;C for 5&#8197;minutes and fast cooling (two cycles).







Abstract
In this work, a simple, fast and dry method for the fabrication of a thermochromic product with a high load of VO2(M1) consisting of the controlled heat treatment of pure vanadium nanoparticles in air is presented. After a complete design of experiments, it is concluded that the most direct way to attain the maximum transformation of V into VO2(M1) consists of one cycle with a fast heating ramp of 42&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;s&#8722;1, followed by keeping 700&#8201;&#176;C for 530&#8211;600&#8197;seconds, and a subsequent cooling at 0.05&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;s&#8722;1. Careful examination of these results lead to a second optimum, even more suitable for industrial production (quicker and less energy&#8208;intensive because of its lower temperatures and shorter times), consisting of subjecting V to two consecutive cycles of temperatures and times (625&#8201;&#176;C for 5&#8197;minutes) with similar preheating (42&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;s&#8722;1) but a much faster postcooling (&#8764; 8&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;s&#8722;1). These green reactions only use the power for heating a tube open to atmosphere and a vanadium precursor; without assistance of reactive gases or catalysts, and no special vacuum or pressure requirements. The best products present similar thermochromic properties but higher thermal stability than commercial VO2 particles. These methods can be combined with VO2 doping.

         <title>Rational design and facile synthesis of dual&#8208;state emission fluorophores: Expanding functionality for the sensitive detection of nitroaromatic compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Six novel benzimidazole&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A compounds  4a  &#8208;  4f  were concisely synthesized by attaching different donor/acceptor units to the skeleton of 1,3&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene on its 5&#8208;position through a ethynyl link. Due to the twisted conformation and effective conjugation structure, these dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) molecules show intense and multifarious photoluminescence, and their fluorescence quantum yields in solution and solid state can be up to 96.16% and 69.82%, respectively. Especially, for excellent photostability, obvious solvatofluorochromic and extraordinary wide range of solvent compatibility, DSE molecule  4a  is a multifunctional fluorescent probe for the visual detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) with the limit of detection as low as 10  &#8722;7  M. The quenching mechanism has been proved as the results of photoinduced electron transfer and fluorescence resonance energy transfer processes. Importantly, probe  4a  can sensitively detect NACs not only in real water samples, but also on  4a  &#8208;coated strips and  4a  @PBAT thinfilms.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Titanium Species Stabilized with Aluminum/Boron Hydride Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;valent titanium species were prepared by reaction of [TiCp*X3] (Cp* = &#951;5&#8208;C5Me5; X = Cl, Br, Me) with LiEH  4  (E = Al, B) or BH3(thf), and their structures elucidated by experimental and theoretical methods. The treatment of trihalides [TiCp*X3] with LiAlH4  in ethereal solvents (L) leads to the hydride&#8208;bridged heterometallic complexes [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;H)}2{(&#956;&#8208;H)2AlX(L)}2] (L = thf, X = Cl, Br; L = OEt2, X = Cl). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for those compounds reveal an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a Ti&#8211;Ti bond and can be described as titanium(II) species. The theoretical analyses also show strong interactions between the Ti&#8211;Ti bond and the empty  s  orbitals of the Al atom of the AlH2XL fragments, which behave as &#963;&#8208;accepting (Z&#8208;type) ligands. Analogous reactions of [TiCp*X3] with LiBH4&#160;(2 and 3 equiv) in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature and at 85 &#186;C lead to the titanium(III) compounds [{TiCp*(BH4)(&#956;&#8208;X)}2] (X = Cl, Br) and [{TiCp*(BH4)(&#956;&#8208;BH4)}2], respectively. The treatment of [TiCp*Me3] with 4 and 5 equiv of BH3(thf) produces the diamagnetic [{TiCp*(BH3Me)}2(&#956;&#8208;B2H6)] and paramagnetic [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;B2H6)}2] complexes, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>An Alternative Route to Complex Allenes or Cyclooctatrienes via a Suzuki Cyclocarbopalladation Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 4&#8208; exo &#8208;dig cyclocarbopalladation of vinyl bromides substituted with a triple or double bond, resulted in impressive cascade reactions leading to different compounds under Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling conditions upon a slight modification of the starting material. When the starting compound carries a triple bond, a single cascade occurs providing a structure containing an allene, a tetrasubstituted cyclopropane, and a cyclobutene with complete stereoselectivity. When the related starting material possessing a double bond is reacted under the same conditions in the presence of various vinyl boronic esters or acids, an efficient 8&#960;electrocyclization provides tricyclic systems comprised of a cyclobutene unit, as well as a cyclooctatriene. Five carbons of the latter can be selectively decorated with different substituents depending on the choice of the starting material and the boronic coupling partner.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of electrocatalytic activity by local microstructure: focusing on catalytic active zone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional regulation methods of active sites have been successfully optimized the performance of electrocatalysts, but seem unable to achieve further breakthrough in the catalytic activity. Unlike the conventional viewpoint of focusing on single active site, the concept of local microstructure active zone is more comprehensive and new suits of methods to regulate reaction zone for electrocatalytic reactions are developed accordingly. The local microstructure active zone refers to the zone with high catalytic activity formed by the interaction between active atoms and neighboring coordination atoms as well as the surrounding environment. Instead of the traditional single active atom site, the active zone is more suitable for the actual electrochemical reaction process. According to this concept, the activity of the electrocatalysts can be coordinated by multiple active atoms. This strategy is beneficial to understand the relationship between material, structure and catalysis, which realizes the scientific design and synthesis of high performance electrocatalysts. This review provides the research progress of this strategy in electrocatalytic reactions, with the emphasis on their important applications in oxygen evolution reaction, urea oxidation reaction and carbon dioxide reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Light&#8208;Activatable Phthalocyanine Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high penetration of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light makes it effective for use in selective reactions under light&#8208;shielded conditions, such as in sealed reactors and deep tissues. Here, we report the development of phthalocyanine catalysts directly activated by NIR light to transform small organic molecules. The desired photo&#8208;catalytic properties were achieved in the phthalocyanines by introducing the appropriate peripheral substituents and central metal. These phthalocyanine photocatalysts promote cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;coupling (CDC) reactions under irradiation with 810 nm NIR light. The choice of reaction solvent is important, and a mixture of a reaction&#8208;accelerating (pyridine) and decelerating (methanol) solvent was particularly effective. Moreover, we demonstrate photoreactions under visible&#8208;light&#8208;shielded conditions via the transmission of NIR light. A combined experimental and computational mechanistic analysis revealed that this NIR reaction does not involve a photoredox&#8208;type mechanism via electron transfer, but instead a singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism via energy transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Unique Roles of Metal Coordination and Modulator in the Polymorphism Control of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymorphism control of metal&#8208;organic frameworks is highly desired for elucidating structure&#8208;property relationship, but remains an empirical process and is usually done in a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Herein, we adopt the rarely touched actinide cation Th  4+  and a ditopic linker to construct a series of thorium&#8208;organic frameworks (TOFs) with a range of polymorphs. The extraordinary coordination versatility of Th  4+  cations and clusters, coupled with synthetic modulation, renders five distinct phases, wherein the highest degree of interpenetration (3&#8208;fold) and porosity (75.9%) of TOFs have been achieved. Notably, the O atom on the capping site of the nine&#8208;coordinated Th  4+  cation can function as a bridging unit to interconnect neighboring SBUs, affording topologies undocumented for other tetravalent metal containing MOFs. Furthermore, HCOOH has been demonstrated as a bridging unit of SBUs to further induce structural complexity. The resulting TOFs exhibit considerably different adsorption behaviors toward organic dyes, suggesting that TOFs represent an exceptional and promising platform for structure&#8208;property relationship study.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of [&#8208;2, &#8208;1, 0] charged&#8208;ligand based iridium(III) complexes of [Ir(bph)(bpy)(acac)] (  1  ), [Ir(bph)(2MeO&#8208;bpy)(acac)] (  2  ), [Ir(bph)(2CF  3  &#8208;bpy)(acac)] (  3  ), [Ir(bph)(bpy)(2  t  Bu&#8208;acac)] (  4  ) and [Ir(bph)(bpy)(CF  3  &#8208;acac)] (  5  ), which using biphenyl as dianionic ligand [&#8722;2], acetylacetone (or its derivatives) as monoanionic ligand [&#8722;1], and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (or its derivatives) as neutral ligand [0] were designed and synthesized. The chemical structures were well characterized. All of the ligands have simple chemical structures, thus further making the complexes have excellent thermal stability and are easy to sublimate and purify. Phosphorescent characteristics with short emission lifetime were demonstrated for these emitters. Notably, all of the complexes exhibit remarkable deep red/near infrared emission, which is quite different from the reported [&#8722;1, &#8722;1, &#8722;1] charged&#8208;ligand based iridium(III) complexes. The photophysical properties of these complexes are regularly improved by introducing electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups into [&#8722;1] or [0] charged&#8208;ligand. The related organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibited deep red/near infrared emission with acceptable external quantum efficiency and low turn&#8208;on voltage (&lt; 2.6 V). This work provides a new idea for the construction of new type phosphorescent iridium(III) emitters with different valence states of [&#8722;2, &#8722;1, 0] charged ligands, thus offering new opportunities and challenges for their optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Extra&#8208;Large Pore, Large Pore and Medium Pore Zeolites Using a Small Imidazolium Cation as the Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One common strategy in the search for new zeolites is the use of organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDA). Typically, one seeks to achieve a high specificity in the structure&#8208;directing effect of the OSDA. Here we show, however, that an OSDA lacking strong specificity towards any particular zeolite may provide opportunities for discovery when other synthesis parameters are systematically screened. Thus, 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;  n  &#8208;propylimidazolium has allowed to crystallize the new large/medium pore zeolite HPM&#8208;16 as well as the recently reported extra&#8208;large pore  &#8208;SYT  and the medium/small pore and chiral  STW  . The sophisticated OSDA originally affording  &#8208;SYT  and our new simple OSDA have very little in common, both in terms of size, shape and flexibility, while both may still direct the synthesis of the same zeolite. In fact, molecular simulations show that our OSDA is located in three different positions of the  &#8208;SYT  structure, including the discrete 8MR where the original organic could not fit.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reactivity of white phosphorus and yellow arsenic towards two different nickel nacnac complexes is investigated. The nickel complexes [(L  1  Ni)  2  tol] (  1  , L  1  =  [{N(C  6  H  3  i  Pr  2  &#8208;2,6)C(Me)}  2  CH]  &#8208;  )  and [K  2  ][(L  1  Ni)  2  (   &#956;   ,   &#951;    1:1    &#8208;N  2  )] (  6  ) were reacted with P  4  ,  As  4  and the interpnictogen compound AsP  3  , respectively, yielding the homobimetallic complexes [(L  1  Ni)  2  (  &#956;  ,  &#951;  3:3  &#8208;E  4  )] (E = P (  2a  ), As (  2b  ), AsP  3  (  2c  )), [(L  1  Ni)  2  (  &#951;  3:3  &#8208;E  3  )] (E = P (  3a  ), As (  3b  )) and [K@18&#8208;c&#8208;6(thf)  2  ][(L  1  Ni)  2  (  &#951;  1:1  &#8208;E  4  )] (E = P (  7a  ), As (  7b  )), respectively. Heating of  2  also leads to the formation of  3  .

         <title>H2S Dosimetry by CuO &#8211; Towards Stable Sensors by Unraveling the Underlying Solid&#8208;State Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise detection of the toxic gas H  2  S requires reliable sensitivity and specificity of sensors even at minute concentrations of as low as 10 ppm, the value corresponding to typical exposure limits. CuO can be used for H  2  S dosimetry, based on the formation of conductive CuS and the concomitant significant increase in conductance. In theory, by elevated temperature the reaction is reversed and CuO is formed, ideally enabling repeated and long&#8208;term use of one sensor. Yet, the performance of CuO tends to drop upon cycling. Utilizing defined CuO nanorods we thoroughly elucidated the associated detrimental chemical changes directly on the sensors, by Raman and electron microscopy analysis of each step during sensing (CuO &#8594; CuS) and regeneration (CuS &#8594; CuO) cycles. We find the decrease in the sensing performance is mainly caused by the irreversible formation of CuSO  4  during regeneration. The findings allowed us to develop strategies to reduce CuSO  4  formation and thus to substantially maintain the sensing stability even for repeated cycles. We achieved CuO&#8208;based dosimeters possessing a response time of a few minutes only, even for 10 ppm H  2  S, and prolonged life&#8208;time.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Lithium Ion by Artificial Protective Overlayers for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main limitation of lithium (Li) metal anodes lies in their severe dendrite growth due to nonuniform Li ion flux and sluggish Li&#160;ion&#160;transportation at the anode surface. Fabricating artificial protective overlayer with tunable surficial properties on Li metal is a precise and effective strategy to relieve this problem. In this Concept article, we focus on the basic principles of regulating interfacial Li ion&#160;through artificial protective overlayers and summarize the material preparation as well as structural design of these overlayers. The remaining challenges and promising directions of artificial protective overlayers are then highlighted to provide clues for the practical application of Li metal anodes.</dc:description>

         <title>The appeal of small molecules for practical nonlinear optics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small organic molecules with a&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated system that consists of only a few double or triple bonds can have significantly smaller optical excitation energies when equipped with donor&#8208; and acceptor groups, which raises the quantum limits to the molecular polarizabilities. As a consequence, third&#8208;order nonlinear optical polarizabilities become orders of magnitude larger than those of molecules of similar size without donor&#8208;acceptor substitution. This&#160;&#160;enables strong third&#8208;order nonlinear optical effects (as high as 1000 times those of silica glass) in dense, amorphous monolithic assemblies. These properties, accompanied by the possibility of deposition from the vapor phase and of electric&#8208;field poling at higher temperatures, make the resulting materials competitive towards adding an active nonlinear optical or electro&#8208;optic functionality to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art integrated photonics platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Carrier Protein&#8208;Free Enzymatic Biaryl Coupling in Arylomycin A2 Assembly and Structure of the Cytochrome P450 AryC</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The arylomycin antibiotics are potent inhibitors of bacterial type I signal peptidase. These lipohexapeptides contain a biaryl structural motif reminiscent of glycopeptide antibiotics. We herein describe the functional and structural evaluation of AryC, the cytochrome P450 performing biaryl coupling in biosynthetic arylomycin assembly. Unlike its enzymatic counterparts in glycopeptide biosynthesis, AryC converts free substrates without the requirement of any protein interaction partner, likely enabled by a strongly hydrophobic cavity at the surface of AryC pointing to the substrate tunnel. This activity enables chemo&#8208;enzymatic assembly of arylomycin A2 that combines the advantages of liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis with late&#8208;stage enzymatic cross coupling. The reactivity of AryC is unprecedented in cytochrome P450&#8208;mediated biaryl construction in non&#8208;ribosomal peptides, in which peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)&#8208;tethering so far was shown crucial both in vivo and in vitro.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;catalyzed RNA&#8208;oligomerization from 3&#180;,5&#180;&#8208;cGMP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of ancient informational polymers from nucleotide precursors is the central challenge of life&#8217;s origin on our planet. Among the possible solutions, dry polymerization of 3&#180;,5&#180;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate (3&#180;,5&#180;&#8208;cGMP) has been proposed as a candidate to create oligonucleotides of the length of 15&#8208;20 nucleotides. However, the reported sensitivity of the reaction to the presence of cations raised questions if this chemistry could be relevant in a geological context. The experiments in the current study show that the presence of cations is not restrictive as long as the reaction is conducted in an acidic environment, in contrast to previous reports that suggested optimal conditions at pH 9.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8208;Iodopyrimidine labeling reveals nuclear translocation and nuclease activity for both MIF and MIF2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its homolog MIF2 (also known as D&#8208;dopachrome tautomerase or DDT) play key roles in cell growth and immune responses. MIF and MIF2 expression is dysregulated in cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Accurate and convenient detection of MIF and MIF2 will facilitate research on their roles in cancer and other diseases. Herein, we report the development and application of a 4&#8208;iodopyrimidine based probe  8  for the selective labeling of MIF and MIF2. Probe  8  incorporates a fluorophore that allows  in situ  imaging of these two proteins. This enabled visualization of the translocation of MIF2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon methylnitronitrosoguanidine stimulation of HeLa cells. This observation, combined with literature on nuclease activity for MIF, enabled the identification of nuclease activity for MIF2 on human genomic DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>New type of aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems for anion recognition. Strong anion&#8208;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;anion interactions between halides and aromatic ligands in half&#8208;sandwich compounds</title>

         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich compounds of benzene, cyclopentadienyl, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and indenyl were studied as a new type of aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems for interactions with halide anions. While uncoordinated benzene forms only C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;anion interactions, and hexafluorobenzene forms only anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, aromatic ligands in half&#8208;sandwich compounds can form both types of interactions, since their entire electrostatic potential surface is positive. These aromatic ligands can form stronger anion&#8208;&#960; interactions than organic aromatic molecules, as a consequence of more pronounced dispersion and induction energy components. Moreover, C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;anion interactions of aromatic ligands are stronger than anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, and significantly stronger than C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;anion interactions of benzene. Our study shows that transition metal coordination can make aromatic moieties suitable for strong interactions with anions, and gives insight into the design of new anion receptors.</dc:description>
