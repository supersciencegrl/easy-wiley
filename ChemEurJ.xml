         <title>Stereoretentive N&#8208;Arylation of Amino Acid Esters with Cyclohexanones Utilizing a Continuous&#8208;Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;arylation of chiral amino acid esters with minimal racemization is a challenging transformation because of the sensitivity of the &#945;&#8208;stereocenter. We developed a versatile synthetic method to prepare N&#8208;arylated amino acid esters using cyclohexanones as aryl sources under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. The designed flow system, which consists of a coil reactor and a packed&#8208;bed reactor containing a Pd(OH)2/C catalyst, efficiently afforded the desired N&#8208;arylated amino acids without significant racemization, accompanied by only small amounts of easily removable co&#8208;products (i.e., H2O and alkanes). The efficiency and robustness of this method allowed for the continuous synthesis of the desired product in very high yield and enantiopurity with high space&#8208;time yield (74.1 g L&#8211;1 h&#8211;1) and turnover frequency (5.9 h&#8211;1) for at least 3 days.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;Hierarchical Nanosphere as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;with high reactivity and stability was incorporated into WS  2  &#160;nanosheets  via  &#160;a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method for the first time. The resulted hybrid catalyst has much higher catalytic activity than WS  2  &#160;and Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;alone, and the optimal WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;hybrid catalyst was found by adjusting the feed ratio. We proved that the addition of Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;can enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of WS  2  , and vice versa. At the same time, it was found that the catalytic effect of the hybrid catalyst was the best when the feed ratio was W:Fe=2:1. In other words, we confirmed that there is a synergistic effect between W&#8208; and Fe&#8208;based sulfide hybrid catalysts, and validated that the reason for the improved HER performance is the strong interaction between the two in the middle sulfur. WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;hybrid catalyst leads to enhanced HER activity, which shows&#160;a low overpotential of ~&#160;0.172&#160;V at 10 mA&#160;cm  &#8208;  2  , low&#160;Tafel slope of ~&#160;53.47 mV/decade. This study supplies innovative synthesis of a highly active WS  2  /Fe  0.95  S  1.05  &#160;hybrid catalyst for HER.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Control of Peptide Conformation with Light and Metal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the design of a stimuli&#8208;responsive peptide whose conformation is controlled by wavelength&#8208;specific light and metal coordination. The peptide adopts a defined tertiary structure whose conformation can be modulated between an &#945;&#8208;helical coiled coil and &#946;&#8208;sheet. The peptide is designed with a hydrophobic interface to induce coiled coil formation and is based on a recently described strategy to obtain switchable helix dimers. Here, we endowed the helix dimer with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (HQ) groups to achieve metal coordination and a shift to a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure. We find that the conformational shift only occurs upon introduction of Zn  2+  . The other metal ions (Cu  2+  , Fe  3+  , Co  2+  , Mg  2+  and Ni  2+  ) do not offer switching likely due to non&#8208;specific metal&#8208;peptide coordination. A control peptide lacking the metal&#8208;coordinating residues does not show conformational switching with Zn  2+  supporting the role of this metal in stabilizing the &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation in a defined manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing C2&#8208;Functionalized 1,3&#8208;(Benz)azolesthrough Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The skeletal presence of 1,3&#8208;azoles in a variety of bioactive natural products, pharmacophores, and organic materials demands the derivatization of such heteroarenes regioselectively. Plenty of cross&#8208;coupling as well as cyclocondensation reactions have been performed to build up these skeletons but remained commercially unrealizable. A couple of severe drawbacks are faced by these traditional protocols that require a more straightforward strategy to obviate them. Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H functionalization has emerged as a superior alternative in that context. 1,3&#8208;azoles and their benzo counterparts have been extensively functionalized exploiting both noble and earth&#8208;abundant transition metals. Lately, C&#8208;2 functionalizations have gained much traction due to the ease of attaining high regioselectivity and installation of synthetically manipulative functionalities. This critical review presents a bird's eye view of all major C&#8208;2 functionalizations of (benz)azoles catalyzed by a diverse set of metals performed over the past 15 years.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship for Di&#8208; up to Tetranuclear Macrocyclic Ruthenium Catalysts in Homogeneous Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized two di&#8208; and tetranuclear Ru(bda) (bda: 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;6,6'&#8208;dicarboxylate) macrocyclic complexes and investigated their catalytic activities in chemical and photochemical water oxidation in a comparative manner to our previously reported trinuclear congener. Our studies have shown that the catalytic activities of this homologous series of multinuclear Ru(bda) macrocycles in homogeneous water oxidation are dependent on their size, exhibiting highest efficiencies for the largest tetranuclear catalyst. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) have increased from di&#8208; to tetranuclear macrocycles not only per catalyst molecule but more importantly also per Ru unit with TOF of 6 s&#8208;1 to 8.7 s&#8208;1 and 10.5 s&#8208;1 in chemical and 0.6 s&#8208;1 to 3.3 s&#8208;1 and 5.8 s&#8208;1 in photochemical water oxidation per Ru unit, respectively. Thus, for the first time, a clear structure&#8208;activity relationship could be established for this novel class of macrocyclic water oxidation catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>From BN Naphthalenes to Benzoborole Dianions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of benzoborole polyanions by alkali metal reduction of BN&#8208;naphthalene derivatives via a ring&#8208;contraction strategy has been developed. Reduction of 1&#8208;alkynyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1a in Et2O led to the elimination of alkynyllithium with the formation of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole trilithium salt 2a, whereas reduction of 1&#8208;phenyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1c in THF yielded 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2c with the elimination of ArNHLi. The trilithium and dilithium salts 2a and 2c have been fully characterized. Treatment of trilithium salt 2a with Et3NHCl led to the selective protonation of the amino lithium to afford the dilithium salt 2aH, which could be cleanly oxidized to 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole 3 in excellent yield.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of benzoborole polyanions by alkali metal reduction of BN&#8208;naphthalene derivatives via a ring&#8208;contraction strategy has been developed. Reduction of 1&#8208;alkynyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1a in Et2O led to the elimination of alkynyllithium with the formation of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole trilithium salt 2a, whereas reduction of 1&#8208;phenyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1c in THF yielded 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2c with the elimination of ArNHLi.

         <title>Scalable Production of Ambient Stable Hybrid Bismuth&#8208;based Materials: AACVD of Phenethylammonium Bismuth Iodide Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large homogeneous and adherent coatings of phenethylammonium bismuth iodide were produced using the cost&#8208;effective and scalable aerosol&#8208;assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) methodology. The film morphology was found to depend on the deposition conditions and substrates, resulting in different optical properties to those reported from their spin&#8208;coated counterparts. Optoelectronic characterization revealed band bending effects occurring between the hybrid material and semiconducting substrates (TiO2 and FTO) due to heterojunction formation, and the optical bandgap of the hybrid material was calculated from UV&#8208;visible and PL spectrometry to be 2.05 eV. Maximum values for hydrophobicity and crystallographic preferential orientation were observed for films deposited on FTO/glass substrates, closely followed by values from films deposited on TiO2/glass substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural, Magnetic and Catalytic Properties of a New Vacancy Ordered Perovskite Type Barium Cobaltate BaCoO2.67</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new vacancy ordered, anion deficient perovskite modification with composition of BaCoO  2.67  (Ba  3  Co  3  O  8  &#9633;  1  ) has been prepared via a two&#8208;step heating process. Combined Rietveld analysis of neutron and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data shows a novel ordering of oxygen vacancies not known before for barium cobaltates. A combination of neutron powder diffraction, magnetic measurements and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirms G&#8208;type antiferromagnetic ordering. From impedance measurements, the electronic conductivity of the order of 10  &#8722;4  S cm  &#8722;1  is determined. Remarkably, the bifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is found to be comparable to that of Ba  0.5  Sr  0.5  Co  0.8  Fe  0.2  O  3&#8722;  y  , confirming that charge&#8208;ordered anion deficient non&#8208;cubic perovskites can be highly efficient catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond the Isoprene Pattern: Bifunctional Polyene Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7017-7021, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional polyene cyclizations take advantage of the unique reactivity of higher&#8208;functionalized alkenes in contrast to the common isoprene&#8208;based polyenes. The potential of these systems is highlighted by the synthesis of structurally complex polycycles involving unprecedented cyclization pathways.







Abstract
Polyene cyclizations are capable of producing molecular complexity in a single step. While classical systems are limited to simple alkyl substitution patterns only, bifunctional polyenes take advantage of the unique reactivity of higher&#8208;functionalized alkenes. Here, we highlight the potential of these variants for the synthesis of structurally complex polycycles involving unprecedented termination steps. We also want to provide a stimulus for the development of novel modes of cyclization that involve bifunctional units to enable efficient synthesis of yet inaccessible natural products.

         <title>Directing Polymorphism in the Helical Nanofilament Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7108-7113, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morphogenesis control: the morphogenesis of the helical nanofilament (HNF) liquid&#8208;crystal phase was controlled to give structures that depend on the growth conditions. Two different growth methods were used to investigate the polymorphism of HNFs: nanoconfinement and light&#8208;driven orientation. This is apparently the first report on the polymorphism of an HNF phase formed by single kind of molecules.







Abstract
Herein, it is reported that the polymorphism in the helical nanofilament (HNF, B4) liquid&#8208;crystalline phase depends on the fabrication methods, that is, UV&#8208;driven formation and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly in the nanoconfined geometry. As a result, uniaxially oriented HNFs with different helical structures were obtained, in which generation of the twisted&#8208;ribbon and cylindrical&#8208;ribbon polymorphs showed that even the molecular lattice has a different orientation. The detailed structures were directly observed by SEM and grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation. The resultant polymorphs could be used in chiro&#8208;optical applications due to the capability for fine control of the helical structures.

         <title>A Nickel(II)&#8208;Mediated Thiocarbonylation Strategy for Carbon Isotope Labeling of Aliphatic Carboxamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7114-7123, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The faster the better: Rapid nickel(II)&#8208;mediated thiocarbonylation of alkyl zinc reagents provides an expedient route to activated esters, which can subsequently be exploited for the direct synthesis of aliphatic carboxamides. This process is highly adaptable to carbon isotope labeling, which was illustrated for the synthesis of 13C&#8208;labeled low molecular weight drugs and biopharmaceuticals.







Abstract
A series of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules and biopharmaceuticals bearing aliphatic carboxamides have been successfully labeled with carbon&#8208;13. Key to the success of this novel carbon isotope labeling technique is the observation that 13C&#8208;labeled NiII&#8208;acyl complexes, formed from a 13CO insertion step with NiII&#8208;alkyl intermediates, rapidly react in less than one minute with 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide to quantitatively form the corresponding 2&#8208;pyridyl thioesters. Either the use of 13C&#8208;SilaCOgen or 13C&#8208;COgen allows for the stoichiometric addition of isotopically labeled carbon monoxide. Subsequent one&#8208;pot acylation of a series of structurally diverse amines provides the desired 13C&#8208;labeled carboxamides in good yields. A single electron transfer pathway is proposed between the NiII&#8208;acyl complexes and the disulfide providing a reactive NiIII&#8208;acyl sulfide intermediate, which rapidly undergoes reductive elimination to the desired thioester. By further optimization of the reaction parameters, reaction times down to only 11&#8197;min were identified, opening up the possibility of exploring this chemistry for carbon&#8208;11 isotope labeling. Finally, this isotope labeling strategy could be adapted to the synthesis of 13C&#8208;labeled liraglutide and insulin degludec, representing two antidiabetic drugs.

Gold (I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition: 8&#8208;Aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azafulvenes undergo a regioselective gold catalyzed [8+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;rich allenamines and ynamides to give dihydrocyclohepta[b]pyrrole derivatives. The cyclization takes place after the nucleophilic attack of the heptafulvene to the electrophilic intermediates formed by the coordination of cationic gold to either allene or triple bond moieties of the unsaturated systems.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed higher&#8208;order [8+2] cycloadditions of 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1 with allenamides 2 and ynamides 3 were studied. 1,8&#8208;Dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 4 were achieved by a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition of azaheptafulvenes 1 and allenamides 2 in the presence of (2,4&#8208;ditBuC6H3O)3PAuNTf2 as catalyst. Besides, ynamides 3 and 8&#8208;aryl&#8208;8&#8208;azaheptafulvenes 1, undergo a regioselective [8+2] cycloaddition, to give 2&#8208;amido&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydrocycloheptapyrroles 7 in the presence of JohnPhosAuNTf2 as catalyst. Both reactions take place with good yields and with a variety of substituents. A plausible mechanism hypothesis suggests a nucleophilic attack of the 8&#8208;azaheptafulvene to the gold activated electron rich allene or alkyne moieties of the allenamide and ynamide, respectively.

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and its Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7176-7182, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular [3+2] reaction of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) using a commercially available ligand has been realized for the synthesis of 5/5 and 6/5 bicycles. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts usually used for these reactions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction takes places via oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and the ACP, ring opening of the cyclopropyl group, and reductive elimination.







Abstract
Developing new transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to bicyclo[3.3.0]octadiene and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadiene molecules using a cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts, which are usually the choices for [3+2] reactions with ACPs. The enantiomeric excess in the present reaction can be up to 92&#8201;%. Cationic cobalt(I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.

         <title>Temperature Dependence of 1H Paramagnetic Chemical Shifts in Actinide Complexes, Beyond Bleaney's Theory: The AnVIO22+&#8211;Dipicolinic Acid Complexes (An=Np, Pu) as an Example</title>

NMR spectroscopy: The temperature dependence of paramagnetic 1H NMR chemical shifts are measured and modelled in the AnVIO22+&#8211;dipicolinic acid complexes. Only the pseudocontact term is non&#8208;zero. The magnetic susceptibility tensor, the energy states and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center are deduced and compared to the SO&#8208;CASPT2 values.







Abstract
Actinide +VI complexes (
=
, 
 and 
) with dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, 
 and 
 complexes were described by first principles CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The analysis of the 1H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the Fermi contact contribution is negligible in agreement with spin density determined by unrestricted DFT. The magnetic susceptibility tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217; method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic properties of the 
 complex. The temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 
 contribution, contrarily to Bleaney's theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemical Library Based on Peptide Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7160-7167, April 26, 2021. </description>

A DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library (DEL) based on canonical and non&#8208;canonical peptide macrocycles (YO&#8208;DEL) was generated. The single&#8208;stranded format allowed for selections by affinity capture, through a novel selection method exploiting the competition with an antibody fragment and the annealing to a photoreactive moiety which allowed for selections by a photocrosslinking approach. The YO&#8208;DEL yielded ligands against proteins of pharmaceutical interest such as CAIX, HSA and NKp46, a protein expressed on the surface of activated NK&#8208;cells.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel DNA&#8208;encoded library of macrocyclic peptide derivatives are described; the macrocycles are based on three sets of proteinogenic and non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid building blocks and featuring the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction for ring closure. The library (termed YO&#8208;DEL) which contains 1&#8201;254&#8201;838 compounds, was encoded with DNA in single&#8208;stranded format and was screened against target proteins of interest using affinity capture procedures and photocrosslinking. YO&#8208;DEL selections yielded specific binders against serum albumins, carbonic anhydrases and NKp46, a marker of activated Natural Killer cells.

         <title>Novel Ferrocene&#8208;Appended &#946;&#8208;Ketoimines and Related BF2 Derivatives with Significant Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>

Strong candidates! The synthesis and structural characterization of ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes is reported. A study of their photophysical properties revealed that both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and their BF2 complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response, and thus are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.







Abstract
A series of new &#946;&#8208;ketoimines containing a ferrocene moiety and their BF2 complexes have been synthesized and structurally characterized. The solvatochromism of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines was studied, putting in evidence a redshift with increasing solvent polarity. This positive solvatochromism can be attributed to a more polarized excited state compared with the ground state, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. The &#946;&#8208;ketoimines exhibited weak emission, attributable to the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon. This ESIPT effect is suppressed upon restriction of the keto&#8208;enamine tautomerism, induced upon addition of BF3&#8901;OEt2, which afforded the related BF2 complexes, characterized by an enhancement of the fluorescence through the ICT effect. Both the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and BF2 complexes exhibited significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior in mixtures of CH3CN/H2O, due to restriction of intramolecular rotation in the aggregated state. The frontier molecular orbital levels, ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state dipole moments (&#956;g and &#956;e), and the origin of electronic absorption spectra were studied by time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were determined by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced second&#8208;harmonic generation technique. The &#956;&#946;1907 values of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines increased upon the formation of the related BF2 complexes, mainly due to an enhancement of the ground&#8208;state dipole moment. The results presented here reveal that some of these novel compounds are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7168-7175, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;substituted arenes are found in societally important molecules but are challenging to synthesize. This work reports on a method that uses aryl(Mes)iodonium salts as an aryne precursor via regioselective deprotonation. Various arynophiles are used and result in formation of C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;Cl, and C&#8722;Si bonds; mechanistic insights from experiments and DFT calculations are provided.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products, is described.[1] In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. This work reports a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, it was found that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1)&#8197;ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2)&#8197;regioselective trapping of said arynes, thereby improving previously reported reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal ring substituents on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryl(Mes)iodoniums as aryne precursors.

Low&#8208;density polymorphs obtained in a high&#8208;pressure environment are reported in this work. The single crystals were grown by the kinetic crystallization of the seeds precipitated in high&#8208;entropy conditions, owing to the extreme temperature and pressure in the confined space. This simple and inexpensive method opens a colorful palette of polymorphic forms inaccessible with traditional methods.

         <title>Cover Feature: Directing Polymorphism in the Helical Nanofilament Phase (Chem. Eur. J. 24/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 6996-6996, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymorphism is defined as the formation of more than two kinds of crystal structures from a single compound, which is essential for practical applications such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture. Stimuli&#8208;responsive polymorphism of the helical nanofilament (HNF) is investigated by using light&#8208;driven and nanoconfinement methods. The light&#8208;driven HNFs form the twisted ribbons, while the nanoconfined HNFs show the cylindrical ribbons. The discovery of polymorphism on HNF structures will provide insights for future studies on chirality. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D.&#8197;K. Yoon et&#8197;al. on page 7108.

         <title>Frontispiece: Synthetic Approaches to Triarylboranes from 1885 to 2020</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review article presented by T.&#8197;B. Marder et&#8197;al. on page 7043, summarizes the synthetic developments that have been made in the synthesis of triarylboranes throughout the years from their first appearance in 1885 to the present. It is shown that, over time, developments in other fields of research enriched triarylborane chemistry by developing new organometallic reagents or boron sources, which led to new synthetic strategies and opened the door for diverse applications. Investigation of reactivities and other molecular properties of triarylboranes led to the first commercially available products by the middle of the 20th century. With increasing interest in this field of research, new potential applications of such compounds continue to arise. This review article aims to provide guidance for researchers to find the best synthetic strategy for preparing new compounds containing the triarylborane motif.

         <title>Frontispiece: Chiral Triptycenes: Concepts, Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The journey of chiral triptycenes started in 1962 with their first synthesis. Until 1984 several chiral triptycene derivatives were synthesized and their optical properties studied in relation to the substituted functional groups including the determination of their absolute configurations. Afterwards, a huge gap of almost 30 years remained in the development of chiral triptycenes. Only in 2014, chiral triptycenes caught again the attention of researchers when research based on chiral triptycenes applied to the synthesis of chiral materials was published. This work brought the almost forgotten chiral triptycenes back to the limelight. This Minireview describes the initial history of developments of chiral triptycenes and their comeback to important applications in advanced materials and catalysis after a research gap of almost 30 years. For more information, see the Minireview by T. Wirth et&#8197;al. on page 7059.

In s&#8211;p hybridization, the contraction of C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds as the carbon atom involved varies from sp3 to sp2 to sp is a fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical computations, this work uncovers that these bonds do not contract due to the increasing percentage of s&#8208;character of the hybrid orbital at the pertinent carbon, as is commonly accepted, but, instead, because the steric congestion around this carbon atom decreases as the coordination number goes from 4 to 3 to 2 for sp3 to sp2 to sp, respectively. More information can be found in the Communication by F.&#8197;M. Bickelhaupt et&#8197;al. on page 7074.

         <title>Half&#8208;Integer Spin Triangles: Old Dogs, New Tricks</title>

Triangular tricks: In architecture, relief triangles relieve the stress of the superstructure by distributing it away from the weak points of the underlying wall. In magnetism, spin triangles relieve the stress of competing interactions by distributing local magnetizations to minimize energy. Architectural examples, like the &#8220;Lion gate&#8221; in Mycenae, are extremely ancient, but spin triangles are slowly catching up.







Abstract
Spin triangles, that is, triangular complexes of half&#8208;integer spins, are the oldest molecular nanomagnets (MNMs). Their magnetic properties have been studied long before molecular magnetism was delineated as a research field. This Review presents the history of their study, with references to the parallel development of new experimental investigations and new theoretical ideas used for their interpretation. It then presents an indicative list of spin&#8208;triangle families to illustrate their chemical diversity. Finally, it makes reference to recent developments in terms of theoretical ideas and new phenomena, as well as to the relevance of spin triangles to spintronic devices and new physics.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Triarylboranes from 1885 to 2020</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7043-7058, April 26, 2021. </description>

This review presents a history of the methods used to synthesize triarylboranes, which are an interesting class of electron&#8208;poor compounds with a wide range of useful properties and applications as Lewis acids, frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) catalysts, electron transporters, luminescent chromophores for OLEDs, anion sensors, and bioimaging agents, among others.







Abstract
In recent years, research in the fields of optoelectronics, anion sensors and bioimaging agents have been greatly influenced by novel compounds containing triarylborane motifs. Such compounds possess an empty p&#8208;orbital at boron which results in useful optical and electronic properties. Such a diversity of applications was not expected when the first triarylborane was reported in 1885. Synthetic approaches to triarylboranes underwent various changes over the following century, some of which are still used in the present day, such as the generally applicable routes developed by Krause et&#8197;al. in 1922, or by Grisdale et&#8197;al. in 1972 at Eastman Kodak. Some other developments were not pursued further after their initial reports, such as the synthesis of two triarylboranes bearing three different aromatic groups by Mikhailov et&#8197;al. in 1958. This review summarizes the development of synthetic approaches to triarylboranes from their first report nearly 135 years ago to the present.

From basics to advanced: Chirality in triptycenes due to atropisomerism and stereocenters have been reviewed and the routes to obtain these chiral triptycenes have been highlighted. This Minireview describes the initial history of developments of chiral triptycenes and its comeback to important applications in advanced materials and catalysis after a gap of almost 30 years.







Abstract
Triptycenes have been established as unique scaffolds because of their backbone &#960;&#8208;structure with a propeller&#8208;like shape and saddle&#8208;like cavities. They are some of the key organic molecules that have been extensively studied in polymer chemistry, in supramolecular chemistry and in material science. Triptycenes become chiral molecules when substituents are unsymmetrically attached in at least two of their different aromatic rings. This Minireview highlights the chirality of triptycenes from basics to an advanced stage for the development of functional molecules.

         <title>On the Structural Assignments Underlying R.&#8197;B. Woodward's Most Personal Data That Led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann Rules: Subramania Ranganathan's Key Role and Related Research by E.&#8197;J. Corey and A.&#8197;G. Hortmann</title>

In 1963 and early 1964, R. B. Woodward and his postdoctoral student Subramania Ranganathan discovered a route&#8208;ending glitch in the isoxazole route to vitamin B12. However, they simultaneously discovered two coupled pairs of stereospecific valence isomerizations that became Woodward's 5th mysterious reaction and led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. This Essay discusses the behind&#8208;the&#8208;scenes story of Ranganathan's research and confirms his structure determinations using quantum chemical calculations of 1H&#8197;NMR parameters.







Abstract
In the early 1960s, as part of R. B. Woodward's isoxazole route to vitamin B12, Subramania Ranganathan uncovered two coupled sets of stereospecific reactions, a thermal set and a photochemical set. These four reactions illustrated the alternating configurations that were the major data points that prompted the solution of the no&#8208;mechanism problem. Though Ranganathan's reactions played a major role, according to Woodward, in the development of the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules, they were published only as part of the documentation of a lecture given by Woodward in 1966. The authors of this paper have uncovered Subramania Ranganathan's 1964 postdoctoral report and have used modern quantum chemical theory to predict the 1H&#8197;NMR spectra for Ranganathan's key compounds, providing support for the structure assignments made by Woodward and Ranganathan. A similar set of alternating, stereospecific reactions was observed by E.&#8197;J. Corey and Alfred Hortmann in their 1963 total synthesis of dihydrocostunolide. We also have applied the computational process used for Ranganathan's compounds to Hortmann's compounds, now also including the calculation of coupling constants, and find computational support for Corey and Hortmann's structure assignments.

         <title>High&#8208;pressure Nucleation of Low&#8208;Density Polymorphs**

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7069-7073, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy nucleation and subsequent crystallization performed under high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions lead to kinetic polymorphs of aryl disulfides, characterized by lower symmetry, higher Z&#8217; number and lower density than the ambient&#8208;pressure polymorphs.







Abstract
New polymorphs &#946; and &#947; of bis&#8208;3&#8208;nitrophenyl disulphide, crystallized above 0.3&#8197;GPa, are less dense than the ambient&#8208;pressure polymorph &#945;. This counterintuitive density relation results from the high&#8208;entropy nucleation and subsequent kinetic crystallization. The work performed by pressure compensates the high entropy and temperature product, substantiated in varied conformers and increased chemical potential. Pressure&#8208;increased viscosity promotes the kinetic polymorphs, in accordance with empirical Ostwald's rule of stages. It contrasts to mechanochemical techniques, favouring high&#8208;density polymorphs.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free &#945; Csp3&#8722;H Cyanation of Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7103-7107, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flash chromatography column free and transition metal free cyanation of &#945; C&#8722;H sulfonylamide was developed to access valuable &#945;&#8208;amino cyanation products from a variety of fluorine masked sulfonylamides. Compared with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction has a broad substrate scope and occurs under mild conditions. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron allows for excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
This report describes the site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;functionalization of sulfonylamide derivatives through the in&#8208;situ generation of imine intermediates. The N&#8722;F sulfonylamides, which could facilitate the elimination to generate imines, are coupled with TBACN to efficiently and mildly afford &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides. Comparing with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction is also characterized by broad substrate scope and flash chromatography column free workup. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron pathway to generate imines through manipulation of the leaving group allows us to achieve excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Not Carbon s&#8211;p Hybridization, but Coordination Number Determines C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C Bond Length</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7074-7079, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paradigm shift! Our quantum chemical analyses reveal that, for example, C&#8722;H bonds along ethane, ethylene, and acetylene, do not contract due to the changing s&#8211;p hybridization of the pertinent carbon atom from sp3 to sp2 to sp but, instead, because the steric congestion around this carbon atom decreases as the coordination number goes from 4 to 3 to 2.







Abstract
A fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry is the contraction of both C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds as the carbon atoms involved vary, in s&#8211;p hybridization, along sp3 to sp2 to sp. Our quantum chemical bonding analyses based on Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital theory show that the generally accepted rationale behind this trend is incorrect. Inspection of the molecular orbitals and their corresponding orbital overlaps reveals that the above&#8208;mentioned shortening in C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds is not determined by an increasing amount of s&#8208;character at the carbon atom in these bonds. Instead, we establish that this structural trend is caused by a diminishing steric (Pauli) repulsion between substituents around the pertinent carbon atom, as the coordination number decreases along sp3 to sp2 to sp.

         <title>Double&#8208;Network Heparin Dynamic Hydrogels: Dynagels as Anti&#8208;bacterial 3D Cell Culture Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7080-7084, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent dynagels for heparin encapsulation: Dynamic covalently cross&#8208;linked dynamers with high mechanical strength, biocompatibility and self&#8208;healing behaviors have been used for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Double cross&#8208;linked dynamic hydrogels, dynagels, have been prepared through reversible imine bonds and supramolecular interactions, which showed good pH responsiveness, injectability, self&#8208;healing property and biocompatibility. With the further encapsulation of heparin, the obtained hydrogels exhibited good anti&#8208;bacterial activity and promotion effects for 3D cell culture.

New visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable solvatochromic fluorescent label for light&#8208;up and colour&#8208;change sensing of DNA&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine and its 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphate bearing solvatochromic acetophenyl&#8208;thienyl&#8208;aniline fluorophore was developed using the Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key step. The triphosphate was used for polymerase synthesis of labelled DNA. The labelled nucleotide or DNA exerted weak red fluorescence when excited at 405&#8197;nm, but a significant colour change (to yellow or green) and light&#8208;up (up to 20 times) was observed when the DNA probes interacted with proteins or lipids.

         <title>Synthesis of Desepoxy&#8208;Tedanolide C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 24, Page 7085-7089, April 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of one isomer of the marine natural product tedanolide C was accomplished and provides evidence about the relative configuration of this member of the tedanolide family. The synthesis takes advantage of a variant of the Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. The synthesis was particularly sensitive to the appropriate selection of protecting groups, which made constant protecting group switches necessary. The spectroscopic data of the synthesized isomer support a different configuration than the originally proposed one.







Abstract
The synthesis of desepoxy&#8208;tedanolide C was accomplished and provided experimental evidence on the configuration of tedanolide C. The reported chemical shifts and coupling constants point to a configuration different from the published structure and analogous to the structures of the other members of this family of natural products. The key step is a Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. Furthermore, two additional aldol reactions and a Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination were used to assemble the carbon framework.

         <title>Rhamnogalacturonan II: Chemical Synthesis of a Substructure Including &#945;&#8208;2,3&#8208;Linked Kdo**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis of a Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide was achieved by a [4+1] post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach.







Abstract
The synthesis of a fully deprotected Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide is described. The strategy relies on the preparation of a suitably protected homogalacturonan tetrasaccharide backbone, through a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach, and its stereoselective glycosylation with a Kdo fluoride donor.

&#8220;We found that the high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions can be effectively used for high&#8208;entropy nucleation of kinetic polymorphs! The high&#8208;entropy nucleation can be performed in the confined space of high&#8208;pressure chambers, where strong rota&#8208;vibrations of molecules can be agitated by heating. The molecules in various excited states require an additional space, but increased viscosity hampers the molecular reorientations or conformational changes before the nucleation.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;7069&#8197;ff.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Models for Side Chain Discrimination in Peptide&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bis(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) Tr&#246;ger's base receptor and 4&#8208;substituted hepta&#8208;1,7&#8208;diyl bisammonium salt ligands have been used as a model system to study the interactions between non&#8208;polar side chains of peptides and an aromatic cavity of a protein. NMR titrations and NOESY/ROESY NMR spectroscopy were used to analyze the discrimination of the ligands by the receptor based on the substituent of the ligand, both quantitatively (free binding energies) and qualitatively (conformations). The analysis showed that an all&#8208;anti conformation of the heptane chain was preferred for most of the ligands, both free and when bound to the receptor, and that for all of the receptor&#8208;ligand complexes, the substituent was located inside or partly inside of the aromatic cavity of the receptor. We estimated the free binding energy of a methyl&#8208; and a phenyl group to an aromatic cavity, via CH&#8208;&#960;, and combined aromatic CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions to be &#8722;1.7 and &#8722;3.3 kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively. The experimental results were used to assess the accuracy of different computational methods, including molecular mechanics (MM) and density functional theory (DFT) methods, showing that MM was superior.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Binding Dynamics in High&#8208;Affinity Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Dithienylethene Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of external stimuli to control the binding kinetics in supramolecular systems is of critical importance for the development of advanced molecular machines and devices. In this work we report a study focused on the kinetics of a water&#8208;soluble host&#8208;guest system based on cucurbit[8]uril and two dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches. We show that for the DTE guest comprising two anionic sulfonate side arms appended to pyridinium moieties, the formation/dissociation of the pseudorotaxane structures is slowed down by more than 100000&#8208;fold with respect to its bipyridinium analogue. The decrease in ingression rate leads to the emergence of a competitive metastable product with the open DTE isomer that has an important influence in the overall binding kinetics. We also demonstrate that host&#8208;guest dissociation kinetics is approximately 100&#8208;fold slower for the closed DTE isomer (t  1/2  = 107 hours vs t  1/2  = 1.2 hours for the open isomer) allowing control over the dissociation rate with light.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn3&#8208;xFexO4 Hollow Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of hollow nanostructure and controllable phase of mixed metal oxides for improving performance in supercapacitor applications is highly desirable. Here we demonstrate the rational design and synthesis of Mn  3&#8208;x  Fe  x  O  4  hollow nanostructures for supercapacitor applications. Owing to high porosity and the specific surface area that provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions, the electrochemical performance of Mn  3&#8208;x  Fe  x  O  4  hollow nanostructure substantially enhances comparing with pristine Mn  3  O  4  . Particularly, in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, Mn  0.16  Fe  2.84  O  4  with a typical diameter of 20 nm exhibits excellent specific capacitance of 2675, 2320, 1662, 987 Fg  &#8208;1  at current densities of 1, 2, 5, 10 Ag  &#8208;1  , respectively, which is significantly superior to those of other transition metal oxides. Besides, an asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled by using Mn  0.16  Fe  2.84  O  4  and activated carbon as a positive and a negative electrode, respectively. Electrochemical results indicate a high energy density of 42 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at a power density of 0.75 kW kg  &#8208;1  , which makes this hollow nanostructure a highly promising electrode for achieving high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation supercapacitors.</dc:description>

Electrochemical results indicate a high energy density of 42 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at a power density of 0.75 kW kg  &#8208;1  , which makes this hollow nanostructure a highly promising electrode for achieving high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation supercapacitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accessing Improbable Foldamer Shapes with Strained Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The alkylation of some secondary amide functions with a dimethoxybenzyl (DMB) group in oligomers of 8&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;quinolinecarboxylic acid destabilizes the otherwise favored helical conformations, and allows for cyclization to take place. A cyclic hexamer and a cyclic heptamer were produced in this manner. After DMB removal, X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR show that the macrocycles adopt strained conformations that would be improbable in non&#8208;cyclic species. The high helix folding propensity of the main chain is partly expressed in these conformations, but it remains frustrated by macrocyclization. Despite being homomeric, the macrocycles possess inequivalent monomer units. Experimental and computational studies highlight specific fluxional pathways within these structures. Extensive simulated annealing molecular dynamics allow for the prediction of the conformations for larger macrocycles with up to sixteen monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries: Hydrazide as a Pluripotent Precursor for On&#8208;DNA Synthesis of Various Azole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phylogenic chemical transformation approach to synthesize on&#8208;DNA 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole, 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amine and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives using DNA&#8208;conjugated benzoyl hydrazine as pluripotent precursor are reported here, which shows great potential in facilitating rapid construction of azole&#8208;focused DELs.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded combinatorial chemical library (DEL) technology, an approach that combines the power of genetics and chemistry, has emerged as an invaluable tool in drug discovery. Skeletal diversity plays a fundamental importance in DEL applications, and relies heavily on novel DNA&#8208;compatible chemical reactions. We report herein a phylogenic chemical transformation strategy using DNA&#8208;conjugated benzoyl hydrazine as a common versatile precursor in azole chemical expansion of DELs. DNA&#8208;compatible reactions deriving from the common benzoyl hydrazine precursor showed excellent functional group tolerance with exceptional efficiency in the synthesis of various azoles, including oxadiazoles, thiadiazoles, and triazoles, under mild reaction conditions. The phylogenic chemical transformation strategy provides DELs a facile way to expand into various unique chemical spaces with privileged scaffolds and pharmacophores.

         <title>Crystallization Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: A Strategy to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Small Domain Sizes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lamellar morphologies with ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3&#8197;nm) are achieved by the self&#8208;assembly of giant molecules. The driven force for the phase separation is attributed to the strong tendency and fast kinetics for crystallization of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) segment. Upon the gamma ray radiation followed pyrolysis, ultra&#8208;thin two dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets are obtained due to polymerization of vinyl group in VPOSS.







Abstract
Achieving self&#8208;assembled nanostructures with ultra&#8208;small feature sizes (e.&#8201;g., below 5&#8197;nm) is an important prerequisite for the development of block copolymer lithography. In this work, the preparation and self&#8208;assembly of a series of giant molecules composed of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) tethered with monodispersed oligo(L&#8208;lactide) chains are presented. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results demonstrate that ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3&#8197;nm) of phase separated lamellar morphology are achieved in bulk, driven by the strong tendency and fast kinetics for crystallization of VPOSS moieties. Moreover, upon gamma ray radiation, VPOSS cages in the lamellar structure can be crosslinked via polymerization of the vinyl groups. After pyrolysis at high temperature, ultra&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets can be obtained.

         <title>Affinity selections of DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries on carbonic anhydrase IX&#8208;expressing tumor cells reveal a dependence on ligand valence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries are typically screened against purified protein targets. Recently, cell&#8208;based selections with encoded chemical libraries have been described, commonly revealing suboptimal performance due to insufficient recovery of binding molecules. We used carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;expressing tumor cells as a model system to optimize selection procedures with code&#8208;specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as selection readout. Salt concentration and performing PCR on cell suspension had the biggest impact on selection performance, leading to 15&#8208;fold enrichment factors for high&#8208;affinity monovalent CAIX binders (acetazolamide; K  D  = 8.7 nM). Surprisingly, the homobivalent display of acetazolamide at the extremities of both complementary DNA strands led to a substantial improvement of both ligand recovery and enrichment factors (above 100&#8208;fold). The optimized procedures were used for selections with a DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library comprising 1 million members against tumor cell lines expressing CAIX, leading to a preferential recovery of known and new ligands against this validated tumor&#8208;associated target. This work may facilitate future affinity selections on cells against target proteins which might be difficult to express otherwise.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Formation, Solution Rearrangements, and Catalytic Behavior of a Polymorphic Ca/K Allyl Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical synthesis provides the metastable organocalciate K[CaA&#8217;3] (A&#8217;= 1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C3H3), whose &#8216;first contact&#8217; with solvent determines how fast it rearranges to a more stable form: minutes (in hexanes) to days (in arenes). The latter form of the calciate initiates the polymerization of methyl methacrylate and isoprene under mild conditions.







Abstract
Without solvents present, the often far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium environment in a mechanochemically driven synthesis can generate high&#8208;energy, non&#8208;stoichiometric products not observed from the same ratio of reagents used in solution. Ball milling 2&#8197;equiv. K[A&#8217;] (A&#8217;=[1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C3H3]&#8722;) with CaI2 yields a non&#8208;stoichiometric calciate, K[CaA&#8217;3], which initially forms a structure (1) likely containing a mixture of pi&#8208; and sigma&#8208;bound allyl ligands. Dissolved in arenes, the compound rearranges over the course of several days to a structure (2) with only &#951;3&#8208;bound allyl ligands, and that can be crystallized as a coordination polymer. If dissolved in alkanes, however, the rearrangement of 1 to 2 occurs within minutes. The structures of 1 and 2 have been modeled with DFT calculations, and 2 initiates the anionic polymerization of methyl methacrylate and isoprene; for the latter, under the mildest conditions yet reported for a heavy Group 2 species (one&#8208;atm pressure and room temperature).

         <title>Modulation of Src kinase activity by selective substrate recognition with pseudopeptidic cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective recognition of tyrosine (Tyr) residues in peptides is an appealing approach to inhibit their phosphorylation mediated by tyrosine kinases (TKs). Here we describe pseudopeptidic cages that efficiently protect the substrates from the action of the Src TK enzyme, precluding the corresponding Tyr phosphorylation. The most efficient cage inhibitors strongly bind the peptide substrates as shown by fluorescence emission titrations, with a very good correlation between the binding constants and the inhibitory potency. Structural insights and additional control experiments further support the proposed mechanism by the selective supramolecular protection of the substrates. Moreover, the approach also works in a completely different kinase&#8208;substrate system. These results illustrate the potential of supramolecular complexes for the efficient and selective modulation of TK signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Gold Chemistry: From Simple Salts to Complexes for Regioselective C&#8208;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold coordinated to neutral phosphines (R  3  P),  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) or anionic ligands is catalytically active in functionalizing various C&#8208;H bonds with high selectivity. The sterics/electronic nature of the studied C&#8208;H bond, oxidation state of gold and stereoelectronic capacity of the coordinated auxiliary ligand are some of the associated selectivity factors in gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond functionalization reactions. Hence, in this review a comprehensive update about the action of different types of gold catalysts, from simple to sophisticated ones, on C&#8208;H bond reactions and their regiochemical outcome is disclosed. This review also highlights the catalytic applications of Au(I)&#8208; and Au(III)&#8208;species in creating new opportunities for the regio&#8208; and site&#8208;selective activation of challenging C&#8208;H bonds. Finally, it also intends to stress the potential applications in selective C&#8208;H bond activation associated with a variety of heterocycles recently described in the literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective production of linear aldehydes and alcohols from alkenes using formic acid as syngas surrogate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Performing carbonylation without the use of carbon monoxide for high&#8208;value&#8208;added products is an attractive yet challenging topic in sustainable chemistry. Herein, effective methods for producing linear aldehydes or alcohols selectively with formic acid as both carbon monoxide and hydrogen source have been described. Linear&#8208;selective hydroformylation of alkenes proceeds smoothly with up to 88% yield and &gt; 30 regioselectivity in the presence of single Rh catalyst. Strikingly, introducing Ru into the system, the dual Rh/Ru catalysts accomplish efficient and regioselective hydroxymethylation in one pot. The present processes utilizing formic acid as syngas surrogate operate simply under mild condition, which opens a sustainable way for production of linear aldehydes and alcohols without the need for gas cylinders and autoclaves. As formic acid can be readily produced via CO 2 hydrogenation, the protocols represent indirect approaches for chemical valorization of CO 2 .</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Nitrogen Retention of Carbon Anode for Enhancing the Electrochemical Performance for Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy has been successfully adopted to retain N atoms in&#8197;situ and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly(acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;itaconic acid) (PANIA). After being carbonised at 700&#8201;&#176;C, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 maintains 90&#8201;% of the original N from PANIA. At the same time, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 also exhibits a good rate performance and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with a specific capacity of 94&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Retaining nitrogen for polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon anode is a cost&#8208;effective way to make full use of the advantages of PAN for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Here, a simple strategy has been successfully adopted to retain N atoms in&#8197;situ and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly (acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;itaconic acid) (PANIA). Among the prepared carbonised fibre (CF) samples, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 maintains the highest N content, retaining 90&#8201;% of the original N from PANIA. It represents the highest capacity storage contribution (80.55&#8201;%) and the lowest impedance Rct (117&#8197;&#937;). Consequently, the specific capacity increases from 60&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 of PANIA&#8208;CF&#8208;700 to 190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 of PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. At the same time, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 exhibits a good rate performance and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with a specific capacity of 94&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Cyano Derivatives of 7&#8208;Aminoquinoline that are Highly Emissive in Water: Potential for Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
6&#8208;Cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline was synthesized and found to be non&#8208;emissive in water, while the amino derivative 6CN&#8722;7AQ exhibits intense emission, making the azido/amino pair excellent in sensing H2S. Moreover, conjugation of 6CN&#8722;7AQ with peptide renders a nearly non&#8208;emissive composite that can be digested by proteinase&#8208;K, recovering intense 6CN&#8722;7AQ emission with &#8764;200&#8208;fold enhancement.







Abstract
6&#8208;Cyano&#8208;7&#8208;aminoquinoline (6CN&#8722;7AQ) and 3&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;aminoquinoline (3CN&#8722;7AQ) were synthesized and found to exhibit intense emission with quantum yield as high as 63&#8201;% and 85&#8201;%, respectively, in water. Conversely, their derivatives 6&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline (6CN&#8722;7N3Q) and 3&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline (3CN&#8722;7N3Q) show virtually no emission, which makes them suitable to be used as recognition agents in azide reactions based on fluorescence recovery. Moreover, conjugation of 6CN&#8722;7AQ with a hydrophobic biomembrane&#8208;penetration peptide PFVYLI renders a nearly non&#8208;emissive 6CN&#8722;7AQ&#8208;PFVYLI composite, which can be digested by proteinase K, recovering the highly emissive 6CN&#8722;7AQ with &#8764;200&#8208;fold enhancement. The result provides an effective early confirmation for RT&#8208;qPCR in viral detection.

         <title>CO2 Capture by Hydroxylated Azine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties as a function of their textural and chemical features. Experimental and theoretical data indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold. For the best performing COF, a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures were investigated, showing excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) RIO&#8208;13, RIO&#8208;12, RIO&#8208;11, and RIO&#8208;11m were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties by thermogravimetric analysis at 1&#8197;atm and 40&#8201;&#176;C. These microporous COFs bear in common the azine backbone composed of hydroxy&#8208;benzene moieties but differ in the relative number of hydroxyl groups present in each material. Thus, their sorption capacities were studied as a function of their textural and chemical properties. Their maximum CO2 uptake values showed a strong correlation with an increasing specific surface area, but that property alone could not fully explain the CO2 uptake data. Hence, the specific CO2 uptake, combined with DFT calculations, indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold, as the hydroxyl groups were indeed identified as relevant adsorption sites in all the studied COFs. Additionally, the best performing COF was thoroughly investigated, experimentally and theoretically, for its CO2 capture properties in a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures, and showed excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Ion&#8208;Pair Cryptand Host Discrimination of Potassium Halide Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding (ChB) and halogen bonding (XB) ion&#8208;pair heteroditopic cryptands exhibit cooperative recognition of potassium halide salts. Incorporation of bidentate triazole&#8208;based ChB or XB donor motifs into a dibenzo&#8208;30&#8208;crown&#8208;10&#8208;based macrobicyclic receptor framework is demonstrated to profoundly influence selectivity and affinity behaviour towards the recognition of KBr and KI ion&#8208;pairs relative to hydrogen bonding analogues.







Abstract
A series of chalcogen, halogen and hydrogen bonding heteroditopic macrobicyclic cryptands are reported and their potassium halide ion&#8208;pair recognition properties investigated. Saliently, the co&#8208;bound potassium cation was determined to be crucial in switching on the bromide and iodide recognition properties of the respective cryptand receptor. Importantly, the nature of the sigma&#8208;hole mediated interaction employed in the anion recognition component is demonstrated to significantly augment the ion&#8208;pair binding behaviour, markedly so for the halogen bonding analogue. Most notably the incorporation of a chelating chalcogen bonding donor motif significantly improves the selectivity towards KBr over KI, relative to halogen and hydrogen bonding analogues.

         <title>The Versatile Electronic, Magnetic and Photo&#8208;electro Catalytic Activity of a New 2D MA2Z4 Family</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent successful growth of MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 monolayer led to the discovery of a new class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MA2Z4 materials with no known 3D layered allotropes, which renders great possibilities to integrate diverse properties by proper design of sandwiched &#8220;MZ2&#8221; building blocks and &#8220;A&#8208;Z&#8221; passivation layers. In this work, we theoretically probe the dynamic stability, electronic properties, and surface reactivity of the new MA2Z4 family, in which M is Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, A refers to Si or Ge, and Z is N, P or As. Among the proposed 54 possible combinations, about 42 compositions are dynamically stable, which vary from non&#8208;magnetic, anti&#8208;ferromagnetic, to ferromagnetic semiconductors, metals and half&#8208;metal. In particular, the VB (V, Nb, Ta) MA2Z4 possesses robust intrinsic ferromagnetism that is essential for spintronics applications. In regards to surface activity, most of MA2Z4, particularly for N or P terminated IVB and VB MA2Z4, have high catalytic potential for hydrogen evolution, and the &#8710;GH of non&#8208;magnetic MA2Z4 is highly correlated to the highest occupied p electronic states of surface Z atom. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity is also evaluated, MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 within 4% tensile strain are capable of photocatalytic overall water splitting. Our findings indicate the new 2D MA2Z4 family has fascinating properties and possesses strong potential for applications but not limited to electronics, spintronics and catalysts, which will stimulate the interests of experimental synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>First total synthesis of phytoprostanes with prostaglandin&#8208;like&#160;configuration, evidence for their formation in edible vegetable oils and orienting study of their biological activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phytoprostanes (PhytoP) are natural products, which form in plants under oxidative stress conditions from &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid. However, their epimers with relative prostaglandin configuration termed phytoglandins (PhytoG) have never been detected in Nature, likely because of the lack of synthetic reference material. Here, the first asymmetric total synthesis of such compounds, namely of PhytoGF  1  a  &#160;(9&#8208;  epi  &#8208;16&#8208;F  1t  &#8208;PhytoP) and its diastereomer&#160;  ent  &#8208;16&#8208;  epi  &#8208; PhytoGF  1  a  &#160;(  ent  &#8208;9,16&#8208;  diepi  &#8208;16&#8208;F  1t  &#8208;PhytoP), has been accomplished. The synthetic strategy is based on radical anion oxidative cyclization, copper(I)&#8208;mediated alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling and enantioselective reduction reactions. A UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS study using the synthesized compounds as standards indicates PhytoG formation at significant levels during autoxidation of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid in edible vegetable oils. Initial testing of synthetic PhytoGs together with F  1  &#8208;PhytoP and 15&#8208;F  2t  &#8208;IsoP derivatives for potential interactions with the PGF  2&#945;  &#160;(FP) receptor did not reveal significant activity. The notion that PUFA&#8208;derived oxidatively formed cyclic metabolites with prostaglandin configuration do not form to a significant extent in biological or food matrices has to be corrected. Strong evidence is provided that oxidatively formed PhytoG metabolites may be ingested with plant&#8208;derived food, which necessitates further investigation of their biological profile.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Heptacene and Its Hole&#8208;Transfer Property of Stable Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heptacene (  1  ) was produced through a monoketone precursor (  2  ), which was prepared starting from 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene through 9 steps in a total yield of 10%. Compound  2  was converted to  1  quantitatively by heating at 202 &#176;C. Heptacene exhibited high thermal stability in the solid state without observable change over two months. To investigate the potential value of  1  as a material for  p  &#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), the top&#8208;contact OFET devices were fabricated by vacuum&#8208;deposition of  1  on a hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)/SiO  2  /Si substrate. The best performance of hole mobility was 2.2 cm  2  V  &#8211;1  s  &#8211;1  . This is the first report that stable heptacene was used in an effective device and examined on its charge carrier property.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Valence Tautomerism using Redox Potentials: Studies on Ferrocene&#8208;Based Triarylmethylium Dyes With Electron&#8208;Poor Fluorenylium and Thioxanthylium Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new electrochromic ferrocenyl triarylmethylium dyes with fluorenylium (  1a  +  ,  1b  +  ) or thioxanthylium (  1c  +  ) residues were selected in order to keep the intrinsic differences of redox potentials for ferrocene oxidation and triarylmethylium reduction small and to trigger valence tautomerism. UV/Vis/NIR and quantitative EPR spectroscopy identified paramagnetic diradical isomers  1a  +&#8226;&#8226;  &#8208;1c  +&#8226;&#8226;  alongside diamagnetic forms  1a  +  &#8208;1c  +  , which renders these complexes magnetochemical switches. The diradical forms  1a  +&#8226;&#8226;  &#8208;1c  +&#8226;&#8226;  as well as the one&#8208;electron reduced triarylmethyl forms of the complexes were found to dimerize in fluid solution. For radical  1a  &#8226;  , dimerization occurs on the timescale of cyclic voltammetry, which allowed us to determine the kinetics and equilibrium constant for this process by digital simulation. M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopy indicated that  1a  +  and  1b  +  retain VT even in the solid state. UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry revealed the polyelectrochromic behaviour of these complexes by establishing distinctly different electronic absorption profiles of the corresponding oxidized and reduced form  s.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>N&#8208;enriched porous carbon/SiO  2  (SiO  2  /NC) composite from rice husks was prepared by ball mill and tested as stable anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), in which the homogeneous dispersion of SiO  2  nanoparticles and carbon matrix, and high level of N&#8208;doping can be realized simultaneously. The N&#8208;doping influence on a series of SiO  2  /NC has been systematically studied, which proves that the porosity, N&#8208;doping content and electronic conductivity of SiO  2  /NC can be controlled by adjusting common nitrogen sources (urea and melamine) and doping routes including dry and wet mill to reach a desirable balance of high capacity, long&#8208;term cyclability and rate property. The optimized SiO  2  /NC composite delivers stably reversible capacity of 581 mA h g  &#8208;1  at high current load of 1.0 A g  &#8208;1  at 1000  th  . The novel Li&#8208;storage mechanism of active silica in composite has been firstly proposed upon N&#8208;doping effect that redox reaction between SiO  2  and Li  +  is accelerated to transform into alloying reaction of Si generated and Li  +  , enhancing reversible capacity. Besides, kinetics analysis confirms that there is combined Li&#8208;storage mechanism of battery&#8208;capacitive pattern in composite, which contributes to fast charge transfer and ion diffusion during cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>STED imaging the dynamic of lysosomes by dually fluorogenic Si&#8208;rhodamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Super&#8208;resolution microscopy (SRM) imaging of the finite subcellular structures and subtle bioactivities inside organelles delivers abundant cellular information with high fidelity to unravel the intricate biological processes. An ideal fluorescent probe with precise control of fluorescence is critical in SRM technique like stimulated emission depletion (STED). Si&#8208;rhodamine was decorated with both targeting group and H  +  &#8208;receptor, affording the dually fluorogenic Si&#8208;rhodamine in which the NIR fluorescence was efficiently controlled by the coalescent of spirolactone&#8208;zwitterion equilibrium and PeT mechanism. The dually fluorogenic characters of the probe offer a perfect mutual enhancement in sensitivity, specificity and spatial resolution. Strong fluorescence only released in the existence of targeting protein at acidic lysosomal pH, ensured precisely tracking the dynamic of lysosomal structure and pH in living cells by STED.</dc:description>

         <title>A Smart Access to the Dinitramide Anion &#8211; The Use of Dinitraminic Acid for the Preparation of Energetic Coordination Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinitraminic acid (HN(NO  2  )  2  , HDN) was prepared by ion exchange chromatography and acid&#8208;base reaction with basic copper(II) carbonate allowed the  in situ  preparation of copper(II) dinitramide, which was reacted with twelve nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands e.g. 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;5  H  &#8208;tetrazole, di(5  H  &#8208;tetrazolyl)&#8208;methane/&#8208;ethane/&#8208;propane/&#8208;butane. Nine of the complexes were investigated by low temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, all compounds were investigated by infrared spectroscopy (IR), differential thermal analysis (DTA), elemental analysis (EA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for selected compounds. Furthermore, investigations of the materials were carried out regarding their sensitivity toward impact (IS), friction (FS), ball drop impact (BDIS) and electrostatic discharge (ESD). In addition, hot plate and hot needle tests were performed. Complex [Cu(AMT)  4  (H  2  O)](DN)  2  , based on 1&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;methyltetrazole (AMT), is most outstanding for its detonative behavior and thus also capable of detonating PETN in classical initiation experiments. Laser ignition experiments at a wavelength of 915&#160;nm were performed for all substances and solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;Vis spectra were recorded for apprehending the ignition mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed Cu2Se Hexagonal Nanosheets@Co3Se4 Nanospheres for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational designing and constructing multiphase hybrid electrode materials is an effective method to compensate for the performance defects of the single component. Based on this strategy, Cu  2  Se hexagonal nanosheets@Co  3  Se  4  nanospheres mixed structures have been fabricated by a facile two&#8208;step hydrothermal method. Under the synergistic effect of the high ionic conductivity of Cu  2  Se and the remarkable cycling stability of Co  3  Se  4  , Cu  2  Se@Co  3  Se  4  can exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance as a novel electrode material. The as&#8208;prepared Cu  2  Se@Co  3  Se  4  electrode displays high specific capacitance of 1005 F g  &#8208;1  at 1 A g  &#8208;1  with enhanced rate capability (56% capacitance retention at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ), and ultralong lifespan (94.2% after 10000 cycles at 20 A g  &#8208;1  ). An asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled applying the Cu  2  Se@Co  3  Se  4  as anode and graphene as cathode, which delivers a wide work potential window of 1.6 V, high energy density (30.9 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at 0.74 kW kg  &#8208;1  ), high power density (21.0 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at 7.50 kW kg  &#8208;1  ), and excellent cycling stability (85.8% after 10000 cycles at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence quenching in iminophosphonamide copper and zinc complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of copper and zinc complexes of four variably substituted iminophosphonamide ligands is presented. While the copper complexes form ligand bridged dimers, the zinc compounds are monomeric. Due to different steric demand of the ligand the arrangement of the ligands within the dimeric complexes varies. Similar to the structurally related iminophosphonamide complexes of alkali metals and calcium, the steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (PL) of four of the seven compounds studied here as solids in a temperature range of 5&#160;&#8211;&#160;295 K can be described within the scheme of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Accordingly, they exhibit bright blue&#8208;green phosphorescence at low temperatures (&lt;100 K), which turns into delayed fluorescence by increasing the temperature. However, unusually, the fluorescence is practically absent in two copper complexes which otherwise still conform to the TADF scheme. In these cases, the excited singlet states decay essentially non&#8208;radiatively and their thermal population from the corresponding low&#8208;lying triplet states efficiently quenches PL (phosphorescence). Three other copper and zinc complexes only exhibit prompt fluorescence, evidencing a wide variation of photophysical properties in this class of compounds. The excited states of the copper complex with especially pronounced phosphorescence quenching were also investigated by low&#8208;temperature time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene: synthesis, characterization and application in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A soluble and green&#8208;blue fluorescent &#960;&#8208;extended azatrioxa[8]circulene was synthesized by oxidative condensation of a 3,6&#8208;dihydroxycarbazole and 1,4&#8208;anthraquinone utilizing benzofuran scaffolding. This is the first circulene to incorporate anthracene within it carbon framework. Solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence and bright green electroluminescence accompanied by excimer emission are key optical properties of this material. The presence of sliding &#960;&#8208;stacked columns in the single crystal of dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene is found to cause a very high rate for the electron hopping making this material a promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an electron mobility predicted around 2.26 cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  . The best OLED device based on the dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene fluorescent emitter has a brightness around 16 000 Cd m  &#8208;2  and external quantum efficiency of 3.3%. By using dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene as a host matrix material the quantum dots based OLEDs were fabricated.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification and Prediction of Imine Formation Kinetics in Aqueous Solution by Microfluidic NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantitatively predicting the reactivity of dynamic covalent reaction is essential to understand and rationally design complex structures and reaction networks. In this work, we quantified the reactivity of aldehydes and amines in various rapid imine formation in aqueous solution by microfluidic NMR. Investigation of reaction kinetics allows us to quantify the forward rate constants  k  +  by an empirical equation, of which three independent parameters were introduced as reactivity parameters of aldehydes (  S  E  ,  E  ) and amines (  N  ). Furthermore, these reactivity parameters were successfully used to predict the unknown forward rate constants of imine formation. Finally, two competitive reaction networks were rationally designed based on the proposed reactivity parameters. Our work has demonstrated the capability of microfluidic NMR in quantifying the kinetics of label&#8208;free chemical reactions, especially rapid reactions that complete in minutes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nazarov&#8208;Ene Tandem Reaction for the Stereoselective Construction of Spiro Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The different reactivity of trienones under Lewis and Br   &#248;   nsted acids catalysis was investigated, resulting in distinct cyclization products and carbon backbones that originated either from a conjugate Prins cyclization or an interrupted Nazarov cyclization. In particular, an unprecedented Nazarov cyclization tandem reaction is presented, terminating the oxyallyl cation by an ene&#8208;type reaction, and leading stereoselectively to bicyclic spiro compounds. The terminal olefin of this motif represents a useful handle for further functionalization, making it a strategic intermediate in total syntheses.  The tandem Nazarov/ene cyclization  was shown to be preferred over a Nazarov/  [  3+2]  tandem reaction for all our substrates, independent of chain length. Deuteration studies further support the mechanistic hypothesis of the terminating ene reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly and Aggregation Induced Emission in Aqueous Media of Responsive Luminescent Copper(I) Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent copper(I)&#8208;based compounds have recently attracted much attention since they can reach very high emission quantum yields. Interestingly, Cu(I) clusters can also be emissive, and the extension from small molecules to larger architecture could represent the first step to novel materials that could be reached by programming the units to undergo self&#8208;assembly. However, for Cu(I) compounds the formation of supramolecular systems is challenging due to the coordinative diversity of copper centers. Herein we show that this diversity can be exploited in the construction of responsive systems. In detail, we followed the changes in the emissive profile of different aggregates formed in water by phosphine&#8208;thioether copper(I) derivatives. Our results demonstrate that the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly of Cu(I)&#8208;based coordination polymeric nanoparticles (CPNs) is sensitive to solvent composition. The solvent&#8208;induced changes are related to modifications in the coordination sphere of copper at the molecular level, which alters not only the emission profile but also the morphology of the aggregates. We expect our findings to inspire construction of smart supramolecular systems based on dynamic coordinative metal centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphology Engineering of Fullerene[C70] Microcrystals: from Perfect Cube, Defective Hopper to Novel Cruciform&#8208;pillar</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled crystallization of fullerene molecules into ordered molecular assemblies is important for their applications. However, the morphology engineering of fullerene[C  70  ] assemblies is challenging and complicated architectures have rarely been reported due to the low molecular symmetry of C  70  molecules which makes their crystallization difficult to control and the low production yield as well. Herein, with the assistance of solvent intercalation, we report a general reprecipitation approach to prepare morphologically controllable C  70  microcrystals with mesitylene as a good solvent and n&#8208;propanol as a poor solvent in one solvent system without replacing specific solvents. A series of C  70  microcrystals with high uniformity from perfect cubes and defective hoppers to novel cruciform&#8208;pillars are obtained by intentionally tuning C  70  concentration and the volume ratio of mesitylene to n&#8208;propanol. Among them, novel cruciform&#8208;pillar&#8208;shaped microcrystals are obtained for the first time by further decreasing the amount of mesitylene in the solvent&#8208;intercalated microcrystals. Noteworthily, the C  70  concentration is a key parameter for the selective growth of C  70  hopper, rather than the volume ratio of mesitylene to n&#8208;propanol. Interestingly, the hopper&#8208;shaped microcrystals exhibit excellent photoluminescence properties relative to those of cubes and cruciform&#8208;pillars owing to the enhanced light absorption, proving their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Template/Solvent&#8208;Free Pyrolysis for   in&#8208;situ  &#160;Immobilization of CoP Nanoparticles onto N and P  co&#8208;Doped Carbon Porous Nanosheets towards&#160;High&#8208;efficiency Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for economical, active and stable electrocatalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is highly imperative for the progression of water electrolysis technology and related sustainable energy conversion technologies. The delicate&#160;optimization of chemical composition and architectural configuration is paramount to design high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;precious HER electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step scalable template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis approach for in&#8208;situ&#160;immobilizing uniform CoP nanoparticles onto N and P co&#8208;doped carbon porous nanosheets (denoted as CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs hereafter). The simultaneous consideration of architectural design and nanocarbon hybridization renders the formed CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs with plentiful well&#8208;dispersed anchored active sites, shortened pathway for mass diffusion, enhanced electric conductivity, and reinforced mechanical stability. As a consequence, the optimized CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs exhibit an overpotential of 115 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, small Tafel slope of 74.2 mV dec&#8208;1, high Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%, and superb long&#8208;term durability in an alkaline medium. Given the fabrication feasibility, mass production potential and outstanding HER performance, the CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs may hold great promise for large&#8208;scale electrochemical water splitting. More importantly, the explored one&#8208;step template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis methodology offers a feasible and versatile route to fabricate carbon nanosheet&#8208;based nanocomposites for diverse energy conversation&#8208;related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobic metal&#8208;organic frameworks and derived composites for microelectronics applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extraordinary characteristic features of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) make them applicable for use in a variety of fields but their conductivity in microelectronics over a wide relative humidity (RH) range has not been extensively explored. To achieve good performance, MOFs must be stable in water, i.e., under humid conditions. However, the design of ultrastable hydrophobic MOFs with high conductivity for use in microelectronics as conducting and dielectric materials remains a challenge. In this Review, we discuss applications of an emerging class of hydrophobic MOFs with respect to their use as active sensor coatings, tunable low&#8208;&#954; dielectrics and conductivity, which provide high&#8208;level roadmap for stimulating the next steps toward the development and implementation of hydrophobic MOFs for use in microelectronic devices. Several methodologies including the incorporation of long alkyl chain and fluorinated linkers, doping of redox&#8208;active TCNQ, the use of guest molecules, and conducting polymers or carbon materials in the pores or surface of MOFs have been utilized to produce hydrophobic MOFs. The contact angle of a water droplet and a coating can be used to evaluate the degree of hydrophobicity of the surface of a MOF. These unique advantages enable hydrophobic MOFs to be used as a highly versatile platform for exploring multifunctional porous materials. Classic representative examples of each category are discussed in terms of coordination structures, types of hydrophobic design, and potential microelectronic applications. Lastly, a summary and outlook as concluding remarks in this field are presented. We envision that future research in the area of hydrophobic MOFs promise to provide important breakthroughs in microelectronics applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Broad Scope and High&#8208;yield Access to Unsymmetrical Acyclic [11C]ureas for Biomedical Imaging from [11C]carbonyl Difluoride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective methods are needed for labelling acyclic ureas with carbon&#8208;11 (  t  1/2  = 20.4 min) as potential radiotracers for biomedical imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). Herein, we describe the rapid and high&#8208;yield syntheses of unsymetrical acyclic [  11  C]ureas under mild conditions (room temperature and within 7 minutes) using no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [  11  C]carbonyl difluoride with aliphatic and aryl amines. This methodology is compatible with diverse functionality (e.g., hydroxy, carboxyl, amino, amido, or pyridyl) in the substrate amines. The labelling process proceeds through putative [  11  C]carbamoyl fluorides and for primary amines through identifiable [  11  C]isocyanate intermediates. Unsymmetrical [  11  C]ureas are produced with negligible amounts of unwanted symmetrical [  11  C]urea byproducts. Moreover, the overall labelling method tolerates trace water and the generally moderate to excellent yields show good reproducibility. [  11  C]Carbonyl difluoride shows exceptional promise for application to the synthesis of acyclic [  11  C]ureas as new radiotracers for biomedical imaging with PET.</dc:description>

         <title>Plant&#8208;derived stilbenoids as DNA&#8208;binding agents: from monomers to dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stilbenoids are natural compounds endowed with several biological activities, including cardioprotection and cancer prevention.

         <title>Amorphous calcium phosphates: Solvent&#8208;controlled growth and stabilization through the Epoxide Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium phosphates stand among the most promising nanobiomaterials where their intrinsic properties as crystalline structure, composition, particle shape and size define their successful use in key biomedical applications as bone repairment, signalling or drug/gene delivery. Among these compounds, metastable amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) is currently gaining particular attention due to its inherently high reactivity in solution, which is   crucial in bone development mechanisms. However, the obtainment of this highly desired (bio)material with control over its shape, size and phase purity remains as a synthetic challenge. Herein, we have adapted the Epoxide Route for the synthesis of   pure and stable ACP colloids   . By using biocompatible solvents such as ethylene glycol and/or glycerine we are able to avoid t   he natural tendency of ACP to maturate into more stable and crystalline apatites. Moreover, this procedure offers size control, ranging from small nanoparticles (60 nm) to micrometric spheroids (500 nm), and the eventual fractalization of the microstructure, by simply adjusting the   composition of the solvent mixture, means   ethylene glycol:glycerine   ratio.   These findings introduce the use of green   solvents as a new tool to control crystallinity and/or particle size in the synthesis of nanomaterials, avoiding the use of capping agents and preserving the natural chemical reactivity of the pristine surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Reevaluating the Solution Photophysics of Tetraphenylethylene at the Origin of their Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through actinometric NMR evaluation of the photoisomerization kinetics of tetraphenylethylene simple derivatives, it is shown that process is the almost exclusive nonradiative pathway accounting for their luminescence quenching in solution, while photocyclization plays at best a minor role.







Abstract
Although tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and its derivatives have been the most commonly used building blocks in the construction of molecules with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, no absolute consensus exists regarding the mechanisms at the origin of the phenomenon. Restriction of intramolecular rotations (RIR) of peripheral phenyls has historically been a dominant paradigm, which has served as a valuable guideline in the molecular engineering of AIEgens. Yet, an increasing number of recent works have established that photoisomerization or photocyclization may actively participate in the nonradiative dissipation of the excitation energy. In this paper, the first experimental evaluation of the quantum efficiencies of these different processes is reported, and photoisomerization is shown to be by far the dominant photophysical pathway in solution, accounting for virtually all nonradiative decay of the molecule&#8216;s excited state in degassed solution.

         <title>Ultraviolet&#8208;Cured Semi&#8208;Interpenetrating Network Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an UV&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ETPTA), linear polymer chains (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and lithium salt solution are designed to satisfy the demands of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility and electrochemical stability. LiFePO4/Li battery based on the SNP electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity, good rate capability and cycling stability at room temperature.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes with relatively low ionic conductivity at room temperature and poor mechanical strength greatly restrict their practical applications. Herein, we design semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an ultraviolet&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate), linear polymer chains (polyvinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) and lithium salt solution to satisfy the demand of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility, and electrochemical stability for lithium metal batteries. The semi&#8208;interpenetrating network has a pivotal effect in improving chain relaxation, facilitating the local segmental motion of polymer chains and reducing the polymer crystallinity. Thanks to these advantages, the SNP electrolyte shows a high ionic conductivity (1.12&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C), wide electrochemical stability window (4.6&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), good bendability and shape versatility. The promoted ion transport combined with suppressed impedance growth during cycling contribute to good cell performance. The assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LiFePO4/SNP/Li) exhibit good cycling stability and rate capability at room temperature.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocycles via Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Coupling of Thioesters and Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins is reported, which provides unique and atom&#8208;economic access to spirocyclic scaffolds. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins has been developed for the efficient synthesis of spirocycles, a privileged scaffold commonly found in natural products. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination. Initial mechanistic investigations are consistent with an oxidative addition/olefin insertion/reductive elimination mechanism. The incorporated methylene sulfide substituent can undergo a variety of further reactions to increase molecular diversity and complexity. These results demonstrate that thioester derivatives can be used as powerful building blocks for the assembly of complex scaffolds.

         <title>Cyclopentadienone Derivative Dimers as Tunable Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel photoswitches based on a cyclopentadienone derivative dimer was synthesized. Their photoswitching properties were investigated.







Abstract
A series of photoswitchable cyclopentadienone derivative dimers bearing bromo, thienyl, 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl, 3&#8208;pyridinyl, 4&#8208;nitrophenyl and cyano groups was designed and facilely synthesized. Photoswitching properties such as the photoconversions in the photostationary state (PSS), the thermal kinetics and thermal half&#8208;lives of photoisomers were systematically investigated. These photoswitches show high fatigue resistance and large photoconversions in the PSS. This work proves that the photoswitching properties of photoswitches based on cyclopentadienone dimers can be tuned by substitution groups and also pave the way to functionalize the cyclopentadienone derivative dimer&#8208;based photoswitch, which is important for its future applications.

This work proves that the photoswitching properties of photoswitches based on cyclopentadienone dimers can be tuned by substitution groups and also pave the way to functionalize the cyclopentadienone derivative dimer&#8208;based photoswitch, which is important for its future applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>New Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides Composed of Square&#8208;Planar Gold(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to common types of Au(I) coordination, such as linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral units observed in extended solids, the square planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia, shown in the cover image, exhibits the 3&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8208;Tt&#8208;Au and Au&#8208;Pn&#8208;Au (on her feathers), square planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her pendant), and linear &#8230;&#8208;Au&#8208;Au&#8208;Au&#8208;&#8230; chains (her legs) that are characteristic of the novel equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds. The image was created by designer Grant Luhmann. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Kovnir et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005312).

         <dc:description>
Cooperativity between cationic zinc hydrides and triphenylborane is utilized to catalyze CO2 reduction. Elementary reactions provide insights into a general mechanism for zinc hydride promoted CO2 hydrosilylation and hydroboration. The significance of the zinc&#8208;bound ligand denticity and the Lewis acid additive role in the catalytic process is highlighted. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. Maron, A. Venugopal, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005392).

         <title>Interconnectivity between Surface Reactivity and Self&#8208;Assembly of Kemp Elimination Catalyzing Nanorods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered assembly: Synthetic functional assembly of catalytic unit (gold nanorod), principally regulated through their surface catalytic reactivity towards proton transfer reaction is reported. The hydrophobic cavities formed during flocking of gold nanorods has been utilized as reactors for hydrophobic substrates towards aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction in aqueous media, demonstrating a catalytic cascading which is completely unrelated to primary reaction products.







Abstract
Understanding the fundamental facts behind dynamicity of catalytic processes has been a longstanding quest across disciplines. Herein, we report self&#8208;assembly of catalytically active gold nanorods that can be regulated by tuning its reactivity towards a proton transfer reaction at different pH. Unlike substrate&#8208;induced templating and co&#8208;operativity, the enhanced aggregation rate is due to alteration of catalytic surface charge only during reactivity as negatively charged transition state of reactant (5&#8208;nitrobenzisoxazole) is formed on positively charged nanorod while undergoing a concerted E2&#8208;pathway. Herein, enhanced diffusivity during catalytic processes might also act as an additional contributing factor. Furthermore, we have also shown that nanosized hydrophobic cavities of clustered nanorods can also efficiently accelerate the rate of an aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction, which also demonstrates a catalytic phenomenon that can lead to cascading of other reactions where substrates and products of the starting reactions are not directly involved.

         <title>Rapid and Mild Lactamization Using Highly Electrophilic Triphosgene in a Microflow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid (0.5 to 10&#8197;s), mild, inexpensive, and less wasteful lactamization was achieved using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a micro&#8208;flow reactor. This work reports two methods using NMM and NMI, respectively. The slight difference in basicity is critical in the lactamization depending on the type of lactam. A plausible reaction mechanism was discussed. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without tedious purifications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Fuse et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100059).

         <dc:description>
Starting from 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (not shown), in situ nitration leads to different nitrated linker molecules that selectively react with Ga3+ or Al3+ ions to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 and Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10 type frameworks, respectively.

         <title>The Missing Parent Compound [(C5H5)Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]: Synthesis, Characterization, Coordination Behavior and Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of parent pentaphosphaferrocene [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] has been achieved after more than 30 years, closing the gap within the large class of pentaphosphaferrocenes; the cover image depicts the parent compound taking its proper place on the family tree. The influence of the unsubstituted Cp ligand on the complex formation was shown, reflecting specific conditions during the synthesis, its eclipsed conformation, different coordination behavior towards CuI halides and ability to template the construction of nano&#8208;sized fullerene&#8208;like spheres, acting hereby, in contrast to the other homologous, as an electron donor. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Scheer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100203).

The influence of the unsubstituted Cp ligand on the complex formation was shown, reflecting specific conditions during the synthesis, its eclipsed conformation, different coordination behavior towards Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; halides and ability to template the construction of nano&#8208;sized fullerene&#8208;like spheres, acting hereby, in contrast to the other homologous, as an electron donor.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Induced Growth of Coordination Polymer Derived&#8208;Straight Carbon Nanotubes on Carbon Nanofiber Network for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

The scheme illustrates the sulfur&#8208;induced synthesis of a Masson pine twigs&#8208;like 3&#8208;dimensional carbon nanofibers network with abundant straight carbon nanotubes from a type of Co&#8208;based coordination polymer, which are encapsulated with Co9S8 nanoparticles. Combined with the effective catalytic sites of the Co, N, and S doped carbon nanofibers/carbon nanotubes and the unique structure of 3&#8208;dimensional cross&#8208;connected carbon nanofiber network, CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;T shows excellent ORR catalytic activity.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon nanomaterials have been widely studied for efficient oxygen reduction reaction and energy storage and conversion in metal&#8208;air batteries. A Masson pine twigs&#8208;like 3&#8208;dimensional network construction of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with abundant straight long Co, N, and S&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is developed by thermal treatment of Co&#8208;based polymer coated onto polyacrylonitrile nanofiber network together with thiourea at 900&#8201;&#176;C, denoted as CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900. It is interesting to note that the introduction of a high concentration of sulfur does not lead to the complete toxicity of catalysts, but promotes the axial growth to selectively form straight CNTs instead of curly bamboo&#8208;like CNTs. The highly graphitized in&#8208;situ grown Co, N, S&#8208;doped CNTs and the 3&#8208;dimensional N&#8208;doped CNF network provide both active catalytic sites and highly conductive paths, which are beneficial for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thus, the optimal CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900 performs the excellent ORR catalytic activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.84&#8197;V and a diffusion&#8208;limited current density of 5.49&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900&#8208;based Zn&#8208;air devices also possess a high power density of 136.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 better than commercial Pt/C.

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase Co&#8722;C Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>

B12&#8208;derived phenyl&#8208;corrins are antivitamins B12 that resist the enzymatic cleavage of their Co&#8722;C bond. Surprisingly, as shown by ESI&#8208;MS threshold CID, the Co&#8722;Csp2 bonds of phenyl&#8208;corrins are weaker than Co&#8722;Csp3 bonds of analogous methyl&#8208;corrins, contrasting the known effect of the hybridization on bond strengths. Hence, for the behavior of phenyl&#8208;cobalamins as antivitamins B12, stereo&#8208;electronic restrictions of the nucleophilic displacement are more critical than Co&#8722;C bond strengths.

         <title>Glycerol as a Substrate and Inactivator of Coenzyme B12&#8208;Dependent Diol Dehydratase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct enzymes, coenzyme B12&#8208;dependent diol dehydratase (B12&#8208;dDDH) and coenzyme B12&#8208;independent glycerol dehydratase (B12&#8208;iGDH), are capable of catalyzing the selective transformation of glycerol to 3&#8208;hydroxypropionaldehyde. Only the former enzyme is subject to substrate&#8208;induced inactivation, however. Utilizing molecular dynamics (MD), quantum mechanical (QM), and hybrid QM/MM techniques, we found that inactivation in B12&#8208;dDDH occurs if hydrogen abstraction takes place from the &#8216;wrong&#8217; side (C3) of glycerol.







Abstract
Diol dehydratase, dependent on coenzyme B12 (B12&#8208;dDDH), displays a peculiar feature of being inactivated by its native substrate glycerol (GOL). Surprisingly, the isofunctional enzyme, B12&#8208;independent glycerol dehydratase (B12&#8208;iGDH), does not undergo suicide inactivation by GOL. Herein we present a series of QM/MM and MD calculations aimed at understanding the mechanisms of substrate&#8208;induced suicide inactivation in B12&#8208;dDDH and that of resistance of B12&#8208;iGDH to inactivation. We show that the first step in the enzymatic transformation of GOL, hydrogen abstraction, can occur from both ends of the substrate (either C1 or C3 of GOL). Whereas C1 abstraction in both enzymes leads to product formation, C3 abstraction in B12&#8208;dDDH results in the formation of a low energy radical intermediate, which is effectively trapped within a deep well on the potential energy surface. The long lifetime of this radical intermediate likely enables its side reactions, leading to inactivation. In B12&#8208;iGDH, by comparison, C3 abstraction is an endothermic step; consequently, the resultant radical intermediate is not of low energy, and the reverse process of reforming the reactant is possible.

         <title>Enantioselective CO2 Fixation Via a Heck&#8208;Coupling/Carboxylation Cascade Catalyzed by Nickel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
COTWO task. An enantioselective nickel catalyzed tandem Heck coupling/carboxylation synthetic sequence with CO2 is reported that provides ready access to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;ylacetic acids and analogous compounds (ee up to 99&#8201;%). Labelling experiments, DFT analysis and X&#8208;ray characterizations enabled both mechanistic steps and stereodiscriminating transition states to be fully elucidated.







Abstract
A novel asymmetric nickel&#8208;based procedure has been developed in which CO2 fixation is achieved as a second step of a truncated Heck coupling. For this, a new chiral ligand has been prepared and shown to achieve enantiomeric excesses up to 99&#8201;%. The overall process efficiently furnishes chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;ylacetic acids, an important class of bioactive products, from easy to prepare starting materials. A combined experimental and computational effort revealed the key steps of the catalytic cycle and suggested the unexpected participation of Ni(I) species in the coupling event.

         <title>Photochemical Activation of Aromatic Aldehydes: Synthesis of Amides, Hydroxamic Acids and Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemistry. A facile, mild and metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot protocol for the activation of aromatic aldehydes and their conversion into amides, hydroxamic acids and esters was developed, using cheap household lamps as the light source and thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one as the photocatalyst.







Abstract
A cheap, facile and metal&#8208;free photochemical protocol for the activation of aromatic aldehydes has been developed. Utilizing thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one as the photocatalyst and cheap household lamps as the light source, a variety of aromatic aldehydes have been activated and subsequently converted in a one&#8208;pot reaction into amides, hydroxamic acids and esters in good to high yields. The applicability of this method was highlighted in the synthesis of Moclobemide, a drug against depression and social anxiety. Extended and detailed mechanistic studies have been conducted, in order to determine a plausible mechanism for the reaction.

         <title>Supramolecular Coordination Cages Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Gold(I) Ligands and Their Precursors: Self&#8208;Assembly, Structural Transformation and Guest&#8208;Binding Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a trackable CpZr&#8208;involved cage to cage conversion to generate heteroleptic V2E3 cages from two homoleptic cages with different geometries of V2E3 and V4E6. The heteroleptic assembly can also be formed by ligand displacement transformations from homoleptic assembly.







Abstract
The incorporation of functional groups into the cavity of discrete supramolecular coordination cages (SCCs) will bring unique functions and applications. Here, three dicarboxylate ligands (H2L1Cl, H2L2Cl and H2L3Cl) containing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors as linkers were introduced to construct SCCs by combining with two C3&#8208;symmertic (CpZr)3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(&#956;2&#8208;OH)3 clusters as three&#8208;connect vertices, resulted in a series of rugby&#8208;like V2E3 (V=vertex, E=edge) type homoleptic cages (SCC&#8208;1, SCC&#8208;2 and SCC&#8208;3). However, V4E6&#8208;type tetrahedral cages (SCC&#8208;4 and SCC&#8208;5), incorporating six Au&#8208;NHC moieties, were obtained when the corresponding NHC&#8208;gold(I) functionalized ligands (H2L1Au, H2L2Au) were applied. For the first time, we present a trackable CpZr&#8208;involved cage to cage conversion to generate a heteroleptic V2E3 cage (SCC&#8208;6) from two homoleptic cages (SCC&#8208;2 and SCC&#8208;5) with different geometries of V2E3 and V4E6. The heteroleptic assembly SCC&#8208;6 can also be formed upon a subcomponent displacement strategy. The structural transformation and reassembly processes were detected and monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry. The formation of heteroleptic assembly was further supported by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Moreover, homoleptic cage SCC&#8208;2 possesses a trigonal bipyramidal cationic cavity allowing the encapsulation of a series of sulfonate anionic guests.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Putative Biosynthetic Intermediate Ambruticin J</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The family of anti&#8208;fungal natural products known as the ambruticins are structurally distinguished by a pair of pyran rings adorning a divinylcyclopropane core. Previous characterization of their biosynthesis, including the expression of a genetically modified producing organism, revealed that the polyketide synthase pathway proceeds through a diol intermediate, known as ambruticin J. Here we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of the putative PKS product, ambruticin J, via  a triply&#8208;convergent synthetic route featuring a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and a Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination for fragment assembly. This synthesis takes advantage of synthetic methodology, previously developed by our laboratory, for the stereoselective generation of the trisubstituted cyclopropyl linchpin.</dc:description>

         <title>The Long and Bright Path of a Lanthanide MOF: From Basics towards the Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic structural and optical changes of Tb&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks in the presence of aqueous fluoride solutions are reported in this work. The structural transformation of the MOF in the presence of fluorides was scrutinized by XRD, XAFS, and dynamic measurements of the Tb emission, and all the information was summarized in the development of a tech&#8208;demo. The cover shows &#8220;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&#8221; hinting at the flow between the different but connected states of the MOF when the fluoride concentration increases, first increasing the emission by replacement of Tb&#8722;OH groups in the MOF by Tb&#8722;F and later quenching the emission by the formation of TbF3. The cover image was designed by ScienceBrush Design. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E.&#8197;H. Otal, M. Kimura, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005222).

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serotonin is an important signaling molecule with a high lipid membrane affinity. Membrane binding of serotonin modulates membrane properties and potentially cellular function as well, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. The results presented in this study suggest a mode of serotonin&#8211;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D. Huster, S. Maiti, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100328).

         <title>Click and Release Chemistry for Activity&#8208;Based Purification of &#946;&#8208;Lactam Targets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we functionalized carbapenem &#946;&#8208;lactams for the development of an original activity&#8208;based purification method of the complex targets of these drugs. The alkyne drug covalently bound to the target specifically reacted with an azido probe containing a biotin moiety for affinity purification and an iminosydnone for single&#8208;step elution and fluorescent labeling of the targets.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Lactams, the cornerstone of antibiotherapy, inhibit multiple and partially redundant targets referred to as transpeptidases or penicillin&#8208;binding proteins. These enzymes catalyze the essential cross&#8208;linking step of the polymerization of cell wall peptidoglycan. The understanding of the mechanisms of action of &#946;&#8208;lactams and of resistance to these drugs requires the development of reliable methods to characterize their targets. Here, we describe an activity&#8208;based purification method of &#946;&#8208;lactam targets based on click and release chemistry. We synthesized alkyne&#8208;carbapenems with suitable properties with respect to the kinetics of acylation of a model target, the Ldtfm L,D&#8208;transpeptidase, the stability of the resulting acylenzyme, and the reactivity of the alkyne for the cycloaddition of an azido probe containing a biotin moiety for affinity purification and a bioorthogonal cleavable linker. The probe provided access to the fluorescent target in a single click and release step.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Fluorescent Helicene&#8208;Boranils: Synthesis, Photophysical and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicene&#8208;mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;boranils have been prepared in enantiopure forms. The chiroptical (electronic circular dichroism and optical rotation) and photophysical properties (unpolarized and circularly polarized luminescence) of these new chiral emissive helicenes have been studied both experimentally and theoretically and highlight their combined helical and axial chirality effects.







Abstract
Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;boranil&#8208;substituted helicenes were prepared by BF2&#8208;borylation of the corresponding anils, readily synthesized by condensation of 2&#8208;amino&#8208; and 2,15&#8208;diamino&#8208;helicenes with 4&#8208;(diethylamino)salicylaldehyde. After enantiomeric resolution using HPLC, their chiroptical properties including circularly polarized fluorescence in solution and in PMMA films were investigated and rationalized with the help of NMR, X&#8208;ray and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

         <title>Vapochromic Luminescent &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems with Reversible Coordination&#8208;Number Control of Hypervalent Tin(IV)&#8208;Fused Azobenzene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vapochromic luminescence of hypervalent tin(IV) complexes: Hypervalent tin(IV) complexes having deep&#8208;red emission can be synthesized. The critically narrow energy gap was attributed to three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8211;4e) bonds. Furthermore, dynamic and reversible color changes of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems were caused by coordination&#8208;number control of the hypervalent tin(IV) complexes. The color&#8208;change mechanism and degree of binding constants were well explained by theoretical calculation.







Abstract
The dynamic and reversible changes of coordination numbers between five and six in solution and solid states, based on hypervalent tin(IV)&#8208;fused azobenzene (TAz) complexes, are reported. It was found that the TAz complexes showed deep&#8208;red emission owing to the hypervalent bond composed of an electron&#8208;donating three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8211;4e) bond and an electron&#8208;accepting nitrogen&#8211;tin (N&#8211;Sn) coordination. Furthermore, hypsochromic shifts in optical spectra were observed in Lewis basic solvents because of alteration of the coordination number from five to six. In particular, vapochromic luminescence was induced by attachment of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vapor to the coordination point at the tin atom accompanied with a crystal&#8211;crystal phase transition. Additionally, the color&#8208;change mechanism and degree of binding constants were well explained by theoretical calculation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of vapochromic luminescence by using stable and variable coordination numbers of hypervalent bonds.

         <title>CoS2/N&#8208;doped Hollow Spheres as Anode Material for High Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we first synthesized polyacrylic acid (PAA) spheres and used PAA as a template to load Co(OH)  2  particles on its surface. The product of CoS  2  nanoparticles dispersed in N&#8208;doped hollow spheres (N&#8208;HCS) was prepared through sulfurization treatment (CoS  2  /S@N&#8208;HCS). During the sulfuration process, S will penetrate into the PAA and be embedded in the graphite layer along with the carbonization process. It was found that during the charging and discharging process, the S in the carbon layer will gradually dissolve out, thereby forming new ion diffusion channels in the carbon spheres and exposing more CoS  2  active sites. CoS  2  /S@N&#8208;HCS composite exhibits a specific capacity of 729.6 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g  &#8208;1  . The sodium storage mechanism and reaction kinetics of the materials were further measured by in&#8208;situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, capacitance performance evaluation and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique. The excellent cycling performance and rate capability demonstrated that the CoS  2  /S@N&#8208;HCS is a potential and prospective anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Fe&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks through Ligand Conformation Regulation for Efficient Dye&#160;Adsorption and C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating the structure of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) by adjusting the ligands reasonably is expected to enhance the interaction of MOFs on special molecules/ions, which has significant application value for the selective adsorption of guest molecules. In this work, two tricarboxylic ligands H3L&#8208;Cl and H3L&#8208;NH2 were designed and synthesized based on the ligand H3TTCA by replacing part of the benzene rings with C=C bonds and modifying the chlorine and amino groups on the 4&#8208;position of the benzene ring. Two 3D Fe&#8208;MOFs (UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2) with the novel topology types were constructed. As the C=C bonds of the ligands have flexible torsion angles, UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl features three types of irregular 2D channels, while UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 has a cage with two types of windows on the surface. The synergistic effect of unique channels and modification of functional groups endows UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 with high adsorption capacity for organic dyes. UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl shows high adsorption capacity for CV (147.2 mg g&#8208;1), RHB (100.3 mg g&#8208;1), and MO (220.9 mg g&#8208;1), while UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 exhibits selective adsorption of MO (158.7 mg g&#8208;1). Meanwhile, based on the&#160;diverse pore structure and modification of active sites, UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 show the selective separation of equimolar C2H2/CO2. Therefore, reasonable regulation of organic ligands plays a significant role in guiding the structure diversification and performance improvement of MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot synthesis of 11C&#8208;labelled primary benzamides via intermediate [11C]aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic  11  C&#8208;labelled aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium salts, obtained by carbonylative cross coupling of aryl halides with [  11  C]carbon monoxide, were prepared for the first time and shown to be valuable intermediates in the synthesis of primary [  11  C]benzamides. The methodology furnished a set of benzamide model compounds, including the two poly (ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors niraparib and veliparib, in moderate to excellent radiochemical yields. In addition to providing a convenient and practical route to primary&#160;[  11  C]benzamides, the current methodology paves the way for future application of [  11  C]aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium halide salts in PET tracer synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Catalytically Active Species in POM&#8208;catalysed DNA&#8208;model Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphoester hydrolysis is an important chemical step in DNA repair. One archetypal molecular model of phosphoesters is para&#8208;nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP). It has been shown previously that the presence of molecular metal oxide [Mo  7  O  24  ]  6&#8211;  may catalyse the hydrolysis of pNPP through the partial decomposition of polyoxomolybdate framework resulting in a [(PO  4  )  2  Mo  5  O  15  ]  6&#8211;  product. Real&#8208;time monitoring of the catalytic system using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) provided a glance into the species present in the reaction mixture and identification of potential catalytic candidates. Following up on the obtained spectrometric data, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to characterise the hypothetical intermediate [Mo  5  O  15  (pNPP)  2  (H  2  O)  6  ]  6&#8211;  that would be required to form under the hypothesised transformation. Surprisingly, our results point to the dimeric [Mo  2  O  8  ]  4&#8211;  anion resulting from the decomposition of [Mo  7  O  24  ]  6&#8211;  as the active catalytic species involved in the hydrolysis of pNPP rather than the originally assumed {Mo  5  O  15  } species. A similar study was carried out involving the same species but substituting Mo by W. The mechanism involving W species showed a higher barrier and less stable products in agreement with the non&#8208;catalytic effect found in experimental results</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of highly substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines, including a phenylene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinine, was synthesized from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;azaborete rhodium complexes with variously substituted alkynes. 1&#8208;Rhoda&#8208;3,2&#8208;azaborole complexes, which are accessible by phosphine addition to the corresponding 1,2&#8208;azaborete complexes, were also found to be suitable precursors for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines and readily reacted with alkynyl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;azaborinines to generate new regioisomers of bi&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborinines, which feature directly connected aromatic rings. Their molecular structures, which can be viewed as boron&#8208;nitrogen isosteres of biphenyls, show nearly perpendicular 1,2&#8208;azaborinine rings. The new method using rhodacycles instead of 1,2&#8208;azaborete complexes as precursors is shown to be more effective, allowing the synthesis of a wider range of 1,2&#8208;azaborinines.</dc:description>

         <title>Fundamental Characterization, Photophysics and Photocatalysis of a Base Metal Iron(II)&#8208;Cobalt(III) Dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new base metal iron&#8208;cobalt dyad is presented, connecting a heteroleptic tetra&#8209;NHC iron(II) photosensitizer combining a 2,6&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]pyridine) with 2,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)&#8208;4,4'&#8208;bipyridine ligand, and a cobaloxime catalyst. This iron(II)&#8208;cobalt(III) assembly is characterized by ground and excited state methods like X&#8209;ray crystallography, X&#8209;ray absorption spectroscopy, (spectro&#8209;)electrochemistry, and steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved optical absorption spectroscopy, with a focus on the stability of the assembly in solution and the determination of the excited state landscape. NMR and UV&#8209;Vis spectroscopy reveal dissociation of the dyad in acetonitrile at concentrations below 1 mM and high photostability. Transient absorption spectroscopy after excitation into the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer absorption band suggests a relaxation cascade originating from hot singlet and triplet &#160;MLCT states, leading to the population of the  3  MLCT state that exhibits the longest lifetime. Decay into the ground state finally involves a  3MC state. The attachment of cobaloxime to the iron photosensitizer increases the  3MLCT lifetime at the iron center. Together with the directing effect of the linker, this potentially makes the dyad more active in photocatalytic proton reduction experiments than the analogue two&#8208;component system, consisting of the iron photosensitizer and Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl. This work thus sheds new light on the functionality of base metal dyads, important for more efficient and sustainable future proton reduction systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Validation of Ab&#8208;initio&#8208;predicted Magnetic Anisotropies and Magneto&#8208;structural Correlations in Linear Hetero&#8208;trinuclear DyIII&#8208;NiII2 Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported are single crystal SQUID and single crystal high&#8208;frequency / high&#8208;field EPR data of a trinuclear complex with a rare six&#8208;coordinate coordination sphere of a DyIII center coupled to two terminal six&#8208;coordinate NiII ions. The analysis of the single crystal spectroscopic parameters allows for an accurate description of the ground state wavefunction. The experimental analysis is supplemented by the analysis of the paramagnetic NMR spectra, allowing for a thorough description of the DyIII center. The experimental data are interpreted on the basis of an ab initio ligand field analysis, and the computed parameters are in good agreement with the experimental observations. This supports the quality of the theoretical approach based on a pseudo&#8208;spin Hamiltonian for the electronic ground state. Further support emerges from the ab initio ligand field theory based analysis of structurally very similar system that, in contrast to the complex reported here, shows single molecule magnetic properties, and this is in agreement with the quantum&#8208;chemical prediction and analysis.</dc:description>

Further support emerges from the ab initio ligand field theory based analysis of structurally very similar system that, in contrast to the complex reported here, shows single molecule magnetic properties, and this is in agreement with the quantum&#8208;chemical prediction and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intersystem Crossing and Electron Spin Selectivity in Anthracene&#8208;Naphthalimide Compact Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Showing Different Geometry and Electronic Coupling Magnitudes</title>

         <dc:description>
Dependency of the charge transfer and Intersystem crossing on molecular geometry and electronic coupling in electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads: Efficient spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) was observed in compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads. The electron spin selectivity of the ISC was studied with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra.







Abstract
Anthracene&#8208;naphthalimide (An&#8208;NI) compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads were prepared, in which the orientation and distance between the two subunits were varied by direct connection or with intervening phenyl linker. Efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and long triplet state lifetime (&#934;&#916;=92&#8201;%, &#964;T=438&#8197;&#956;s) were observed for the directly connected dyads showing a perpendicular geometry (81&#176;). This efficient spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer ISC (SOCT&#8208;ISC) takes 376&#8197;fs, inhibits the direct charge recombination (CR) to ground state (1CT&#8594;S0, takes 3.04&#8197;ns). Interestingly, efficient SOCT&#8208;ISC for dyads with intervening phenyl linker (&#934;&#916;=40&#8201;% in DCM) was also observed, although the electron donor and acceptor adopt almost coplanar geometry (dihedral angle: 15&#176;). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy shows that the electron spin polarization of the triplet state, i.&#8201;e. the electron spin selectivity of ISC, is highly dependent on the dihedral angle and the linker. For the dyads showing weaker coupling between the donor and acceptors, the charge separation and the intramolecular triplet energy transfer are inhibited at 80&#8197;K (frozen solution), because both the 3An and 3NI states were observed and the ESP are same as compared to the native anthracene and naphthalimide, which unravel their origin. The dyads were used as triplet photosensitizers for triplet&#8722;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA UC). High UC quantum yield (&#934;UC=12.9&#8201;%) as well as a large anti&#8208;Stokes shift (0.72&#8197;eV) was attained by excitation into the CT absorption band.

         <title>Radiochromic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials have been investigated as efficient photochromic platforms for detecting hazardous radiation, while the utilization of hydrogen bonded&#8208;organic frameworks (HOFs) in this field has remained intact. Herein, two HOFs were synthesized through self&#8208;assembly of tetratopic viologen ligand and formic acid (PFC&#8208;25, PFC&#8208;26), as a new class of &#8220;all&#8208;organic&#8221; radiochromic smart materials, opening a gate for HOFs in this desired field. PFC&#8208;26 is active upon both X&#8208;rays and UV light, while PFC&#8208;25 is only active upon X&#8208;rays. The same building block yet different radiochromic behaviors of PFC&#8208;25 and PFC&#8208;26 allow us to gain a deep mechanistic understanding of the factors that control the detection specificity. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of viologen ligand is highly related to the threshold energy of triggering a charge transfer, therefore being a vital factor for the particularity of radiochromic materials. Thanks to its convenient processibility, nanoparticle size, and UV silence, PFC&#8208;25 can be further fabricated into a portable naked&#8208;eye sensor for X&#8208;ray detection, which shows obvious color change with the merits of high transmittance contrast, good sensitivity (reproducible dose threshold of 3.5 Gy), and excellent stability. The work exhibits the promising practical potentials of HOF materials in photochromic technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifaceted Mickey Mouse Amphiphiles for Programmable Self&#8208;Assembly, DNA Complexation and Organ&#8208;Selective Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Instilling segregated cationic and lipophilic domains with an angular disposition in a trehalose&#8208;based trifaceted macrocyclic scaffold allows engineering patchy molecular nanoparticles leveraging directional interactions that emulate those controlling self&#8208;assembling processes in viral capsids. The resulting trilobular amphiphilic derivatives, featuring a Mickey Mouse architecture, can electrostatically interact with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and further engage in hydrophobic contacts to promote condensation into transfectious nanocomplexes. Notably, the topology and internal structure of the cyclooligosaccharide/pDNA co&#8208;assemblies can be molded by fine&#8208;tuning the valency and characteristics of the cationic and lipophilic patches, which strongly impacts the transfection efficacy  in vitro  and  in vivo  . Outstanding organ selectivities can then be programmed with no need of incorporating a biorecognizable motif in the formulation. The results provide a versatile strategy for the construction of fully synthetic and perfectly monodisperse nonviral gene delivery systems uniquely suited for optimization schemes by making cyclooligosaccharide patchiness the focus.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Driven Selective Formation of D2 Symmetric Octanuclear Organometallic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of organometallic half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III)&#8208; and rhodium(III)&#8208;based building blocks with asymmetric ambidentate pyridyl&#8208;carboxylate ligands. Despite the potential for obtaining a statistical mixture of multiple products,  D  2  symmetric octanuclear cages were formed selectively by taking advantage of the electronic effects emanating from the two types of chelating sites &#8213; (  O  ,  O&#8242;  ) and (  N  ,  N&#8242;  ) &#8213; on the tetranuclear building blocks. The metal sources and the lengths of bridging ligands show influence on the selectivity of the self&#8208;assembly. Experimental observations, supported by computational studies, suggest that the  D  2  symmetric cages are the thermodynamically favoured products. Overall, the results underline the importance of electronic effects on the selectivity of coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, and demonstrate that asymmetric ambidentate ligands can be used to control the design of discrete supramolecular coordination complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Relay&#8208;Heck Cross&#8208;Coupling Between Alkenyl Halides and Unsaturated Alcohols in the Synthesis of Open&#8208;Chain Analogues of Musk Odorant Vulcanolide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unactivated alkenyl iodides and bromides underwent an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed relay&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling with a whole range of alkenols of different chain lengths linking the alkene and the alcohol, affording unsaturated aldehydes and ketones in moderate to good yields. In contrast, alkenyl triflates were not suitable partners for this reaction. This methodology allowed for the preparation of open&#8208;chain analogues of the musk odorant Vulcanolide, several of which retained key olfactory properties of the parent molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilisation of [WVF4]+ by N&#8208; and P&#8208;Donor Ligands: Second&#8208;Order Jahn&#8208;Teller Effects in Octacoordinate d1 Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first isolated examples of cationic fluoridotungsten(V) complexes are reported as octacoordinate [WF  4  (L)  4  ]  +  (L = C  5  H  5  N, P(CH  3  )  3  ). The [WF  4  (NC  5  H  5  )  4  ]  +  cation is synthesised as its [O  3  SCF  3  ]  &#8211;  salt upon reaction of WF  5  (NC  5  H  5  )  2  with [(CH  3  )  3  Si(NC  5  H  5  )][O  3  SCF  3  ] in excess C  5  H  5  N, whereas [WF  4  {P(CH  3  )  3  }  4  ]  +  is accessed directly from WF  6  upon reaction with (CH  3  )  3  SiO  3  SCF  3  and excess P(CH  3  )  3  . These salts were characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and Raman spectroscopy in the solid state. New geometry indices for octacoordinate complexes (&#964;  8  and &#964;  8  &#8242;) are introduced, allowing for the facile differentiation of trigonal&#8208;dodecahedral (TD) and square&#8208;antiprismatic (SA) geometries. This has disambiguated the SA geometries of [WF  4  (L)  4  ]  +  and the geometries of a series of previously reported  d  0  and  d  1  MA  4  B  4  complexes. Computational (DFT&#8208;B3LYP) studies of [WF  4  (PH  3  )  4  ]  2+/+  and related model systems demonstrate the occurrence of a second&#8208;order Jahn&#8208;Teller (SOJT) distortion from TD in  d  0  complexes to SA in  d  1  complexes, with the degree of SOJT stabilisation being most significant in 5  d  complexes containing fluorido ligands and monodentate neutral donors.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Effects in Halogen and Hydrogen Bonding Mediated Electrochemical Anion Sensing in Aqueous Solution and at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensing anionic species in competitive aqueous media is a well&#8208;recognised challenge to long&#8208;term applications across a multitude of fields. Herein, we report a comprehensive investigation of the electrochemical anion sensing performance of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) bis&#8208;ferrocene&#8208;(iodo)triazole receptors in solution and at self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), in a range of increasingly competitive aqueous organic solvent media (ACN/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). In solution, the XB sensor notably outperforms the HB sensor, with substantial anion recognition induced cathodic voltammetric responses of the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple persisting even in highly competitive aqueous solvent media of 20% water content. The response to halides, in particular, shows a markedly lower sensitivity to increasing water content associated with a unique halide selectivity at unprecedented levels of solvent polarity. The HB sensor, in contrast, generally displayed a preference towards oxoanions. A significant surface&#8208;enhancement effect was observed for both XB/HB receptive films in all solvent systems, whereby the HB sensor generally displayed larger responses towards oxoanions than its halogen bonding analogue.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 2&#8208;indolyl&#8208;3&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)]quinoxalines with concomitant 1,2&#8208;silyl shift gives rise to the formation of 6&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines in moderate to excellent yield. These silylated heterocycles are readily transformed into 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines in moderate to good yield by one&#8208;pot ipso&#8208;iodination&#8208;Suzuki coupling synthesis. The title compounds represent a novel type of tunable luminophores. Structure&#8208;property relationships for 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines obtained by Hammett correlations with &#963;p+ substituent parameters indicate that emission maxima, Stokes shifts, and fluorescence quantum yields can be fine&#8208;tuned by the remote para&#8208;aryl substituent. Furthermore, indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines were found to exhibit interesting activities against medically relevant pathogens such as the Apicomplexa parasite Toxoplasma gondii with IC50 up to 0.67 &#177; 0.13 &#181;M. Therefore, these compounds are promising candidates for novel anti&#8208;parasitic therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Ligands in Dissolution of Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of new, environmentally benign dissolution methods for metallic gold is driven by needs in the circular economy. Gold is widely used in consumer electronics, but sustainable and selective dissolution methods for Au are scarce. Herein we describe a quantitative dissolution of gold in organic solution under mild conditions using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. In the dissolution reaction, two thiol ligands, pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;thiol and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole, work in a cooperative manner. The mechanistic investigations suggest that two pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;thiol molecules form a complex with Au0 that can be oxidized, while the role of inexpensive 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole is to stabilize the formed AuI species via a ligand exchange process. Under optimized conditions, the reaction proceeds vigorously and gold dissolves quantitatively in an hour. The demonstrated ligand exchange mechanism with two thiols allows us to drastically reduce the thiol consumption and may lead to even more effective gold dissolution methods in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive Characterization of the Self&#8208;folding Cavitand&#160; Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conformational equilibria and guest exchange process of a resorcin[4]arene derived self&#8208;folding cavitand receptor have been characterized in detail by molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and  1  H EXSY experiments. A multi&#8208;timescale strategy for exploring the fluxional behaviour of this system has been constructed, exploiting conventional MD and accelerated MD (aMD) techniques. The use of aMD allows the reconstruction of the folding/unfolding process of the receptor by sampling high&#8208;energy barrier processes unattainable by conventional MD simulations. We obtained MD trajectories sampling events occurring at different timescales from ns to s: 1) rearrangement of the directional hydrogen bond seam stabilizing the receptor, 2) folding/unfolding of the structure transiting partially open intermediates, and c) guest departure from different folding stages. Most remarkably, reweighing of the biased aMD simulations provided kinetic barriers that are in very good agreement with those determined experimentally by  1  H NMR. These results constitute the first comprehensive characterization of the complex dynamic features of cavitand receptors. Our approach emerges as a valuable rational design tool for synthetic host&#8208;guest systems</dc:description>

         <title>A Rapid and Mild Sulfation Strategy Reveals Conformational Preferences in Therapeutically Relevant Sulfated Xylooligosaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although sulfated xylooligosaccharides are promising therapeutic leads for a multitude of afflictions, the structural complexity and heterogeneity of commercially deployed forms (e.g. Pentosan polysulfate&#160;1) complicates their path to further clinical development. We describe herein the preparation of the largest homogeneous persulfated xylooligomers prepared to date&#8212;comprising up to eight xylose residues&#8212;as homogeneous standards for biological studies. Near quantitative sulfation was accomplished using a remarkably mild and operationally simple protocol which avoids the need for high temperatures and a large excess of the sulfating reagent. Moreover, the sulfated xylooligomer standards so obtained enabled definitive identification of a pyridinium contaminant in a sample of a commercially prepared Pentosan drug and provided significant insights into the conformational preferences of the constituent persulfated monosaccharide residues. As the spatial&#160;distribution of sulfates is a key determinant of the binding of sulfated oligosaccharides to endogenous targets, these findings have broad implications for the advancement of Pentosan&#8208;based treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity in Ligand Functionalization of Photocatalytic Metal Oxide Nanoparticles for Phase Transfer and Self&#8208;Assembly Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of photocatalytic metal oxide nanoparticles of TiO  2  , ZnO, WO  3  and CuO with amine&#8208;terminated (oleylamine) and thiol&#8208;terminated (1&#8208;dodecanethiol) alkyl chained ligands was studied under ambient conditions. A high selectivity was observed in the binding specificity of a ligand towards nanoparticles of these different oxides. It was observed that oleylamine binds stably to only TiO  2  and WO  3  , while 1&#8208;dodecanethiol binds stably only to ZnO and CuO. Similarly, polar to non&#8208;polar solvent phase transfer of TiO  2  and WO  3  nanoparticles could be achieved by using oleylamine, but not by 1&#8208;dodecanethiol, while the contrary holds for ZnO and CuO. The surface chemistry of ligand functionalized nanoparticles was probed by ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy, that enabled to elucidate the occupation of the ligands at the active sites. The photo&#8208;stability of the ligands on the nanoparticle surface was determined by the photocatalytic self&#8208;cleaning properties of the material. While TiO  2  and WO  3  degrade the ligands within 24 hours under both UV and visible light, ligands on ZnO and CuO remain unaffected. The gathered insights are also highly relevant from an application point of view. As an example, since the ligand functionalized nanoparticles are hydrophobic in nature, they can thus be self&#8208;assembled at the air&#8208;water interface, for obtaining nanoparticle films with demonstrated photocatalytic as well as anti&#8208;fogging properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Many studies on cerium compounds relate back to CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 when it comes to assigning the metal oxidation state and other ground&#8208;state wavefunction characteristics. It was therefore very important to establish, from first principles, how the ground states and the core&#8208;excited states in the different peaks exactly relate to each other. The Ce L3 edges in CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 have never been calculated without prior assumptions about the excited states or within an ab initio formalism that considers explicitly the differential wavefunction relaxation of the ground&#8208;states and the core&#8208;excited states.

The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and the local potentials that appear in the Euler equation for electron density as well as the corresponding electronic inner&#8208;crystal forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provide the detailed examination of C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A detailed analysis of a complete set of the local potentials that appear in the Euler equation for electron density is carried out for noncovalent interactions in the crystal of a uracil derivative using experimental X&#8208;ray charge density. The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and crystals and the local potentials and corresponding inner&#8208;crystal electronic forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Partitioning of crystal space into atomic basins and atomic&#8208;like potential basins led us to the definite description of interatomic interaction and charge transfer. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provided the detailed examination of &#960;&#8208;stacking and intricate C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds present in the crystal. The donor&#8208;acceptor character of these interactions is revealed by analysis of Pauli and von Weizs&#228;cker potentials together with well&#8208;known functions, e.&#8201;g., deformation electron density and electron localization function. In this way, our analysis throws light on aspects of these closed&#8208;shell interactions hitherto hidden from the description.

The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and crystals and the local potentials and corresponding inner&#8208;crystal electronic forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Partitioning of crystal space into atomic basins and atomic&#8208;like potential basins led us to the definite description of interatomic interaction and charge transfer. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provided the detailed examination of &#960;&#8208;stacking and intricate C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds present in the crystal. The donor&#8208;acceptor character of these interactions is revealed by analysis of Pauli and von Weizs&#228;cker potentials together with well&#8208;known functions, e.&#8201;g., deformation electron density and electron localization function. In this way, our analysis throws light on aspects of these closed&#8208;shell interactions hitherto hidden from the description.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reactions of C60 with Pyridazine and Phthalazine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The benzoannulation of pyridazine changes its electronic structure drastically, thus rendering the pericyclic reaction with C60 efficient. Theoretical calculations suggested that the reaction proceeds with normal electron demand in contrast to hitherto considered inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand pathway. Therefore, the enhanced reactivity could be explained by the better interaction between the LUMO of C60 and the HOMO of phthalazine.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;opened bisfulleroids are one of suitable building blocks for making a large hole on fullerenes. This work focuses on the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of C60 with azines, among synthetic methods developed thus far, to provide bisfulleroids. Surprisingly, the computational study predicted that the reaction proceeds with normal electron demand in contrast to hitherto considered inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand pathway. The benzoannulation to the pyridazine ring, i.&#8201;e., phthalazine, resulted in the remarkably shortened reaction time due to the better interaction between the HOMO of phthalazine and the LUMO of C60 as well as stronger 2,3&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene character in the phthalazine as confirmed crystallographically. Contrary to expectations, the benzobisfulleroid was converted into corresponding orifice&#8208;enlarged derivative via the photooxygenation slightly faster than the fulleroid derived from pyridazine.

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The puzzling two&#8208;peaked X&#8208;ray absorption structure at the Ce L3 edge provides a wealth of information about the electronic structure of Ce complexes, such as the Ce 4f occupation and oxidation state and the extent of metal&#8208;ligand covalency. Multiconfigurational wavefunction calculations of the Ce L3 edges in CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2, reveal the identity of the two&#8208;peaked edge structures and connection with the configurational admixture of the spectroscopically probed electronic states.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Chiral YbIII&#8208;Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active chiral near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescent field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet of YbIII at the solid&#8208;state was designed from the bridging of two Yb(facam)3 units with the bis(1,10&#8208;phenantro[5,6b])tetrathiafulvalene triad.







Abstract
A field&#8208;induced chiral YbIII Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) displayed an unprecedented near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescence (NIR&#8208;CPL) in the solid&#8208;state. The bridging bis(1,10&#8208;phenantro[5,6b])tetrathiafulvalene triad (L) allowed an efficient sensitization of the NIR 2F5/2&#8594;2F7/2 emission while the NIR&#8208;CPL is associated to the f&#8208;f transitions of the YbIII ion bearing chiral &#946;&#8208;diketonate derived&#8208;camphorate ancillary ligands.

         <title>Synthesis of Uniform Gold Nanorods with Large Width to Realize Ultralow SERS Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm were successfully synthesized by introducing heptanol molecules during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The array of vertically aligned Au NRs as SERS substrates can achieve the ultralow limit of detection (LOD) (10&#8722;16&#8197;M for CV probes) with good reliability and reproducibility. Thanks to their LOD, they can be used for rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances with an ultralow concentration.







Abstract
In this work, we successfully demonstrate high&#8208;yield synthesis of high&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm by introducing heptanol molecules as secondary templating agents during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The results show that an appropriate concentration of heptanol molecules not only alter the micellization behavior of CTAB in water, but also help silver ions impact the symmetry&#8208;breaking efficiency of additional Au&#8722;NP seeds in addition to enhancing the utilization of gold precursors. Moreover, the generality and versatility of the present strategy for synthesis of Au NRs with flexible controlled dimensions are further demonstrated by successful synthesis of Au NRs with the assistance of other fatty alcohols with properly long alkyl chains. Furthermore, when arrays of vertically aligned Au NRs with large width (AVA&#8722;Au120&#215;90 NRs) are used as SERS substrates, they can achieve the ultralow limit of detection for crystal violet (10&#8722;16&#8197;M) with good reliability and reproducibility, and the rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances.

         <title>Structural Effects of Incorporation of 2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2'2'&#8208;Difluorodeoxycytidine (Gemcitabine) in A&#8208; and B&#8208;Form Duplexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (gemcitabine) is an adaptable nucleotide derivative that can adopt a North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA (B&#8208;form helix), or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids (A&#8208;form helix).







Abstract
We report the structural effect of 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (dFdC) insertions in the DNA strand of a DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid duplex and in a self&#8208;complementary DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA duplex. In both cases, the modification slightly destabilizes the duplex and provokes minor local distortions that are more pronounced in the case of the DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid. Analysis of the solution structures determined by NMR methods show that dFdC is an adaptable derivative that adopts North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA, or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids. In this latter context, South sugar pucker favors the formation of a 2'F&#8901;&#8901;H8 attractive interaction with a neighboring purine, which compensates the destabilizing effect of base pair distortions. These interactions share some features with pseudohydrogen bonds described previously in other nucleic acids structures with fluorine modified sugars.

     alt="Structural Effects of Incorporation of 2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2'2'&#8208;Difluorodeoxycytidine (Gemcitabine) in A&#8208; and B&#8208;Form Duplexes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine&lt;/b&gt; (gemcitabine) is an adaptable nucleotide derivative that can adopt a North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA (B&#8208;form helix), or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids (A&#8208;form helix).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the structural effect of 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (dFdC) insertions in the DNA strand of a DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid duplex and in a self&#8208;complementary DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA duplex. In both cases, the modification slightly destabilizes the duplex and provokes minor local distortions that are more pronounced in the case of the DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid. Analysis of the solution structures determined by NMR methods show that dFdC is an adaptable derivative that adopts North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA, or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids. In this latter context, South sugar pucker favors the formation of a 2'F&#8901;&#8901;H8 attractive interaction with a neighboring purine, which compensates the destabilizing effect of base pair distortions. These interactions share some features with pseudohydrogen bonds described previously in other nucleic acids structures with fluorine modified sugars.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective addition of silylboronates to unsymmetric internal alkynes has been developed for the synthesis of structurally defined tetrasubstituted alkenes. A variety of unactivated alkynes can be employed with high selectivity under simple and mild conditions and the resulting products have been further functionalized by utilizing silyl and boryl groups on the alkene.







Abstract
As a new and complementary method for the synthesis of structurally defined tetrasubstituted alkenes, a copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective addition of silylboronates to unsymmetric internal alkynes has been developed. A variety of unactivated alkynes can be employed with high selectivity under simple and mild conditions, and the resulting products have been further functionalized by utilizing silyl and boryl groups on the alkene.

         <title>Accelerating H2 Evolution by Anodic Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines in Water over Co3O4 Nanoribbon Arrays Decorated Nickel Foam</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation conversion based on a cobalt electrocatalyst was employed to accelerate hydrogen evolution in water. The Co3O4 nanoribbon arrays modified nickel foam anode provided rich active sites for the transformation of tetrahydroisoquinolines into various value&#8208;added dihydroisoquinolines. Electro&#8208;activated higher&#8208;valent cobalt and plenty of surface oxygen species were responsible for promoting the electrocatalytic oxidation.







Abstract
Coupling the H2 evolution reaction in water with thermodynamically favorable organic oxidation reactions is highly desirable, because it can enhance the energy conversion efficiency compared with electrocatalytic water splitting, and produce value&#8208;added chemicals instead of O2 in the anodic reaction. Herein, Co3O4 nanoribbon arrays in&#8197;situ grown on nickel foam (Co3O4@NF) was employed as an effective electrocatalyst for the selective oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs). Various value&#8208;added semi&#8208;dehydrogenation products including dihydroisoquinolines with electro&#8208;deficient or &#8208;rich groups could be obtained with moderate yields and faradaic efficiencies. Benefitting from the rich surface active sites of Co3O4@NF, a two&#8208;electrode (Co3O4@NF||Pt) electrolytic system drove a benchmark current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage as low as 1.446&#8197;V in 1.0&#8197;M KOH aqueous solution containing 0.02&#8197;M THIQ, which was reduced by 174&#8197;mV in comparison with that of overall water splitting.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Chiroptical Properties of Indolo&#8208; and Pyridopyrrolo&#8208;Carbazole&#8208;Based C2&#8208;Symmetric Azahelicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azahelicenes bearing an indolocarbazole backbone were prepared by a step&#8208;economic double dehydrogenative cyclization under palladium catalysis. Their optical resolutions were attained by chiral HPLC. The pyridopyrrolo derivative (X=N, R=H) was found to show ca. 6 times larger dissymmetry factors than those of the parent azahelicene (X=CH, R=H) in both CD and CPL measurements. The CPL color could be switched by addition of an acid or introduction of a donor substituent R.







Abstract
Treatment of 11,12&#8208;bis(1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl or 6&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole with an oxidizing system of Pd(II)/Ag(I) induced effective double dehydrogenative cyclization to afford the corresponding &#960;&#8208;extended azahelicenes. The optical resolutions were readily achieved by a preparative chiral HPLC. It was found that the pyridopyrrolo&#8208;carbazole&#8208;based azahelicene that contains four nitrogen atoms exhibits ca. 6 times larger dissymmetry factors both in circularly dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), |gCD| and |gCPL| values being 1.1&#215;10&#8722;2 and 4.4&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively, as compared with the parent indolocarbazole&#8208;based azahelicene. Theoretical calculations at the RI&#8208;CC2 level were employed to rationalize the observed enhanced chiroptical responses. The (chir)optical properties of the former helicene was further tuned by a protonation leading to remarkable red&#8208;shift with a considerable enhancement of the |gCPL| value.

         <title>Iridoid Sex Pheromone Biosynthesis in Aphids Mimics Iridoid&#8208;Producing Plants</title>

Natural product biosynthesis in animals: Chemical synthesis of isotopically&#8208;labelled molecular probes and topical application using female pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, are deployed along with coupled GC&#8208;mass spectrometry (GC&#8208;MS) to show that biosynthesis of the female&#8208;produced aphid sex pheromone components (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactol (1) and (4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactone (2) may follow a broadly similar route to that characterized for plants.







Abstract
Biosynthesis of (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactol (1) and (4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactone (2) in plants involves iridoid synthase (ISY), an atypical reductive cyclase that catalyses the reduction of 8&#8208;oxogeranial into the reactive enol of (S)&#8208;8&#8208;oxocitronellal, and cyclization of this enol intermediate, either non&#8208;enzymatically or by a nepetalactol&#8208;related short chain dehydrogenase enzyme (NEPS) that yields the nepetalactols. In this study, we investigated the biosynthesis in&#8197;vivo of 1 and 2 in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, using a library of isotopically&#8208;labelled monoterpenoids as molecular probes. Topical application of deuterium&#8208;labelled probes synthesized from geraniol and nerol resulted in production of 2H4&#8722;lactol 1 and 2H4&#8722;lactone 2. However, deuterium incorporation was not evident using labelled probes synthesized from (S)&#8208;citronellol. These results suggest that iridoid biosynthesis in animals, specifically aphids, may follow a broadly similar route to that characterised for plants.

In this study, we investigated the biosynthesis &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vivo&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in the pea aphid, &lt;i&gt;Acyrthosiphon pisum&lt;/i&gt;, using a library of isotopically&#8208;labelled monoterpenoids as molecular probes. Topical application of deuterium&#8208;labelled probes synthesized from geraniol and nerol resulted in production of &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;lactol &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;lactone &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. However, deuterium incorporation was not evident using labelled probes synthesized from (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)&#8208;citronellol. These results suggest that iridoid biosynthesis in animals, specifically aphids, may follow a broadly similar route to that characterised for plants.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reactions on a 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl Moiety of a Fullerene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety embedded in a cage&#8208;opened fullerene C60 derivative was examined to produce &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl, and acid anhydride compounds. The former two showed a significantly supressed encapsulation/escape dynamics of a water molecule as well as electrochemical properties largely different from the last one.







Abstract
A 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety on a cage&#8208;opened fullerene skeleton is one of suitable building blocks for the further derivatization. Herein, we discuss the chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compound into &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, acid anhydride, and &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl derivatives. Despite possessing a sterically small methylene unit in the last one, the release of an encapsulated water molecule was significantly supressed whereas the &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide bearing three bulky p&#8208;tolyl groups on the P&#8208;atom enabled the faster insertion/release dynamics, implying the flexibility of the phosphonium substituent. The replacement of the carbonyl group with phosphorus ylide and methylene units largely varied electrochemical properties of the fullerene skeleton, likely arising from the anionic charge delocalized over the entire molecule and removal of an electron&#8208;withdrawable carbonyl group, respectively.

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase Co&#8722;C Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crucial resistance of aryl&#8208;cobalamins, as antivitamins B12, against metabolic conversion into B12 cofactors has been traced to their presumed strong organometallic bond. The strength of the Co&#8722;C bond of aryl&#8208;cobinamides was examined here by ESI&#8208;MS threshold collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Surprisingly, the Co&#8722;C
 bonds of these aryl&#8208;corrins were less strong than the Co&#8722;C
 bond in their methyl analogue, revealing the relevance of non&#8208;bonded interactions.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, the stereo&#8208;structure of which was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;MS threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, for the two &#946;&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the corresponding &#945;&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of the Co&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDE of Co&#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mononuclear lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have progressively evolved in recent years. Lanthanide alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry offers a modular design approach to study the relaxation dynamics of high&#8208;performing SMMs. Alkoxide and aryloxide ligands on a single axis at a DyIII ion enhances the magnetic anisotropy and the barrier to magnetic reversal (Ueff). Leading examples of DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs are reviewed. The focus is on mononuclear DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid&#8208;state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear TbIII, HoIII, ErIII and YbIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.

         <title>Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>

Sticky scaffolds: The state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.







Abstract
Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell&#8208;surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, valency and spatial organisation of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere with such interactions and blocks bacterial or viral adhesion and entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. Herein, the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.

         <title>Tunable Light&#8208;Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Golden carbene emitter systems: N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes that efficiently emit in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum are reported. A first example of a solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting device has been realized for this class of gold(III) complexes, revealing unique opportunities presented by these highly efficient gold(III) carbene emitter systems.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes was investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N)=5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL=456&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL=516&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43&#8201;% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266&#8197;&#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr=103&#8211;104&#8197;s&#8722;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best&#8208;performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited&#8208;state nature of these complexes. The calculations showed a significant contribution of the gold(III) metal center in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of up to 18&#8201;%, which was found to be unique for this class of cyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated by using a solution process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.

N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes: Highly efficient photoluminescence was achieved in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum using strong s&#8208;donating cyclometalated NHC ligands and a dianionic (N&#8201;N)&#8208;type bidentate as the ancillary ligand. Detailed photophysical investigations supported by density functional theory calculations provide insights into the excited&#8208;state properties of this new class of emitter molecules. The realization of the first solution&#8208;processable OLED device based on these strongly luminescent gold(III) carbene emitter systems opens up exciting new opportunities in light emitting applications.

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic Degradability</title>

Bioelectronics: Processing of additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride is demonstrated, and biological implications like cell compatibility and enzymatic degradability are investigated.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, a method was developed for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions were investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells was observed up to concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis was investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggested that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS2 and h&#8208;BN were degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibited slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of the Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubling up: The synthesis and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations of Fe&#8208;doped, lead&#8208;free dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals for photodetector applications are presented. The results of systematic investigation of the crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of these materials are discussed.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as stable and non&#8208;toxic alternatives to Pb&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskites are reported that display blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of the Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites were investigated systematically. Formation of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. XRD and thermo&#8208;gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380&#8197;nm. It extends up to 700&#8197;nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;band gap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the time&#8208;correlated single&#8208;photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV/Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential optoelectronics devices fabrication and photocatalytic applications.

It extends up to 700&#8197;nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;band gap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the time&#8208;correlated single&#8208;photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double perovskites predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV/Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential optoelectronics devices fabrication and photocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Dual C&#8722;C Coupling Reaction via Site Selective Cascade Formation by PdII&#8208;Cryptate of an Amino&#8208;Ether Heteroditopic Macrobicycle</title>

         <dc:description>
PdII catalysed site selective dual C&#8722;C Coupling in the presence of heteroditopic macrobicycle was achieved to synthesize symmetrical and unsymmetrical conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes.







Abstract
Selectivity of aryl iodo over ethynyl iodo toward the Suzuki cross coupling reaction is explored by utilizing a palladium complex of amino&#8208;ether heteroditopic macrobicycle. Subsequently, unreacted ethynyl iodide undergoes homocoupling reaction in the same catalytic atmosphere, thereby representing a cascade dual C&#8722;C coupling reaction. Furthermore, this approach is extended for novel one&#8208;pot synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;diynes.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Multifunctional Blue&#8208;Emitting Materials Based on Phenanthroimidazole Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deeper blue: On the basis of multifunctional phenanthroimidazole&#8208;based material PTPBPTA, which acts both as a deep&#8208;blue fluorescent emitter and as a host material for phosphors, high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs, and a white OLED were fabricated.







Abstract
High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 5&#8201;% are still scarce in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this work, by introducing a [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit at the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole (PI), two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPTPA, were obtained. Systematic photophysical analysis showed that the TP block is suitable for constructing hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) emitters. Its moderate electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the additional phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increased the oscillator strength, but also decreased the Stokes shift. TDDFT calculations pointed out facile reverse intersystem crossing processes in PTPTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. A nondoped device based on PTPTPA as emitter showed impressive performance with EQEmax of 7.11&#8201;% and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.09). At the same time, it was also an efficient host for yellow and red phosphorescent OLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dyes into PTPTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85&#8201;% was achieved. The successful design of PTPTPA not only provided an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrated the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.

Fit in the groove: Hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains are prepared. Space&#8208;demanding side chains introduced into the 7&#8208;position of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA and have a positive impact on helix stability.







Abstract
The Watson&#8211;Crick coding system depends on the molecular recognition of complementary purine and pyrimidine bases. Now, the construction of hybrid DNAs with Watson&#8211;Crick and purine&#8211;purine base pairs decorated with dendritic side chains was performed. Oligonucleotides with single and multiple incorporations of 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyguanosine, its tripropargylamine derivative, and 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine were synthesized. Duplex stability decreased if single modified purine&#8211;purine base pairs were inserted, but increased if pyrene residues were introduced by click chemistry. A growing number of consecutive 5&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deazaguanine&#8211;isoguanine base pairs led to strong stepwise duplex stabilization, a phenomenon not observed for the guanine&#8211;isoguanine base pair. Spacious residues are well accommodated in the large groove of purine&#8211;purine DNA tracts. Changes to the global helical structure monitored by circular dichroism spectroscopy show the impact of functionalization to the global double&#8208;helix structure. This study explores new areas of molecular recognition realized by purine base pairs that are complementary in hydrogen bonding, but not in size, relative to canonical pairs.

It can act as a high&#8208;efficiency deep blue emitter as well as an efficient host material for yellow (the color of the bull in the image) and red (the festive color, indicating the coming of the Spring Festival) phosphors. Combining the blue fluorescence and yellow or red phosphorescence produced high&#8208;performance WOLED, which emits white light as the color of the external circle.

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ce L3 X&#8208;ray absorption spectra of CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 are calculated with relativistic multiconfigurational wavefunction approaches. Calculated spectra are in excellent agreement with experiments. The metal oxidation state in the ground vs. the core&#8208;excited states, and the experimental 4f electron count derived spectroscopically, are fully rationalized.







Abstract
The Ce L3 edge XAS spectra of CeO2 and cerocene [Ce(C8H8)2] were calculated with relativistic ab&#8208;initio multireference wavefunction approaches capable of reproducing the observed spectra accurately. The study aims to resolve the decades&#8208;long puzzle regarding the relationship between the number and relative intensities of the XAS peaks and the 4f electron occupation in the ground state (GS) versus the core&#8208;excited states (ESs). CeO2 and cerocene exemplify the different roles of covalent bonding and wavefunction configurational composition in the observed intensity patterns. Good agreement is found between the calculated GS 4f&#8208;shell occupations and the value derived from XAS measurements using peak areas (nf). The identity of the two&#8208;peaked Ce L3 edge is fully rationalized from the perspective of the relaxed wavefunctions for the GS and core ESs. The states underlying the different peaks differ from each other in a surprisingly simple way that can be associated with 4f1 vs. 4f0 sub&#8208;configurations. Furthermore, part of one of the cerocene spectral peaks is associated with 4f2 sub&#8208;configurations. The pattern therefore reveals excited states that can be interpreted in terms of Ce&#8201;IV and III oxidation numbers, as long assumed, with Ce&#8201;II states additionally appearing in the cerocene spectrum. While this work demonstrates the rough accuracy of the conventional approach to determining nf from Ce L3&#8208;edge XAS, limitations are highlighted in terms of the ultimate accuracy of this approach and the potential of observing new types of excited states. The need to determine the sources of nf by calculations, is stressed.

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;containing compounds are widely used in different applications owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of the C&#8722;F bond on the conformational preference when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems will be discussed through presentation of the most recent applications.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties. A particularly interesting feature is the impact of fluorine substitution on the relative orientation of a C&#8722;F bond when incorporated into organic molecules. In this Review, we will be discussing the conformational behavior of fluorinated aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole, dipole&#8208;dipole, and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in detail. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.

         <title>Designed Construction of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt Heterojunctions with Boosted Photocatalytic H2 Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalyst is designed with consideration of heterojunction band matching and porous structure. The SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction using Pt as the co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. It is proposed that the presence of SrSO4 provides extra channels for electron transportation as well as promoting photocatalytic activity.







Abstract
Efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs is a crucial factor for high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. Effective electron&#8211;hole separation and migration could be achieved by heterojunctions with suitable band structures. Herein, a porous SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction is prepared by a sol&#8208;gel method at room temperature followed by an annealing process. XRD characterization suggests high crystallinity of the heterostructure. A well&#8208;defined interface between the two phases is confirmed by high&#8208;resolution (HR)TEM. The photocatalytic H2 evolution productivity of the SrTiO3/SrSO4 heterojunction with Pt as co&#8208;catalyst reaches 396.82&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is 16&#8197;times higher than that of SrTiO3/Pt. The boosted photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3/SrSO4/Pt can be ascribed to the presence of SrSO4, which promotes the transfer and migration of photogenerated carriers by forming the heterojunction and porous structure, which provides a large amount of active sites. This novel porous heterostructure brings new ideas for the development of high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts for H2 release.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches to Selenoesters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selenoesters are an important class of compounds that have wide possibilities for chemical transformations, being considered excellent building blocks for the synthesis of more complex molecules. In this review, an overview of the available methods for the synthesis of selenoesters will be presented. This overview is hoped to serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new strategies for the synthesis of this type of compound, as well as for their use as building blocks in synthesis.







Abstract
Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.

         <title>Specific Ion&#8211;Protein Interactions Influence Bacterial Ice Nucleation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effects of ions on bacterial ice nucleation: Freezing droplet experiments, sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy, and molecular dynamic simulations were used to demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. The different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with ice&#8208;nucleating proteins on the surface of the bacteria.







Abstract
Ice nucleation&#8208;active bacteria are the most efficient ice nucleators known, enabling the crystallization of water at temperatures close to 0&#8201;&#176;C, thereby overcoming the kinetically hindered phase transition process at these conditions. Using highly specialized ice&#8208;nucleating proteins (INPs), they can cause frost damage to plants and influence the formation of clouds and precipitation in the atmosphere. In nature, the bacteria are usually found in aqueous environments containing ions. The impact of ions on bacterial ice nucleation efficiency, however, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. Weakly hydrated ions inhibit bacterial ice nucleation whereas strongly hydrated ions apparently facilitate ice nucleation. Surface&#8208;specific sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with the INPs on the surface of the bacteria. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous ice nucleation facilitated by bacteria strongly depends upon the nature of the ions, and specific ion&#8211;protein interactions are essential for the complete description of heterogeneous ice nucleation by bacteria.

         <title>Metal Cation Valency Dependence in Morphology Evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS Nanodisk Seeds and Their Pseudomorphic Cation Exchanges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin cation valency&#8208;dependent morphology evolution of Cu2&#8722;xS nanodisk seeds was initially developed. Subsequent pseudomorphic full/partial cation exchanges with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce traditionally inaccessible nanostructures were reported as well.







Abstract
A crucial parameter in the design of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) with controllable optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties is the morphology. Herein, we demonstrate the potential of additive metal cations with variable valency to direct the morphology evolution of copper&#8208;deficient Cu2&#8722;xS nanoparticles in the process of seed&#8208;mediated growth. In particular, the djurleite Cu1.94S seed could evolve from disk into tetradecahedron in the presence of tin(IV) cations, whereas they merely formed sharp hexagonal nanodisks with tin(II) cations. In addition to djurleite Cu1.94S, the tin(IV) cations could be generalized to direct the growth of roxbyite Cu1.8S and covellite CuS nanodisk seeds into tetradecahedra. We further perform pseudomorphic cation exchanges of Cu1.94S tetradecahedra with Zn2+ and Cd2+ to produce polyhedral zinc sulfide (ZnS) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) NPs. Moreover, we achieve Cu1.8S/ZnS and Cu1.94S/CdS tetradecahedral heterostructures via partial cation exchange, which are otherwise inaccessible by traditional synthetic approaches.

         <title>Overview of N&#8208;Rich Antennae Investigated in Lanthanide&#8208;Based Temperature Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncontact temperature sensors are gaining importance. Lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out as they benefit form for example, high photostability. In this Review, an extensive overview on N&#8208;rich antennae used in lanthanide based temperature sensing is provided. The potential of N&#8208;rich small molecules, bi&#8208;and polynuclear complexes, metal organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers are discussed.







Abstract
The market share of noncontact temperature sensors is expending due to fast technological and medical evolutions. In the wide variety of noncontact sensors, lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors stand out. They benefit from high photostability, relatively long decay times and high quantum yields. To circumvent their low molar light absorption, the incorporation of a light&#8208;harvesting antenna is required. This Review provides an overview of the nitrogen&#8208;rich antennae in lanthanide&#8208;based temperature sensors, emitting in the visible light spectrum, and discusses their temperature sensor ability. The N&#8208;rich ligands are incorporated in many different platforms. The investigation of different antennae is required to develop temperature sensors with diverse optical properties and to create a diverse offer for the multiple application fields. Molecular probes, consisting of small molecules, are first discussed. Furthermore, the thermometer properties of ratiometric temperature sensors, based on di&#8208; and polynuclear complexes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, periodic mesoporous organosilicas and porous organic polymers, are summarized. The antenna mainly determines the application potential of the ratiometric thermometer. It can be observed that molecular probes are operational in the broad physiological range, metal&#8211;organic frameworks are generally very useful in the cryogenic region, periodic mesoporous organosilica show temperature dependency in the physiological range, and porous organic polymers are operative in the cryogenic&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature range.

         <title>Biological and Medical Applications of Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles are well suited to transport organic or biological molecules into cells and tissue. They are well tolerated by cells and organisms and have a clearly defined degradation pathway, also due to their almost ubiquitous presence in the body. Promising applications for them are seen in drug and gene delivery and also in immunization, for example, for vaccination. This Review explores the synthesis, characterization, functionalization and biomedical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles from the recent literature.







Abstract
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, for example, bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, for example, against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.
