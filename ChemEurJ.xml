      <title>Between Aromatic and Quinoid Structure: A symmetric UV to Vis/NIR Benzothiadiazole Redox&#8208;Switch</title>
      <dc:description>Reversibly switching the light absorption of organic molecules by redox processes is of interest for applications in sensors, light harvesting, smart materials, and medical diagnostics. Here, we present a symmetric benzothiadiazole (BTD) derivative with a high fluorescence quantum yield in solution and in the crystalline state and show by spectroelectrochemical analysis that reversible switching of UV&#8208;absorption in the neutral state, to broad&#8208;band Vis/NIR absorption in the 1st oxidized state, to sharp band Vis absorption in the 2nd oxidized state, is possible. For the one&#8208;electron oxidized species, formation of a delocalized radical is confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroelectrochemistry. Furthermore, our results reveal an increasing quinoidal distortion upon the 1st and 2nd oxidation, which can be used as the leitmotif for the development of BTD based redox switches.</dc:description>

      <title>Saccharide Recognition by a Three Arm&#8208;Shaped Host Having Preorganized Three&#8208;Dimensional Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Sites</title>
      <dc:description>Generally, cage&#8208;shaped hosts for saccharides can strongly bind to guest molecules owing to the three&#8208;dimensional preorganized hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites. However, the preparation of cage molecules is often difficult due to the low&#8208;yield macrocyclization step. Here, we report a three arm&#8208;shaped molecule possessing pyridine&#8211;acetylene&#8211;phenol units as a new kind of host having a preorganized three&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonding site. This three arm&#8208;shaped host was readily prepared compared to a cage&#8208;shaped analogue. This host associated with lipophilic glycosides to form chiral complexes, and the association constants were sufficiently high as well as those of the cage&#8208;shaped one.

      <title>Enzymatic formation of indolactam scaffold by C&#8208;N bond&#8208;forming cytochrome P450 oxidases in teleocidin biosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Teleocidins are potent&#160; protein kinase C activators, &#160;and possess a unique indole&#8208;fused nine&#8208;membered lactam structure. Teleocidin biosynthesis&#160;&#160;starts from the formation of a dipeptide by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), followed by oxidative C&#8208;N bond formation by a cytochrome P450&#160; oxidase , reverse&#8208;prenylation by a prenyltransferase, and methylation&#8208;initiated terpene cyclization by a&#160;  C  &#8208;methyltransferase. This minireview focuses on recent research progress toward the&#160; elucidation of the molecular basis for&#160; the remarkable P450&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8208;N bond forming reaction, which is challenging in synthetic chemistry, to generate the indolactam scaffold. In addition, precursor directed biosynthesis with the promiscuous P450 enzymes led to the formation of a series of unnatural and novel molecular scaffolds, including a sulfur&#8208;substituted indolactam with a different conformation from that of indolactam V.</dc:description>

Teleocidin biosynthesis&#160;&#160;starts from the formation of a dipeptide by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), followed by oxidative C&#8208;N bond formation by a cytochrome P450&#160; oxidase , reverse&#8208;prenylation by a prenyltransferase, and methylation&#8208;initiated terpene cyclization by a&#160;  C  &#8208;methyltransferase. This minireview focuses on recent research progress toward the&#160; elucidation of the molecular basis for&#160; the remarkable P450&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular C&#8208;N bond forming reaction, which is challenging in synthetic chemistry, to generate the indolactam scaffold. In addition, precursor directed biosynthesis with the promiscuous P450 enzymes led to the formation of a series of unnatural and novel molecular scaffolds, including a sulfur&#8208;substituted indolactam with a different conformation from that of indolactam V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Imidazolium Substituted Cp Ligands and their Ru Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Ligand design and application: The synthesis of electron&#8208;poor imidazolium substituted Cp&#8208;ylides is presented. Their electronic properties are elucidated based on NMR spectroscopy, DFT and reactivity studies. The first &#951;5&#8208;Cp coordination of electron&#8208;poor cationic ylides is confirmed by X&#8208;ray structure analyses and an equilibrium for the coordination of a Cp ligand is observed. Electrochemical investigations of the ligands and of the ruthenocenes quantify the decreasing donor properties with increasing number of imidazolium substituents.







Abstract
The synthesis of electron&#8208;poor mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri(imidazolium)&#8208;substituted Cp&#8208;ylides is presented and their electronic properties are discussed based on NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray structure analyses, electrochemical investigations and DFT calculations as well as by their reactivity toward [Ru(CH3CN)3Cp*](PF6). With mono&#8208; and di(imidazolium)&#8208;substituted cyclopentadienides the respective monocationic and dicationic ruthenocences are formed (X&#8208;ray), whereas tri(imidazolium) cyclopentadienides are too electron&#8208;poor to form the ruthenocenes. Cyclic voltammetric analysis of the ruthenocenes shows reversible oxidation at a potential that increases with every additional electron&#8208;withdrawing imidazolium substituent at the Cp ligand by 0.53&#8211;0.55&#8197;V in an electrolyte based on a weakly coordinating anion. A reversible oxidation can be observed for the free 1,3&#8208;disubstituted ligand as well.

      <title>Divergent Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Amino Acid and &#947;&#8208;Lactam Derivatives from meso&#8208;Glutaric Anhydrides</title>
      <dc:description>
Desymmetrisation: A divergent synthetic strategy to access both &#947;&#8208;amino acid and &#947;&#8208;lactam derivatives by treatment of meso&#8208;glutaric anhydrides with TMSN3 is reported (see scheme).







Abstract
The first divergent synthesis of both &#947;&#8208;amino acid and &#947;&#8208;lactam derivatives from meso&#8208;glutaric anhydrides is described. The organocatalytic desymmetrisation with TMSN3 relies on controlled generation of a nucleophilic ammonium azide species mediated by a polystyrene&#8208;bound base to promote efficient silylazidation. After Curtius rearrangement of the acyl azide intermediate to access the corresponding isocyanate, hydrolysis/alcoholysis provided uniformly high yields of &#947;&#8208;amino acids and their N&#8208;protected counterparts. The same intermediates were shown to undergo an unprecedented decarboxylation&#8211;cyclisation cascade in situ to provide synthetically useful yields of &#947;&#8208;lactam derivatives without using any further activating agents. Mechanistic insights invoke the intermediacy of an unconventional &#947;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (&#947;&#8208;NCA) in the latter process. Among the examples prepared using this transformation are 8&#8197;APIs/molecules of considerable medicinal interest.

      <title>Protein&#8208;Templated Hit Identification through an Ugi Four&#8208;Component Reaction
</title>
      <dc:description>
Screening fast: The Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) is introduced as a novel reaction in kinetic&#8208;target guided synthesis (KTGS). Novel inhibitors of a model enzyme (aspartic protease endothiapepsin) and new binders of the emerging antibacterial target (&#946;&#8208;sliding clamp DnaN) were successfully identified. This new technique enables a rapid screening of a large number of compounds in early drug discovery.







Abstract
Kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis represents an efficient hit&#8208;identification strategy, in which the protein assembles its own inhibitors from a pool of complementary building blocks via an irreversible reaction. Herein, we pioneered an in situ Ugi reaction for the identification of novel inhibitors of a model enzyme and binders for an important drug target, namely, the aspartic protease endothiapepsin and the bacterial &#946;&#8208;sliding clamp DnaN, respectively. Highly sensitive mass&#8208;spectrometry methods enabled monitoring of the protein&#8208;templated reaction of four complementary reaction partners, which occurred in a background&#8208;free manner for endothiapepsin or with a clear amplification of two binders in the presence of DnaN. The Ugi products we identified show low micromolar activity on endothiapepsin or moderate affinity for the &#946;&#8208;sliding clamp. We succeeded in expanding the portfolio of chemical reactions and biological targets and demonstrated the efficiency and sensitivity of this approach, which can find application on any drug target.

      <title>Synthetically Versatile Nitrogen Acyclic Carbene stabilized Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have received significant attention as gold nanoparticle stabilizers due to their strong binding affinity towards gold. However, their tunability is limited by the difficulty in obtaining nonsymmetric NHCs.

      <title>Tuning the Thermal Stability and Photoisomerization of Azoheteroarenes through Macrocycle Strain</title>
      <dc:description>Azobenzene and its derivatives are one of the most&#8208;widespread molecular scaffolds in a range of modern applications, as well as in fundamental research. After photoexcitation, azo&#8208;based photoswitches revert back to the most stable isomer in a timescale ( [[EQUATION]] ) that determines the range of potential applications. Attempts to bring [[EQUATION]] to extreme values prompted to the development of azobenzene and azoheteroarene derivatives that either rebalance the E&#8208; and Z&#8208; isomer stabilities, or exploit unconventional thermal isomerization mechanisms. In the former case, one successful strategy has been the creation of macrocycle strain, which tends to impact the E/Z stability asymmetrically, and thus significantly modify [[EQUATION]] . On the bright side, bridged derivatives have shown an improved optical switching owing to the higher quantum yields and absence of degradation. However, in most (if not all) cases, bridged derivatives display a  reversed  thermal stability (more stable Z&#8208;isomer), and smaller [[EQUATION]] than the acyclic counterparts, which restricts their potential interest to applications requiring a fast forward and backwards switch. In this paper, we investigate the impact of alkyl bridges to the thermal stability of phenyl&#8208;azoheteroarenes using computational methods, and we reveal that is indeed possible to combine such improved photo&#8208;switching characteristics while preserving the  regular  thermal stability (more stable E&#8208;isomer), and increased [[EQUATION]] values under the appropriate connectivity and bridge length.</dc:description>

However, in most (if not all) cases, bridged derivatives display a  reversed  thermal stability (more stable Z&#8208;isomer), and smaller [[EQUATION]] than the acyclic counterparts, which restricts their potential interest to applications requiring a fast forward and backwards switch. In this paper, we investigate the impact of alkyl bridges to the thermal stability of phenyl&#8208;azoheteroarenes using computational methods, and we reveal that is indeed possible to combine such improved photo&#8208;switching characteristics while preserving the  regular  thermal stability (more stable E&#8208;isomer), and increased [[EQUATION]] values under the appropriate connectivity and bridge length.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Synthetic Tigliane Intermediates Engage Thiols to Induce Potent Cell Line Selective Anti&#8208;Cancer Activity</title>
      <dc:description>
Advanced synthetic intermediates en route to D&#8208;ring inverted non&#8208;natural tiglianes display higher potency (e.g. MM96L and CAL27) as compared to natural tigliane esters, especially when moving away from PKC&#8208;activation sensitive cancer cell lines (e.g. MCF7).







Abstract
The tigliane ring system, which encompasses iconic members such as phorbol and TPA, is widely renowned due to numerous observations of displaying potent biological activity, and subsequent use as mainstream biochemical tools. Traditionally, naturally occurring phorboids are regarded as tumor promotors through PKC activation, although in recent times more highly oxidized natural derivatives have been identified as anti&#8208;tumor agents. In the view that only limited synthetic investigations toward skeletal stereochemical modification have been undertaken, non&#8208;natural systems could be useful for a better understanding of the tigliane pharmacophore via interrogation of cellular sensitivity. In this context the concise construction of a number of highly functionalized non&#8208;natural D&#8208;ring inverted phorbol esters were synthesized, via a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+3] cycloaddition, and biologically evaluated using a range of cancer cell lines. The biological results highlight the notion that subtle changes in structure have dramatic effects on potency. Furthermore, although the non&#8208;natural derivatives did not outcompete the natural systems in the PKC&#8208;activation sensitive MCF7 cancer cell line, they outperformed in other cancer cell lines (MM96L and CAL27). This observation strongly suggested an alternate mode of action not involving activation of PKC, but instead involves thiol addition as indicated by glutathione addition and NF&#8208;&#954;B reporter activity.

Enzymatically synthesised cellodextrins are known to have limited water solubility beyond DP9, a point at which they self&#8208;assemble into particles resembling the antiparallel cellulose II crystalline packing.

The structural characterisation of these materials at different length scales, combining advanced NMR and microscopy methods, showed that a 6&#8208;fluorinated donor substrate yielded multiply 6&#8208;fluorinated cellodextrin chains that assembled into particles presenting morphological and crystallinity features, and intermolecular interactions, that are unprecedented for cellulose&#8208;like materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Double orthogonal click reactions for the development of antimicrobial peptide nanotubes</title>
      <dc:description>A new class of amphipathic cyclic peptides, which assemble in bacteria membranes to form polymeric supramolecular nanotubes giving them antimicrobial properties, is described. The method is based on the use of two orthogonal clickable transformations to incorporate different hydrophobic or hydrophilic moieties in a simple, regioselective, and divergent manner. The resulting cationic amphipathic cyclic peptides described in this article exhibit strong antimicrobial properties with a broad therapeutic window. Our studies suggest that the active form is the nanotube resulted from the parallel stacking of the cyclic peptide precursors. Several techniques, CD, FTIR, fluorescence, and STEM, among others, confirm the nanotube formation.</dc:description>

      <title>Temperature as an extra dimension in multidimensional protein NMR.</title>
      <dc:description>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a particularly informative method for studying protein structure and dynamics in solution; however, it is also one of the most time&#8208;consuming. Modern approaches to biomolecular NMR are based on lengthy multidimensional (ND) experiments whose duration grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. The experimental time may even be several days in the case of 3D and 4D spectra. Moreover, the experiment often has to be repeated in several different conditions, for example in order to measure the temperature&#8208;dependent effects in a spectrum (temperature coefficients, TCs). In this paper we propose a new approach that involves joint sampling of indirect evolution times and temperature. This allows us to measure TCs with 3D spectra in even less time than is needed to acquire a single spectrum using the conventional approach. We propose two signal processing methods that are complementary in terms of sensitivity and resolution: a) dividing the data into overlapping subsets followed by compressed sensing reconstruction, and b) treating the complete data set with a variant of the Radon transform. The temperature&#8208;swept 3D HNCO spectra of two intrinsically disordered proteins&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;osteopontin and CD44 cytoplasmic tail&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;show that our new approach makes it possible to determine TCs and their non&#8208;linearities effectively. Non&#8208;linearities, which indicate the presence of a compact state, are particularly interesting. We provide the complete package of data acquisition and processing software for this new approach.</dc:description>

      <title>Quinoline Photobasicity &#8211; Investigation within water&#8208;soluble light&#8208;responsive copolymers</title>
      <dc:description>Photobases exhibit a distinctly higher pK  a  in their excited state compared to the ground state, thus, enabling light&#8208;controlled proton transfer reactions. Their versatility in  e.g.  molecular catalysis routes in the dramatic change of the electronic configuration. The absorption of UV light translates in a pK  a  jump of approximately 10 units as established for small molecule photobases. This contribution presents the first synthesis of quinoline&#8208;based polymeric photobases prepared  via  reversible addition&#8210;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The integration of quinolines as photobase chromophores within copolymers offers new possibilities for light triggered proton transfer in nanostructured materials,  i.e.  , in nanoparticles, at surfaces, membranes and interfaces. To exploit the light&#8208;triggered reactivity of photobases within such materials, we first investigated how the ground and excited state properties of the quinoline unit changes upon polymer integration. To address this matter, we combine absorption and emission spectroscopy with time&#8208;resolved transient absorption studies to reveal photoinduced proton transfer dynamics in various solvents. The results yield important insights into the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of these polymeric quinoline photobases.</dc:description>

      <title>B&#8592;N&#8208;Incorporated Dibenzo&#8208;azaacene with Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption and Visible Transparency</title>
      <dc:description>Organic compounds with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption and visible transparency are very desirable for fabrication of transparent/semi&#8208;transparent opto&#8208;electronic devices. Herein, we develop a molecule with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption property, QBNA&#8208;O, in which four B&#8592;N units are incorporated to the core and two benzodioxin groups are introduced at the termini of the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton. QBNA&#8208;O exhibits a small optical gap of 1.39 eV due to the strong electron&#8208;donating benzodioxin groups and the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing B&#8592;N units. In toluene solution, QBNA&#8208;O shows a strong absorption peak at 856 nm with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of only 41 nm as well as very weak absorption in the visible range from 380 nm to 760 nm. Thin films of QBNA&#8208;O exhibit the average visible transparency (AVT) of 78% at the thickness of 205 nm and 90% at the thickness of 45 nm. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) of QBNA&#8208;O display ambipolar transporting behavior with the electron mobility of 0.52 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and the hole mobility of 0.013 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 together with excellent air&#8208;stability. The selective NIR absorbing property and excellent charge transporting property imply that QBNA&#8208;O can be used to fabricate transparent organic opto&#8208;electronic devices.</dc:description>

      <title>The Microwave Detection of Wet Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP): Non&#8208;Covalent Forces and Water Dynamics</title>
      <dc:description>The microsolvated adducts of Triacetone triperoxide (TATP) have been observed using broadband rotational spectroscopy. This work opens a new way for the gas phase detection of this improvised explosive. The observed clusters exhibit unusual water dynamics and rarely observed multicenter interactions. TATP&#8211;H  2  O is formed from the D  3  symmetry conformer of TATP with water lying close to the C  3  axis. Water rotation around this axis with a very low barrier converts the cluster in an effective symmetric top. &#160;The main interaction of the monohydrate is a four&#8208;center trifurcated donor O  w  &#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bond, not observed previously in the gas phase, reinforced by a weak four&#8208;center trifurcated acceptor C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O  w  interaction. Surprisingly all structural signatures show the weakness of these interactions. The complex TATP&#8211;(H  2  O)&#173;  2  is formed from the monohydrated adduct by the self&#8208;association of water.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The microsolvated adducts of Triacetone triperoxide (TATP) have been observed using broadband rotational spectroscopy. This work opens a new way for the gas phase detection of this improvised explosive. The observed clusters exhibit unusual water dynamics and rarely observed multicenter interactions. TATP&#8211;H  2  O is formed from the D  3  symmetry conformer of TATP with water lying close to the C  3  axis. Water rotation around this axis with a very low barrier converts the cluster in an effective symmetric top. &#160;The main interaction of the monohydrate is a four&#8208;center trifurcated donor O  w  &#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bond, not observed previously in the gas phase, reinforced by a weak four&#8208;center trifurcated acceptor C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O  w  interaction. Surprisingly all structural signatures show the weakness of these interactions. The complex TATP&#8211;(H  2  O)&#173;  2  is formed from the monohydrated adduct by the self&#8208;association of water.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>This communication reports the first example of an enantioselective carbocyclization of an alkyne&#8208;containing substrate catalyzed by chiral Br&#248;nsted acids. The use of the 2&#8208;hydroxynaphthyl substituent on the alkyne as a directing group constitutes the key parameter enabling both efficient regioselective protonation of the carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond and chiral induction. The key cationic intermediate can be depicted either as a cationic vinylidene  ortho  &#8208;quinone methide or a stabilized vinyl cation. Atropoisomeric phenanthrenes derivatives were produced in high yields and good enantioselectivities under mild, metal&#8208;free reaction conditions in the presence of chiral  N  &#8208;triflylphosphoramide catalysts. The carbenic nature of the cationic intermediate was also exploited to describe an example of alkyne/alkane cycloisomerization.</dc:description>

      <title>DpgC&#8208;catalyzed peroxidation of&#160; DPA&#8208;CoA: insights into the spin&#8208;forbidden transition and charge transfer mechanisms</title>
      <dc:description>Despite being a very strong oxidizing agent, most organic molecules are not oxidized in the presence of O$_2$ at room temperature because O$_2$ is a diradical while most organic molecules are closed&#8208;shell. Oxidation then requires a change in the spin state of the system, forbidden according to non&#8208;relativistic quantum theory. To overcome this limitation, oxygenases usually rely on metal or redox cofactors to catalyze the incorporation of, at least, one oxygen atom into an organic substrate. However, some oxygenases do not require any cofactor, and the detailed mechanism followed by these enzymes remains elusive. To fill this gap, here we study the mechanism for the enzymatic cofactor&#8208;independent oxidation of&#160; 3,5&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetyl&#8208;CoA (DPA&#8208;CoA) combining multi&#8208;reference calculations on a model system, with QM/MM calculations. Our results reveal that intersystem crossing takes place without requiring the previous protonation of molecular oxygen. The characterization of the electronic states reveals that&#160; &#160;electron transfer is concomitant with the triplet&#8208;singlet transition. The enzyme plays a passive role in promoting the intersystem crossing, although spontaneous reorganization of the water&#8208;wire connecting the active site with the bulk presets the substrate for subsequent chemical transformations. Our results show that the stabilization of the singlet radical&#8208;pair between dioxygen and enolate is enough to promote spin&#8208;forbidden reaction without the need for neither metal cofactors nor basic residues in the active site.</dc:description>

Aminoglycosides are therapeutically useful antibiotics as well as very efficient RNA ligands. They are able to interfere with the translation process in prokaryotes upon binding to bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) thus impairing protein synthesis. The ability of aminoglycosides to bind to various RNAs renders them a great source of inspiration for the synthesis of new binders with improved affinity and specificity toward several therapeutically relevant RNA targets.

      <title>Frontispiece: Journey from Small&#8208;Molecule Diyne Structures to 2D Graphdiyne: Synthetic Strategies</title>
      <dc:description>
Graphdiyne (GDY) has unique characteristics of a highly conjugated &#960; system, uniformly distributed nanopores and direct band gap. In order to study the intrinsic properties of GDY, the synthesis methods of small&#8208;molecule diyne structure (GDY substructure), one&#8208;dimensional nanoribbons and highly ordered 2D GDY thin films were developed. In the Minireview by Y. Li et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;12310&#8197;ff., powerful strategies such as enhancing the chemoselectivity through optimizing interfaces at which coupling reactions take place and the molecular structure of precursors that prefer to form a flat 2D surface upon coupling reactions are highlighted. The obtained structures with different dimensions provide an opportunity to study various physical properties, such as the function of oligomer size, and reveal a reliable correlation between structure and properties.

      <dc:description>
Human NOTCH1 receptor contains 36&#8197;epidermal growth factor (EGF)&#8208;like repeating domains, in which O&#8208;glycosylation status of the EGF12 domain regulates the interaction with Notch ligands. In their Full Paper on page&#8197;12363&#8197;ff., Y. Yokoi and S.&#8208;I. Nishimura carried out chemical synthesis and NMR studies of site&#8208;specifically O&#8208;glycosylated EGF11 and EGF10. Four EGF11 and five EGF10 modules were synthesized. The specific O&#8208;glycosylation states affected in vitro folding of EGF10 more than EGF11, while calcium ion had a larger effect on EGF11 folding. Comprehensive NMR studies shed light on the new type &#8220;sugar bridges&#8221; crosslinking Thr&#8208;O&#8208;GlcNAc in the consensus sequence C5&#8208;X&#8208;X&#8208;G&#8208;X&#8208;(T/S)&#8208;G&#8208;X&#8208;X&#8208;C6 and an amino acid in the hinge region between the domains, 445Thr&#8208;O&#8208;GlcNAc&#8212;IIe451 in domain&#8197;11 and 405Thr&#8208;O&#8208;GlcNAc&#8212;Gln411 in domain&#8197;10.

      <title>Understanding the Uniqueness of the 2p&#8208;Elements in the Periodic Table</title>
      <dc:description>T
The Periodic Table, and the unique chemical behavior of the first element of a group, were discovered simultaneously one and a half centuries ago.&#160; Half a century ago the unique chemistry of the light homologs was corre&#173;lated to the then available atomic orbital (AO) radii. The radially nodeless 1s,&#160;2p, 3d, 4f valence AOs are part&#173;icu&#173;larly compact. The similarity of r(2s) &#8776; r(2p)&#160; leads to pronounced sp&#8208;hybrid bonding of &#160;the light p&#8208;block elements, while the heavier p&#8209;elements with n&#8805;3 exhibit &#160;r(ns)&#160;&#171;&#160;r(np) of ca. &#8722;20 to &#8722;30 %. 
We present a compre&#173;hensive physical explana&#173;tion in terms of kinetic radial and&#160; angular, as well as potential nuclear&#8208;attraction and electron&#8208;screening effects. For hydrogen&#8208;like atoms and all inner shells of the heavy atoms, r(2s)&#160;&#187;&#160;r(2p) by +20 to +30 %, while r(3s) &#8819; r(3p) &#8819; r(3d), since in Coulomb potentials radial motion is more radial orbital expanding than angular motion. However, the screening of nuclear attraction by inner core shells is more efficient for s than p valence shells. The uniqueness of the 2p AO is explained by this differential shielding. Thereby we pave the way for future physical expla&#173;nations of the 3d, 4f and 5g cases.</dc:description>

The Periodic Table, and the unique chemical behavior of the first element of a group, were discovered simultaneously one and a half centuries ago.&#160; Half a century ago the unique chemistry of the light homologs was corre&#173;lated to the then available atomic orbital (AO) radii. The radially nodeless 1s,&#160;2p, 3d, 4f valence AOs are part&#173;icu&#173;larly compact. The similarity of r(2s) &#8776; r(2p)&#160; leads to pronounced sp&#8208;hybrid bonding of &#160;the light p&#8208;block elements, while the heavier p&#8209;elements with n&#8805;3 exhibit &#160;r(ns)&#160;&#171;&#160;r(np) of ca. &#8722;20 to &#8722;30 %. 
We present a compre&#173;hensive physical explana&#173;tion in terms of kinetic radial and&#160; angular, as well as potential nuclear&#8208;attraction and electron&#8208;screening effects. For hydrogen&#8208;like atoms and all inner shells of the heavy atoms, r(2s)&#160;&#187;&#160;r(2p) by +20 to +30 %, while r(3s) &#8819; r(3p) &#8819; r(3d), since in Coulomb potentials radial motion is more radial orbital expanding than angular motion. However, the screening of nuclear attraction by inner core shells is more efficient for s than p valence shells. The uniqueness of the 2p AO is explained by this differential shielding. Thereby we pave the way for future physical expla&#173;nations of the 3d, 4f and 5g cases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Effect of Larger Pore Size on the Sorption Properties of Isoreticular Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with High Number of Open Metal Sites</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks with coordinatively exposed metal cations perform extraordinarily well in low&#8208;pressure sorption processes. CPO&#8208;54&#8208;Mn is isoreticular to the heavily studied CPO&#8208;27/MOF&#8208;74 materials. It has a honeycomb structure with a larger pore and the second highest number of open metal sites. The difference in pore size and chemical structure affects the behavior of the two isostructural compounds on adsorption of CO2, H2 and CO.







Abstract
Four isostructural CPO&#8208;54&#8208;M metal&#8208;organic frameworks based on the larger organic linker 1,5&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid and divalent cations (M=Mn, Mg, Ni, Co) are shown to be isoreticular to the CPO&#8208;27 (MOF&#8208;74) materials. Desolvated CPO&#8208;54&#8208;Mn contains a very high concentration of open metal sites, which has a pronounced effect on the gas adsorption of N2, H2, CO2 and CO. Initial isosteric heats of adsorption are significantly higher than for MOFs without open metal sites and are slightly higher than for CPO&#8208;27. The plateau of high heat of adsorption decreases earlier in CPO&#8208;54&#8208;Mn as a function of loading per mole than in CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Mn. Cluster and periodic density functional theory based calculations of the adsorbate structures and energetics show that the larger adsorption energy at low loadings, when only open metal sites are occupied, is mainly due to larger contribution of dispersive interactions for the materials with the larger, more electron rich bridging ligand.

      <title>An Apparent Umpolung Reactivity of Indole via [Au]&#8208;Catalysed Cyclisation and Lewis&#8208;Acid Mediated Allylation</title>
      <dc:description>The possibility of sequential functionalisation of indole C2 and C3 in an umpolung fashion has been executed with a pre&#8208;designed substrate and choice of reagents. The developed method comprises of a gold&#8208;catalysed alkynol cycloisomerization/ intramolecular addition of C2 of indole and subsequent BF  3  .OEt  2  mediated regioselective C3 allylation, resulting in the synthesis of the functionalized indoloisoquinolinone scaffold. The reaction involves 5&#8208;  endo  &#8208;alkynol cycloisomerization and the dearomative/ addition of indole C2 to the intermediate oxocarbenium cation, which results in two equilibrating fused and spiro pentacyclic intermediates which upon treatment with allylsilane in the presence of BF  3  .OEt  2  , undergo selective indole C3 allylation.

      <title>On the Role of Alkali&#8208;Metal&#8208;Like Superatom Al12P in Reduction and Conversion of Carbon Dioxide</title>

With the assistance of DFT calculations, it is interesting to find that, different from Al  12  X (X = Be, Al, and C), the  alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;like superatom Al  12  P  prefers to combine with CO  2  via a bidentate double oxygen coordination, yielding a stable Al  12  P(  &#951;  2  &#8208;O  2  C) complex containing an activated radical anion of CO  2  (  i.e.  , CO  2  &#8226;&#8722;  ). Thereby, this compound can not only participate in the subsequent cycloaddition reaction with propylene oxide, but also initiate the radical reaction with hydrogen gas to form high value chemicals, revealing that Al  12  P can play an important role in catalyzing these conversion reactions. Considering that Al  12  P has been produced in laboratory, and is capable of absorbing visible light to drive the activation and transformation of CO  2  , we optimistically anticipated that this work could guide the experimentalists to discover such an additional superatom catalyst for CO  2  transformation, and open up a new research field of superatom catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Exciton Transport in Molecular Semiconductor Crystals for Spin&#8208;Optoelectronics Paradigm</title>
      <dc:description>Organic semiconductors with ultralong&#8208;range exciton diffusion length is highly desirable for optoelectronics but currently remain rare. Here, we show the diffusion length of singlet excitons (LD) in 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA) crystals grown by solvent evaporation is up to ~124 nm. These crystals show a previously unseen parallelogram morphology with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer edge&#8208;on molecular stacking, isotropic optical waveguiding, radiation rate and non&#8208;radiation rate constants of 0.15 ns&#8208;1 and 0.26 ns&#8208;1 respectively, as well as good field effect transistor hole mobility and theoretically computed strong electronic couplings as high as 109 meV. Photoresponse experiments reveal that the photoconductivity of DPA crystals is surprisingly not related to the radiative pathway, but associated with rapid exciton diffusion to crystal surface for charge separation and carrier bimolecular recombination. Taken together, this study shows that DPA with ultralong&#8208;range exciton diffusion length is a promising semiconducting material for new organic optoelectronics paradigm.</dc:description>

Photoresponse experiments reveal that the photoconductivity of DPA crystals is surprisingly not related to the radiative pathway, but associated with rapid exciton diffusion to crystal surface for charge separation and carrier bimolecular recombination. Taken together, this study shows that DPA with ultralong&#8208;range exciton diffusion length is a promising semiconducting material for new organic optoelectronics paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Single&#8208;step glycosylations with 13C&#8208;labelled sulfoxide donors: a low&#8208;temperature NMR cartography of the distinguishing mechanistic intermediates</title>
      <dc:description>Glycosyl sulfoxides have gained recognition in the total synthesis of complex oligosaccharides and as model substrates for dissecting the mechanisms involved. While these donors are usually reacted under pre&#8208;activation conditions, an experimentally more convenient single&#8208;step protocol has also been reported, whereby the activation is performed in the presence of the acceptor alcohol; yet, the nature and prevalence of the reaction intermediates formed in this more complex scenario have comparatively received minimal attention. Herein, we report a systematic NMR&#8208;based study employing both  13  C&#8208;labelled and unlabelled glycosyl sulfoxide donors for the detection and monitorization of marginally populated intermediates. Our results conclusively show that glycosyl triflates play a key role in these glycosylations despite the presence of the acceptor alcohol. Importantly, the formation of covalent donor/acceptor sulfonium adducts has been identified as the main competing reaction, thus defining a non&#8208;productive consumption of the acceptor that could limit the reaction yield.</dc:description>

      <title>Programmable DNA Nanoflowers for Biosensing, Bioimaging, and Therapeutics</title>
      <dc:description>
Flower of the flock: DNA nanoflowers consisting of DNA molecules and inorganic skeletons show flower&#8208;like morphology and porous structure. The DNA sequences and inorganic components can be designed in a predefined and programmable fashion, and eventually generate DNA nanoflowers with precise structures and synergistic functions, which can be widely applied in biomedical and related fields.







Abstract
DNA nanostructures have shown excellent prospects in biomedical applications owing to their unique sequence programmability, function designability, and biocompatibility. As a type of unique DNA&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanostructures, DNA nanoflowers (DNFs) have attracted considerable attention in the past few years. Precise design of the DNA sequence enables the functions of DNFs to be customized. Specifically, DNFs exhibit high physiological stability and more diverse properties by virtue of the incorporation of inorganic materials, which in turn have been applied in an assortment of biomedical fields. In this review, the design, synthesis, and biomedical applications of programmable DNFs are discussed. First, the background of DNA&#8208;based materials and the fundamentals of DNFs are briefly introduced. In the second part, two synthetic methods of DNFs are categorized as the rolling circle amplification and salt aging method, focusing on the formation mechanism of DNFs and differences between the synthetic methods. In the third part, the biomedical applications of DNFs functional materials are summarized, including biosensing, bioimaging, and therapeutics. Finally, the challenges and future opportunities of DNFs are discussed toward more widespread applications.

      <title>Influence of Amide Connectivity on the Hydrogen Bond Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of [n.n]Paracyclophanes</title>

Four new 1,4&#8208;phenylene and 9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;based oligothiophenes were ad hoc designed to ensure efficient spontaneous formation of chiral supramolecular order.

      <title>Enhanced polysulfides adsorptions on CNTs/Boron Nitride fibers for excellent Li&#8208;S Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are one of the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage system. However, serious capacity attenuation and poor cycling stability induced by the shuttle effect of polysulfide intermediates can impede the practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, we report a novel sulfur cathode by intertwining multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and porous boron nitride fibers (BNFs) for the subsequent loading of sulfur. This structural design enables trapping of active sulfur and serves to localize the soluble polysulfide within the cathode region, leading to low active material loss. Compared with CNTs/S, CNTs/BNFs/S cathodes delivered a high initial capacity of 1222 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 C. Upon increasing the current density of 4 C, the cell retained a capacity of 482 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 500 cycles with a capacity decay of only 0.044% per cycle. The rational design of CNTs/BNFs/S gives new insights on how to optimize the cathode for the Li&#8208;S battery.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are one of the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage system. However, serious capacity attenuation and poor cycling stability induced by the shuttle effect of polysulfide intermediates can impede the practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, we report a novel sulfur cathode by intertwining multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and porous boron nitride fibers (BNFs) for the subsequent loading of sulfur.

      <title>What determines the selectivity of arginine dihydroxylation by the nonheme iron enzyme OrfP?</title>
      <dc:description>The nonheme iron enzyme OrfP reacts with L&#8208;Arg selectively to form the 3  R  ,4  R  &#8208;dihydroxyarginine product, which in mammals can inhibit the nitric oxide synthase enzymes involved in blood pressure control. To understand the mechanisms of dioxygen activation of L&#8208;Arg by OrfP and how it enables two sequential oxidation cycles on the same substrate, we performed a density functional theory study on a large active site cluster model. We show that substrate binding and positioning in the active site guides a highly selective reaction through C  3  &#8208;H hydrogen atom abstraction. This happens despite the fact that the C  3  &#8210;H and C  4  &#8210;H bond strengths of L&#8208;Arg are very similar. Electronic differences in the two hydrogen atom abstraction pathways drive the reaction with an initial C  3  &#8210;H activation to a low&#8208;energy  5  s&#8208;pathway, while substrate positioning destabilizes the C  4  &#8210;H abstraction and sends it over the higher&#8208;lying  5  p&#8208;pathway. We show that substrate and monohydroxylated products are strongly bound in the substrate binding pocket and hence product release is difficult and consequently its lifetime will be long enough to trigger a second oxygenation cycle.</dc:description>

      <title>Lanthanoid Complexes as Molecular Materials: The Redox Approach</title>
      <dc:description>The development of molecular materials with novel functionality offers promise for technological innovation. Switchable molecules that incorporate redox&#8208;active components are enticing candidate compounds due to their potential for electronic manipulation. Lanthanoid metals are most prevalent in their trivalent state and usually redox&#8208;activity in lanthanoid complexes is restricted to the ligand. The unique electronic and physical properties of lanthanoid ions have been exploited for various applications, including in magnetic and luminescent materials as well as in catalysis.&#160; Lanthanoid complexes are also promising for applications reliant on switchability, where the physical properties can be modulated by varying the oxidation state of a coordinated ligand. Lanthanoid&#8208;based redox activity is also possible, encompassing both divalent and tetravalent metal oxidation states. Thus, utilization of redox&#8208;active lanthanoid metals offers an attractive opportunity to further expand the capabilities of molecular materials. This review surveys both ligand and lanthanoid centered redox&#8208;activity in pre&#8208;existing molecular systems, including tuning of lanthanoid magnetic and photophysical properties by modulating the redox states of coordinated ligands. Ultimately the combination of redox&#8208;activity at both ligands and metal centers in the same molecule can afford novel electronic structures and physical properties, including multiconfigurational electronic states and valence tautomerism. Further targeted exploration of these features is clearly warranted, both to enhance understanding of the underlying fundamental chemistry, and for the generation of a potentially important new class of molecular material.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Emission of Ultraviolet Light by Solid State Organic Fluorophores: Synthesis and Characterization of 1,4&#8208;Dialkeny&#8208;2,5&#8208;dioxybenzenes</title>
      <dc:description>The design and development of organic luminophores that exhibit efficient ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence in the solid state remains underexplored. Here, we report that 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;benzenes and 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;disiloxybenzenes act as such UV&#8208;emissive fluorophores. The dialkenyldioxybenzenes were readily prepared in three steps from 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diacetylbenzene or 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diformylbenzene and via two to four steps from 1,4&#8208;bis(diethoxyphosphonylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzene. The dial&#8208;kenyldioxybenzenes emit UV light in solution (  &#955;  em  = 350&#8211;387 nm) and in the solid state (  &#955;  em  = 328&#8211;388 nm). In addition, the quantum yields in the solid state were generally higher than those in solution. In particular, the adamantylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes fluoresced in the UV region with high quantum yields (  &#934;  = 0.37&#8211;0.55) in the solid state. Thin films of poly(methyl methacrylate) doped with the adaman&#8208;tylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes also exhibited UV emission with good efficiency (  &#934;  = 0.27&#8211;0.45). Density functional theory calculations revealed that the optical excitation of the dialkenyldimethoxy&#8208;benzenes involves intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the ether oxygen atoms to the twisted alkenyl&#8211;benzene&#8211;alkenyl moiety, whereas the dialkenylbis(triphenylsiloxy)benzenes were optically excited through intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the oxygen atoms and twisted  &#960;  &#8208;system to the phenyl&#8211;Si moieties of each triphenylsilyl group.</dc:description>

      <title>Computational Mapping of Dirhodium(II) Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The chemistry of dirhodium(II) catalysts is highly diverse, and can enable the synthesis of many different molecular classes. A tool to aid in catalyst selection, independent of mechanism and reactivity, would therefore be highly desirable. Here, we describe the development of a database for dirhodium(II) catalysts that is based on the principal component analysis of DFT&#8208;calculated parameters capturing their steric and electronic properties. This database maps the relevant catalyst space, and may facilitate exploration of the reactivity landscape for any process catalysed by dirhodium(II) complexes. We have shown that one of the principal components of these catalysts correlates with the outcome (e.g. yield, selectivity) of a transformation used in a molecular discovery project. Furthermore, we envisage that this approach will assist the selection of more effective catalyst screening sets, and, hence, the data&#8208;led optimisation of a wide range of rhodium&#8208;catalysed transformations.</dc:description>

      <title>Innovative Multipodal Ligands Derived from Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s Bases for the Sensitization of Lanthanide(III) Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of the first family of multipodal ligands with a Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base framework designed for the preparation of luminescent lanthanide(III) complexes. Eight ligands were designed and synthesized using different strategies, including alkylation reactions, amide couplings and Ugi multicomponent reactions. All ligands bear carboxylate groups for the coordination of the lanthanide(III) ion, with lanthanide(III) sensitizing units consisting of the Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base framework itself or attached benzamides. Upon irradiation of the chromophoric ligands, the green terbium(III) emission was efficiently generated, whereas the europium(III) emission signal was negligible. The geometry and the substitution pattern of the ligands allow the control of the stoichiometry of the species formed and the Tb(III) luminescence sensitization efficiency, showing that  para  &#8211;substitution patterns are more efficient than  meta  &#8211;substitution ones for the formation of coordination compounds with lower Tb(III)/ligand ratio. We propose that the formed species are self&#8211;assembled 2:2 or 2:4 metallosupramolecular structures.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosting the Iodine Adsorption and Radioresistance of Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 MOFs via Aromatic Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>Effective capture of radioactive iodine is of paramount importance for the safe and long&#8208;term storage of fission products in nuclear fuel cycle. Herein, a series of functionalized Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 MOFs was employed as a model to investigate the effects of substituents on iodine adsorption in both solution and vapor states. Sorption studies revealed that the electro&#8208;donating amino group exhibits the most positive role on increasing the removal rate of iodine from cyclohexane and the uptake capacity of iodine vapor. Particularly, the disubstituted Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2  can effectively remove 91.9% of iodine (300 mg/L) from cyclohexane and capture 969 mg/g iodine vapor, significantly higher than 59.6% and 334 mg/g of untagged Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, respectively. In addition, the substituent effect on the radiolytic stability of MOFs was for the first time investigated, leading to the unearthing of one of the most radioresistant MOFs Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2  reported up to date.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>PhI(OTf)2 has been used for the past 30 years as a strong I(III) oxidant for organic and inorganic transformations.

      <title>Structural and Oxidation State Alternatives in Platinum and Palladium Complexes of a Redox&#8208;Active Amidinato Ligand</title>

The reversibly accessible cations [PtL  2  ]  +  and [Pd  2  L  4  ]  +  were also studied, the latter as [Pd  2  L  4  ][B{3,5&#8208;(CF  3  )  2  C  6  H  3  }  4  ] single crystals.

      <title>Galectin&#8208;Glycan Interaction: Guideline for Monitoring by 77Se NMR Spectroscopy and Solvent (H2O/D2O) Impact on Binding</title>
      <dc:description>Functional pairing between cellular glyco&#173;con&#173;ju&#173;gates and tissue lectins like galectins has wide (patho)physio&#173;logical significance. Their study is facilitated by non&#8208;hydrolyzable deri&#173;va&#173;tives of the natural O&#8208;glycans, such as S&#8208; and Se&#8208;glycosides. The latter en&#173;able extensive analyses by specific  77  Se NMR spectroscopy, but still remain under&#173;explored. By the example of seleno&#173;&#173;digalac&#173;to&#173;side (SeDG) and the human galectins 1 and 3, we evaluate diverse  77  Se NMR detec&#173;tion methods and pro&#173;pose selec&#173;tive  1  H,  77  Se hetero&#173;nuclear Hartmann&#8208;Hahn transfer for efficient use in com&#173;peti&#173;tive NMR screening against a seleno&#173;glycoside spy ligand.

      <title>PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS Block Copolymer Templated Mesoporous Carbons: A Comparative Study of Nitrogen and Sulfur Doping in the Oxygen Reduction Reaction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
      <dc:description>Carbon materials slightly doped with heteroatoms such as nitrogen (N&#8208;RFC) or sulfur (S&#8208;RFC) are investigated as active catalysts for the electrochemical bioelectronic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to H  2  O  2  . Mesoporous carbons with wide, accessible pores were prepared by pyrolysis of a resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde resin using a PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS block copolymer as a sacrificial templating agent and the nitrogen and sulfur doping were accomplished in a second thermal treatment employing 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline and dibenzothiophene as nitrogen and sulfur precursors, respectively. The synthetic strategy allowed to obtain carbon materials with very high surface area and mesopore volume without any further physico&#8208;chemical post treatment.
Voltammetric rotating ring&#8208;disk measurements in combination with potentiostatic and galvanostatic bulk electrolysis measurements in 0.5 M H  2  SO  4  demonstrated a pronounced effect of heteroatom doping and mesopores volume on the catalytic activity and selectivity for H  2  O  2  .

The undoped carbon RFC showed a lower production rate (218 mM&#160;g  &#8208;1  &#160;h  &#8208;1  ) but a higher FE of 76 %, while the performances drastically dropped when S&#8208;RFC (production rate 11 mmol&#160;g  &#8208;1  &#160;h  &#8208;1  and FE = 39 %) was used.</dc:description>

      <title>How does iron storage protein ferritin interact with plutonium (and thorium) ?</title>
      <dc:description>The impact of the contamination of living organisms by actinide elements has been a constant subject of attention since the 1950s. But to date still little is understood. Ferritin is the major storage and regulation protein of iron in many organisms, it consists of a protein ring and a ferrihydric core at the center. This work sheds light on the interactions of early actinides (Th, Pu) at oxidation state +IV with ferritin and its ability to store those elements at physiological pH compared to Fe.&#160;
The Ferritin &#8208; thorium load curve suggests that Th(IV) saturates the protein (2840 Th atoms per ferritin) in a similar way that Fe does on the protein ring. Complementary spectroscopic techniques (Spectrophotometry, Infrared Spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy) were combined with Molecular Dynamics to provide a structural model of the interaction of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) with ferritin. Comparison of spectroscopic data together with MD calculations suggests that Th(IV) and Pu(IV) are complexed mainly on the protein ring and not on the ferrihydric core. Indeed from XAS data, there is no evidence of Fe neighbors in the Th and Pu environments. On the other hand, carboxylates from amino acids of the protein ring and a possible additional carbonate anion are shaping the cation coordination spheres. This thorough description from a molecular view point of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) interaction with ferritin, an essential iron storage protein, is a cornerstone in comprehensive nuclear toxicology</dc:description>

      <title>Implanting Atomic Dispersed Ru in PtNi Colloidal Nanocrystal Clusters for Efficient Catalytic Performance in Electro&#8208;oxidation of Liquid Fuels</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the fact that PtRu alloy nanocatalyst has been certified to possess the excellent electrocatalytic performance and CO&#8208;poisoning tolerance toward the formic acid and methanol electro&#8208;oxidation, the unaffordable usages of ruthenium (Ru) and platinum (Pt) have greatly limited their widespread adoption. Here, we report a facile one&#8208;pot method to implant atomic dispersed Ru in PtNi colloidal nanocrystal clusters with different Ru/Pt/Ni molar ratios, which highly reduces the dosages of Pt and Ru, and further improves their catalytic performances for the electro&#8208;oxidation of formic acid and methanol. By simply controlling the amount of Ni(acac)2 precursor,&#160;trimetallic Ru0.3Pt70.5Ni29.2, Ru0.6Pt55.9Ni43.5,&#160;Ru0.2Pt77.3Ni22.5&#160;and Ru0.9Pt27.3Ni71.8&#160;CNCs are obtained. Particularly, the Ru0.3Pt70.5Ni29.2&#160;CNCs&#160;exhibit the excellent specific activities for formic acid and methanol electro&#8208;oxidation, 14.2&#8211; and 15.3&#8211;fold higher than those of Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Moreover, the Ru0.3Pt70.5Ni29.2&#160;CNCs&#160;also possess better anti&#8208;CO&#8208;poisoning property&#160;and superior diffusion ability than those of other RuPtNi CNCs.&#160;The excellent formic acid and methanol electro&#8208;oxidation activities of RuPtNi CNCs&#160;are ascribed&#160;to the optimal ligand effects derived from the Pt, Ni and atomic dispersed Ru atoms, which can improve OH adsorption ability and further anti&#8208;CO&#8208;poisoning capability.&#160;This research opens up a new door for increasing the electro&#8208;oxidation properties of liquid fuels by using the less dosages of noble metal in Pt&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>
