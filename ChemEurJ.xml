         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Dimeric Capsules with Appended Spiropyran Units: Towards Controlled Cargo Release</title>

Controlled uptake and release: We investigate the photo&#8208; and acid&#8208;induced isomerization of monomeric and homo&#8208;dimeric tetra&#8208;spiropyran tetra&#8208;urea calix[4]arene and calix[4]pyrrole derivatives. The acid&#8208;induced isomerization of the switches was coupled to the homo&#8208;dimeric calix[4]arene capsule's disassembly and the release of the cationic guest to the bulk solution. The neutralization of the acidified solution with Et3N completely restored the original encapsulation complex.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of unprecedented tetra&#8208;urea derivatives of calix[4]arene and calix[4]pyrrole containing four spiropyran (SP) units at their upper rim. We investigate the photo&#8208; and acid&#8208;induced isomerization of the monomeric and homo&#8208;dimeric tetra&#8208;ureas derivatives using UV&#8208;Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopies. At micromolar concentration, irradiation of the samples with 365&#8197;nm light induces changes in their absorption spectra that are consistent with SP&#8594;merocyanine (MC) isomerization. However, analogous experiments at millimolar concentration do not produce noticeable changes in the 1H NMR spectra. The addition of triflic acid to micromolar and millimolar solutions of the tetra&#8208;ureas produces the quantitative isomerization of the SP units to the protonated merocyanine form (E&#8208;MCH+) and the simultaneous disassembly of the capsular dimers to form ill&#8208;defined aggregates. The neutralization of the acid solutions resets the SP form. Under these acid/base treatment conditions, the controlled release of the included guest and the reassembly of the all&#8208;SP tetra&#8208;urea dimers occurs at different extents depending on its calix[4]arene or calix[4]pyrrole scaffold.

         <title>Synthesis and Surface Behaviour of NDI Chromophores Mounted on a Tripodal Scaffold: Towards Self&#8208;Decoupled Chromophores for Single&#8208;Molecule Electroluminescence</title>

Three&#8208;legged race: The efficient synthesis, optical and electrochemical properties of a series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetracarboxdiimides (NDIs) mounted on a tripodal platform are reported. Moreover, their surface behaviour after spraying on Au(111) was studied. In a STML setup, such NDI tripods show electroluminescence photon spectra with high electroluminescence yields and thus demonstrate their potential for optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
This paper reports the efficient synthesis, absorption and emission spectra, and the electrochemical properties of a series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetracarboxdiimide (NDI) tripodal molecules with thioacetate anchors for their surface investigations. Our studies showed that, in particular, the pyrrolidinyl group with its strong electron&#8208;donating properties enhanced the fluorescence of such core&#8208;substituted NDI chromophores and caused a significant bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum with a correspondingly narrowed bandgap of 1.94&#8197;eV. Cyclic voltammetry showed the redox properties of NDIs to be influenced by core substituents. The strong electron&#8208;donating character of pyrrolidine substituents results in rather high HOMO and LUMO levels of &#8208;5.31 and &#8208;3.37 eV when compared with the parental unsubstituted NDI. UHV&#8208;STM measurements of a sub&#8208;monolayer of the rigid tripodal NDI chromophores spray deposited on Au(111) show that these molecules mainly tend to adsorb flat in a pairwise fashion on the surface and form unordered films. However, the STML experiments also revealed a few molecular clusters, which might consist of upright oriented molecules protruding from the molecular island and show electroluminescence photon spectra with high electroluminescence yields of up to 6&#215;10&#8722;3. These results demonstrate the promising potential of the NDI tripodal chromophores for the fabrication of molecular devices profiting from optical features of the molecular layer.

         <title>Effect of a &#8220;Zn Bridge&#8221; on the Consecutively Tunable Retention Characteristics of Volatile Random Access Memory Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Committing zinc to memory: A prominent &#8220;zinc bridge&#8221; effect with extending feature could endow porphyrinated polyimide information memory materials with volatility. The electronic excitation processes and memory behavior of porphyrinated co&#8208;polyimides could be flexibly regulated by simply altering the zinc ion content in the porphyrin core. By strengthening the stability of the &#8220;zinc bridge&#8221;, the retention characteristics of porphyrinated polyimides could be precisely and successively tuned.







Abstract
Polyimide memory materials with a donor&#8211;acceptor structure based on a charge&#8208;transfer mechanism exhibit great potential for next&#8208;generation information storage technology due to their outstanding high&#8208;temperature resistance and good dimensional and chemical stability. Precisely controlling memory performance by limited chemical decoration is one of core challenges in this field. Most reported work mainly focuses on designing novel and elaborate electron donors or acceptors for the expected memory behavior of polyimides; this takes a lot of time and is not always efficacious. Herein, we report a series of porphyrinated copolyimides coPI&#8722;Znx (x=5, 10, 20, 50, 80), where x represents the mole percentage of Zn ion in the central core of the porphyrin. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicate that the Zn ion could play a vital bridge role in promoting the formation and stabilization of a charge&#8208;transfer complex by enhancing the hybridization of local and charge transfer (HLCT) excitations of porphyrinated polyimides, endowing coPI&#8722;Znx with volatile random access memory performance and continuously tunable retention time. This work could provide one simple strategy to precisely regulate memory performance merely by altering the metal content in porphyrinated polyimides.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed couplings of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-alkynyl &lt;i&gt;N,N&#8242;&lt;/i&gt;-di-(&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butoxycarbonyl)-aminals with &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-naphthols led to chiral propargylamines in moderate to high yields with high to excellent enantioselectivity, in which the reactions underwent sequential chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed in&#8197;situ formation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butoxycarbonyl)-imines (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-imines) from the aminals, and 1,2-addition of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-naphthols to the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Boc-imines. Chiral 1,2-dihydronaphtho[2,1&lt;i&gt;-b&lt;/i&gt;]furans and naphtho[2,1&lt;i&gt;-b&lt;/i&gt;]furans were prepared with satisfactory results when 10&#8197;mol% AgOAc and 20&#8197;mol% 2,6-lutidine or 1.2 equiv. of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) were added to the resulting chiral propargylamines solution, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>First Synthesis of the Inherently Chiral Trans&#8208;4' Bisadduct of C59N Azafullerene Using Cyclo&#8208;[2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as Tether</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiaddition chemistry of azafullerene C  59  N has been scarcely explored and the isolation of pure bisadducts is in its infancy. Encouraged by the recent regioselective synthesis of the inherently chiral  equatorial  face  bisadduct of C  59  N, we focused on the isolation of the first  trans&#8208;  4 bisadduct, via a simple two&#8208;step approach. The first regioselective synthesis of the  trans&#8208;  4 bisadduct of C  59  N utilizing  cyclo&#8208;  [2]&#8208;dodecylmalonate as tether is now reported. The newly synthesized bisadduct has a  C  1  symmetry as evidenced by  13  C NMR, while X&#8208;ray crystallography validated the  trans&#8208;  4' addition pattern. Furthermore, the inherently chiral  trans&#8208;  4' C  59  N bisadduct was enantiomerically resolved and the mirror&#8208;image relation of the two enantiomers was probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Finally, UV&#8208;Vis and redox assays suggested that the addition pattern has a reflection in the light&#8208;harvesting and redox properties of the bisadduct.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving High Efficiency at High Luminance in Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via Triplet&#8208;Triplet Fusion Based on Phenanthroimidazole&#8208;Benzothiadiazole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high efficiency at high luminance is one of the most important prerequisites towards practical application for any kinds of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Herein, we report highly emissive organic fluorescent molecules based on phenanthroimidazole&#8208;benzothiadiazole derivatives capable of maintaining high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at high luminance enabled by triplet&#8208;triplet fusion (TTF) in doped organic LEDs. The PIBzP, PIBzPCN and PIBzTPA based devices showed EQE of 8.27%, 9.15% and 8.64%, respectively, at luminance of higher than 1000 cd m  &#8208;2  , with little efficiency roll&#8208;off.</dc:description>

         <title>Matrix Isolation Spectroscopic and Relativistic Quantum Chemical Study on Molecular Platinum Fluorides PtFn (n = 1&#8211;6) Reveals Magnetic Bistability of PtF4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular platinum fluorides PtF  n  ,  n  = 1&#8211;6, are prepared by two different routes, the photo&#8208;initiated fluorine elimination from PtF  6  embedded in solid noble&#8208;gas matrices, and the reaction of elemental fluorine with laser ablated platinum atoms. IR spectra of the reaction products isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices at cryogenic conditions provide for the first time experimental vibrational frequencies of molecular PtF  3  , PtF  4  and PtF  5  . Photolysis of PtF  6  enabled a highly efficient and almost quantitative formation of molecular PtF  4  , while both PtF  5  and PtF  3  were formed simultaneously by subsequent UV irradiation of PtF  4  . The vibrational spectra of these molecular platinum fluorides were assigned with the help from one&#8208; and two&#8208;component quasirelativistic DFT computations to account for scalar relativistic and spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects. Competing Jahn&#8208;Teller and spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects result in a magnetic bistability of PtF  4  , for which a spin&#8208;triplet (  3  B  2g  ,  D  2h  ) coexists with an electronic singlet state (  1  A  1g  ,  D  4h  ) in solid neon matrices.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined Chemical Modification and Collision Induced Unfolding Using Native Ion Mobility&#8208;mass Spectrometry Provides Insights into Protein Gas&#8208;phase Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Native mass spectrometry is now an important tool in structural biology. Thus, the nature of higher protein structure in the vacuum of the mass spectrometer is an area of significant interest. One of the major goals in the study of gas&#8208;phase protein structure is to elucidate the stabilising role of interactions at the level of individual amino acid residues. A strategy combining protein chemical modification together with collision induced unfolding (CIU) was developed and employed to probe the structure of compact protein ions produced by native electrospray ionisation. Tractable chemical modification was used to alter the properties of amino acid residues, and&#160; ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) utilised to monitor the extent of unfolding as a function of modification. From these data the importance of specific intramolecular interactions for the stability of compact gas&#8208;phase protein structure can be inferred. Using this approach, and aided by molecular dynamics simulations, an important stabilising interaction between K6 and H68 in the protein ubiquitin was identified, as was a contact between the N&#8208;terminus and E22 in a ubiquitin binding protein UBA2.</dc:description>

This methodology was applied to the efficient and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of dapagliflozin, a medicament used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Finally, the versatility of our methodology was proved by the synthesis of other analogues of dapagliflozin.

         <title>On the Mechanism of Au&#8208;Catalyzed Enynamide&#8208;yne Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>

Following the pattern: The Au&#8208;catalyzed formal dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of enynamide&#8208;yne derivatives was shown experimentally and computationally to proceed according to a dual gold&#8208;catalyzed mechanism. The reaction proceeded in 3 stages: initial formation of a &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex followed by cyclization to produce a gem&#8208;diaurated aryl complex and finally a catalyst transfer. The concerted or stepwise nature of the cyclization event was found to depend on the substitution pattern of the ynamide moiety.







Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of ynamide derivatives allow efficient access to a variety of N&#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles. A dual gold catalysis mechanism was postulated for transformations involving the formation of C&#8722;C bonds by reaction between a terminal alkyne and an enynamide fragment. In this article, complete experimental and computational investigations into the mechanism of such a transformation are reported. Support for a dual gold catalysis was found and it was shown that the concerted or stepwise nature of the cyclization event depends on the substitution of the ynamide moiety. The reaction was found to proceed in three stages: 1)&#8197;formation of a &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex from the terminal alkyne, 2)&#8197;cyclization to produce a gem&#8208;diaurated aryl complex, and 3)&#8197;catalyst transfer to free the product and regenerate the &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex.

         <title>Optimizing Fe&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks through Ligand Conformation Regulation for Efficient Dye Adsorption and C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 41, Page 10693-10699, July 21, 2021. </description>

Two 3D Fe&#8208;MOFs (UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2) were constructed based on UPC&#8208;200(Fe)&#8208;H&#8208;H2O by replacing part of the benzene rings with C=C bonds and modifying &#8722;Cl&#8722; and &#8722;NH2 on the ligand. The synergistic effect of diversified structure and modification of functional groups endow UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 with high adsorption capacity for dyes and good C2H2/CO2 separation ability. Through reasonable regulation of ligands with functional groups, the structure can be precisely regulated to achieve the adsorption and separation of specific guest molecules.







Abstract
Regulating the structure of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) by adjusting the ligands reasonably is expected to enhance the interaction of MOFs on special molecules/ions, which has significant application value for the selective adsorption of guest molecules. Herein, two tricarboxylic ligands H3L&#8722;Cl and H3L&#8722;NH2 were designed and synthesized based on the ligand H3TTCA by replacing part of the benzene rings with C=C bonds and modifying the chlorine and amino groups on the 4&#8208;position of the benzene ring. Two 3D Fe&#8208;MOFs (UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2) with the new topology types were constructed. As the C=C bonds of the ligands have flexible torsion angles, UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl features three types of irregular 2D channels, while UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 has a cage with two types of windows on the surface. The synergistic effect of unique channels and modification of functional groups endows UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 with high adsorption capacity for organic dyes. Compound UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl shows high adsorption capacity for CV (147.2&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), RHB (100.3&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), and MO (220.9&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), whereas UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 exhibits selective adsorption of MO (158.7&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1). Meanwhile, based on the diverse pore structure and modification of active sites, UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 show the selective separation of equimolar C2H2/CO2. Therefore, reasonable regulation of organic ligands plays a significant role in guiding the structure diversification and performance improvement of MOFs.

         <title>Multivalent Tryptophan&#8208; and Tyrosine&#8208;Containing [60]Fullerene Hexa&#8208;Adducts as Dual HIV and Enterovirus A71 Entry Inhibitors</title>

Hexa&#8208;adducts of [60]fullerene with twelve tryptophan (Trp)/tyrosine (Tyr) residues in their periphery have been synthesized. They are much potent against HIV and equally active against EV71 than the prototype AL&#8208;385, with the same number of Trp moieties but a smaller and flexible pentaerythritol scaffold. This finding showed the relevance of the globular presentation of the peripheral groups for inhibiting viral replication, particularly HIV.







Abstract
Unprecedented 3D hexa&#8208;adducts of [60]fullerene peripherally decorated with twelve tryptophan (Trp) or tyrosine (Tyr) residues have been synthesized. Studies on the antiviral activity of these novel compounds against HIV and EV71 reveal that they are much more potent against HIV and equally active against EV71 than the previously described dendrimer prototypes AL&#8208;385 and AL&#8208;463, which possess the same number of Trp/Tyr residues on the periphery but attached to a smaller and more flexible pentaerythritol core. These results demonstrate the relevance of the globular 3D presentation of the peripheral groups (Trp/Tyr) as well as the length of the spacer connecting them to the central core to interact with the viral envelopes, particularly in the case of HIV, and support the hypothesis that [60]fullerene can be an alternative and attractive biocompatible carbon&#8208;based scaffold for this type of highly symmetrical dendrimers. In addition, the functionalized fullerenes here described, which display twelve peripheral negatively charged indole moieties on their globular surface, define a new and versatile class of compounds with a promising potential in biomedical applications.

Tremella is utilized as the precursor, a new process method (high&#8208;shear, freeze&#8208;drying and chemical activation are used in turn) is proposed, and an in&#8208;situ doped hierarchical porous biochar materials with adjustable 3D macro&#8208;meso&#8208;micropore is prepared successfully. Due to its unique physical structure, prepared cathode can still reach a reversible discharge capacity of 616&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a rate of 5&#8197;C. After 400 charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 1&#8197;C, the reversible capacity is maintained at 510.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Quick capacity loss due to the polysulfide shuttle effects and poor rate performance caused by low conductivity of sulfur have always been obstacles to the commercial application of lithium sulfur batteries. Herein, an in&#8208;situ doped hierarchical porous biochar materials with high electron&#8208;ion conductivity and adjustable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) macro&#8208;meso&#8208;micropore is prepared successfully. Due to its unique physical structure, the resulting material has a specific surface area of 2124.9&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a cumulative pore volume of 1.19&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. The presence of micropores can effectively physically adsorb polysulfides and mesopores ensure the accessibility of lithium ions and active sites and give the porous carbon material a high specific surface area. The large pores provide channels for the storage of electrolyte and the transmission of ions on the surface of the substrate. The combined effect of these three kinds of pores and the N doping formed in&#8208;situ can effectively promote the cycle and rate performance of the battery. Therefore, prepared cathode can still reach a reversible discharge capacity of 616&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a rate of 5&#8197;C. After 400 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 1&#8197;C, the reversible capacity is maintained at 510.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. This new strategy has provided a new approach to the research and industrial&#8208;scale production of adjustable hierarchical porous biochar materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tremella is utilized as the precursor, a new process method&lt;/b&gt; (high-shear, freeze-drying and chemical activation are used in turn) is proposed, and an in-situ doped hierarchical porous biochar materials with adjustable 3D macro-meso-micropore is prepared successfully. Due to its unique physical structure, prepared cathode can still reach a reversible discharge capacity of 616&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a rate of 5&#8197;C. After 400 charge-discharge cycles at 1&#8197;C, the reversible capacity is maintained at 510.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick capacity loss due to the polysulfide shuttle effects and poor rate performance caused by low conductivity of sulfur have always been obstacles to the commercial application of lithium sulfur batteries. Herein, an in-situ doped hierarchical porous biochar materials with high electron-ion conductivity and adjustable three-dimensional (3D) macro-meso-micropore is prepared successfully. Due to its unique physical structure, the resulting material has a specific surface area of 2124.9&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a cumulative pore volume of 1.19&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The presence of micropores can effectively physically adsorb polysulfides and mesopores ensure the accessibility of lithium ions and active sites and give the porous carbon material a high specific surface area. The large pores provide channels for the storage of electrolyte and the transmission of ions on the surface of the substrate. The combined effect of these three kinds of pores and the N doping formed in-situ can effectively promote the cycle and rate performance of the battery. Therefore, prepared cathode can still reach a reversible discharge capacity of 616&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a rate of 5&#8197;C. After 400 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 1&#8197;C, the reversible capacity is maintained at 510.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This new strategy has provided a new approach to the research and industrial-scale production of adjustable hierarchical porous biochar materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Fabrication of Pd/Mg2P2O7 via a Struvite&#8208;Template Way from Wastewater and Application as Chemoselective Catalyst in Hydrogenation of Nitroarenes</title>

One man&#8216;s trash is another man&#8216;s treasure: A novel template strategy allows fibrous struvite&#8212;a composite Pd/Mg2P2O7 with a mesoporous structure and an ultrahigh surface area&#8212;to be synthesized from wastewater. The prepared Pd/Mg2P2O7 nanowires showed excellent performance in the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzenes. This strategy provided a new pathway for synthesizing highly efficient catalysts as well as a solution for alleviate eutrophic pollution caused by N&#8208; and P&#8208;containing substances in wastewater.







Abstract
A highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst Pd/Mg2P2O7 was fabricated by combining palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) and mesoporous Mg2P2O7 fibers/rods. Mg2P2O7 fibers with ultra&#8208;high specific surface area were prepared from struvite as templates, which were synthesized from waste water containing N&#8208; and P&#8208;containing pollutants. This strategy provided a novel pathway for developing advanced catalysts from eutrophication&#8208;polluted water. The composite Pd/Mg2P2O7 showed brilliant performance in selective hydrogenation of nitro aromatics to give anilines. As an example of nitrobenzene hydrogenation, the conversion to aniline and selectivity were found to reach almost 100&#8201;% at a temperature of T=90&#8201;&#176;C and under a pressure of P
=2.0&#8197;MPa. The superior performance was found to originate from PdNPs, which were boosted by electron transfer afforded by the nanofiber Mg2P2O7 supports. The favorable adsorption of withdrawing groups (&#8722;NO2) was realized by synergistic effects between Pd and oxygen vacancies provided by pyrolysis of struvite. The catalyst remained stable after cycles of reuse with little degradation in catalytic performance.

         <title>Azide&#8208;Functionalized Derivatives of the Virulence&#8208;Associated Sugar Pseudaminic Acid: Chiral Pool Synthesis and Labeling of Bacteria</title>

Tailor&#8208;made derivatives of pseudaminic acid (Pse) allow for the detection of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria expressing this unique virulence&#8208;associated nonulosonic acid. The synthesis of azido&#8208;labeled Pse derivatives starting from d&#8208;glucose and respective labeling studies are described.







Abstract
Pseudaminic acid (Pse) is a significant prokaryotic monosaccharide found in important Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. This unique sugar serves as a component of cell&#8208;surface&#8208;associated glycans or glycoproteins and is associated with their virulence. We report the synthesis of azidoacetamido&#8208;functionalized Pse derivatives as part of a search for Pse&#8208;derived metabolic labeling reagents. The synthesis was initiated with d&#8208;glucose (Glc), which served as a cost&#8208;effective chiral pool starting material. Key synthetic steps involve the conversion of C1 of Glc into the terminal methyl group of Pse, and inverting deoxyaminations at C3 and C5 of Glc followed by backbone elongation with a three&#8208;carbon unit using the Barbier reaction. Metabolic labeling experiments revealed that, of the four Pse derivatives, ester&#8208;protected C5 azidoacetamido&#8208;Pse successfully labeled cells of Pse&#8208;expressing Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative strains. No labeling was observed in cells of non&#8208;Pse&#8208;expressing strains. The ester&#8208;protected and C5 azidoacetamido&#8208;functionalized Pse is thus a useful reagent for the identification of bacteria expressing this unique virulence&#8208;associated nonulosonic acid.

         <title>Inherent Ethyl Acetate Selectivity in a Trianglimine Molecular Solid</title>

         <dc:description>
The separation of ethyl acetate from its azeotropic mixtures with ethanol is of great importance in the industrial production of ethyl acetate. Current purification techniques include extractive distillation and azeotropic distillation are energy&#8208;intensive. Guided by crystal structure prediction, a &#8220;templating&#8221; strategy was used to construct selective binding sites in a trianglimine macrocycle crystal for the solvent molecule. These crystals exhibit inherently high selectivity towards ethyl acetate, reasonable kinetics, and show promise for real&#8208;life, practical dynamic separations.







Abstract
Ethyl acetate is an important chemical raw material and solvent. It is also a key volatile organic compound in the brewing industry and a marker for lung cancer. Materials that are highly selective toward ethyl acetate are needed for its separation and detection. Here, we report a trianglimine macrocycle (TAMC) that selectively adsorbs ethyl acetate by forming a solvate. Crystal structure prediction showed this to be the lowest energy solvate structure available. This solvate leaves a metastable, &#8220;templated&#8221; cavity after solvent removal. Adsorption and breakthrough experiments confirmed that TAMC has adequate adsorption kinetics to separate ethyl acetate from azeotropic mixtures with ethanol, which is a challenging and energy&#8208;intensive industrial separation.

         <title>CoOx@Co&#8208;NC Catalyst with Dual Active Centers for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution: Breaking Trade&#8208;Off of Particle Size and Metal Loading</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 41, Page 10657-10665, July 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up ligand&#8208;mediated strategy was developed to break the trade&#8208;off of particle size and metal loading, so the in&#8208;suit fabricated CoOx@Co&#8208;NC had a large metal loading with ultrafine metal dispersion. Ascribed to the dual active centers (CoOx nanoclusters and Co&#8208;N4 macrocycles), the as&#8208;synthesized CoOx@Co&#8208;NC showed higher oxygen evolution efficiency than the benchmark RuO2.







Abstract
Increasing the metal loading and downsizing the metal particle size are two effective ways to boost the electrochemical performance of catalysts. However, it is difficult to simultaneously increase the metal loading and reduce the particle size since isolated individual atoms are easy to aggregate into nanoparticles when increasing the metal loading. To tackle this contradiction, we report a bottom&#8208;up ligand&#8208;mediated strategy to facilely prepare ultrafine CoOx nanoclusters anchored on a Co&#8208;N&#8208;containing carbon matrix (CoOx@Co&#8208;NC). The co&#8208;exist of N and O atoms prevent Co atoms agglomerating into large particles and allowing the formation of ultrafine dispersed Co species with large Co loading (up to 20&#8197;wt.%). Since the relationship between ultrasmall size and large metal loading is well balanced, the CoOx nanoclusters have no inhibitory effect, but facilitate the catalytic performance of Co&#8208;N4 sites during OER process. Consequently, due to the synergistic effect of ultrafine CoOx nanoclusters and Co&#8208;N4 macrocycles, the as&#8208;synthesized CoOx@Co&#8208;NC exhibit promising OER activity (&#951;10=370&#8197;mV, Tafel plot=40&#8197;mV/dec), bettering than that of benchmark RuO2 (&#951;10=411&#8197;mV, Tafel plot=72&#8197;mV/dec).

     alt="CoOx@Co-NC Catalyst with Dual Active Centers for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution: Breaking Trade-Off of Particle Size and Metal Loading"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A bottom-up&lt;/b&gt; ligand-mediated strategy was developed to break the trade-off of particle size and metal loading, so the in-suit fabricated CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@Co-NC had a large metal loading with ultrafine metal dispersion. Ascribed to the dual active centers (CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters and Co-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; macrocycles), the as-synthesized CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@Co-NC showed higher oxygen evolution efficiency than the benchmark RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing the metal loading and downsizing the metal particle size are two effective ways to boost the electrochemical performance of catalysts. However, it is difficult to simultaneously increase the metal loading and reduce the particle size since isolated individual atoms are easy to aggregate into nanoparticles when increasing the metal loading. To tackle this contradiction, we report a bottom-up ligand-mediated strategy to facilely prepare ultrafine CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters anchored on a Co-N-containing carbon matrix (CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@Co-NC). The co-exist of N and O atoms prevent Co atoms agglomerating into large particles and allowing the formation of ultrafine dispersed Co species with large Co loading (up to 20&#8197;wt.%). Since the relationship between ultrasmall size and large metal loading is well balanced, the CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters have no inhibitory effect, but facilitate the catalytic performance of Co-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites during OER process. Consequently, due to the synergistic effect of ultrafine CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters and Co-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; macrocycles, the as-synthesized CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@Co-NC exhibit promising OER activity (&#951;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;=370&#8197;mV, Tafel plot=40&#8197;mV/dec), bettering than that of benchmark RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&#951;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;=411&#8197;mV, Tafel plot=72&#8197;mV/dec). This ligand-mediated strategy to synthesize carbonaceous materials containing dual active centers with large metal loading is promising for developing active and stable catalysts for electrocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Look on the bright side: Three new fluorescent aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes fused with fluorene or carbazole substituents show strong bathochromic shifts (up to 139&#8197;nm) of absorption and emission maxima compared to the parent 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyl aza&#8208;BODIPY (TPAB) and are highly photostable. Two of the dyes show excellent fluorescence brightness due to exceptionally high molar absorption coefficients (ca. 230&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and emission quantum yields (up to 0.66); the third dye was rendered pH sensitive by introducing a chlorophenol motif.







Abstract
Three new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes incorporating fused fluorene or carbazole moieties have been prepared. The dyes show significant enhancement of photophysical properties compared to the parent 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyl aza&#8208;BODIPY (TPAB): a bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum (up to 2700&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and emission maximum (up to 2270&#8197;cm&#8722;1); an almost threefold increase in molar absorption coefficients (to ca. 230&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and a significant increase in the fluorescence quantum yield to 49&#8211;66&#8201;%. Owing to the combination of these properties, the new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes belong to the brightest NIR dyes reported. The dyes also show excellent photostability. Due to their outstanding properties, the new dyes represent a promising platform for further exploration in biomedical research. A pH indicator containing only one fused carbazole unit was also prepared and shows absorption and emission spectra that are bathochromically shifted by about 110 and 100&#8197;nm, respectively, compared to the indicator dye based on the TPAB chromophore.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Reduction of Ketosteroids to Hydroxysteroids over Zr&#8208;Containing MOF&#8208;808 Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808&#8201;is a stable and reusable catalyst for the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reduction of 17&#8208;ketosteroids to elusive 17&#945;&#8208;hydroxysteroids compounds, as shown for the synthesis of 17&#945;&#8208;estradiol, androstan&#8208;3&#946;,17&#945;&#8208;diol, and epitestosterone. The process was carried out in a single step and without using toxic and/or expensive reagents. Temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic analysis of estrone reduction revealed that the diastereoselectivity to 17&#945;&#8208;estradiol originates from the confinement of the reaction inside the MOF cavities in which the Zr4+ active sites are located.







Abstract
Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808 is a very promising heterogeneous catalyst for the selective reduction of ketosteroids to the corresponding hydroxysteroids through a Meerwein&#8208;Ponndorf&#8208;Verley (MPV) reaction. Interestingly, the process leads to the diastereoselective synthesis of elusive 17&#945;&#8208;hydroxy derivatives in one step, whereas most chemical and biological transformations produce the 17&#946;&#8208;OH compounds, or they require several additional steps to convert 17&#946;&#8208;OH into 17&#945;&#8208;OH by inverting the configuration of the 17 center. Moreover, MOF&#8208;808 is found to be stable and reusable; it is also chemoselective (only keto groups are reduced, even in the presence of other reducible groups such as C=C bonds) and regioselective (in 3,17&#8208;diketosteroids only the keto group in position 17 is reduced, while the 3&#8208;keto group remains almost intact). The kinetic rate constant and thermodynamic parameters of estrone reduction to estradiol have been obtained by a detailed temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic analysis. The results evidence a major contribution of the entropic term, thus suggesting that the diastereoselectivity of the process is controlled by the confinement of the reaction inside the MOF cavities, where the Zr4+ active sites are located.

Biomass to battery: By using facile ball milling, N&#8208;enriched porous carbon/silica composites have been prepared from biomass rice husks as a high&#8208;performance anode material for lithium ion batteries. A uniform distribution between silica nanoparticles and carbon matrix, and a high level of N&#8208;incorporation are simultaneously achieved. The Li&#8208;storage mechanism of active silica in composites is available to improve the discharging capacity, and the increased capacitive behavior of electrode material provides fast electrochemical dynamics.







Abstract
A N&#8208;enriched porous carbon/SiO2 (SiO2/NC) composite from rice husks was prepared by ball milling and tested as a stable anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), in which the homogeneous dispersion of SiO2 nanoparticles and carbon matrix, and high level of N&#8208;doping can be realized simultaneously. The influence of N&#8208;doping on a series of SiO2/NCs was systematically studied; this proved that the porosity, N&#8208;doping content, and electronic conductivity of SiO2/NC can be controlled by adjusting common nitrogen sources (urea and melamine) and doping routes, including dry and wet milling, to reach a desirable balance of high capacity, long&#8208;term cyclability, and rate property. The optimized SiO2/NC composite delivers a stably reversible capacity of 581&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the high current load of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the 1000th cycle. The novel Li&#8208;storage mechanism of active silica in a composite was first proposed after observation of the N&#8208;doping effect that the redox reaction between SiO2 and Li+ is accelerated to transform into an alloying reaction of generated Si and Li+, thus enhancing the reversible capacity. Moreover, kinetics analysis confirms that there is a combined Li&#8208;storage mechanism of battery&#8208;capacitive pattern in composite that contributes to fast charge transfer and ion diffusion during cycle.

A Cp*Ir(III) complex bearing a pyridyl(benzamide)&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand exhibits aromatization/dearomatization on protonation/deprotonation. The proton&#8208;responsive unit of the title compound plays a key role in catalysing &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones and &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols using primary alcohols via a borrowing&#8208;hydrogen pathway.







Abstract
A Cp*Ir(III) complex (1) of a newly designed ligand L1 featuring a proton&#8208;responsive pyridyl(benzamide) appended on N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) has been synthesized. The molecular structure of 1 reveals a dearomatized form of the ligand. The protonation of 1 with HBF4 in tetrahydrofuran gives the corresponding aromatized complex [Cp*Ir(L1H)Cl]BF4 (2). Both compounds are characterized spectroscopically and by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The protonation of 1 with acid is examined by 1H NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. The proton&#8208;responsive character of 1 is exploited for catalyzing &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones and &#946;&#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols using primary alcohols as alkylating agents through hydrogen&#8208;borrowing methodology. Compound 1 is an effective catalyst for these reactions and exhibits a superior activity in comparison to a structurally similar iridium complex [Cp*Ir(L2)Cl]PF6 (3) lacking a proton&#8208;responsive pendant amide moiety. The catalytic alkylation is characterized by a wide substrate scope, low catalyst and base loadings, and a short reaction time. The catalytic efficacy of 1 is also demonstrated for the syntheses of quinoline and lactone derivatives via acceptorless dehydrogenation, and selective alkylation of two steroids, pregnenolone and testosterone. Detailed mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations substantiate the role of the proton&#8208;responsive ligand in the hydrogen&#8208;borrowing process.

Revisiting the chemical bond on silylene&#8208;carbonyl species reveals a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction between the CO and the silylene. The bonding can be conventionally understood as a &#963;&#8208;donation from the &#963;CO into the empty p&#8208;orbital of silicon, and a &#960;&#8208;back donation from the sp2 lone pair of silicon into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbitals. Nonetheless, an unrecognized &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;donation from the R&#8722;Si &#963;&#8208;orbital into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbital faithfully explains the relationship between structure and stability.







Abstract
Although silylene&#8208;carbonyl complexes are known for decades, only recently isolable examples have been accomplished. In this work, the bonding situation is re&#8208;evaluated to explain the origins of their remarkable stability within the Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory framework. It is shown that the chemical bond can be understood as CO interaction with the silylene via a donor&#8208;acceptor interaction: a &#963;&#8208;donation from the &#963;CO into the empty p&#8208;orbital of silicon, and a &#960;&#8208;back donation from the sp2 lone pair of silicon into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbitals. Notably, it was established that the driving force behind the surprisingly stable Si&#8722;CO compounds, however, is another &#960;&#8208;back donation from a perpendicular bonding R&#8722;Si &#963;&#8208;orbital into the &#960;*CO antibonding orbitals. Consequently, the pyramidalization of the central silicon atom cannot be associated with the strength of the &#960;&#8208;back donation, in sharp contrast to the established chemical bonding model. Considering this additional bonding interaction not only shed light on the bonding situation, but is also an indispensable key for broadening the scope of silylene&#8208;carbonyl chemistry.

Synthesis confirms structures: The first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;oxazolomycin B and (+)&#8208;oxazolomycin C was achieved in a longest linear sequence of 25 steps from the amino acid serine in 3.6 and 2.7&#8201;% overall yield, respectively. The completion of the total synthesis showed that the hypothesized structures of the natural products are correct.







Abstract
Efforts towards the first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;oxazolomycin B and (+)&#8208;oxazolomycin C from the intermediate of our previous synthesis of (+)&#8208;neoxazolomycin are reported. The syntheses were achieved in a longest linear sequence of 25 steps from the amino acid serine in 3.6 and 2.7&#8201;% overall yields, respectively. The efficiency of our approach is derived from silyl triflate&#8208;mediated reductive oxazolidine ring&#8208;opening and F&#252;rstner's Ru&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and protodesilylation reactions. The obtained spectra and optical rotations were in good agreement with those of natural products, thus confirming the structures.

Any colour will do: The synthesised high&#8208;surface&#8208;area, enriched, heterogeneous heptazine&#8208;based microporous polymeric network HMP&#8208;TAPA shows remarkable dual photo(catalytic) behaviour for efficient organic transformation reactions, that is, coupling reactions of benzylamine under visible light radiation and base&#8208;catalysed Knoevenagel condensation at room temperature. The engineered electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor moieties in the polymeric network allow the absorption of a broad range of visible light.







Abstract
A heptazine&#8208;based microporous polymeric network, HMP&#8208;TAPA was synthesised by direct coupling of trichloroheptazine and tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine (TAPA). A high surface area of 424&#8197;m2/g was achieved, which is the highest surface area among heptazine&#8208;based polymeric networks (HMPs). The tailored electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor units in HMP&#8208;TAPA give broad visible&#8208;light absorption. HMP&#8208;TAPA was employed as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for oxidative coupling of amines to imines under visible light irradiation with 98&#8201;% selectivity. Furthermore, the surface basicity of HMP&#8208;TAPA was used to achieve metal&#8208;free heterogeneous base catalysis for Knoevenagel condensation under base&#8208;free conditions with &gt;99&#8201;% conversion. In addition, HMP&#8208;TAPA showed extreme robustness over a wide pH range (1&#8211;14). The versatility and flexibility of the current material design is beneficial for understanding its photoactivity and surface basicity so as to design dual active (photo)catalyst materials for specific applications.

They can be photoactivated with visible light to generate PtII DNA interstrand crosslinks and cytotoxic ROS, and are thus promising photo&#8208;chemotherapeutic agents. Notably, a 4&#8208;NMe2 substituent red&#8208;shifted absorption of the naphthalimide ring, giving rise to its green&#8208;light photo&#8208;cytotoxicity.







Abstract
Photoactivatable agents offer the prospect of highly selective cancer therapy with low side effects and novel mechanisms of action that can combat current drug resistance. 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimides with their extended &#960; system can behave as light&#8208;harvesting groups, fluorescent probes and DNA intercalators. We conjugated N&#8208;(carboxymethyl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (gly&#8208;R&#8208;Nap) with an R substituent on the naphthyl group to photoactive diazido PtIV complexes to form t,t,t&#8208;[Pt(py)2(N3)2(OH)(gly&#8208;R&#8208;Nap)], R=H (1), 3&#8208;NO2 (2) or 4&#8208;NMe2 (3). They show enhanced photo&#8208;oxidation, cellular accumulation and promising photo&#8208;cytotoxicity in human A2780 ovarian, A549 lung and PC3 prostate cancer cells with visible light activation, and low dark cytotoxicity. Complexes 1 and 2 exhibit pre&#8208;intercalation into DNA, resulting in enhanced photo&#8208;induced DNA crosslinking. Complex 3 has a red&#8208;shifted absorption band at 450&#8197;nm, allowing photoactivation and photo&#8208;cytotoxicity with green light.

         <title>Comparative Investigation into the Complexation and Extraction Properties of Tridentate and Tetradentate Phosphine Oxide&#8208;Functionalized 1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline Ligands toward Lanthanides and Actinides</title>

The same, but different: Two phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands, the tetradentate 2,9&#8208;bis(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (L1) and tridentate 2&#8208;(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (L2), have been synthesized and studied comparatively for coordination and extraction with trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Although quite different extraction properties toward AmIII and EuIII were found between L1 and L2 due to their different hydrophobicity in nitrate media, they showed comparable affinity to trivalent f&#8208;block elements, as revealed by UV/vis titration, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculation.







Abstract
Two new phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands, tetradentate 2,9&#8208;bis(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;BPPhen, L1) and tridentate 2&#8208;(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;MPPhen, L2), were synthesized and studied comparatively for their coordination with trivalent actinides and lanthanides. The complexation mechanisms of these two ligands toward trivalent f&#8208;block elements were thoroughly elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectrometry, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solvent extraction, and theoretical calculation methods. NMR titration results demonstrated that 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 (metal to ligand) lanthanides complexes formed for L1, whereas 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;3 lanthanide complexes formed for L2 in methanol. The formation of these species was validated by fluorescence spectrometry, and the corresponding stability constants for the complexes of NdIII with L1 and L2 were determined by using UV/vis spectrophotometry. Structures of the 10&#8208;coordinated 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;type complexes of EuL1(NO3)3 and [EuL2(NO3)3(H2O)] Et2O in the solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In solvent&#8208;extraction experiments, L1 exhibited extremely strong extraction ability for both AmIII and EuIII, whereas L2 showed nearly no extraction toward AmIII or EuIII due to its high hydrophilicity. Finally, the structures and bonding natures of the complex species formed between AmIII/EuIII and L1/L2 were analyzed in DFT calculations.

         <title>Steric Effects on the Thermal Processes of Hemithioindigo Based Molecular Motor Rotation</title>

         <dc:description>
Understanding the detailed mechanism behind directional rotation of light driven molecular motors is a necessary prerequisite for the conscious design of their properties. In this work the influence of sterical hindrance on the speed of helix inversion in hemithioindigo&#8208;based molecular motors is elucidated. Unexpectedly, increasing steric hindrance at two different positions on the rotor fragment is found to have opposite effects: at the aliphatic position helix inversion is accelerated while at the aromatic position this process is slowed down.







Abstract
Tuning the thermal behavior of light driven molecular motors is fundamentally important for their future rational design. In many molecular motors thermal ratcheting steps are comprised of helicity inversions, energetically stabilizing the initial photoproducts. In this work we investigated a series of five hemithioindigo (HTI) based molecular motors to reveal the influence of steric hindrance in close proximity to the rotation axle on this process. Applying a high yielding synthetic procedure, we synthesized constitutional isomeric derivatives to distinguish between substitution effects at the aromatic and aliphatic position on the rotor fragment. The kinetics of thermal helix inversions were elucidated using low temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy and an in&#8197;situ irradiation technique. In combination with a detailed theoretical description, a comparative analysis of substituent effects on the thermal helix inversions of the rotation cycle is now possible. Such deeper understanding of the rotational cycle of HTI molecular motors is essential for speed regulation and future applications of visible light triggered nanomachines.

         <title>Molecular Tools for the Study of ADP&#8208;Ribosylation: A Unified and Versatile Method to Synthesise Native Mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;Ribosylated Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 41, Page 10621-10627, July 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides: A universal approach to synthesise mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides is presented. These peptides can provide a valuable tool for studying ADP&#8208;ribosylation. This is demonstrated by the synthesis of a variety of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides modified on Ser&#8208;, Thr&#8208; or Cys&#8208;residues, the latter of which can act as a stable isostere for Ser&#8208;ADPr as Cys&#8208;ADPr is not reversed by the Ser&#8208;ADPr hydrolase ARH3. Furthermore, in using these peptides, the first hydrolase capable of hydrolysing Cys&#8208;ADPr was identified.







Abstract
ADP&#8208;ribosylation (ADPr), as a post&#8208;translational modification, plays a crucial role in DNA&#8208;repair, immunity and many other cellular and physiological processes. Serine is the main acceptor for ADPr in DNA damage response, whereas the physiological impact of less common ADPr&#8208;modifications of cysteine and threonine side chains is less clear. Generally, gaining molecular insights into ADPr recognition and turn&#8208;over is hampered by the availability of homogeneous, ADP&#8208;ribosylated material, such as mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated (MARylated) peptides. Here, a new and efficient solid&#8208;phase strategy for the synthesis of Ser&#8208;, Thr&#8208; and Cys&#8208;MARylated peptides is described. ADP&#8208;ribosylated cysteine, apart from being a native post&#8208;translational modification in its own right, proved to be suitable as a stabile bioisostere for ADP&#8208;ribosylated serine making it a useful tool to further biochemical research on serine ADP&#8208;ribosylation. In addition, it was discovered that the Streptococcus pyogenes encoded protein, SpyMacroD, acts as a Cys&#8208;(ADP&#8208;ribosyl) hydrolase.

ADP-ribosylated cysteine, apart from being a native post-translational modification in its own right, proved to be suitable as a stabile bioisostere for ADP-ribosylated serine making it a useful tool to further biochemical research on serine ADP-ribosylation. In addition, it was discovered that the &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pyogenes&lt;/i&gt; encoded protein, &lt;i&gt;Spy&lt;/i&gt;MacroD, acts as a Cys-(ADP-ribosyl) hydrolase.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Heptacene: Synthesis and Its Hole&#8208;Transfer Property in Stable Thin Films</title>

Charge carrier&#8208;bagged: Heptacene has been synthesized in nine steps in a total yield of 10&#8201;%, and its hole&#8208;transfer properties have been measured by fabricating organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) devices. The best hole mobility performance was 2.2&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in a stable thin film of heptacene. The potential use of heptacene as an effective charge carrier is reported for the first time.







Abstract
Heptacene (1) has been produced via a monoketone precursor, 2, which was prepared from 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene in nine steps in a total yield of 10&#8201;%. Compound 2 was converted to 1 quantitatively by heating at 202&#8201;&#176;C. Heptacene exhibited high thermal stability in the solid state without any observable change over two months. To investigate the potential value of 1 as a material for p&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), top&#8208;contact OFET devices were fabricated by vacuum deposition of 1 onto a hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)/SiO2/Si substrate. The best hole mobility performance was 2.2&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This is the first report of stable heptacene being used in an effective device and examined for its charge carrier properties.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions: Reactivity Trends across the Periodic Table</title>

Periodic reactivity trends! Quantum chemical activation strain analyses reveal how various weakly interacting Lewis acids across the periodic table, based on hydrogen, pnictogen, chalcogen, and halogen bonds, accelerate the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and methyl acrylate by amplifying the degree of asynchronicity and reducing the Pauli repulsion between the reactants.







Abstract
The catalytic effect of various weakly interacting Lewis acids (LAs) across the periodic table, based on hydrogen (Group&#8197;1), pnictogen (Group&#8197;15), chalcogen (Group&#8197;16), and halogen (Group&#8197;17) bonds, on the Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition reaction between 1,3&#8208;butadiene and methyl acrylate was studied quantum chemically by using relativistic density functional theory. Weakly interacting LAs accelerate the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction by lowering the reaction barrier up to 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. The reaction barriers systematically increase from halogen&lt;hydrogen&lt;chalcogen&lt;pnictogen&#8208;bonded LAs, i.&#8201;e., the latter have the least catalytic effect. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that these LAs lower the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction barrier by increasing the asynchronicity of the reaction to relieve the otherwise destabilizing Pauli repulsion between the closed&#8208;shell filled &#960;&#8208;orbitals of diene and dienophile. Notably, the reactivity can be further enhanced on going from a Period 3 to a Period 5 LA, as these species amplify the asynchronicity of the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction due to a stronger binding to the dienophile. These findings again demonstrate the generality of the Pauli repulsion&#8208;lowering catalysis concept.

Mind the gap! Disabled scientists and students have been severely affected by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic; this must be urgently addressed to avoid entrenching existing inequalities. The graphical abstract includes a bar chart comparing the % disability declaration statistics for the UK population (&#8764;20% 2015&#8211;16), STEM first degree students (15.5%, 2018&#8211;19), STEM academics (3.8%, 2018&#8211;19), and UKRI grant applicants (&#8764;1%, 2014&#8211;19); and highlights the key recommendations given in the article: meaningful consultation, flexible working policies, disabled staff networks, and allyship.







Abstract
Scientists and students with disabilities have been severely affected by the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, and this must be urgently addressed to avoid further entrenching existing inequalities. The need for rapid decision&#8208;making, often by senior colleagues without lived experience of disabilities, can lead to policies which discriminate against scientists with disabilities.
This article reflects on disability declaration statistics and research in critical disability studies and social science to explore the challenges experienced by disabled scientists before and during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and highlights recommendations and examples of good practice to adopt in order to challenge ableism in STEM communities and workplaces. It is vital that disabled staff and students are fully involved in decision making. This is particularly important as we continue to respond to the challenges and opportunities associated with the ongoing COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and plan for a post&#8208;COVID&#8208;19 future.
This time of great change can be used as an opportunity to listen, learn, and improve working conditions and access for scientists with disabilities, and by doing so, for everyone.

         <dc:description>
A sandwich framework of &#960;&#8208;conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbon ligands was found to provide a unique coordination environment that facilitates unusual coupling of d8 RhI and d10 M0 (M=Pd, Pt). The molecular orbital analysis showed that the electron&#8208;accepting ability of the sandwich framework through back&#8208;donation allows the formation of a d&#963;&#8208;type Rh&#8208;Pd bond in a (d&#8208;d)18 electron system. More information can be found in the Communication by S. Sakaki, T. Murahashi, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101133).

A silyl hydride derivative of d&#8208;glucal was used conveniently as a bench&#8208;stable precursor for the construction of C&#8208;glycosidic bond. After activation by fluoride&#8208;mediated dehydrogenative hydrolysis, an intermediate silanol species was used for Hiyama arylation. Various aryl and heteroaryl C&#8208;glycosides, C&#8208;glycopeptides, as well as both a&#8208; and b&#8208;isomers of Dapagliflozin could be constructed rapidly and without the need for protecting groups. The cover image was designed by Tom&#225;&#353; Bello&#328; at IOCB Prague. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.&#8197;Parkan et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101052).

Lawsone is naturally obtained from Henna plant leaves (as shown in the cover image), which are responsible for the red&#8208;orange pigment properties. It is well known in the cosmetic industry as a natural coloring agent for hair, nails, and skin. Over the centuries, lawsone has been frequently used as a natural beauty product, but the pharmaceutical applications of lawsone and its analogs are still underexplored. To fulfill these shortcomings, we started utilizing lawsone as a synthon for a new class of cascade reactions to synthesize structurally complex molecules, which are analogues of biologically and pharmaceutically active molecules. We sincerely thank Dr. M. A. Pasha for the excellent design of the cover. More information can be found in the Communication by D.&#8197;B. Ramachary et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100985).

         <title>Cover Feature: Inherent Ethyl Acetate Selectivity in a Trianglimine Molecular Solid (Chem. Eur. J. 41/2021)</title>

Guided by crystal structure prediction, a &#8220;templating&#8221; strategy was used to construct selective binding sites in a trianglimine macrocycle crystal for ethyl acetate, an important chemical raw material and solvent. The resulting molecular crystals exhibit inherently high selectivity towards ethyl acetate, and hence can separate ethyl acetate from azeotropic mixtures with ethanol. The crystals show reasonable adsorption kinetics, good reliability after multiple adsorption cycles, and hold promise for practical separation or detection applications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G.&#8197;M. Day, M. Liu, A.&#8197;I. Cooper, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101510).

Transition metals play revolutionary role in achieving regioselective and chemodivergent C&#8722;H activation attaining step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economy. Introducing synthetically manipulative functional groups to omnipresent backbone 1,3&#8208;(benz)azoles has never been easier with this diverse set of metal catalysts and tailored ligands. This review article presents a collective summary of all metal catalysts used to rapidly extend the synthetic library of azoles.







Abstract
The skeletal presence of 1,3&#8208;azoles in a variety of bioactive natural products, pharmacophores, and organic materials demands the derivatization of such heteroarenes regioselectively.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transition metals&lt;/b&gt; play revolutionary role in achieving regioselective and chemodivergent C&#8722;H activation attaining step- and atom-economy. Introducing synthetically manipulative functional groups to omnipresent backbone 1,3-(benz)azoles has never been easier with this diverse set of metal catalysts and tailored ligands. This review article presents a collective summary of all metal catalysts used to rapidly extend the synthetic library of azoles.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skeletal presence of 1,3-azoles in a variety of bioactive natural products, pharmacophores, and organic materials demands the derivatization of such heteroarenes regioselectively. Plenty of cross-coupling as well as cyclocondensation reactions have been performed to build up these skeletons but remained commercially unrealizable. A couple of severe drawbacks are faced by these traditional protocols that require a more straightforward strategy to obviate them. Transition metal-catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged as a superior alternative in that context. 1,3-Azoles and their benzo counterparts have been extensively functionalized exploiting both noble and earth-abundant transition metals. Lately, C-2 functionalization have gained much traction due to the ease of attaining high regioselectivity and installation of synthetically manipulative functionalities. This critical review presents a bird&#8216;s eye view of all major C-2 functionalization of (benz)azoles catalyzed by a diverse set of metals performed over the past 15&#8197;years.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Gold Chemistry: From Simple Salts to Complexes for Regioselective C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 41, Page 10495-10532, July 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The focus of this review is to highlight the advances in catalysis by gold complexes and salts on C&#8722;H bond activation chemistry. In particular, it covers the gold&#8208;catalyzed regioselective as well as site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization with emphasis on structural features, mechanisms and contributing factors of the relevant reactions. Depending on the nature of substrate, this review was categorized into six sections along with discussing applications in natural product synthesis.







Abstract
Gold coordinated to neutral phosphines (R3P), N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) or anionic ligands is catalytically active in functionalizing various C&#8722;H bonds with high selectivity. The sterics/electronic nature of the studied C&#8722;H bond, oxidation state of gold and stereoelectronic capacity of the coordinated auxiliary ligand are some of the associated selectivity factors in gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond functionalization reactions. Hence, in this review a comprehensive update about the action of different types of gold catalysts, from simple to sophisticated ones, on C&#8722;H bond reactions and their regiochemical outcome is disclosed. This review also highlights the catalytic applications of Au(I)&#8208; and Au(III)&#8208;species in creating new opportunities for the regio&#8208; and site&#8208;selective activation of challenging C&#8722;H bonds. Finally, it also intends to stress the potential applications in selective C&#8722;H bond activation associated with a variety of heterocycles recently described in the literature.

         <title>Enantioselective Protonation of Cyclic Carbonyl Ylides by Chiral Lewis Acid Assisted Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 41, Page 10578-10582, July 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective protonation of cyclic carbonyl ylides by chiral Lewis acid assisted alcohol addition reactions featuring a dual catalytic system is reported. The unique heterobicyclic products bearing a quaternary heteroatom&#8208;substituted carbon center were obtained with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The alcohol adducts were successfully converted to optically active oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones by hydrolysis. Computational mechanistic studies indicated that a stepwise syn&#8208;addition of alcohols under the influence of a Lewis acid was favored.







Abstract
Chiral Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alcohol addition reactions to cyclic carbonyl ylides generated from N&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinones featuring a dual catalytic system are reported. Construction of a chiral quaternary heteroatom&#8208;substituted carbon center was accomplished in which the unique heterobicycles were obtained in good yields with high stereoselection. The alcohol adducts were successfully converted to optically active oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones by hydrolysis. Mechanistic studies by DFT calculations revealed that alcohols could be activated by Lewis acids, enabling enantioselective protonation of the carbonyl ylides.

The unique heterobicyclic products bearing a quaternary heteroatom-substituted carbon center were obtained with high diastereo- and enantioselectivities. The alcohol adducts were successfully converted to optically active oxazolidine-2,4-diones by hydrolysis.

Stable duplexes with Ag+&#8208;mediated cytosine&#8211;cytosine pairs were formed by all anomeric and enantiomeric combinations. The Ag+&#8208;mediated base pair of anomeric &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;dC (&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine) with enantiomeric &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;dC (&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine) is superior to the well&#8208;noted &#946;&#8208;d/&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;dC pair in view of stability and Tm increase.







Abstract
Dodecamer duplex DNA containing anomeric (&#945;/&#946;&#8208;d) and enantiomeric (&#946;&#8208;l/&#946;&#8208;d) 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine mismatches was studied with respect to base pair stability in the absence and presence of silver ions. Stable duplexes with silver&#8208;mediated cytosine&#8211;cytosine pairs were formed by all anomeric and enantiomeric combinations. Stability changes were observed depending on the composition of the mismatches. Most strikingly, the new silver&#8208;mediated base pair of anomeric &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;dC with enantiomeric &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;dC is superior to the well&#8208;noted &#946;&#8208;d/&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;dC pair in terms of stability.

         <title>Heterometallic d8&#8211;d10 Coupling of Rh(I) and M(0) (M=Pd, Pt) in a Sandwich Framework of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Ligands</title>

Outside the norm: The low&#8208;valent heterometallic pair, d8 RhI and d10 M0 (M=Pd, Pt), undergoes unusual coupling through Rh&#8722;M bond formation in the sandwich framework of cycloheptatriene. The molecular orbital analysis showed that Rh&#8722;M d&#963; bond (M=Pd, Pt) is formed in a (d&#8211;d)18 electron system through the back&#8208;donating interaction.







Abstract
A heterometallic M&#8722;M&#8242; bond formation is a key to construct atomically precise bimetallic clusters and materials. However, it is sometimes not straightforward to construct a heterometallic M&#8722;M&#8242; bond through conventional methods including redox condensation. Here, we found that a sandwich framework of &#960;&#8208;conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbon ligands provides a unique coordination environment that facilitates unusual coupling of d8 RhI and d10 M0 (M=Pd, Pt). The molecular orbital analysis showed that the electron&#8208;accepting ability of the sandwich framework through back&#8208;donation allows the formation of a d&#963;&#8208;type Rh&#8722;Pd bond in a (d&#8211;d)18 electron system.

&lt;p&gt;A heterometallic M&#8722;M&#8242; bond formation is a key to construct atomically precise bimetallic clusters and materials. However, it is sometimes not straightforward to construct a heterometallic M&#8722;M&#8242; bond through conventional methods including redox condensation. Here, we found that a sandwich framework of &#960;-conjugated unsaturated hydrocarbon ligands provides a unique coordination environment that facilitates unusual coupling of d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (M=Pd, Pt). The molecular orbital analysis showed that the electron-accepting ability of the sandwich framework through back-donation allows the formation of a d&#963;-type Rh&#8722;Pd bond in a (d&#8211;d)&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; electron system.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 41, Page 10563-10568, July 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stepwise or concerted, the outcome is the best: An asymmetric synthesis of benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octanes, basic antibiotic skeletons, in very good yields, dr and ee has been developed through the tandem Wittig/[3+2] annulation of lawsone aldehydes and phosphoranes under a catalytic amount of quinine&#8208;thiourea. The sustainability of this new reaction was investigated by changing various reaction coordinates; the catalyst was recovered at more than 50&#8201;%.







Abstract
Lawsone aldehydes were directly transformed into the biologically important, unique carbon skeleton of chiral methanobenzo[f]azulenes/methanodibenzo[a,d][7]annulenes in high dr and ee and in very good yields by using quinine&#8208;thiourea&#8208;catalyzed tandem Wittig/intramolecular Michael/intramolecular aldol reactions. This asymmetric catalytic tandem protocol will be highly useful because these final molecules are basic skeletons of important antibiotics.

         <title>TIPS&#8208;Ethynylated Naphthodiquinoline and Naphthodiacridine: Novel Diazabisacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 41, Page 10569-10573, July 21, 2021. </description>

Gluing together two monoazaacenes: The synthesis of two novel diazabisacenes with cata&#8208;annelated monoazaacene subunits sharing three joint bonds is reported. These &#8220;&#960;&#8208;extended pyrenes&#8221; exhibit global aromaticity with bond length alternations and optical spectra similar to acenes, thus justifying the term &#8220;bisacenes&#8221; for the compounds investigated. Introducing nitrogen into the bisacene backbone significantly increases stability compared to that of their hydrocarbon analogs.







Abstract
The synthesis of two diazabisacenes is reported. A bisboronated naphthalene was Suzuki&#8208;coupled to substituted ethyl nicotinates, then cyclized by intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation. The resulting diketones were alkynylated and reduced to give the title compounds, bis(TIPS&#8208;ethynyl)&#8208;substituted naphtha[1,8&#8208;gh:5,4&#8208;g&#8242;h&#8242;]diquinoline and naphtho[1,8&#8208;bc:5,4&#8208;b&#8242;c&#8242;]diacridine. Nitrogen incorporation stabilizes the bisacenes with respect to oxidation compared to their consanguine nonaza analogs.

         <title>A Water Molecule Triggers Guest Exchange at a Mono&#8208;zinc Centre Confined in a Biomimetic Calixarene Pocket: a Model for Understanding Ligand Stability in Zn Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, the ligand exchange mechanism at a biomimetic Zn  II  centre, embedded in a pocket mimicking the possible constrains induced by a proteic structure, is explored. The residence time of different guest ligands (dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and ethanol) inside the cavity of a calix[6]arene&#8208;based tris(imidazole) tetrahedral zinc complex was probed using 1D EXchange SpectroscopY NMR experiments. A strong dependence of residence time on water content was observed with no exchange occurring under anhydrous conditions, even in the presence of a large excess of guest ligand. These results advocate for an associative exchange mechanism involving the transient exo&#8208;coordination of a water molecule, giving rise to 5&#8208;coordinate Zn  II  intermediates, and inversion of the pyramid at the Zn  II&#160;  centre. Theoretical modelling by DFT confirmed that the associative mechanism is at stake. These results are particularly relevant in the context of the understanding of kinetic stability/lability in Zn proteins and highlight the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing ligand exchange and controlling the lability of Zn.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The direct C2&#8208;functionalization of pyridines via a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol using aryne multicomponent coupling is demonstrated.

Activated keto esters could also be employed as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones.

The initially generated pyridylidene intermediate undergoes a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl followed by an S  N  Ar process resembling the Smiles rearrangement to afford the desired products.</dc:description>

         <title>Dicyano&#8208;imidazole: A Facile Generation of Pure Blue TADF Materials for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of dicyano&#8208;imidazole&#8208;based molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties were synthesized to obtain pure blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The targeted molecules used dicyano&#8208;imidazole with a short&#8208;conjugated system as the electron acceptor to strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, and provide a relatively shallow energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The cyano group was selected to improve imidazole as an electron acceptor due to its prominent electron&#8208;transporting characteristics. The crowded molecular structure in space makes the electron donor and acceptor almost orthogonal, reducing the energy gap (&#916;EST) between the first excited singlet (S1) and the triplet (T1) states and introducing significant TADF property. The efficiencies of the blue&#8208;emissive devices with imM&#8208;SPAC and imM&#8208;DMAC obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs, which are 13.8% and 13.4%, respectively. Both of Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates are close to the saturated blue region at (0.17, 0.18) and (0.16, 0.19), respectively. Combining these tailor&#8208;made TADF compounds with specific device architectures, electroluminescent (EL) emission from sky&#8208;blue to deep&#8208;blue could be achieved, proving their great potential in EL applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Supramolecular Organic Frameworks Constructed by Amidinium&#8208;Carboxylate Salt Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a set of fluorescent supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) that incorporate aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) units within their frameworks. The fluorescent SOFs of this study were constructed by linking the tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based tetra(amidinium) cation  TPE  4+  and aromatic dicarboxylate anions through amidinium&#8208;carboxylate salt bridges. The resulting self&#8208;assembled structures are characterized by fluorescence quantum yields in the range of 4.6%~14%. This emissive behavior is ascribed to a combination of electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions that operate in concert to impede motions that would otherwise lead to excited state energy dissipation. Single crystal X&#8208;ray di&#64256;raction analyses revealed that the length of dicarboxylate anion bridges has a considerable impact on the structural features of the resulting frameworks. Nevertheless all SOFs prepared in the context of the present study were found display emissive features characteristic of TPE&#8208;based AIE luminogens with only a modest dependence on the structural specifics being seen. The SOFs reported here could be reversibly &#8220;broken up&#8221; and &#8220;reformed&#8221; in response to acid/base stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Midkine Interaction with Chondroitin Sulfate Model Synthetic Tetrasaccharides and Their Mimetics: The Role of Aromatic Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spatial structures of the active complex of midkine and synthetic chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharides have been solved by NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. The rigid ligand is enclosed by a flexible receptor, with an intrinsically disordered region. The 3D structure of the ligands remains as a helical, almost lineal structure, independently of the aromatic substituents introduced.







Abstract
Midkine (MK) is a neurotrophic factor that participates in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) development and neural stem cell regulation, interacting with sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is the natural ligand in the CNS. In this work, we describe the interactions between a library of synthetic models of CS&#8208;types and mimics. We did a structural study of this library by NMR and MD (Molecular Dynamics), concluding that the basic shape is controlled by similar geometry of the glycosidic linkages. Their 3D structures are a helix with four residues per turn, almost linear. We have studied the tetrasaccharide&#8208;midkine complexes by ligand observed NMR techniques and concluded that the shape of the ligands does not change upon binding. The ligand orientation into the complex is very variable. It is placed inside the central cavity of MK formed by the two structured beta&#8208;sheets domains linked by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Docking analysis confirmed the participation of aromatics residues from MK completed with electrostatic interactions. Finally, we test the biological activity by increasing the MK expression using CS tetrasaccharides and their capacity in enhancing the growth stimulation effect of MK in NIH3T3 cells.

         <title>Aromatic Trifluoromethylselenolation via Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trifluoromethylselenolation of arenes was performed through a metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization. This pallado&#8208;catalyzed reaction was based on the use of 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;amino&#8208;quinoline as directing group and trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as trifluoromethylselenolating reagent. This method was also extended to fluoroalkylselenolation reactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of trifluoromethylselenolated aromatic molecules via an auxiliary&#8208;assisted, palladium catalyzed, C&#8722;H bonds functionalization with trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as reagent is described. The mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;products can be preferentially formed. Some mechanistic investigations were realized to better understand the reaction. This methodology was also extended to fluoroalkylselenyl groups.

         <title>Magnesium Deintercalation From the Spinel&#8208;Type MgMn2&#8208;yFeyO4 (0.4&#8804;y&#8804;2.0) by Acid&#8208;Treatment and Electrochemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
Nanostructured MgxMn2&#8208;yFeyO4 with cubic spinel structures are studied. According to the DFT calculations, the intermediate compositions can be stable, and the voltage could be tailored with the composition. Partial replacement of Mn by Fe could improve the electrochemical cyclability, whereas the Fe would also induce a disorder of the spinel structure, thereby reducing the electrode capacity. The reactions for the acid&#8208;treatment are different for MgMn2O4 and MgFe2O4. The intermediate composition with low iron&#8208;content and acid&#8208;treatment exhibits a good electrochemical behavior.







Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries attract lots of attention because of their high safety and low cost compared to lithium batteries, and it is needed to develop more efficient electrode materials. Although MgMn2O4 is a promising material for the positive electrode in Mg rechargeable batteries, it usually exhibits poor cyclability. To improve the electrochemical behavior, we have prepared nanoparticles of MgMn2&#8208;yFeyO4. The XRD results have confirmed that when Mn3+ (Jahn&#8208;Teller ion) ions are replaced by Fe3+ (non&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller ion), the resulting MgMn2&#8208;yFeyO4 is a cubic phase. The structure and theoretical voltage are theoretically calculated by using the DFT method. The obtained samples have been chemically treated in acid solution for partial demagnesiation, and it is observed that the presence of iron inhibits the deinsertion of Mg through disproportionation and favors the exchange reaction. The electrochemical behavior in non&#8208;aqueous magnesium cells has been explored.

PtM/MxBy (M=Ni, Co, Fe) heterostructured nanobundles have been synthesized by a hydrothermal method and subsequent boride doping. The synergistic effect of heterostructured electrocatalysts facilitates electron transfer and hydrogen adsorption ensure the catalysts to possess excellent catalytic activity and stability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In addition, from the point of view of morphology, the PtM/MxBy NBs with 1D nanowire structure possess abundant active sites, high aspect ratios, which would undoubtedly boom the HER catalytic activity.







Abstract
Optimizing the electronic and synergistic effect of hybrid electrocatalysts based on Pt and Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts is of tremendous importance towards a superior hydrogen evolution performance under both acidic and alkaline conditions. However, developing an ideal Pt&#8208;based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst with moderated electronic structure as well as strong synergistic effect is still a challenge. Herein, we fabricated boron (B)&#8208;doped PtNi nanobundles by a two&#8208;step method using NaBH4 as the boron source to obtain PtNi/Ni4B3 heterostructures with well&#8208;defined nanointerfaces between PtNi and Ni4B3, achieving an enhanced catalytic HER performance. Especially, the PtNi/Ni4B3 nanobundles (PtNi/Ni4B3 NBs) can deliver a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the overpotential of 14.6 and 26.5&#8197;mV under alkaline and acidic media, respectively, as well as outstanding electrochemical stability over 40&#8197;h at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, this approach is also universal for the syntheses of PtCo/Co3B and PtFe/Fe49B with outstanding electrocatalytic HER performance.

Protons get a move on: A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP&#8208;1) was self&#8208;assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT&#8208;68, to synthesize MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68. The migration and leaching of MOP could be effectively prohibited if MOP&#8208;1 was encapsulated in the MOF&#8242;s cavities. Incorporation of MOP&#8208;1 makes the proton conductivity of MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 reach 1.14&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 98&#8201;% RH), which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of DUT&#8208;68.







Abstract
A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) was self&#8208;assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT&#8208;68, successfully to synthesize MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68. The MOP guest (MOP&#8208;1) has a diameter of about 20&#8197;&#197;, larger than that of the square windows (pore sizes of &#8764;14&#8197;&#197;) of DUT&#8208;68 but smaller than that of the rhombicuboctahedral cage (27.7&#8197;&#197;), which means that the migration and leaching of MOP&#8208;1 could be effectively prohibited if MOP&#8208;1 is encapsulated in the MOF&#8242;s cavities. The proton conductivity of MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 is 1.14&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 98&#8201;% relative humidity), which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of DUT&#8208;68. Compared with MOP&#8208;1&#8834;DUT&#8208;68, which was synthesized by impregnation, MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 is more prone to form faster proton&#8208;conduction pathways and thus provides higher proton conductivity.

         <title>Low&#8208;Concentration C2H6 Capture Enabled by Size Matching in the Ultramicropore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recorded C2H6adsorption at low concentration was achieved by precisely size matching in an ultramicroporous metal&#8211;organic framework. Low&#8208;Concentration Ethane Capture Enabled by Size Matching in the Ultramicropore (Chen et&#8197;al.).







Abstract
Low&#8208;concentration ethane capture is crucial for environmental protection and natural gas purification. The ideal physisorbent with strong C2H6 interaction and large C2H6 uptake at low&#8208;concentration level has rarely been reported, due to the large pKa value and small quadrupole moment of C2H6. Herein, we demonstrate the perfectly size matching between the ultramicropore (pore size of 4.6&#8197;&#197;) and ethane (kinetic diameter of 4.4&#8197;&#197;) in a nickel pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate metal&#8211;organic framework (IISERP&#8208;MOF2), which enables the record&#8208;breaking performance for low concentration C2H6 capture. IISERP&#8208;MOF2 exhibits the large C2H6 adsorption enthalpy of 56.7&#8197;kJ/mol, and record&#8208;high C2H6 uptake at low pressure of 0.01&#8211;0.1&#8197;bar and 298&#8197;K (1.8&#8197;mmol/g at 0.01&#8197;bar). Molecule simulations and C2H6&#8208;loading crystal structure analysis revealed that the maximized interaction sites in IISERP&#8208;MOF2 with ethane molecule originates the strong C2H6 adsorption. The dynamic breakthrough experiments for gas mixtures of C2H6/N2(1/999, v/v) and C2H6/CH4 (5/95, v/v) proved the excellent low&#8208;concentration C2H6 capture performance.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Formation by DNA Sequences Deficient in Guanines: Two Tetrad Parallel Quadruplexes Do Not Fold Intramolecularly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lesson on less: There are multiple ways a sequence with a reduced number of guanines can form a G&#8208;quadruplex. Parallel topology is unstable, unless stabilized by suitable capping sequences or dimerization.







Abstract
Guanine quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical forms of nucleic acids that are frequently found in genomes. The stability of G4s depends, among other factors, on the number of G&#8208;tetrads. Three&#8208; or four&#8208;tetrad G4s and antiparallel two&#8208;tetrad G4s have been characterized experimentally; however, the existence of an intramolecular (i.&#8201;e., not dimeric or multimeric) two&#8208;tetrad parallel&#8208;stranded DNA G4 has never been experimentally observed. Many sequences compatible with two&#8208;tetrad G4 can be found in important genomic regions, such as promoters, for which parallel G4s predominate. Using experimental and theoretical approaches, the propensity of the model sequence AATGGGTGGGTTTGGGTGGGTAA to form an intramolecular parallel&#8208;stranded G4 upon increasing the number of GGG&#8208;to&#8208;GG substitutions has been studied. Deletion of a single G leads to the formation of intramolecular G4s with a stacked G&#8208;triad, whose topology depends on the location of the deletion. Removal of another guanine from another G&#8208;tract leads to di&#8208; or multimeric G4s. Further deletions mostly prevent the formation of any stable G4. Thus, a solitary two&#8208;tetrad parallel DNA G4 is not thermodynamically stable and requires additional interactions through capping residues. However, transiently populated metastable two&#8208;tetrad species can associate to form stable dimers, the dynamic formation of which might play additional delicate roles in gene regulation. These findings provide essential information for bioinformatics studies searching for potential G4s in genomes.

         <title>Multilevel Chirality Transfer from Amino Acid Derivatives to Circularly Polarized Luminescence&#8208;Active Nanoparticles in Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (WP5), and l&#8208;/d&#8208;PyLys hydrochlorides, two&#8208;step chirality&#8208;transferring systems have been successfully fabricated in aqueous solution. The chirality originated from the point chirality of amino acid derivatives l&#8208;/d&#8208;PyLys hydrochloride, and transferred to the planar conformational chirality of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene pR&#8208;/pS&#8208;WP5. Then, two kinds of chiral nanoparticle were formed that exhibited L&#8208;/R&#8208;handed circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Chirality at different levels is widely observed in nature, but the clue to connect it all together, and the way chirality transfers among different levels are still obscure. Herein, a l&#8208;/d&#8208;lysine&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly system was constructed, in which two&#8208;step chirality transfer among three different levels was observed in aqueous solution. The chirality originated from the point chirality of amino acid derivatives l&#8208;/d&#8208;PyLys hydrochloride, and was transferred to the planar conformational chirality of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene pR&#8208;/pS&#8208;WP5. Then, with the aid of pR&#8208;/pS&#8208;WP5, nanoparticles were formed that exhibited L&#8208;/R&#8208;handed circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor of up to &#177;0.001, arising from pyrene chiral excimers. This multilevel chirality transfer not only provides a perspective to trace potential clues, and to pursue certain ways by which the chirality transfers, but also offers a strategy to create controllable CPL emission in aqueous media.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Initiated Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical hydrogenation of olefins via stepwise hydrogen atom transfer (HAT&#8208;OH) is a complementary approach to alkene reduction that has attracted considerable interest in recent years. Blue light photolysis of a cobalt(II) monohydride pincer complex enabled olefin hydrogenation via photo&#8208;initiated HAT&#8208;OH. Femtosecond pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy confirmed Co&#8211;H homolysis to a three&#8208;coordinate cobalt(I) complex, which binds H2 and catalyzes thermal HAT&#8208;OH even of unactivated alkenes.







Abstract
Outer&#8208;sphere radical hydrogenation of olefins proceeds via stepwise hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from transition metal hydride species to the substrate. Typical catalysts exhibit M&#8722;H bonds that are either too weak to efficiently activate H2 or too strong to reduce unactivated olefins. This contribution evaluates an alternative approach, that starts from a square&#8208;planar cobalt(II) hydride complex. Photoactivation results in Co&#8722;H bond homolysis. The three&#8208;coordinate cobalt(I) photoproduct binds H2 to give a dihydrogen complex, which is a strong hydrogen atom donor, enabling the stepwise hydrogenation of both styrenes and unactivated aliphatic olefins with H2 via HAT.

         <title>Chiral Resolution of Spin&#8208;Crossover Active Iron(II) [2x2] Grid Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trans&#8208;type ligand wrapping around the metal centers in an inter&#8208;woven style makes the complex to be in chiral. This separation of &#923; and &#916; forms of spin&#8208;crossover isomers was successfully achieved by appending the chiral moiety onto the parent ligand. The presence of spin&#8208;crossover and chirality makes these multifunctional complexes intriguing for the study of magneto&#8208;optical effects.







Abstract
Chiral magnetic materials are proposed for applications in second&#8208;order non&#8208;linear optics, magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism, among others. Recently, we have reported a set of tetra&#8208;nuclear Fe(II) grid complex conformers with general formula C/S&#8208;[Fe4L4]8+ (L: 2,6&#8208;bis(6&#8208;(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;d&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;d&#8242;]diimidazole). In the grid complexes, isomerism emerges from tautomerism and conformational isomerism of the ligand L, and the S&#8208;type grid complex is chiral, which originates from different non&#8208;centrosymmetric spatial organization of the trans type ligand around the Fe(II) center. However, the selective preparation of an enantiomerically pure grid complex in a controlled manner is difficult due to spontaneous self&#8208;assembly. To achieve the pre&#8208;synthesis programmable resolution of Fe(II) grid complexes, we designed and synthesized two novel intrinsically chiral ligands by appending chiral moieties to the parent ligand. The complexation of these chiral ligands with Fe(II) salt resulted in the formation of enantiomerically pure Fe(II) grid complexes, as unambiguously elucidated by CD and XRD studies. The enantiomeric complexes exhibited similar gradual and half&#8208;complete thermal and photo&#8208;induced SCO characteristics. The good agreement between the experimentally obtained and calculated CD spectra further supports the enantiomeric purity of the complexes and even the magnetic studies. The chiral resolution of Fe(II)&#8208; [2&#215;2] grid complexes reported in this study, for the first time, might enable the fabrication of magneto&#8208;chiral molecular devices.

         <title>Synthesis and Absorption Properties of Long Acenoacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple general synthesis of a new family of angularly fused acenoacenes was developed. The presented strategy is general enough to be employed also for the construction of substituted analogues and potentially their heteroanalogues. The structure of these acenoacenes represent, in fact, formal stitching of two acene units that share one double bond in the final product. This angular topology significantly improves their stability compared to their isoelectronic linear counterparts.







Abstract
Acenes, polyaromatic hydrocarbons composed of linearly fused benzene rings have received immense attention due to their performance as semiconductors in organic optoelectronic applications. Their appealing physicochemical properties, such as extended delocalization, high charge carrier mobilities, narrow HOMO&#8208;LOMO gaps and partially radical character in the ground state make them very attractive targets for many potential applications. However, the intrinsic synthetic challenges of unsubstituted members such as high reactivity and poor solubility are still limiting factors for their wider exploitation. Herein, we report a simple general synthesis of a new family of angularly fused acenoacenes with improved stability compared to their isoelectronic linear counterparts. The synthesis and comprehensive characterization of pentacenopentacene, pentacenohexacene and hexacenohexacene, with lengths between decacene and dodecacene, are disclosed.

         <title>Analyzing anisotropic exchange in a pentanuclear Os2Ni3 complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spin Hamiltonian parameters of a pentanuclear Os  III  2  Ni  II  3  cyanometallate complex are derived from ab initio wave function based calculations, namely valence&#8208;type configuration interaction calculations with a complete active space including spin&#8208;orbit interaction (CASOCI) in a singlestep procedure. While fits of experimental data performed so far could reproduce the data but the resulting parameters were not satisfactory, the parameters derived in the present work reproduce experimental data and at the same time have a reasonable size.&#160; Exchange interactions (both isotropic and anisotropic) obtained from CASOCI have to be scaled by a factor of 2.5 to obtain agreement with experiment, a known deficiency of such types of calculation. After scaling the parameters, the isotropic Os&#8208;Ni exchange coupling constant is  J  = &#8722;4.2 cm  &#8722;1  and the  D  parameter of the (nearly axial) anisotropic Os&#8208;Ni exchange is  D  =  J  k  &#8722;  J  &#8869;  = 18.8 cm  &#8722;1  , so anisotropic exchange is larger in absolute size than isotropic exchange. The negative value of the isotropic  J  (indicating antiferromagnetic coupling) seemingly contradicts the large&#8208;temperature behaviour of the temperature dependent susceptibility curve, but this is caused by the negative  g  value of the Os centres. This negative  g  value is a universal feature of a pseudo&#8208;octahedral coordination with configuration and strong spin&#8208;orbit interaction.

While fits of experimental data performed so far could reproduce the data but the resulting parameters were not satisfactory, the parameters derived in the present work reproduce experimental data and at the same time have a reasonable size.&#160; Exchange interactions (both isotropic and anisotropic) obtained from CASOCI have to be scaled by a factor of 2.5 to obtain agreement with experiment, a known deficiency of such types of calculation. After scaling the parameters, the isotropic Os-Ni exchange coupling constant is  J  = &#8722;4.2 cm  &#8722;1  and the  D  parameter of the (nearly axial) anisotropic Os-Ni exchange is  D  =  J  k  &#8722;  J  &#8869;  = 18.8 cm  &#8722;1  , so anisotropic exchange is larger in absolute size than isotropic exchange. The negative value of the isotropic  J  (indicating antiferromagnetic coupling) seemingly contradicts the large-temperature behaviour of the temperature dependent susceptibility curve, but this is caused by the negative  g  value of the Os centres. This negative  g  value is a universal feature of a pseudo-octahedral coordination with configuration and strong spin-orbit interaction. Knowing the size of these exchange interactions is important because Os(CN) is a versatile building block for the synthesis of 5  d  /3  d  magnetic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>A catalytic domino reduction&#8722;imine formation&#8722;intramolecular cyclization&#8722;oxidation for the general synthesis of a wide variety of biologically relevant N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as quinoxaline&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;fused derivatives, and phenanthridines, is reported. A simple, easily available, and environmentally friendly dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex has proven to be a highly efficient and versatile catalyst for transforming a broad range of starting nitroarenes involving several redox processes. Not only is this a sustainable, step&#8208;economical as well as air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;tolerant method, but also it is worth highlighting that the waste byproduct generated in the first step of the sequence is recycled and incorporated in the final target molecule, improving the overall synthetic efficiency. Moreover, selected indoloquinoxalines have been photophysically characterized in cyclohexane and toluene with exceptional fluorescence quantum yields above 0.7 for the alkyl derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Fjord Substitution in Expanded Helicenes: Effects of the Insert in the Inversion Barrier and Helical Pitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of expanded helicenes of different sizes and shapes incorporating phenyl&#8208; and biphenyl&#8208;substituents at the inner part of their fjord have been synthesized via sequential Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of appropriately designed diynes, and their racemization barriers have been calculated employing electronic structure methods. These show that the overall profile of the inversions (energies, number of transition states and intermediates, and their relative position) is intensively affected by the interplay of steric and attractive London dispersion interactions. Hence, in&#8208;fjord substitution constitutes an additional tool to handle the mechanical properties in helicenes of uncommonly large diameter. The photochemical characterization of the newly prepared helical structures is also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Metal Phosphides as Superior Host Materials for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For the past few years, a new generation of energy storage system with large theoretical specific capacity is urgently needed because of the rapid development of the society. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates of novel battery systems, when resurged at the end of the 21st century. Li&#8208;S batteries have attracted more and more attention, attributed to their notably high theoretical energy density of 2600 W h kg  &#8208;1  which almost quintuple larger than that of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). One of the most determined factors in Li&#8208;S batteries is how to design/prepare the sulfur cathode. As for the sulfur host, the major technical challenge is avoiding the shuttling effect which caused by soluble polysulfides during the reaction. In the past decades, though the sulfur cathode has made great development, there are also some enormous challenges needing to conquered, such as low utilization of S, rapid decay of capacity and poor cycle life. This article spotlights the recent progress and foremost findings in improving the battery performance of Li&#8208;S batteries by employing multi&#8208;functional metal phosphides as host materials. The nowadays state of development of sulfur electrode of Li&#8208;S batteries is summarized by emphasizing the relationship between essential properties of metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, chemical reaction with lithium polysulfides and the latterly influence on electrochemical performance. Finally, the development trend and practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries are also pointed out in the review.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights from Binding on Quadruplex Selective Carbazole Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A summary is provided of the most promising carbazole ligands that have been established as effective G&#8208;quadruplex binders. The focus is made on the structural design of carbazole ligands and on NMR analysis of carbazole&#8208;G4 interactions with particular attention to the variety in binding modes shown by the carbazole ligands. Further, a brief view on biophysical and biological data of their molecular interactions with G&#8208;quadruplexes has been discussed.







Abstract
Polymorphic G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) secondary DNA structures have received increasing attention in medicinal chemistry owing to their key involvement in the regulation of the maintenance of genomic stability, telomere length homeostasis and transcription of important proto&#8208;oncogenes. Different classes of G4 ligands have been developed for the potential treatment of several human diseases. Among them, the carbazole scaffold with appropriate side chain appendages has attracted much interest for designing G4 ligands. Because of its large and rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugation system and ease of functionalization at three different positions, a variety of carbazole derivatives have been synthesized from various natural or synthetic sources for potential applications in G4&#8208;based therapeutics and biosensors. Herein, we provide an updated close&#8208;up of the literatures on carbazole&#8208;based G4 ligands with particular focus given on their detailed binding insights studied by NMR spectroscopy. The structure&#8208;activity relationships and the opportunities and challenges of their potential applications as biosensors and therapeutics are also discussed. This review will provide an overall picture of carbazole ligands with remarkable G4 topological preference, fluorescence properties and significant bioactivity; portraying carbazole as a very promising scaffold for assembling G4 ligands with a range of novel functional applications.

         <title>Azo&#8208;Functionalized Zirconium Based Metal&#8722;Organic Polyhedron as an Efficient Catalyst for CO2 Fixation with Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical fixation of CO  2  as C1 source at ambient temperature and low pressure is an energy&#8208;saving way to make use of the green&#8208;house gas, but it still remains a challenge since efficient catalyst with high catalytic active sites is required. Here a novel monoclinic azo&#8208;functionalized Zr based metal organic polyhedron (Zr&#8208;AZDA) has been prepared and applied in CO  2  fixation with epoxides. The inherent azo groups not only endow Zr&#8208;AZDA with good solubilization, but also act as basic sites to enrich CO  2  showing efficient synergistic catalysis as confirmed by TPD&#8208;CO  2  analysis. XPS results demonstrate the Zr active sites in Zr&#8208;AZDA possess suitable Lewis acidity, which satisfies both substrates activation and products desorption. DFT calculation indicates the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in CO  2  cycloaddition could be reduced remarkably (by ca. 60.9%) in the presence of Zr&#8208;AZDA, which may rationalize the mild and efficient reaction condition employed (80  o  C and 1 atm of CO  2  ). The work provides an effective multi&#8208;functional cooperative method for improvement of CO  2  cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress and Perspectives on Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and Composites for Various Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), being a new member of crystalline porous materials&#8217; family, have emerged as important materials for energy storage/conversion/generation devices. They possess high surface areas, ordered micro/mesopores, designable structures and an ability to precisely control electro&#8208;active groups in their pores, which broaden their application window. Thanks to their low weight density, long range crystallinity, reticular nature and tunable synthesis approach towards two and three dimensional (2D and 3D) networks, they have been found suitable for a range of challenging electrochemical applications. Our review focuses on the progress made on the design, synthesis and structure of COFs and their composites for various&#160;energy applications, such as metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water&#8208;splitting and solar cells. Additionally, attempts have been made to correlate the structural and mechanistic characteristics of COFs with their applications.</dc:description>

Thanks to their low weight density, long range crystallinity, reticular nature and tunable synthesis approach towards two and three dimensional (2D and 3D) networks, they have been found suitable for a range of challenging electrochemical applications. Our review focuses on the progress made on the design, synthesis and structure of COFs and their composites for various&#160;energy applications, such as metal-ion batteries, supercapacitors, water-splitting and solar cells. Additionally, attempts have been made to correlate the structural and mechanistic characteristics of COFs with their applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effect of Heterometal&#8208;Functionalization and Template Exchange on the Redox Chemistry of Molecular Vanadium Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs) have emerged as material of interest in many applications such as energy storage and conversion due to their redox activity and molecularly defined structure. However, especially for polyoxovanadates a lack of understanding between structural modifications and physicochemical properties remains. The present study leverages a lacunary dodecavanadate to systematically investigate the electronic effect of heterometal functionalization. While structural distortion affects the stability of the cluster, the redox potentials correlate with the overall cluster charge. Furthermore, we report the first bromide&#8208;templated analogue of this cluster family. While the halide anion is crucial for the formation of the cluster, no major effect on the electrochemical properties is observed. By improving the understanding of structure&#8208;property&#8208;relationship in this work, we hope to enable a more predictable tuning of redox&#8208;properties of polyoxovandates.</dc:description>

         <title>Transient Directing Groups in Metal&#8208;Organic Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct functionalization of C&#8211;H bonds is among the most fundamental chemical transformations in organic synthesis. However, when the innate reactivity of the substrate cannot be utilized for the functionalization of a given single C&#8211;H bond, this selective C&#8211;H bond functionalization mostly relies on the use of directing groups that allow bringing the catalyst in close proximity to the C&#8211;H bond to be activated and these directing groups need to be installed before and cleaved after the transformation, which involves two additional undesired synthetic operations. These additional steps dramatically reduce the overall impact and the attractiveness of C&#8211;H bond functionalization techniques since classical approaches based on substrate pre&#8208;functionalization are still more straightforward and appealing. During the past decade, a different approach involving both the  in situ  installation and removal of the directing group, which can then often be used in a catalytic manner, has emerged: the transient directing group strategy. In addition to its innovative character, this strategy has brought C&#8211;H bond functionalization to an unprecedented level of usefulness and has enabled the development of remarkably efficient processes for the direct and selective introduction of functional groups onto both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. The processes unlocked by the development of these transient directing groups will be comprehensively overviewed in this review article.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Isomerism in the S3 State of the Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Complex Resolved by Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic and geometric structures of the water oxidizing complex of Photosystem II in the steps of the catalytic cycle that precede dioxygen evolution remain hotly debated. Recent structural and spectroscopic investigations support contradictory redox formulations for the active&#8208;site Mn4CaO x  cofactor in the final metastable S3 state. These range from the widely accepted Mn(IV)4 oxo&#8208;hydroxo model, which presumes O&#8211;O bond formation to occur in the ultimate transient intermediate (S4) of the catalytic cycle, to a Mn(III)2Mn(IV)2 peroxo model representative of the contrasting &#8220;early&#8208;onset&#8221; O&#8211;O bond formation hypothesis. Density functional theory energetics of suggested S3 redox isomers are inconclusive because of extreme functional dependence. Here we leverage the power of the domain&#8208;based local pair natural orbital approach to coupled cluster theory, DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T), to present the first correlated wave function theory calculations of relative stabilities for distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms of the S3 state. Our results enable us to evaluate conflicting models for the S3 state of the OEC and to quantify the accuracy of lower&#8208;level theoretical approaches. Our assessment of the relevance of distinct redox&#8208;isomeric forms for the mechanism of biological water oxidation strongly disfavors the scenario of early&#8208;onset O&#8211;O formation advanced by literal interpretations of certain crystallographic models. The present work serves as a case study in the application of modern coupled cluster implementations to redox isomerism problems in oligonuclear transition metal systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemistry platform for the ultrafast continuous synthesis of high quality III&#8208;V quantum dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chemistry platform for the fast continuous synthesis of III&#8208;V quantum dots is demonstrated. III&#8208;nitride QDs are prepared using short residence times (less than 30 s) in a one&#8208;step continuous process with supercritical solvents. GaN QDs prepared via this route exhibit strong UV photoluminescence with a structuring of the emission signal at low temperature (5K), confirming their high quality. An example of metal site substitution is given with the synthesis of InxGa1&#8208;xN solid solution. A continuous bandgap shift towards lower energies is demonstrated when increasing indium content with strong photoluminescence signals from UV to visible. The chemistry platform proposed could be easily extrapolated to binary and ternary III phosphides or arsenides with the homologous V source.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide with a Copper Graphitic Carbon Nitride Photocathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research on the photoreduction of CO  2  &#160;has been often dominated by the use of sacrificial reducing agents. A pathway that avoids this problem would be the development of photocathodes for CO  2  &#160;reduction that could then be coupled to a photoanodic oxygen evolution reaction. Here, we present the use of copper substituted graphitic carbon nitride (Cu&#8208;CN) on a fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) electrode for the photoelectrochemical two&#8208;electron reduction of CO  2  &#160;to CO as a major product (&gt;95%) and formic acid (&lt;5%). The results show that at a potential of &#8208;2.5 V versus Fc\Fc  +  &#160;the CO  2  &#160;reduction activity of Cu&#8208;CN on FTO electrode improves by 25% upon illumination by visible light with a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%. Independently, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy conclusively shows a pronounced increase in the electrical conductivity of the Cu&#8208;CN upon white light illumination under vacuum and a contactless measuring configuration. This photo&#8208;assisted charge mobility is shown to play a key role in the increased reactivity and faradaic efficiency for the reduction of CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold (I) catalyzed formal [4+2] cycloaddition of O &#8208;aryl ynol ethers 1 and enol ethers 2 is described. This intermolecular reaction between two electron&#8208;rich unsaturated systems takes place, under mild conditions, in the presence of 5 mol% [IPrAu(CH 3 CN)]SbF 6 as catalyst giving chromene derivatives with good yields. The cycloaddition is completely regio&#8208; and stereoselective, as well as versatile for both reactives. Silyl enol ethers also can react in the same way and in the same reaction conditions with quantitative yields. A plausible mechanism through a selective addition of the enol ether to the alkyne gold activated complex followed by an intramolecular aromatic electrophilic substitution is proposed. Several experimental results support the presence of a cationic oxonium intermediate prior to the aromatic substitution. The reaction represents a new entry to the chromene core,</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic and Computational Study of Boronium Ionic Liquids and Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boronium cation&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) have demonstrated high thermal stability and a &gt;5.8 V electrochemical stability window. Additionally, IL&#8208;based electrolytes containing the salt LiTFSI have shown stable cycling against the Li metal anode, the &#8220;Holy grail&#8221; of rechargeable lithium batteries. However, the basic spectroscopic characterisation needed for further development and effective application is missing for these promising ILs and electrolytes. In this work, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used in combination to characterise four ILs and electrolytes based on the [NNBH2]+  and [(TMEDA)BH2] &#160;boronium cations and the [FSI]&#8211;  and [TFSI]&#8211;  anions. Using this combined experimental and computational approach, proper understanding of the role of different ion&#8208;ion interactions for the Li cation coordination environment in the electrolytes was achieved. Furthermore, the calculated vibrational frequencies assisted in the proper mode assignments for the ILs and in providing insights into the spectroscopic features expected at the interface created when they are adsorbed on a Li(001) surface. A reproducible synthesis procedure for [(TMEDA)BH2]+  is also reported. The fundamental findings presented in this work are beneficial for any future studies that utilise IL based electrolytes in next generation Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Covalent Delivery Systems for Volatile Compounds&#160;(Part 1): Controlled Hydrolysis of Micellar Amphiphilic Imines in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite their intrinsic hydrolysable character, imine bonds can become remarkably stable in water when self&#8208;assembled in amphiphilic micellar structures. In the present article, we systematically study some of these structures and the influence of various parameters that can be used to take control over their hydrolysis, including pH, concentration, position of the imine function in the amphiphilic structure, relative lengths of the linked hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. Thermodynamic and kinetic data lead us to the rational design of stable imines in water, partly based on the location of the imine function within the hydrophobic part of the amphiphile and on a predictable quantitative term that we define as the total hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB). In addition, we show that such stable systems are also stimuli&#8208;responsive and therefore, of potential interest in trapping and releasing micellar components on demand.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Covalent Delivery Systems for Volatile Compounds (Part 2): Fragrance&#8208;Releasing Cleavable Surfactants in Functional Perfumery Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amphiphilic imines prepared by condensation of a hydrophobic fragrance aldehyde with a hydrophilic amine derived from a hydrophilic poly(propylene oxide) and poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymer were investigated as cleavable surfactant profragrances in applications of functional perfumery. In water, the cleavable surfactants assemble into micelles that allow solubilization of perfume molecules that are not covalently attached to the surfactant. Dynamic headspace analysis on a glass surface showed that solubilized perfume molecules evaporated in a similar manner in the presence of the cleavable surfactant as compared with a non&#8208;cleavable reference surfactant. Under application conditions, the cleavable surfactant imine hydrolysed to release the covalently linked fragrance aldehyde. The profragrances were stable during storage in aqueous media and upon dilution showed a blooming effect for the hydrolytical fragrance release and a more balanced performance of a solubilized perfume by retaining the more volatile fragrances and boosting the evaporation of the less volatile fragrances.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Cy3 FRET System to Analyze Photoactive DNA Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new FRET system for structural analyses of DNA duplexes using perylene and Cy3 as donor and acceptor, respectively, linked at the termini of a DNA duplex via D&#8208;threoninol. Experimentally obtained FRET efficiencies were in good agreement with theoretical values calculated based on canonical B&#8208;form DNA. Due to the relatively long F&#246;rster radius, this system can be used to analyze large DNA structures, and duplexes containing photo&#8208;reactive molecules can be analyzed since perylene can be excited with visible light. The system was used to analyze a DNA duplex containing stilbene, demonstrating that in the region of the stilbene cluster the duplex adopts a ladder&#8208;like structure rather than helical one. Upon photodimerization between stilbene residues, FRET efficiencies indicated the reaction does not disturb DNA duplex. This FRET system will be useful for analysis of photoreactions of nucleobases as well as a wide range of nucleic acid structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Frustrated Lewis&#8208;Pair Neighbors at the Xanthene Framework: Epimerization at Phosphorus and Cooperative Formation of Macrocyclic Adduct Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The meso and rac diastereoisomers of two P&#8208;stereogenic 4,5&#8208;bis(mesityl,alkynylphosphanyl)dimethylxanthenes underwent slow thermally induced interconversion. The activation barrier of the P&#8208;propynyl derivative was determined experimentally and by DFT calculation. Adding HB(C6F5)2 to the tert&#8208;butylethynyl&#8208;P&#8208;containing system gave intramolecular pairs of geminal frustrated P/B Lewis pairs at the xanthene&#8208;derived backbone. This reaction also proceeded with epimerization of the P&#8208;stereogenic phosphanyl units. The new FLP pairs at the xanthene backbone formed bridged macrocyclic adducts with a variety of bifunctional Lewis base donors.







Abstract
Attachment of a pair of P&#8208;stereogenic mesityl(alkynyl)phosphanyl groups at the 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions of a 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene framework gave mixtures of the respective rac&#8208; and meso&#8208;bisphosphanyl diastereoisomers. They slowly epimerized in a thermally induced reaction with Gibbs activation barriers of about 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at room temperature (measured and DFT calculated). The reaction of the meso&#8208;mesityl(tert&#8208;butylethynyl)phosphanyl derivative with two molar equivalents of Piers&#8242; borane [HB(C6F5)2] led to the formation of the alkylidene&#8208;bridged geminal bisphosphane/borane&#8208;frustrated Lewis pair system. The compound was obtained enriched (&gt;85&#8201;%) in the rac diastereoisomer. With a variety of bifunctional donor substrates, the rac&#8208;bis&#8208;P/B FLP formed macrocyclic compounds. They were all formally derived from meso&#8208;configurated diastereoisomers of the bisphosphanylxanthene backbone.

         <title>Polymerization of Allenes by Using an Iron(II) &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Pre&#8208;Catalyst to Generate High Mn Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare example of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of aryl allenes is presented. Reactions are mild and generate very high Mn polymers with narrow polydispersity by using a well&#8208;defined Fe(II) pre&#8208;catalyst and a hydride additive. [2+2] cycloaddition to form cyclobutanes is also viable using the same catalytic system.







Abstract
Herein, we report an iron(II)&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of arylallenes. This reaction proceeds rapidly at room temperature in the presence of a hydride co&#8208;catalyst to generate polymers of weight up to Mn=189 000&#8197;Da. We have determined the polymer structure and chain length for a range of monomers through a combination of NMR, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. Mechanistically, we postulate that the co&#8208;catalyst does not react to form an iron(II) hydride in&#8197;situ, but instead the chain growth is proceeding via a reactive Fe(III) species. We have also performed kinetic and isotopic experiments to further our understanding. The formation of a highly unusual 1,3&#8208;substituted cyclobutane side&#8208;product is also investigated.

         <title>Upgrading Octane Number of Naphtha by a Robust and Easily Attainable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework through Selective Molecular Sieving of Alkane Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time for an upgrade: The separation of alkane isomers is investigated on a simple, easily available metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), Co3(HCOO)6. The compound is capable of splitting monobranched and dibranched alkanes through selective molecular exclusion. In addition, the material exhibits excellent separation of naphtha, outperforming benchmark zeolites and MOFs, making it a promising candidate for naphtha separation and RON upgrading.







Abstract
The separation of alkanes, particularly monobranched and dibranched isomers, is of paramount importance in the petrochemical industry for optimizing the feedstock of ethylene production as well as for upgrading the octane number of gasoline. Here, we report the full separation of linear/monobranched alkanes from their dibranched isomers by a robust and easily scalable metal&#8208;organic framework material, Co3(HCOO)6. The compound completely excludes dibranched alkanes but adsorbs their linear and monobranched isomers, as evidenced by single&#8208;component and multicomponent adsorption measurements. More importantly, the material exhibits excellent performance in separating naphtha and is capable of providing high quality feedstock for the production of ethylene and gasoline components with high octane number, making it a promising candidate for naphtha separation in petrochemical industry.

         <title>Walter Reppe Revival &#8211; Identification and Genesis of Copper Acetylides Cu2C2 as Active Species in Ethynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>More than six decades after proposing copper acetylide, Cu  2  C  2  , as catalytically active species in ethynylation reactions by Walter Reppe, the explosive species have been experimentally identified and investigated during catalysis in detail now. Taking into account specific safety precautions, unequivocal qualitative characterization was achieved by Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction of supported copper catalysts Cu/Bi/SiO  2  during and after activation and catalysis in comparison to bulk Cu  2  C  2  materials. Quantification of Cu  2  C  2  succeeded by thermal analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Its formation in aqueous suspension is studied starting from copper(II) oxide catalysts including dissolution, reduction and precipitation steps. Copper acetylide formation can be correlated with catalytic performance in the ethynylation of formaldehyde to 1,4&#8208;butynediol.</dc:description>

         <title>Quadruple Role of Pd Catalyst in Domino Reaction Involving Aryl to Alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd Migration to Access 1,9&#8208;Bridged Triptycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 1,8,13&#8208;tribromo&#8208;9&#8208;methoxytriptycenes is reported. Under conventional Suzuki coupling conditions, the triptycenes underwent multiple transformations to give 1,9&#8208;bridged triptycenes. Based on mechanistic investigations, a single Pd catalyst functions as Pd0, PdII and PdIV species to catalyze four distinct processes: 1)&#8197;aryl&#8208;to&#8208;alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd migration, 2)&#8197;intramolecular arylation, 3)&#8197;homocoupling of phenylboronic acid and 4)&#8197;Suzuki coupling.

         <title>Monitoring the Structure Evolution of Titanium Oxide Photocatalysts: From the Molecular Form via the Amorphous State to the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanium oxide photocatalysts with ordered domains of less than 7 &#197; in size were synthesized from titanium(IV) ethoxide as molecular precursor. UV light induces a color change from white to dark, corresponding to a change in the oxidation state of Ti. Upon heating, the structural order in the core of the as&#8208;synthesized particle extends. During transformation to anatase, the changes in the local structure were investigated by in situ total scattering experiments and subsequent pair distribution function (PDF) analysis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Weidenthaler et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101117).

         <title>C=C Bond Oxidative Cleavage of BODIPY Photocages by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to the cleavage of C&#8722;X single bonds, the photoreaction of the C=C bonds of electron&#8208;rich oxidative alkenes remains a challenge. This work presents a novel photoactivation of dialkenyl&#8208;substituted BODIPY photocages to release para&#8208;hydroxy benzaldehyde under visible light illumination in an aqueous environment through a formal [2+2] cycloaddition of singlet oxygen and a double bond. A real&#8208;time monitoring assay revealed that a mannose&#8208;functionalized photocage can target HepG2 cancer cells and release an aldehyde and a biothiol probe under illumination. More information can be found in the Communication by J. Geng et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101833).

         <title>The CdIn2S4/WO3 Nanosheet Composite Has a Significantly Enhanced Photo&#8208;electrochemical Cathodic Protection Performance and Excellent Electron Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrochemical cathodic protection technology is considered to be a green technology that protects metals from corrosion as it uses solar energy for corrosion protection and does not consume any anode materials. A CdIn2S4/WO3 nanosheet composite film with electron self&#8208;storage properties was synthesized and used as a photoelectrode to couple with metallic materials to provide photoelectrochemical cathodic protection under light illumination and continuous cathodic protection in the dark. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z. Chen et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101479).

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The story of C&#8208;C bond formation includes several reactions, and surely Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura is among the most outstanding ones. Herein, a brief historical overview of insights regarding the reaction mechanism is provided. In particular, the formation of the catalytically active species is probably the main concern, thus the preactivation is in competition with, or even assumes the role of the rate determining step (rds) of the overall reaction. Computational chemistry is key in identifying the rds and thus leading to milder conditions on an experimental level by means of predictive catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Osteosarcoma stem cell potent gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complexes bearing diflunisal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cell (OSC) properties of a series of gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complexes (5&#8208;7) containing diflunisal, a non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug. The most effective complex within the series,  6  (containing 3,4,7,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) displayed similar potency towards bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs, in the nanomolar range. Remarkably,  6  exhibited significantly higher monolayer and sarcosphere OSC potency (up to three orders of magnitude) than clinically approved drugs used in frontline (cisplatin and doxorubicin) and secondary (etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin) osteosarcoma treatments. Mechanistic studies show that  6  downregulates cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) and kills osteosarcoma cells in a COX&#8208;2 dependent manner. Furthermore,  6  induces genomic DNA damage and caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge,  6  is the first metal complex to kill osteosarcoma cells by simultaneously inhibiting COX&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8211;&#948;Ge136 from a Redox&#8208;Preparation Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metastable type&#8208;II clathrate Na  24&#8208;  &#948;  Ge  136  was obtained from Na  12  Ge  17  by applying a two&#8208;step procedure. At first, Na  12  Ge  17  was reacted at 70&#160;&#176;C with a solution of benzophenone in the ionic liquid (IL) 1,3&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) azanide. The IL was inert towards Na  12  Ge  17  , but capable of dissolving the sodium salts formed in the redox reaction. By annealing at 340&#160;&#176;C in argon atmosphere, the X&#8209;ray amorphous intermediate product was transformed to crystalline Na  24&#8208;  &#948;  Ge  136  (  d  &#8776; 2) and a&#8209;Ge in an about 1:1 mass ratio. The product was characterized by X&#8209;ray powder diffraction, chemical analysis, and  23  Na solid&#8208;state NMR. Metallic properties of Na  24&#8211;  &#948;  Ge  136  were revealed by a significant Knight shift of the  23  Na NMR signals and by a Pauli&#8208;paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility. At room temperature, Na  24&#8208;  &#948;  Ge  136  slowly ages, with a tendency to volume decrease and sodium loss.</dc:description>

         <title>A Comprehensive Study on the Full Series of Alkali Metal Selenocyanates AI[SeCN] (AI = Li &#8211; Cs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The full series of quasibinary alkali metal selenocyanates was synthesized either by oxidation of the respective cyanides (  A  = Li&#8211;Rb) or by metathesis (  A  = Cs). For Li[SeCN] only ball&#8208;milling and subsequent annealing led to the isolation of the quasibinary selenocyanate. Their structures were refined from single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray data. The respective solid&#8208;state IR and Raman spectra were interpreted with the aid of solid&#8208;state quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations and DSC&#8208;TGA measurements allowed for extraction of melting points. Only for Li[SeCN] a possible phase transition was observed that is discussed on the basis of VT&#8208;PXRD experiments. It is also the only quasibinary selenocyanate to form a hydrate (Li[SeCN] &#8226; 2H  2  O).</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Techniques for the Structural Characterization of Geminal Alane&#8208;Phosphane Frustrated Lewis Pairs and Secondary Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first comprehensive solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) characterization of geminal alane&#8208;phosphane Frustrated L  ewis  Pairs (Al/P FLPs) is reported. Their relevant NMR parameters (isotropic chemical shifts, direct and indirect  27  Al&#8208;  31  P spin&#8208;spin coupling constants, and  27  Al nuclear electric quadrupole coupling tensor components) have been determined by numerical analysis of the experimental NMR lineshapes and compared with values computed from the known crystal structures using density functional theory (DFT) methods. Our work demonstrates that the  31  P NMR chemical shifts for the studied Al/P FLPs are very sensitive to slight structural inequivalences. The  27  Al NMR central transition signals are spread out over a broad frequency range (&gt;200 kHz), owing to the presence of strong nuclear electric quadrupolar interactions that can be well&#8208;reproduced by the static  27  Al Wideband Uniform Rate Smooth Truncation (WURST) Carr&#8722;Purcell&#8722;Meiboom&#8722;Gill (WCPMG) NMR experiment.  27  Al chemical shifts and quadrupole tensor components offer a facile and clear distinction between three&#8208; and four&#8208;coordinate aluminum environments. For measuring internuclear Al  &#8230;.  P distances a new Resonance&#8208;Echo Saturation&#8208;Pulse Double&#8208;Resonance (RESPDOR) experiment was developed using efficient saturation via frequency&#8208;swept WURST pulses. The successful implementation of this widely applicable technique indicates that internuclear Al  &#8230;.  P distances in these compounds can be measured within a precision of &#177;0.1 &#197;.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Alkali Cation Intercalates on the Electrochemical Characteristics of Nb2CTX Mxene for Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intercalation of cations into layered structure electrode materials has long been studied in depth in energy storage applications. In particular, Li  +  , Na  +  , and K  +  alkali metal&#8208;based cation transports in energy storage devices such as batteries and electrochemical capacitors are closely related to the capacitance behavior. Herein, we exploited different sizes of cations from aqueous salt electrolyte intercalating into layered Nb  2  CT  x  electrode in a supercapacitor for the first time. As a result, we demonstrated that capacitive performance was dependent on cation intercalation behavior. The interlayer spacing expansion of the electrode material can be observed in Li  2  SO  4  , Na  2  SO  4  , and K  2  SO  4  electrolytes with the increased  d  &#8208;spacing. Additionally, our results showed that the Nb  2  CT  x  electrode exhibited higher electrochemical performance in the presence of Li  2  SO  4  than in that of Na  2  SO  4  and K  2  SO  4  . This is partly because smaller size Li  +  transports fast and intercalates between the layers of Nb  2  CT  x  easily. Poor ion transport in the Na  2  SO  4  electrolyte limited the electrode capacitance and presented the lowest electrochemical performance, although the cation radius is following Li  +  &gt;Na  +  &gt;K  +  . Our experimental studies provide direct evidence for the intercalation mechanism of Li  +  , Na  +  , and K  +  on the 2D layered Nb  2  CT  x  electrode, which provides a new path for exploring the relationship between intercalated cations and other MXene electrodes</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;Triggered Enhancement of Singlet Oxygen Production by Pyridinium Alkynylanthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is an ongoing interest in  1  O  2  sensitizers, whose activity is selectively controlled by their interaction with DNA. To this end, we synthesized three isomeric pyridinium alkynylanthracenes  2  o  &#9472;  p  and a water&#8208;soluble trapping reagent for  1  O  2  . In water and in the absence of DNA, these dyes show a poor efficiency to sensitize the photooxygenation of the trapping reagent as they decompose due to electron transfer processes. In contrast, in the presence of DNA  1  O  2  is generated from the excited DNA&#8208;bound ligand. The interactions of  2  o  &#8211;  p  with DNA were investigated by various analytical methods. Our studies revealed an intercalative binding with an orientation of the long pyridyl&#8208;alkynyl axis parallel to the main axis of the DNA base pairs. In the presence of poly(dA:dT), all three isomers show an enhanced formation of singlet oxygen, as indicated by the reaction of the latter with the trapping reagent. With green light irradiation of isomer  2  o  in poly(dA:dT), the conversion rate of the trapping reagent is enhanced by a factor &gt;10. The formation of  1  O  2  was confirmed by control experiments under anaerobic conditions, in deuterated solvents, or by addition of  1  O  2  quenchers. When bound to poly(dG:dC), the opposite effect was observed only for isomers  2  o  and  2  m  , namley the trapping reagent reacted significantly slower. Overall, we showed that pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are very useful intercalators, that exhibit an enhanced photochemical  1  O  2  generation in the DNA&#8208;bound state.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy and Chemotherapy of Tumor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To fulfill the demand of precision and personalized medicine, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been emerged as a frontier in the biomedical fields due to the enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysis. Herein, we present a biocompatible and versatile nanoagent consisting of single&#8208;atom iron&#8208;containing nanoparticles (SAF NPs), DOX and A549 cell membrane (CM). The designed porous Iron&#8208;based SACs was originally served as a drug&#8208;carrying nanoplatform to release DOX selectively in tumor microenvironment (TME) for tumor chemotherapy (CT) due to the high loading capacity (155%) for DOX, which signifies SACs are a promising candidate for universal delivery cargo. Besides, the designed single&#8208;atom nanoagent can perform like peroxidase, which effectively trigger in situ tumor&#8208;specific Fenton reaction to generate abundant toxic hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) selectively under the acidic TME for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). With the combination of CDT and CT, the constructed SAF NPs@DOX@CM nanoagent demonstrate better in vivo therapeutic performance than single&#8208;pathway therapy. In the meantime, after modified with CM, SAF NPs@DOX@CM can achieve homologous binding to target tumor tissues and avoid early clearance. This study presents a type of multifunctional SACs for enhanced cancer treatment via the capacity of drug carrier combined with enzymatic therapies of single&#8208;atom catalytic sites.</dc:description>

&#8220;In this study, the first coordination of S&#8208;N moieties in the form of tetraimido sulfate ligands to lanthanide ions is showcased, which resulted in the isolation of unprecedented mono&#8208; and bimetallic lanthanide tetraimido sulfate complexes with gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, and erbium.

         <title>Rational Design of Semiconductor Heterojunctions for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic structure calculations provide a useful complement to experimental characterization tools in the atomic&#8208;scale design of semiconductor heterojunctions for photocatalysis. The band alignment of the heterojunction is of fundamental importance to achieve an efficient charge carriers separation, so as to reduce electron/hole recombination and improve photoactivity. The accurate prediction of the offsets of valence and conduction bands in the constituent units is thus of key importance but poses several methodological and practical problems. In this Minireview we address some of these problems by considering selected examples of binary and ternary semiconductor heterojunctions and how these are determined at the level of density functional theory (DFT). The atomically precise description of the interface, the consequent charge polarization, the role of quantum confinement, the possibility to use facet engineering to determine a specific band alignment, are among the effects discussed, with particular attention to pros and cons of each one of these aspects. This analysis shows the increasingly important role of accurate electronic structure calculations to drive the design and the preparation of new interfaces with desired properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding sites, vibrations and spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times in europium(II)&#8208;based metallofullerene spin qubits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To design molecular spin qubits with enhanced quantum coherence, a control of the coupling between the local vibrations and the spin states is crucial, which could be realized in principle by engineering molecular structures via coordination chemistry. To this end, understanding the underlying structural factors that govern the spin relaxation is a central topic. Here, we report the investigation of the spin dynamics in a series of chemically&#8208;designed europium(II)&#8208;based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs). By introducing a unique structural difference, i.e. metal&#8208;cage binding site, while keeping other molecular parameters constant between different complexes, these manifest the key role of the three low energy metal&#8208;based vibrations in mediating the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times (  T  1  ).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To design molecular spin qubits with enhanced quantum coherence, a control of the coupling between the local vibrations and the spin states is crucial, which could be realized in principle by engineering molecular structures via coordination chemistry. To this end, understanding the underlying structural factors that govern the spin relaxation is a central topic. Here, we report the investigation of the spin dynamics in a series of chemically-designed europium(II)-based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs). By introducing a unique structural difference, i.e. metal-cage binding site, while keeping other molecular parameters constant between different complexes, these manifest the key role of the three low energy metal-based vibrations in mediating the spin-lattice relaxation times (  T  1  ). The temperature dependence of  T  1  can thus be normalized by the frequencies of these low energy vibrations to show an unprecedentedly universal behavior for EMFs in frozen CS  2  solution. Our theoretical analysis indicates that this structural difference determines not only the vibrational rigidity but also spin-vibration coupling in these EMF-based qubit candidates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionization and Photofragmentation of Isolated Metalloporphyrin Cations Investigated by VUV Action Spectroscopy**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolated metalloporphyrin cations FePPIX+, CoPPIX+ and ZnPPIX+ have been studied in the gas phase by action spectroscopy in the vacuum&#8208;ultraviolet (VUV) range using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and synchrotron radiation. The ionization energy of each compound has been measured. Photoexcitation and photoionization lead to strikingly different fragmentation pathways. Evidence for non&#8208;statistical dissociation processes including water losses were identified. Fragment assignments have been supported by additional high&#8208;resolution collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments on a hybrid quadrupole&#8208;orbital mass spectrometer.







Abstract
We investigated the photoionization and fragmentation of isolated metal protoporphyrin IX cations (MPPIX+ with M=Fe, Co, Zn) by means of vacuum&#8208;ultraviolet (VUV) action spectroscopy in the energy range of 8.5&#8211;35&#8197;eV. Experiments were carried out in the gas phase by interfacing an electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer with a synchrotron beamline. The mass spectra and partial ion yields show that photoexcitation of the precursor ions predominantly leads to .CH2COOH radical side&#8208;chain losses of the macrocycle with additional methyl radical (.CH3) side&#8208;chain losses. Ionization, in contrast, leads to the formation of the intact ionized precursor and various doubly charged fragments which are mostly due to side&#8208;chain cleavages. Although statistical fragmentation dominates, we found evidence for non&#8208;statistical processes such as new fragments involving for example single and double H2O losses, indicating that different relaxation mechanisms are at play upon photoionization compared to photoexcitation. The measured ionization energies were 9.6&#177;0.2&#8197;eV, 9.4&#177;0.2&#8197;eV and 9.6&#177;0.2&#8197;eV for FePPIX+, CoPPIX+ and ZnPPIX+, respectively.

         <title>Design Strategies of Si/C Composite Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various Si/C materials by different synthetic methods are reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, Si/C materials formed by Si and different carbon&#8208;based materials is summarized, where the influences of carbons on the electrochemical performance of Si are emphasized. Lastly, future research direction in the material design and optimization of Si/C materials is proposed to fill the current gap in the development of efficient Si/C anode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based materials that have higher theoretical specific capacity than other conventional anodes, such as carbon materials, Li2TiO3 materials and Sn&#8208;based materials, become a hot topic in research of lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB). However, the low conductivity and large volume expansion of silicon&#8208;based materials hinders the commercialization of silicon&#8208;based materials. Until recent years, these issues are alleviated by the combination of carbon&#8208;based materials. In this review, the preparation of Si/C materials by different synthetic methods in the past decade is reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, Si/C materials formed by silicon and different carbon&#8208;based materials is summarized, where the influences of carbons on the electrochemical performance of silicon are emphasized. Lastly, future research direction in the material design and optimization of Si/C materials is proposed to fill the current gap in the development of efficient Si/C anode for LIBs.

         <title>How to Prepare Kinetically Stable Self&#8208;assembled Pt12L24 Nanocages while Circumventing Kinetic Traps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Avoiding the unwanted: Robust Pt12L24 assemblies were selectively formed by a combination of thermodynamic tuning, achieved by rigidifying the ligands, and kinetic tuning with catalytic amounts of additives. The described methodology can be applied to prepare a variety of functionalised platinum assemblies that were shown to be kinetically stable against biologically and catalytically relevant substrates.







Abstract
Supramolecular coordination&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled nanostructures have been widely studied, and currently various applications are being explored. For several applications, the stability of the nanostructure is of key importance, and this strongly depends on the metal used in the self&#8208;assembly process. Herein, design strategies and synthetic protocols to access desirable kinetically stable Pt12L24 nanospheres are reported, and it is demonstrated that these are stable under conditions under which the palladium counterparts decompose. Descriptors previously used for palladium nanospheres are insufficient for platinum analogues, as the stronger metal&#8211;ligand bond results in a mixture of kinetically trapped structures. We report that next to the dihedral angle, the rigidity of the ditopic ligand is also a key parameter for the controlled formation of Pt12L24 nanospheres. Catalytic amounts of coordinating additives to labilise the platinum&#8208;pyridyl bond to some extent are needed to selectively form Pt12L24 assemblies. The formed Pt12L24 nanospheres were demonstrated to be stable in the presence of chloride, amines and acids, unlike the palladium analogues.

         <title>The Effect of Interlayer Anion Grafting on Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis: A Comparative Study of Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;Based Brucite&#8208;Type Layered Hydroxides, Layered Double Hydroxides and Hydroxynitrate Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grafting of interlayer anions to brucite&#8208;type layered structures impacts electrocatalytic performance. Three Ni and Co compounds are investigated: (i) brucite&#8208;type M(OH)2 (no interlayer anions), (ii) LDHs (free interlayer anions), and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts (grafted interlayer anions). Substitution of OH&#8722; by NO3&#8722; allows for larger layer separation and reduced electron density at the metal center contributing to earlier onset of OER activity.







Abstract
The urge for carbon&#8208;neutral green energy conversion and storage technologies has invoked the resurgence of interest in applying brucite&#8208;type materials as low&#8208;cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in basic media. Transition metal layered hydroxides belonging to the brucite&#8208;type structure family have been shown to display remarkable electrochemical activity. Recent studies on the earth&#8208;abundant Fe3+ containing m&#246;ssbauerite and Fe3+ rich Co&#8722;Fe layered oxyhydroxide carbonates have suggested that grafted interlayer anions might play a key role in OER catalysis. To probe the effect of such interlayer anion grafting in brucite&#8208;like layered hydroxides, we report here a systematic study on the electrocatalytic performance of three distinct Ni and Co brucite&#8208;type layered structures, namely, (i) brucite&#8208;type M(OH)2 without any interlayer anions, (ii) LDHs with free interlayer anions, and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts with grafted interlayer anions. The electrochemical results indeed show that grafting has an evident impact on the electronic structure and the observed OER activity. Ni&#8208; and Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts with grafted anions display notably earlier formations of the electrocatalytically active species. Particularly Co&#8208;hydroxynitrate salts exhibit lower overpotentials at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#951;=0.34&#8197;V) and medium current densities of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (&#951;=0.40&#8197;V) compared to the corresponding brucite&#8208;type hydroxides and LDH materials.

     alt="The Effect of Interlayer Anion Grafting on Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis: A Comparative Study of Ni- and Co-Based Brucite-Type Layered Hydroxides, Layered Double Hydroxides and Hydroxynitrate Salts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grafting of interlayer anions&lt;/b&gt; to brucite-type layered structures impacts electrocatalytic performance. Three Ni and Co compounds are investigated: (i) brucite-type M(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (no interlayer anions), (ii) LDHs (free interlayer anions), and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts (grafted interlayer anions). Substitution of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; by NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; allows for larger layer separation and reduced electron density at the metal center contributing to earlier onset of OER activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urge for carbon-neutral green energy conversion and storage technologies has invoked the resurgence of interest in applying brucite-type materials as low-cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts in basic media. Transition metal layered hydroxides belonging to the brucite-type structure family have been shown to display remarkable electrochemical activity. Recent studies on the earth-abundant Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; containing m&#246;ssbauerite and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; rich Co&#8722;Fe layered oxyhydroxide carbonates have suggested that grafted interlayer anions might play a key role in OER catalysis. To probe the effect of such interlayer anion grafting in brucite-like layered hydroxides, we report here a systematic study on the electrocatalytic performance of three distinct Ni and Co brucite-type layered structures, namely, (i) brucite-type M(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without any interlayer anions, (ii) LDHs with free interlayer anions, and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts with grafted interlayer anions. The electrochemical results indeed show that grafting has an evident impact on the electronic structure and the observed OER activity. Ni- and Co-hydroxynitrate salts with grafted anions display notably earlier formations of the electrocatalytically active species. Particularly Co-hydroxynitrate salts exhibit lower overpotentials at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;=0.34&#8197;V) and medium current densities of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;=0.40&#8197;V) compared to the corresponding brucite-type hydroxides and LDH materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have great potential application in a range of pioneering areas, such as quantum computing, spintronics, and high&#8208;density information storage. The properties of the molecules presented here are based on the molecular total spin and the magnetic anisotropy created by the lanthanides in a particular crystal field. An important element in SMMs&#8217; optimization is the ligand design. Poly imido sulfur ligands are perfectly suited as the polar S+&#8722;N&#8722;&#8208;bond facilitates electronic and geometric adaptability to various f&#8208;metals. Particularly the acute N&#8211;Dy&#8211;N bite angle generates advantageous magnetic properties. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Demir, D. Stalke et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101076).

         <title>A Novel Reactivity of Phosphanylalumane (&gt;P&#8722;Al&lt;): Reversible Addition of a Saturated Interelement Bond to Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A P&#8722;Al single&#8208;bond species, phosphanylalumane, was found to bind relatively small terminal alkenes (ethylene, propylene, and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene). Although the ethylene adduct did notundergo any elimination of ethylene even under vacuum conditions, heating the terminal alkene adducts resulted in the release of the corresponding alkenes and regenerated the P&#8722;Al bond. Theethylene adduct can work as a new saturated C2 vicinal P/Al&#8208;based frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), showing characteristic reactivity through the elimination of ethylene. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Mizuhata, N. Tokitoh, and T. Yanagisawa (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101649).

         <dc:description>
The quite &#8216;hidden&#8217; compound AlCr2 was isolated for the first time as micro&#8208;fabricated single crystals. Crystal structure and chemical bonding analyses reveal largely different interactions as a consequence of the inverted coloring pattern with respect to prototypical MoSi2. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Borrmann et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100817).

         <title>In Situ Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies of the Mechanochemical Synthesis of ZnS from its Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of the mechanochemical synthesis of cubic ZnS from its elements via ball milling was studied by in situ synchrotron diffraction experiments coupled with gas pressure measurements inside the milling vessel. The combination of both techniques reveals a heterogeneous reaction mechanism including gaseous sulfur and solid zinc. Moreover, the reaction kinetics of the phase transition from cubic to hexagonal ZnS was determined from the in situ synchrotron diffraction experiments. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8197;Weidenthaler et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101260).

         <title>Imidazolium Functionalized Chemically Robust Ionic Porous Organic Polymers (iPOPs) toward Toxic Oxo&#8208;pollutants Capture from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating new and efficient materials aimed at containment of water contamination, in particular removing toxic heavy metal based oxo&#8208;anions (for example CrO  4  2&#8208;  , TcO  4  &#8208;  ) holds paramount importance. In this work, we report two new highly stable imidazolium based ionic porous organic polymers (  i  POPs) decorated with multiple interaction sites along with electrostatics driven adsorptive removal of such oxo&#8208;anions from water. Both the  i  POPs (namely,  i  POP&#8208;3 and  i  POP&#8208;4) exhibited rapid sieving kinetics and very high saturation uptake capacity for CrO  4  2&#8208;  anions (170 and 141 mg g  &#8208;1  for  i  POP&#8208;3 and  i  POP&#8208;4 respectively) and ReO  4  &#8208;  (515.5 and 350.3 mg g  &#8208;1  for  i  POP&#8208;3 and  i  POP&#8208;4 respectively), where ReO  4  &#8208;  anions being the non&#8208;radioactive surrogative counterpart of radioactive TcO  4  &#8208;  ions. Noticeably, both  i  POPs showed exceptional selectivity towards CrO  4  2&#8208;  and ReO  4  &#8208;  even in presence of several other concurrent anions such as Br  &#8208;  , Cl  &#8208;  , SO  4  2&#8208;  , NO  3  &#8208;  etc. The theoretical binding energy calculations via DFT method further confirmed the preferencial interaction sites as well as binding energies of both  i  POPs towards CrO  4  2&#8208;  and ReO  4  &#8208;  over all other competing anions which corroborates with the experimental high capacity and selectivity of  i  POPs towards such oxo&#8208;anions.</dc:description>

         <title>KCs2[Pb2Br5(HCOO)2]: A Polar 3D Lead&#8208;Bromide Framework Exhibiting Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of new nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with excellent properties is in urgently demand because of their ability to generate coherent light. Herein, we report an unique NLO lead bromide formate, KCs  2  [Pb  2  Br  5  (HCOO)  2  ], which has been synthesized by a mix&#8208;solvothermal method.  KCs  2  [Pb  2  Br  5  (HCOO)  2  ] exhibits strong phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response (6.5 &#215; KDP), large birefringence (0.16  @ 1064 nm), and wide transparent window in most visible light and mid&#8208;IR region. Interestingly, KCs  2  [Pb  2  Br  5  (HCOO)  2  ] features a polar 3D lead&#8208;bromide framework in which adjacent Pb&#8208;Br layers containing coplanar Pb  6  Br  6  rings not only parallel to each other, but also orient in the same direction. These oriented arrangements are responsible for the strong SHG response and large birefringence that are elucidated by both local dipole moment and theoretical calculations. This research provides a new strategy to explore subsequent NLO crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordinate reaction model:&#160;an obstacle for interpreting the emergence of chemical complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to be correctly simulated and understood, the chemical behavior of complex systems, requires time&#8208;dependent models ,&#160; otherwise the irreversibility of natural phenomena is overlooked. Micro reversible models based on the reaction coordinate model are time invariant and are therefore unable to explain the evolution of open dissipative systems. The important points necessary for improving the modelling and simulations of chemical complex systems are: a) The understanding of the physical potential related to the entropy production rate, which is in general a non&#8208;exact differential of a state function, and b) The interpretation and application of the so&#8208;called general evolution criteria (GEC) which is the general thermodynamic constraint for the evolution of dissipative chemical systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Ytterbium(II) Hydride as a Powerful Multielectron Reductant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dimeric &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ytterbium(II) hydride affects both the two&#8208;electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (COT) and the more challenging two&#8208;electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E  0  = &#8211;2.60 V). Confirmed by Density Functional Theory calculations, these reactions proceed via consecutive polarized Yb&#8208;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation steps to provide the respective ytterbium(II) inverse sandwich complexes and hydrogen gas. These observations highlight the ability of a simple ytterbium(II) hydride to act as a powerful two&#8208;electron reductant at room temperature without the necessity of an external electron to initiate the reaction and avoiding radicaloid intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Trapping of Terminal Platinapolyynes by Copper(I) Catalyzed Click Cycloadditions; Probes of Labile Intermediates in Syntheses of Complexes with Extended sp Carbon Chains, and Crystallographic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title reactions are, by analogy to a coal miner&#8216;s canary, employed to detect unstable transient species LyPt(C&#8801;C)nH with n up to 9. These are valuable building blocks for still longer polyynes, and all of the precursors LyPt(C&#8801;C)nSiR3 and trapping products can be crystallographically characterized.







Abstract
The silylated hexatriynyl complex trans&#8208;(C6F5)(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt(C&#8801;C)3SiEt3 (PtC6TES) is converted in&#8197;situ to PtC6H (wet n&#8208;Bu4N+ F&#8722;, THF) and cross coupled with the diyne H(C&#8801;C)2SiEt3 (HC4TES; CuCl/TMEDA, O2) to give PtC10TES (71&#8201;%). This sequence is repeated twice to afford PtC14TES (65&#8201;%) and then PtC18TES (27&#8201;%). An analogous series of reactions starting with PtC8TES gives PtC12TES (60&#8201;%), then PtC16TES (43&#8201;%), and then PtC20TES (17&#8201;%). Similar cross couplings with H(C&#8801;C)2Si(i&#8208;Pr)3 (HC4TIPS) give PtC12TIPS (68&#8201;%), PtC14TIPS (68&#8201;%), and PtC16TIPS (34&#8201;%). The trialkylsilyl species (up to PtC18TES) are converted to 3+2 &#8220;click&#8221; cycloadducts or 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles trans&#8208;(C6F5)(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt(C&#8801;C)n&#8208;1C=CHN(CH2C6H5)N=N (29&#8211;92&#8201;% after workups). The most general procedure involves generating the terminal polyynes PtCxH (wet n&#8208;Bu4N+ F&#8722;, THF) in the presence of benzyl azide in DMF and aqueous CuSO4/ascorbic acid. All of the preceding complexes are crystallographically characterized and the structural and spectroscopic properties analyzed as a function of chain length. Two pseudopolymorphs of PtC20TES are obtained, both of which feature molecules with parallel sp carbon chains in a pairwise head/tail packing motif with extensive sp/sp van der Waals contacts.

         <title>Decoding Directing Groups and Their Pivotal Role in C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of directing groups in guiding C&#8722;H activation reactions are described with a detailed picture of the various directing groups that have become prominent in carrying out functionalizations at different sites of aromatic scaffolds. The review encompasses all the relevant works that have been conducted by different groups from all over the world and this provides sufficient information for readers who wish to carry out research in this domain.







Abstract
Synthetic organic chemistry has witnessed a plethora of functionalization and defunctionalization strategies. In this regard, C&#8722;H functionalization has been at the forefront due to the multifarious applications in the development of simple to complex molecular architectures and holds a brilliant prospect in drug development and discovery. Despite been explored tremendously by chemists, this functionalization strategy still enjoys the employment of novel metal catalysts as well metal&#8208;free organic ligands. Moreover, the switch to photo&#8208; and electrochemistry has widened our understanding of the alternative pathways via which a reaction can proceed and these strategies have garnered prominence when applied to C&#8722;H activation. Synthetic chemists have been foraging for new directing groups and templates for the selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds from a myriad of carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds in aromatic as well as aliphatic systems. As a matter of fact, by varying the templates and directing groups, scientists found the answer to the challenge of distal C&#8722;H bond activation which remained an obstacle for a very long time. These templates have been frequently harnessed for selectively activating C&#8722;H bonds of natural products, drugs, and macromolecules decorated with multiple C&#8722;H bonds. This itself was a challenge before the commencement of this field as functionalization of a site other than the targeted site could modify and hamper the biological activity of the pharmacophore. Total synthesis and pharmacophore development often faces the difficulty of superfluous reaction steps towards selective functionalization. This obstacle has been solved by late&#8208;stage functionalization simply by harnessing C&#8722;H bond activation. Moreover, green chemistry and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions have seen light in the past few decades due to the rising concern about environmental issues. Therefore, metal&#8208;free catalysts or the usage of non&#8208;toxic metals have been recently showcased in a number of elegant works. Also, research groups across the world are developing rational strategies for directing group free or non&#8208;directed protocols that are just guided by ligands. This review encapsulates the research works pertinent to C&#8722;H bond activation and discusses the science devoted to it at the fundamental level. This review gives the readers a broad understanding of how these strategies work, the execution of various metal catalysts, and directing groups. This not only helps a budding scientist towards the commencement of his/her research but also helps a matured mind searching out for selective functionalization. A detailed picture of this field and its progress with time has been portrayed in lucid scientific language with a motive to inculcate and educate scientific minds about this beautiful strategy with an overview of the most relevant and significant works of this era. The unique trait of this review is the detailed description and classification of various directing groups and their utility over a wide substrate scope. This allows an experimental chemist to understand the applicability of this domain and employ it over any targeted substrate.

         <title>Organocatalytic Strategies for the Development of the Enantioselective Inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, a profound revision on the latest advances on the organocatalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is shown.







Abstract
Cycloaddition reactions, in particular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, have attracted a lot of attention from organic chemists since they represent one of the most powerful methodologies for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. In particular, inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions have been an important breakthrough for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. Among all their variants, the organocatalytic enantioselective version has been widely explored since the asymmetric construction of diversely functionalized scaffolds under reaction conditions encompassed within the green chemistry field is of great interest. In this review, a profound revision on the latest advances on the organocatalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is shown.

         <title>Inclusion Complexes of Gold(I)&#8208;Dithiocarbamates with &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin: A Journey from Drug Repurposing towards Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inclusion complex of a complex: The two drugs disulfiram and aurothiomalate react to produce a gold(I)&#8208;dithiocarbamate complex, which selectively kills cancer cells. Hydroxy&#8208;substituted derivatives of this complex form inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin in a rare &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; arrangement. Formulation of one gold complex with a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin derivative prevents formation of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria.







Abstract
The gold(I)&#8208;dithiocarbamate (dtc) complex [Au(N,N&#8208;diethyl)dtc]2 was identified as the active cytotoxic agent in the combination treatment of sodium aurothiomalate and disulfiram on a panel of cancer cell lines. In addition to demonstrating pronounced differential cytotoxicity to these cell lines, the gold complex showed no cross&#8208;resistance in therapy&#8208;surviving cancer cells. In the course of a medicinal chemistry campaign on this class of poorly soluble gold(I)&#8208;dtc complexes, &gt;35 derivatives were synthesized and X&#8208;ray crystallography was used to examine structural aspects of the dtc moiety. A group of hydroxy&#8208;substituted complexes has an improved solubility profile, and it was found that these complexes form 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD), exhibiting a rarely observed &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; arrangement of the CD cones. Formulation of a hydroxy&#8208;substituted gold(I)&#8208;dtc complex with excess sulfobutylether&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD prevents the induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which is a major burden in the development of metallodrugs.

         <title>Taming the Antiferromagnetic Beast: Computational Design of Ultrashort Mn&#8722;Mn Bonds Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mn2 survival guide. DFT calculations were used to design synthetically achievable compounds featuring ultrashort Mn&#8722;Mn bonds stabilized by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). We investigated the nature of the metal&#8211;carbene interaction and the role of the ancillary &#951;6 coordination in the generation of ultrashort Mn2 bonds in organometallic platforms featuring closed&#8208;shell singlet multiplicities and positive adiabatic singlet&#8211;triplet gaps. Our analysis identified two classes of potential synthetic targets, whose electrostructural properties were thoroughly examined.







Abstract
The development of complexes featuring low&#8208;valent, multiply bonded metal centers is an exciting field with several potential applications. In this work, we describe the design principles and extensive computational investigation of new organometallic platforms featuring the elusive manganese&#8208;manganese bond stabilized by experimentally realized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). By using DFT computations benchmarked against multireference calculations, as well as MO&#8208; and VB&#8208;based bonding analyses, we could disentangle the various electronic and structural effects contributing to the thermodynamic and kinetic stability, as well as the experimental feasibility, of the systems. In particular, we explored the nature of the metal&#8208;carbene interaction and the role of the ancillary &#951;6 coordination to the generation of Mn2 systems featuring ultrashort metal&#8208;metal bonds, closed&#8208;shell singlet multiplicities, and positive adiabatic singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Our analysis identifies two distinct classes of viable synthetic targets, whose electrostructural properties are thoroughly investigated.

Giving directions: A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was directed by the 2&#8208;pyridyl on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring. Moreover, this pyridyl directing group was easily removable to generate the biheteroaryl structures with a free N&#8722;H group.







Abstract
A rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C6&#8208;selective dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling of 2&#8208;pyridones with thiophenes was developed for the synthesis of 6&#8208;thiophenyl pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one derivatives. In this reaction, the excellent site selectivity was controlled by the 2&#8208;pyridyl directing group on the nitrogen of the pyridone ring. Control experiments indicated that the N&#8208;pyridyl was essential for the transformation. To the best of our knowledge, this procedure is the first successful example of the direct C6 heteroarylation of 2&#8208;pyridones with electron&#8208;rich thiophene derivatives. 4&#8208;Pyridone was also used as substrate to generate the corresponding C2 heteroarylated product. Moreover, this pyridyl directing group was readily removable to generate the biheteroaryl structures with a free N&#8722;H group.

         <title>Selective Oxygen and Hydrogen Functionalization of the h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present detailed studies on the covalent adsorption of molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen on the hexagonal boron nitride (  h  &#8209;BN) nanomesh on Rh(111). The functionalization of this two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material was investigated under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions using synchrotron radiation&#8208;based  in situ  high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. We are able to provide a deep insight into the adsorption behavior and thermal stability of oxygen and hydrogen on  h  &#8209;BN/Rh(111). Oxygen functionalization was achieved via a supersonic molecular beam while hydrogen functionalization was realized using an atomic hydrogen source. Adsorption of the respective species was observed to occur selectively in the pores of  h  &#8208;BN leading to spatially defined modification of the 2D&#160;layer. The adsorption of the observed molecular oxygen species was found to be an activated process that requires high&#8208;energy oxygen molecules. Upon heating to 700&#160;K, oxygen functionalization was observed to be almost reversible except for small amounts of boron oxides evolving due to the reaction of oxygen with the 2D&#160;material. Hydrogen functionalization of  h  &#8209;BN/Rh(111) was fully reversed upon heating to about 640&#160;K.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phase engineering of the electrode materials in terms of designing heterostructures, introducing heteroatom and defects, improves great prospects in accelerating the charge storage kinetics during the repeated Li  +  /Na  +  insertion/deintercalation. Herein, a new design of Li/Na&#8208;ion battery anodes through phase regulating is reported consisting of F doped SnO  2  &#8208;SnS  2  heterostructures nanocrystals with oxygen/sulfur vacancies (V  O  /V  S  ) anchored on 2D sulfur/nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide matrix (F&#8208;SnO  2&#8208;x  &#8208;SnS  2&#8208;x  @N/S&#8208;RGO). Consequently, F&#8208;SnO  2&#8208;x  &#8208;SnS  2&#8208;x  @N/S&#8208;RGO anode demonstrates superb high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Moreover, it exhibits excellent great rate capability with 589 mAh g  &#8208;1  for Li  +  and 296 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 5 A g  &#8208;1  for Na  +  . The enhanced Li/Na storage properties of the nanocomposites are not only attributed to the increase in conductivity caused by V  O  /V  S  and F doping (confirmed by DFT calculations) to accelerate their charge&#8208;transfer kinetics but also the increased interaction between F&#8208;SnO  2&#8208;x  &#8208;SnS  2&#8208;x  and Li/Na through heterostructure.

Blue emissive materials: boron containing fluorescent compounds have been prepared starting from imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine phenols. Large Stokes shift, high absolute quantum yields and good photostability are observed in solution. TD&#8208;DFT calculations allowed to find a linear correlation between the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap of these compounds and the Hammett constants of substituents R para to the hydroxyl group of the phenols.







Abstract
Several boron compounds with 2&#8208;(imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenols, differentiated by the nature of the substituent (R) in the para position of the hydroxy group, have been synthesized and thoroughly characterized both in solution (1H, 13C, 11B, 19F NMR) and in the solid state (X&#8208;ray). All derivatives displayed attractive photophysical properties like very high Stokes shift, high fluorescence quantum yields and a good photostability in solution. Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations allowed to define the main electronic transitions as intra ligand transitions (1ILT), which was corroborated by the Natural Transition Orbitals (NTOs) shapes. The HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap was correlated to the electronic properties of the substituent R on the phenolic ring, as quantified by its &#963;p Hammett constant.

A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted, room temperature and redox neutral direct C&#8722;H amination of glycine and peptides has been firstly accomplished by using N&#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide as nitrogen&#8208;radical precursor. The present strategy provides ways to introduce functionalities such as N&#8208;acyloxyphthalimide or &#8208;succinimide specifically to terminal glycine segment of peptides. Herein, mild conditions and high functional&#8208;group tolerance allow the preparation of non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids and modification of corresponding peptides in this way.

         <title>Native Chemical Ligation&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Cysteine and Aminopeptidase N Using meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorogenic conversion of a meso&#8208;thioester to meso&#8208;amide BODIPY dye was exploited in the construction of fluorescent &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probes relying on the native chemical ligation reaction mechanism. Two fluorogenic probes, 1&#8201;a and 4, derived from a meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY scaffold, were designed, and successfully applied for the selective detection of cysteine (1&#8201;a) and aminopeptidase N (4), respectively.







Abstract
meso&#8208;Carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY responds to small electronic changes resulting from acyl substitution reactions with a marked change in fluorescence. Herein, the minute changes that accompany the thioester to amide conversion encountered in native chemical ligation (NCL) are exploited in the construction of fluorescent &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probes. Two fluorogenic probes, 1&#8201;a and 4, derived from a meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY scaffold, were designed for the selective detection of cysteine (1&#8201;a) and aminopeptidase N (4), respectively. The aromatic (1&#8201;a) and aliphatic (4) thioesters of meso&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY are nonfluorescent. However, specific analyte&#8208;induced conversion to the meso&#8208;amide derivative caused significant spectral changes and a dramatic fluorescence enhancement. Probe 1&#8201;a exhibited a large fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response with high selectivity toward cysteine via a tandem NCL reaction. Probe 4 was successfully applied to the monitoring and imaging of endogenous aminopeptidase N in live cancer cells.

         <title>Crystal Structures of AlCr2 and MoSi2: Same Structure Type vs. Different Bonding Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hidden crystals: With a modified synthesis approach and micro&#8208;fabrication technique, it was possible to isolate micrometer&#8208;sized single crystals of AlCr2 from a largely polycrystalline sample. Chemical bond analysis shows close relation to elements, in contrast to a quite localized bonding pattern in the prototype, MoSi2.







Abstract
In a joint effort utilizing modified sample preparation, microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and micro&#8208;fabrication, it became possible to prepare single crystals of the &#8220;hidden&#8221; phase AlCr2. High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis is described in detail for two crystals with the similar overall composition, but different degree of disorder, which seems to be the main cause for the differing unit cell parameters. Chemical bonding analysis of AlCr2 in comparison to prototypical MoSi2 shows pronounced differences reflecting the interchange of main group element vs. transition metal as majority component.

         <title>Infrared Responsive Choline Phosphate Lipids for Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spot on: A light&#8208;inducible Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox liposome simultaneously loads a water&#8208;soluble drug (Dox) and photothermal transduction agents (ICG), targets the tumor site, and locally heats it up under external laser irradiation. Due to the conformational transformation of CP lipids, the anticancer drug Dox is released at a specific time and in a specific space to kill tumor cells. This brings about a combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy for the noninvasive treatment of tumors.







Abstract
Choline phosphate lipids have been designed and developed as new&#8208;generation zwitterionic nanocarriers with excellent biocompatibility and bioorthogonality to provide a more programmable performance for cancer therapy. However, there is a lack of spatiotemporal and reversible control for drug release at target tumor cells, which can lead to severe adverse effects to normal tissue and discounted treatment outcome. Here, light&#8208;inducible Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox liposomes were developed for synergistic cancer therapy. ICG can effectively convert light energy into selective heating in a local environment upon laser irradiation, thus inducing thermal ablation of tumor cells, and further reversibly trigger the spatiotemporal release of anticancer drugs (Dox) at tumor cells due to the conformation transformation of CP lipids to synergistically kill tumor cells. That Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox exhibited a significant improvement for breast cancer therapy in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo is also demonstrated, thus it can serve as an efficient platform to noninvasively and spatiotemporally control the activation of cytotoxicity at tumor cells for precision cancer therapy.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Highly Fluorescent and CPL&#8208;Active Dispiroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicenes are intriguing and inherently chiral compounds with fascinating 3D architecture. Their shape could be compared to whirlpools in the Naruto Strait (&#40180;&#38272;&#12398;&#28198;&#28526;), as it is beautifully depicted in the famous woodcut by Hiroshige. Formation of the whirlpools requires special conditions and these are also required in helical compounds&#8217; syntheses. Synthesis of chiral fluorescent [7]helical indenofluorenes by using catalytic enantioselective [2+2+2]cyclotrimerization and their photophysical properties are reported. More information can be found in the Communication by D. Ne&#269;as, M. Kotora, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100759).

Chromium based single&#8208;site catalysts allow the production of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene with very high productivities. The picture shows a donor&#8208;functionalised indenyl chromium catalyst in action where a strong electron&#8208;donating substituent leads to an increase in catalytic activity and co&#8208;monomer incorporation. The correlation between donor strength, electronic and catalytic properties was studied systematically. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Enders et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101586).

         <title>Targeted chemical modifications identify key features of carbohydrate assemblies and generate tailored carbohydrate materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular level description of carbohydrate assemblies is hampered by their structural complexity and the lack of suitable analytical methods. Here, we employed systematic chemical modifications to identify key non&#8208;covalent interactions that triggered the supramolecular assembly of a disaccharide model. While some modifications disrupted the supramolecular organization, others were tolerated, delivering important information on the aggregation process. The screening identified new geometries, including nanotubes, and twisted ribbons that were characterized with electron tomography and electron diffraction (ED) methods. This work demonstrates that the combination of synthetic chemistry and ED&#8208;methods is a powerful tool to draw correlations between the molecular structure and the nanoscale architecture of carbohydrate assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Distinction between Noble Metals Located in Mesopores from those on the External Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We compare three methods for quantitatively distinguishing the location of noble metals (NM) in mesopores from those found on the external particle surface. MCM&#8208;41 and SBA&#8208;15 with NM either preferentially located in mesopores or on the external surface were prepared and characterized by TEM. We quantified arylphosphines forming complexes with NM by  31  P MAS NMR spectroscopy. Phosphine/NM ratios drop from 2.0 to 0.2 when increasing the probe diameter from 1.08 to 1.54 nm. The reaction between NM and triphenylphosphine (TPP) within 3.0 nm MCM&#8208;41 pores takes due to confinement effects multiple weeks. In contrast, external NM react with TPP instantly. A promising method is filling the pores using the pore volume impregnation technique with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). TPP loading revealed that 66% of NM are located on the external surface of MCM&#8208;41. The pore filling method can be used in association with any probe molecule, also for the quantification of acid sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Making Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles more Basic and Nucleophilic: Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of the First Phosphinine Selenide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and isolation of a phosphinine selenide was achieved for the first time by reacting red selenium with 2,6&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine. The rather large coupling constant of  1  J  P,Se  = 883 Hz is in line with a P&#8208;Se bond of high  s  &#8208;character. The &#963;&#8208;electron donating Me  3  Si&#8208;substituents significantly increase the energy of the phosphorus lone pair and hence its basicity, making the heterocycle considerably more basic and nucleophilic than the unsubstituted phosphinine C  5  H  5  P, as confirmed by the calculated gas phase basicities. NBO calculations further reveal that the lone pairs of the selenium atom are stabilized through donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with antibonding orbitals of the aromatic ring. Our results pave the way for new perspectives in the chemistry of phosphorus in low coordination.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of Gold Nanoparticles Based on Co&#8208;Functionalization with Zwitterionic and Cationic Binding Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;controlled reversible self&#8208;assembly of Au&#8208;nanoparticles (AuNPs) in water, based on their surface modification with cationic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole (GCP) and zwitterionic guanidiniocarbonyl pyrrole carboxylate (GCPZ) binding motifs. When both binding motifs are installed in a carefully balanced ratio, the resulting functionalized AuNPs self&#8208;assemble at pH 1, pH 7 and pH 13, whereas they disassemble at pH 3 and pH 11. Further disassembly can be achieved at elevated temperatures at pH 1 and pH 13. Thus, we were able to prepare functionalized nanoparticles that can be assembled/disassembled in seven alternating regimes, simply controlled by pH and temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Access to Indole&#8208;Fused Benzannulated Medium&#8208;Sized Rings through a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of Azido&#8208;Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Golden keys close the loop: Starting from phenylene&#8208;tethered azido&#8208;alkynes, pharmaceutically relevant indole&#8208;fused benzannulated eight&#8208;membered rings were constructed by exploiting &#945;&#8208;imino gold(I) carbenes as key intermediates for the gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction. The necessity of the C&#8208;dtbm ligand for the cyclization to a more challenging nine&#8208;membered ring is also demonstrated.







Abstract
Because benzannulated and indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208;sized rings are found in many bioactive compounds, combining these fragments might lead to unexplored areas of biologically relevant and uncovered chemical space. Herein is shown that &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene chemistry can play an important role in solving the difficulty in the formation of medium&#8208;sized rings. Namely, phenylene&#8208;tethered azido&#8208;alkynes undergo arylative cyclization through the formation of a gold carbene intermediate to afford benzannulated indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208;sized tetracycles. The reactions allow a range of different aryl substitution patterns and efficient access to these otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;obtain medium&#8208;sized rings. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of the semihollow&#8208;shaped C&#8208;dtbm ligand for the construction of a nine&#8208;membered ring.

The unit cell contains one centrosymmetric [Tc 20 O 68 ] 4&#8208; polyanion as well as hydronium ions and water molecules. The core of the structure consists of four Tc(V)O 6 octahedra that form a square Tc 4 O 4 ring. The four Tc(V)O 6 octahedra are decorated by sixteen Tc(VII)O 4 tetrahedra. Calculations show the bonding within the Tc 4 O 4 ring to consist of a 3&#8208;center bond formed between each neighbouring pair of Tc atoms and their bridging oxygen. Calculations also indicate that a strong d &#8594; d electronic transition at 513 nm is the origin of the red colour of [ 1 ]. The characterization of red HTcO 4 solutions by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy has complemented the description of this compound in aqueous solution.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Substitutional Li Doping in Supported Pt Nanoparticles and Their Ultra&#8208;selective Catalytic Hydrogenation Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct &#8216;substitution&#8217; of Pt with subLi in atomic columns by electron ptychography images with characteristic contraction in lattice parameters from advanced materials characterization is observed for the first time. The electron donation of d&#8208;band of Pt without higher orbital hybridizations by subLi offers an alternative way for ultra&#8208;selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds with detainment of facile CO bond to alcohols.







Abstract
It has only recently been established that doping light elements (lithium, boron, and carbon) into supported transition metals can fill interstitial sites, which can be observed by the expanded unit cell. As an example, interstitial lithium (intLi) can block H filling octahedral interstices of palladium metal lattice, which improves partial hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under hydrogen. In contrast, herein, we report intLi is not found in the case of Pt/C. Instead, we observe for the first time a direct &#8216;substitution&#8217; of Pt with substitutional lithium (subLi) in alternating atomic columns using scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8208;annular dark field (STEM&#8208;ADF). This ordered substitutional doping results in a contraction of the unit cell as shown by high&#8208;quality synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). The electron donation of d&#8208;band of Pt without higher orbital hybridizations by subLi offers an alternative way for ultra&#8208;selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds by suppressing the facile CO bond breakage that would form alcohols.

         <title>Heterodinuclear Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III) with Na(I) Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide and Cyclohexene Oxide Ring Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterodinuclear M/Na catalysts for cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide copolymerization are reported. The best catalyst comprises Co(III)/Na(I), coordinated by the macrocyclic ligand, and showing activity and selectivity values at the upper end of reported values for 1&#8197;bar carbon dioxide pressure copolymerizations. These catalysts operated without co&#8208;catalyst and maintain high activity at low loadings.







Abstract
A series heterodinuclear catalysts, operating without co&#8208;catalyst, show good performances for the ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide. The complexes feature a macrocyclic ligand designed to coordinate metals such as Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III), in a Schiff base &#8216;pocket&#8217;, and Na(I) in a modified crown&#8208;ether binding &#8216;pocket&#8217;. The 11 new catalysts are used to explore the influences of the metal combinations and ligand backbones over catalytic activity and selectivity. The highest performance catalyst features the Co(III)Na(I) combination, [N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,3&#8217;&#8208;triethylene glycol salicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethylenediamino cobalt(III) di(acetate)]sodium (7), and it shows both excellent activity and selectivity at 1&#8197;bar carbon dioxide pressure (TOF=1590&#8197;h&#8722;1, &gt;99&#8201;% polymer selectivity, 1&#8201;:&#8201;10: 4000, 100&#8201;&#176;C), as well as high activity at higher carbon dioxide pressure (TOF=4343&#8197;h&#8722;1, 20&#8197;bar, 1&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;:&#8201;25000). Its rate law shows a first order dependence on both catalyst and cyclohexene oxide concentrations and a zeroth order for carbon dioxide pressure, over the range 10&#8211;40&#8197;bar. These new catalysts eliminate any need for ionic or Lewis base co&#8208;catalyst and instead exploit the coordination of earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive Na(I) adjacent to a second metal to deliver efficient catalysis. They highlight the potential for well&#8208;designed ancillary ligands and inexpensive Group 1 metals to deliver high performance heterodinuclear catalysts for carbon dioxide copolymerizations and, in future, these catalysts may also show promise in other alternating copolymerization and carbon dioxide utilizations.

Energy efficiency and electrocatalysts: Modulating Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) by means of anion engineering possesses high flexibility to regulate the electronic structure, which can effectively improve the PGM compounds&#8242; activity and reduce the use of noble metals. This review looks at the origin of the electrochemical activity of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds and systematically summarizes the progress of their synthetic strategies and applications in energy&#8208;relevant electrocatalysis to date.







Abstract
Pt&#8208;group metal (PGM) electrocatalysts with unique electronic structures and irreplaceable comprehensive properties play crucial roles in electrocatalysis. Anion engineering can create a series of PGM compounds (such as RuP2, IrP2, PtP2, RuB2, Ru2B3, RuS2, etc.) that provide a promising prospect for improving the electrocatalytic performance and use of Pt&#8208;group noble metals. This review seeks the electrochemical activity origin of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds, and systematically analyzes and summarizes their synthetic strategies and energy&#8208;relevant applications in electrocatalysis. Orientation towards the sustainable development of nonfossil resources has stimulated a blossoming interest in the design of advanced electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion. The anion&#8208;modulated strategy for Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) by means of anion engineering possesses high flexibility to regulate the electronic structure, providing a promising prospect for constructing electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability to satisfy a future green electrochemical energy conversion system. Based on the previous work of our group and others, this review summarizes the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress on anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds (such as RuP2, IrP2, PtP2, RuB2, Ru2B3, RuS2, etc.) in energy&#8208;related electrocatalysis from the origin of their activity and synthetic strategies to electrochemical applications including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), N2 reduction reaction (NRR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). At the end, the key problems, countermeasures and future development orientations of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds toward electrocatalytic applications are proposed.

         <title>The CdIn2S4/WO3 Nanosheet Composite Has a Significantly Enhanced Photo&#8208;electrochemical Cathodic Protection Performance and Excellent Electron Storage Capability</title>

Photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection technology is considered to be a green metallic corrosion protection technology that uses solar energy to protect against corrosion without consuming any anode materials. A CdIn2S4/WO3 nanosheet composite film with electron self&#8208;storage properties was synthesized and used as a photoelectrode to couple with metallic materials to provide photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection under light illumination and continuing cathodic protection in the dark. This research will promote the practical application of photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection technology. The CdIn2S4/WO3 nanosheet composite has a significantly enhanced photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection performance and excellent electron storage capability (Chen et&#8197;al. at the Chinese Academy of Sciences)







Abstract
Photo&#8208;electrochemical cathodic protection (CP) technology is considered to be a green metallic corrosion protection technology that uses solar energy to protect from corrosion and does not consume any anode materials. In this work, a CdIn2S4/WO3 nanocomposite photoelectrode was prepared, and its photo&#8208;electrochemical CP performance and mechanism were studied and analyzed. WO3 has a well band matching with CdIn2S4, leading to a significantly enhanced photo&#8208;electrochemical CP performance of the nanocomposite. Meanwhile, as confirmed in this work, the CdIn2S4/WO3 nanocomposite can store photoinduced electrons under light illumination through intercalation reactions and changing the valence state of tungsten. Moreover, it can discharge in the dark state to provide continuous CP for the coupled metals. This research will promote the practical application process of the photo&#8208;electrochemical CP technology.

         <title>Differentiation of Epoxide Enantiomers in the Confined Spaces of an Homochiral Cu(II) Metal&#8208;Organic Framework by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The homochiral metal&#8208;organic framework TAMOF&#8208;1 was used as a heterogeneous catalyst in the kinetic resolution of styrene oxide by ring opening reactions with anilines. The linear products underwent a second KR resulting in an amplification of the final stereoselectivity (subtractive Horeau amplification effect). Computational studies rationalized the two successive KR while providing a deep understanding of the process.







Abstract
TAMOF&#8208;1, a homochiral metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) constructed from an amino acid derivative and Cu(II), was investigated as a heterogeneous catalyst in kinetic resolutions involving the ring opening of styrene oxide with a set of anilines. The branched products generated from the ring opening of styrene oxide with anilines and the unreacted epoxide were obtained with moderately high enantiomeric excesses. The linear product arising from the attack on the non&#8208;benzylic position of styrene oxide underwent a second kinetic resolution by reacting with the epoxide, resulting in an amplification of its final enantiomeric excess and a concomitant formation of an array of isomeric aminodiols. Computational studies confirmed the experimental results, providing a deep understanding of the whole process involving the two successive kinetic resolutions. Furthermore, TAMOF&#8208;1 activity was conserved after several catalytic cycles. The ring opening of a meso&#8208;epoxide with aniline catalyzed by TAMOF&#8208;1 was also studied and moderate enantioselectivities were obtained.

         <title>Impact of Pore Size and Defects on the Selective Adsorption of Acetylene in Alkyne&#8208;Functionalized Nickel(II)&#8208;Pyrazolate&#8208;Based MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust defective nickel(II) pyrazolate&#8208;based MOFs, bearing alkyne moieties on the organic spacers have been explored for C2H2/CO2 separation. As proven by static and dynamic gas adsorption and computational modelling the non&#8208;defective34 systems give rise to selective interactions with C2H2 over CO2 as a result of a mixture of pore confinement and H&#8208;bonding and alkyne&#8208;alkyne interactions. Creation of defects is responsible for strong interactions of cluster basic sites and extraframework potassium cations with CO2 with a concomitant lowering of C2H2 over CO2 selectivity.







Abstract
C2H2/CO2 separation is a highly challenging process as a consequence of their similar physicochemical properties. In this work we have explored, by static and dynamic gas sorption techniques and computational modelling, the suitability of a series of two isoreticular robust Ni(II)pyrazolate&#8208;based MOFs, bearing alkyne moieties on the ligand backbones, for C2H2/CO2 separation. The results are consistent with high adsorption capacity and selectivity of the essayed systems towards C2H2 molecules. Furthermore, a post&#8208;synthetic treatment with KOH ethanolic solution gives rise to linker vacancy defects and incorporation of extraframework potassium ions. Creation of defects is responsible for increased adsorption capacity for both gases, however, strong interactions of the cluster basic sites and extraframework potassium cations with CO2 molecules are responsible for a lowering of C2H2 over CO2 selectivity.

         <title>Ultradoping Boron on Si(100) via Solvothermal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultradoping introduces unprecedented dopant levels into Si, which transforms its electronic behaviour and enables its use as a next&#8208;generation electronic material. Commercialization of ultradoping is currently limited by gas&#8208;phase ultra&#8208;high vacuum requirements. Solvothermal chemistry is amenable to scale&#8208;up; however, an integral part of ultradoping is a direct chemical bond between dopants and Si and solvothermal dopant&#8208;Si surface reactions are not well&#8208;developed. This work provides the first quantified demonstration of achieving the ultradoping concentrations of Boron (~1e14 cm 2 ) using a solvothermal process. Surface characterization indicate the catalyst cross&#8208;reacted, which led to multiple surface products and caused ambiguity in experimental confirmation of direct surface attachment. Density functional theory computations elucidate that the reaction results in direct B&#8208;Si surface bonds. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle work lays groundwork for emerging solvothermal ultradoping processes</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies of the Mechanochemical Synthesis of ZnS from its Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed in&#8197;situ investigation of the mechanosynthesis of the hexagonal ZnS modification (wurtzite) from its elements combining synchrotron powder diffraction and pressure measurements is presented. In addition, the subsequent phase transition from the hexagonal to the cubic structure (sphalerite) was investigated and the kinetics was explored.







Abstract
Mechanochemistry, as a synthesis tool for inorganic materials, became an ever&#8208;growing field in material chemistry. The direct energy transfer by collision of the educts with the milling media gives the possibility to design environmental&#8208;friendly reactions. Nevertheless, the underlying process of energy transfer and hence the kinetics of mechanosynthesis remain unclear. Herein, we present in&#8197;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies coupled with pressure measurements performed during the formation of ZnS and the subsequent phase transition (PT) from the hexagonal to the cubic modification. Milling Zn and S8 results in the sublimation of S8, observed by a sudden pressure increase. Simultaneously, the hexagonal metastable ZnS&#8208;modification (wurtzite) forms. Via detection of the pressure maximum, the exact start of the wurtzite formation can be determined. Immediately after the formation of wurtzite, the structural PT to the thermodynamic stable cubic modification sphalerite takes place. This PT can be described by the Prout&#8208;Tompkins equation for autocatalytic reactions, similar to thermally induced PT in sulfur vapor at high temperatures (T&gt;1133&#8197;K). The increase in the reactivity of the wurtzite formation is explained by the reaction in sulfur vapor and the induction of defect structures by the collisions with the milling media.

         <title>Monitoring the Structure Evolution of Titanium Oxide Photocatalysts: From the Molecular Form via the Amorphous State to the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation mechanism of amorphous TixOy photocatalysts was studied by X&#8208;ray total scattering experiments and subsequent PDF analysis starting from titanium(IV) ethoxide precursor. Effects of the colour change upon UV illumination on the local Ti environment were investigated by PDF analysis and EELS. Transformation of amorphous TixOy to anatase&#8208;TiO2 by calcination was further examined by in&#8197;situ temperature dependent experiments.







Abstract
Amorphous TixOy with high surface area has attracted significant interest as photocatalyst with higher activity in ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;induced water splitting applications compared to commercial nanocrystalline TiO2. Under photocatalytic operation conditions, the structure of the molecular titanium alkoxide precursor rearranges upon hydrolysis and leads to higher connectivity of the structure&#8208;building units. Structurally ordered domains with sizes smaller than 7&#8197;&#197; form larger aggregates. The experimental scattering data can be explained best with a structure model consisting of an anatase&#8208;like core and a distorted shell. Upon exposure to UV light, the white TixOy suspension turns dark corresponding to the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ as confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Heat&#8208;induced crystallisation was followed by in&#8197;situ temperature&#8208;dependent total scattering experiments. First, ordering in the Ti&#8722;O environment takes place upon to 350&#8201;&#176;C. Above this temperature, the distorted anatase core starts to grow but the structure obtained at 400&#8201;&#176;C is still not fully ordered.

         <title>Saddle&#8208;Shaped Building Blocks: A New Concept for Designing Fully Conjugated 3D Organic Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductors design: Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and its derivatives are &#960;&#8208;conjugated with saddle&#8208;shaped 3D architecture. They would be candidate as building blocks for constructing fully conjugated 3D materials that can facilitate the electron layer&#8208;layer delocalization and transport. We highlight recent conceptual progresses on the design and properties of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D organic semiconducting materials based on the COT derivatives, which could give inspiration for designing next generation organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Currently, most organic semiconducting materials (OSMs) are &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures in one or two dimension (2D), where the lack of layer&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;conjugation connection greatly blocks their electron delocalization and transport. The 3D fully conjugated materials could solve this issue because they can provide efficient charge&#8208;transport pathways throughout the whole 3D skeleton, in which the suitable 3D building block is the key to the development of fully conjugated 3D OSMs. Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and its derivatives are good candidates due to their &#960;&#8208;conjugation with 3D saddle&#8208;shaped architecture. In this Concept, we discuss the key features of saddle&#8208;shaped COT&#8208;based derivatives and their synthetic strategy, then we present the current development of using the COT derivatives as building blocks to construct the 3D fully conjugated organic small compound&#8208; and polymer&#8208;based OSMs. The properties and perspectives of these OSMs in photovoltaics, electro&#8208;catalysis and electrical conductivities are also discussed. These recent advances in the developing 3D fully conjugated materials could potentially open up a new frontier in the design of OSMs.

         <title>Glycol Chitosan Functionalized with a Gd(III) Chelate as a Redox&#8208;responsive Magnetic Resonance Imaging Probe to Label Cell Embedding Alginate Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Gd(III)&#8208;HPDO3A&#8208;like chelate has been conjugated to glycol&#8208;chitosan through a disulphide bond to obtain a redox&#8208;responsive contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), that can be used to label the lumen of alginate&#8208;based cell embedding capsules. The increase of reducing potential within the capsule microenvironment, that is related to hypoxia, can be readily detected by a decrease of MRI contrast enhancement.







Abstract
One possibility for the non&#8208;invasive imaging of encapsulated cell grafts is to label the lumen of cell embedding capsules with a redox&#8208;responsive probe, as an increased extracellular reducing potential can be considered as a marker of hypoxia&#8208;induced necrosis. A Gd(III)&#8208;HPDO3A&#8208;like chelate has been conjugated to glycol&#8208;chitosan through a redox&#8208;responsive disulphide bond to obtain a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Such a compound can be interspersed with fibroblasts within the lumen of alginate&#8208;chitosan capsules. Increasing reducing conditions within the extracellular microenvironment lead to the reductive cleavage of the disulphide bond and to the release of gadolinium in the form of a low molecular weight, non&#8208;ionic chelate. The efflux of such chelate from capsules is readily detected by a decrease of contrast enhancement in T1&#8208;weighted MR images.

         <title>C=C Bond Oxidative Cleavage of BODIPY Photocages by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselective oxidative cleavage of a C=C bond from a boron&#8208;dipyrrolemethene (BODIPY) photocage has been realized under 630&#8197;nm illumination; this generated an aldehyde compound and a thiol fluorescent probe. This reaction was demonstrated inside live cells by monitoring the aldehyde release in real time. In particular, the photocage can easily be functionalized with a mannose group so as to acquire the ability to target cancer cells.







Abstract
Photocages for protection and the controlled release of bioactive compounds have been widely investigated. However, the vast majority of these photocages employ the cleavage of single bonds and high&#8208;energy ultraviolet light. The construction of a photoactivation system that uses visible light to cleave unsaturated bonds still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a regioselective oxidative cleavage of C=C bonds from a boron&#8208;dipyrrolemethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photocage by illumination at 630&#8197;nm, resulting in a free aldehyde and a thiol fluorescent probe. This strategy was demonstrated in live HeLa cells, and the generated &#945;&#8208;formyl&#8208;BODIPY allowed real&#8208;time monitoring of aldehyde release in the cells. In particular, it is shown that a mannose&#8208;functionalized photocage can target HepG2 cells.

         <title>An Optimized Protocol for the Synthesis of Peptides Containing trans&#8208;cyclooctene and Bicyclononyne Dienophiles as Useful Multifunctional Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the great advances in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the incorporation of certain functional groups into peptide sequences is restricted by the compatibility of the building blocks with conditions used during SPPS. In particular, the introduction of highly reactive groups used in modern bioorthogonal reactions into peptides remains elusive. Here we present an optimized synthetic protocol enabling installation of two strained dienophiles,  trans  &#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and bicyclononyne (BCN), into different peptide sequences. The two groups enable fast and modular post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of peptides, as we demonstrate in preparation of peptide&#8208;peptide and peptide&#8208;drug conjugates. Due to the excellent biocompatibility, the click&#8208;functionalization of the peptides can be performed directly in live cells. We further show that the introduction of both clickable groups into peptides enables construction of smart, multifunctional probes that can streamline complex chemical biology experiments such as visualization and pull&#8208;down of metabolically labeled glycoconjugates. The presented strategy will find utility in construction of peptides for diverse applications, where high reactivity, efficiency and biocompatibility of the modification step is critical.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective trans&#8208;Hydrostannation of Boron&#8208;Capped Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkynyl&#8208;B(aam) (aam = anthranilamidato) derivatives are bench stable compounds that undergo remarkably selective reactions with Bu  3  SnH in the presence of [Cp*RuCl]  4  as the catalyst. The addition follows an unorthodox  trans  &#8208;selective course; in terms of regioselectivity, the Bu  3  Sn&#8208; unit is delivered&#160; to the C&#8208;atom adjacent to the boracyclic head group. This outcome is deemed to reflect a hydrogen bonding interaction between the protic &#8211;NH groups of the benzo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;diazaborininone ring system and the polarized [Ru&#8722;Cl] bond in the loaded catalyst, which locks the substrate in place in a favorable orientation relative to the incoming reagent. The resulting isomerically (almost) pure  gem  &#8208;dimetalated building blocks are amenable to numerous downstream functionalizations; most remarkable is the ability to subject the &#8722;B(aam) moiety to Suzuki cross coupling without need for prior hydrolysis while keeping the adjacent Bu  3  Sn&#8208; group intact. Alternatively, the tin residue can be engaged in selective tin/halogen exchange without touching the boron entity; the fact that the two &#8208;NH entities of &#8211;B(aam) do not protonate organozinc reagents and hence do not interfere with Negishi reactions of the alkenyl halides thus formed is another virtue of this so far underutilized boracycle. Overall, the ruthenium catalyzed  trans  &#8208;hydrostannation of alkynyl&#8208;B(aam) derivatives opens a practical gateway to isomerically pure trisubstituted alkenes of many different substitution patterns by sequential functionalization of the 1&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;heterobimetallic adducts primarily formed.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Elucidation of Complex Endotaxially Intergrown Lanthanum Barium Oxonitridosilicate Oxides by Combination of Microfocused Synchrotron Radiation and Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>

         <dc:description>Single crystalline domains in intergrown microcrystalline material of the new compounds Ba  22.5+  x  La  55&#8722;  x  [Si  129  N  240&#8722;  x  O  x  ]O  3  :Ce  3+  and Ba  25.5+  x  La  77&#8722;  x  [Si  170  N  312&#8722;  x  O  9+  x  ]O  4  :Ce  3+  were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Precise diffraction data from these domains were collected with microfocused synchrotron radiation so that crystal structure elucidation of the complex disordered networks became possible. They are composed of two different interconnected slabs of which one is similar in both compounds, which explains their notorious intergrowth. The distribution of Ba and La is indicated by the analysis of bond&#8208;valence sums and by comparison with isostructural Sr  28.5+  x  La  75&#8722;  x  [Si  170  N  312&#8722;  x  O  9+  x  ]O  4  .

         <title>Triplet Exciton Up&#8208;Converting Blue Exciplex Host for Deep Blue Phosphors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) type exciplex host employing a novel electron transport type (n&#8208;type) host managing positive polarons and stabilizing excitons was developed to elongate the device lifetime of deep blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). The bipolar n&#8208;type host was designed to prevent hole leakage and secure hole stability while being stabilized under excitons by introducing a CN modified carbazole moiety as a weak donor. The TADF type exciplex host based blue PhOLEDs showed high quantum efficiency above 20% with a deep blue color coordinate of (0.14, 0.16) and elongated device lifetime. The device operational lifetime of the blue PhOLEDs bearing the TADF type exciplex host was extended by more than twice compared to that of the exciplex free unipolar host. This work suggested a design concept of the n&#8208;type host to develop the TADF type exciplex host for deep blue phosphors to reach long lifespan in the deep blue PhOLEDs.</dc:description>

The reaction regioselectively occurred at the C&#8211;H bond flanked by the two&#8208;fluorine atoms of the difluoroaryl unit, and on both cyclometalated ligands. This post&#8208;functionalization gives a straightforward access to modified complexes in only one manipulation and allows to introduce thermally sensitive functional groups such as trifluoromethyl, nitrile, benzoyl or ester. The X&#8208;ray crystallography, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of the diarylated complexes were investigated. Whatever the nature of the incorporated substituted aryl groups, all obtained complexes emit red phosphorescence (622&#8208;632 nm) with similar lifetimes (1.9&#8208;2 &#956;s).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A decarbonylation free, polystyrene supported Pd (Pd@PS) catalyzed carbonylative esterification of hydroxyl (&#8208;OH) group of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (5&#8208;HMF) to its corresponding aryl esters has been developed. The use of Pd@PS, oxalic acid as CO source, and aryl halides was explored first time for aryl ester of 5&#8208;HMF synthesis. Here, we investigated the vital role of polystyrene support to avoid the commonly known decarbonylation of 5&#8208;HMF. The reaction exhibits vast substrate scope with comparably good yield and catalyst recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR Emissive Chromium(0), Molybdenum(0) and Tungsten(0) Complexes in the Solid State at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of NIR emitters based on earth&#8208;abundant elements is an important goal in contemporary science. We present here Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) carbonyl complexes with a pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) based ligand. A detailed photophysical investigation shows that all the complexes exhibit dual emissions in the VIS and in the NIR region. The emissive excited states are assigned to two distinct triplet states by time&#8208;resolved emission and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy at variable temperature, supported by density functional theory. In particular, the NIR emissive triplet state exhibits unprecedented lifetimes of up to 600 &#177; 10 ns and quantum yields reaching 1.7 &#8729; 10&#8722;4 at room temperature. These are the first examples of Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) complexes that emit in the NIR II region.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Light&#8208;controlled Generation of Calcium Carbonate and Barium Carbonate Biomorphs via Photochemical Stimulation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical activation is proposed as a general method for controlling the crystallization of sparingly soluble carbonates in space and time. The photogeneration of carbonate in an alkaline environment is achieved upon photo&#8208;decarboxylation of an organic precursor using a conventional 365 nm UV LED. Local irradiation was conducted focusing the LED light on a 300 mm radius spot on a closed glass crystallization cell. The precursor solution was optimized to avoid the precipitation of the photoreaction organic byproducts and prevent photoinduced pH changes to achieve the formation of calcium carbonate only in the corresponding irradiated area. The crystallization was monitored in real&#8208;time by time&#8208;lapse imaging. The method is also shown to work in gels. Similarly, it was also shown to photo&#8208;activate locally the formation of barium carbonate biomorphs. In the last case, the morphology of these biomimetic structures was tuned by changing the irradiation intensity.</dc:description>

         <title>ChemBead Enabled High&#8208;Throughput Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Reveals a New, Complementary Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) methods are central to modern medicinal chemistry. While many HTE approaches to C&#8208;N and Csp  2  &#8208;Csp  2  &#160;bonds are available, options for Csp  2  &#8208;Csp  3  &#160;bonds are limited. We report here how the adaptation of nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aryl bromides with alkyl halides to HTE is enabled by AbbVie ChemBeads technology. Using this approach, we were able to quickly map out the reactivity space at a global level using a challenging array of 3 &#215; 222 micromolar reactions. The observed hit rate (56%) is competitive with other often&#8208;used HTE reactions and the results are scalable. A key to this level of success was the finding that bipyridine 6&#8208;carboxamidine (BpyCam), a ligand that had not previously been shown to be optimal in any reaction, is as general as the best&#8208;known ligands with complementary reactivity. Such &#8220;cryptic&#8221; catalysts may be common and modern HTE methods should facilitate the process of finding these catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Molecular Logic Gates Driven by Temperature and by Protons in Solution and on Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent NOT logic is demonstrated by exploiting predissociation in a 1,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted &#916;  2  &#8208;pyrazoline on its own and when grafted onto silica microparticles. Related &#916;  2  &#8208;pyrazolines become proton&#8208;driven YES and NOT logic gates on the basis of fluorescent PET (photoinduced electron transfer) switches. Additional PASS 1 and YES + PASS 1 logic gates on silica are also demonstrated within the same family. Beside these small&#8208;molecule systems, a polymeric molecular thermometer based on a benzofurazan&#8208;derivatized N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide copolymer is attached to silica to produce temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent YES logic.</dc:description>
