         <title>5&#8208;Methylcytosine Substantially Enhances the Thermal Stability of DNA Minidumbbell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minidumbbell (MDB) is a recently identified non&#8208;B DNA structure which has been proposed to associate with genetic instabilities.&#160; It also serves as a functional structural motif in DNA nanotechnology.&#160; DNA molecular switches constructed using MDBs show instant and complete structural conversions with easy manipulations.&#160; The availability of stable MDBs can broaden their applications.&#160; In this work, we found that substitutions of cytosine with 5&#8208;methylcytosine could lead to a significant enhancement in the thermal stabilities of MDBs.&#160; Consecutive methylations of cytosine in MDBs brought about cumulative stabilization with a drastic increase in the melting temperature by 23 &#176;C.&#160; NMR solution structures of two MDBs containing 5&#8208;methylcytosine residues have been successfully determined and revealed that the enhanced stabilities resulted primarily from favorable hydrophobic contacts, more stable base pairs and enhanced base&#8208;base stackings involving the methyl groups of 5&#8208;methylcytosine.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra&#8208;substituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products. In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. We now report a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, we show that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1) ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2) regioselective trapping of said arynes. We have improved upon our previous reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal functional groups on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryne precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Emissive 9&#8208;Borafluorene Derivatives: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties, and Device Fabrication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives, functionalised with electron&#8208;donating groups, was prepared. Some of these 9&#8208;borafluorene compounds exhibit strong yellowish emission in solution and in the solid state with relative high quantum yields (up to 73.6% for  FMesB&#8208;Cz  as a neat film). Highly twisted donor groups suppress the charge transfer but the intrinsic photophysical properties of 9&#8208;borafluorene systems remain and the new compounds possess enhanced stability to the atmosphere. All of these compounds exhibit excellent thermal stability, revealing their potential for applications in materials science. OLED devices were fabricated with two of the highly emissive compounds, and they exhibit strong yellow&#8208;greenish electro&#8208;luminescence with maximum luminance intensity &gt; 22000 cd&#183;m  &#8208;2  . This is the first example of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives being used as light&#8208;emitting materials in OLED devices, and helps us to achieve a balance between maintaining their intrinsic properties and improving their stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Mild Lactamization Using Highly Electrophilic Triphosgene in a Micro&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lactams are cyclic amides that are indispensable as drugs and as drug candidates. Conventional lactamization includes acid&#8208;mediated approaches and coupling agent&#8208;mediated approaches that suffer from a narrow substrate scope, much waste, and/or high cost. Inexpensive, less wasteful and highly electrophilic reagent&#8208;mediated approaches are attractive, but there is an imminent risk of side reactions. Herein, we describe methods using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a micro&#8208;flow reactor that accomplish lactamization that are rapid (0.5&#8208;10 sec), mild, inexpensive, and less wasteful. We developed two methods, referred to here as A and B, using NMM and NMI, respectively. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without the need for tedious purifications. Undesired reactions were successfully suppressed and the risk in handling triphosgene was minimized by the use of micro&#8208;flow technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Bismuth Aminotroponiminates: Charge Controls Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Central control: A series of bismuth aminotroponiminate cations are discussed and differences between neutral and cationic compounds in terms of coordination chemistry, Lewis acidity, and redox behavior are pinpointed. Specifically, cationization allows switching from ligand&#8208;centered redox events to metal&#8208;centered redox events, facilitating rare examples of quasi&#8208;reversible electron transfer at bismuth.







Abstract
The behavior of the redox&#8208;active aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligand in the coordination sphere of bismuth has been investigated in neutral and cationic compounds, [Bi(ATI)3] and [Bi(ATI)2Ln][A] (L=neutral ligand; n=0, 1; A=counteranion). Their coordination chemistry in solution and in the solid state has been analyzed through (variable&#8208;temperature) NMR spectroscopy, line&#8208;shape analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, and their Lewis acidity has been evaluated by using the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett method (and modifications thereof). Cyclic voltammetry, in combination with DFT calculations, indicates that switching between ligand&#8208; and metal&#8208;centered redox events is possible by altering the charge of the compounds from 0 in neutral species to +1 in cationic compounds. This adds important facets to the rich redox chemistry of ATIs and to the redox chemistry of bismuth compounds, which is, so far, largely unexplored.

This adds important facets to the rich redox chemistry of ATIs and to the redox chemistry of bismuth compounds, which is, so far, largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Regiospecific Synthesis of Calcium&#8208;Independent Daptomycin Antibiotics using a Chemoenzymatic Method</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ca not required: Daptomycin relies on calcium as an essential element for its strong antibiotic activity. Herein, a chemoenzymatic approach is used to synthesize regiospecific daptomycin derivatives that are independent of calcium and are more active than the parent drug against daptomycin&#8208;susceptible and daptomycin&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria.







Abstract
Daptomycin (DAP) is a calcium (Ca2+)&#8208;dependent FDA&#8208;approved antibiotic drug for the treatment of Gram&#8208;positive infections. It possesses a complex pharmacophore hampering derivatization and/or synthesis of analogues. To mimic the Ca2+&#8208;binding effect, we used a chemoenzymatic approach to modify the tryptophan (Trp) residue of DAP and synthesize kinetically characterized and structurally elucidated regiospecific Trp&#8208;modified DAP analogues. We demonstrated that the modified DAPs are several times more active than the parent molecule against antibiotic&#8208;susceptible and antibiotic&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Strikingly, and in contrast to the parent molecule, the DAP derivatives do not rely on calcium or any additional elements for activity.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Control of the Bidentate 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole Ligand in Copper Chemistry with Application to Catalysis in the A3 Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precatalyst control: [CuII(OTf)2(pyb)2]2&#8201;CH3CN (1), in which pyb is 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole, enables the synthesis of a wide range of propargylamines by the A3 coupling reaction at room temperature in the absence of additives. The hybrid N,N&#8242;&#8208;bidentate pyb ligand imposes exclusive trans coordination at Cu, can rotate and modulate charge distribution and flux, thus orchestrating structural and electronic precatalyst control permitting activation of the C&#8722;H bond.







Abstract
The hybrid bidentate 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole (pyb) ligand was introduced into 3d transition metal catalysis. Specifically, [CuII(OTf)2(pyb)2]&#8901;2&#8201;CH3CN (1) enables the synthesis of a wide range of propargylamines by the A3 coupling reaction at room temperature in the absence of additives. Experimental and high&#8208;level theoretical calculations suggest that the bridging N atom of the ligand imposes exclusive trans coordination at Cu and allows ligand rotation, while the N atom of the pyridine group modulates charge distribution and flux, and thus orchestrates structural and electronic precatalyst control permitting alkyne binding with simultaneous activation of the C&#8722;H bond via a transient CuI species.

         <title>Lewis Acidic Boranes, Lewis Bases, and Equilibrium Constants: A Reliable Scaffold for a Quantitative Lewis Acidity/Basicity Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Loose or Lewis? A comprehensive set of experimental equilibrium constants reveals the strength of interactions between boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids and N&#8208;, O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and P&#8208;centered Lewis bases. Data analysis shows that two&#8208;parameter Equation&#8197;(1) enables Lewis adduct formation to be straightforwardly predicted for borane/Lewis base couples. Experimental data can be supplemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations for a rational design of borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
A quantitative Lewis acidity/basicity scale toward boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids has been developed based on a set of 90 experimental equilibrium constants for the reactions of triarylboranes with various O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and P&#8208;centered Lewis bases in dichloromethane at 20&#8201;&#176;C. Analysis with the linear free energy relationship log&#8201;KB=LAB+LBB allows equilibrium constants, KB, to be calculated for any type of borane/Lewis base combination through the sum of two descriptors, one for Lewis acidity (LAB) and one for Lewis basicity (LBB). The resulting Lewis acidity/basicity scale is independent of fixed reference acids/bases and valid for various types of trivalent boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids. It is demonstrated that the newly developed Lewis acidity/basicity scale is easily extendable through linear relationships with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated or common physical&#8211;organic descriptors and known thermodynamic data (&#916;H
). Furthermore, this experimental platform can be utilized for the rational development of borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions.

         <title>Cyclo&#8208;Ketal Xanthene Dyes: A New Class of Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores for Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the emission of xanthene dye is pushed to the NIR region by replacing the 10&#8208;position O of rhodamines with a cyclo&#8208;ketal. The newly developed KRhs display intense fluorescence peaks at 700&#8197;nm (&#934;F 0.64) and, more importantly, exhibit stochastic fluorescence off&#8211;on switches to support super&#8208;resolution imaging. These KRh derivatives display great potential for fluorescence labeling and super&#8208;resolution imaging in the NIR region.







Abstract
Newly emerging super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques provide opportunities for precise observations on cellular microstructures. However, they also impose severe demands on fluorophores. Here, we develop a new series of NIR xanthene dyes, named as KRhs, by replacing the 10&#8208;position O of rhodamines with a cyclo&#8208;ketal. KRhs display an intense NIR emission peak at 700&#8197;nm with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.64. More importantly, they, without the aid of enhancing buffer, exhibit stochastic fluorescence off&#8211;on switches to support time&#8208;resolved localization of single fluorophore. KRhs are functionalized into KRh&#8208;MitoFix, KRh&#8208;Mem and KRh&#8208;Halo that demonstrate mitochondria, plasma membrane and fusion protein targeting ability, respectively. Consequently, these KRh probes demonstrate straightforward usage for super&#8208;resolution imaging of these targets in live cells. Therefore, KRhs merit future development for fluorescence labeling and super&#8208;resolution imaging in the NIR region.

         <title>How the physicochemical properties of the bulk material affect the ablation crater profile, mass balance and bubble dynamics during single&#8208;pulse, nanosecond laser ablation in water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the key steps that drive the laser&#8208;based synthesis of colloids is a prerequisite for learning how to optimize the ablation process in terms of the nanoparticle output and functional design of the nanomaterials. Even though many studies focus on cavitation bubble formation using single&#8208;pulse ablation conditions, the ablation efficiency and nanoparticle properties are typically investigated under prolonged ablation conditions with repetition rate lasers. Linking single&#8208;pulse and multiple&#8208;pulse ablation is difficult due to limitations induced by gas formation cross&#8208;effects, which occur on longer timescales and depend on the target materials' oxidation&#8208;sensitivity. Therefore, this study investigates the ablation and cavitation bubble dynamics under nanosecond, single laser pulse conditions for six different bulk materials (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ti, and Al). Also, the effective threshold fluences, ablation volumes and penetration depths are quantified for the these materials. The thermal and chemical properties of the corresponding bulk materials not only favor the formation of larger spot sizes but also lead to the highest molar ablation efficiencies for low melting materials such as Al.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the key steps that drive the laser&#8208;based synthesis of colloids is a prerequisite for learning how to optimize the ablation process in terms of the nanoparticle output and functional design of the nanomaterials. Even though many studies focus on cavitation bubble formation using single&#8208;pulse ablation conditions, the ablation efficiency and nanoparticle properties are typically investigated under prolonged ablation conditions with repetition rate lasers. Linking single&#8208;pulse and multiple&#8208;pulse ablation is difficult due to limitations induced by gas formation cross&#8208;effects, which occur on longer timescales and depend on the target materials' oxidation&#8208;sensitivity. Therefore, this study investigates the ablation and cavitation bubble dynamics under nanosecond, single laser pulse conditions for six different bulk materials (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ti, and Al). Also, the effective threshold fluences, ablation volumes and penetration depths are quantified for the these materials. The thermal and chemical properties of the corresponding bulk materials not only favor the formation of larger spot sizes but also lead to the highest molar ablation efficiencies for low melting materials such as Al. Furthermore, the concept of the cavitation bubble growth linked with the oxidation sensitivity of the ablated material is discussed. With this, evidence is provided that intensive chemical reactions occurring during the very early timescale of ablation are significantly enhanced by the bubble collapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As sulfur containing organic molecules thioamides and their isomers are conceivable intermediates in prebiotic chemistry,  e. g.  , in the formation of amino acids and thiazoles and resemble viable candidates for detection in interstellar media. Here we report the characterization of parent thioformamide in the solid state  via  single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and its photochemical interconversion to its hitherto unreported higher energy tautomer thiolimine in inert argon and dinitrogen matrices. Upon photogeneration, four conformers of thiolimine form, whose ratio depends on the employed wavelength. One of these conformers interconverts due to quantum mechanical tunneling with a half&#8208;life of 30&#8211;45 min in both matrix materials at 3 and 20 K. A spontaneous reverse reaction from thiolimine to thioformamide is not observed. To support our experimental findings, we explored the potential energy surface of the system at the AE&#8208;CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pCVTZ level of theory and computed tunneling half&#8208;lives with the CVT/SCT approach applying DFT methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Noncovalent Helicene Structure between Nucleic Acids and Cyanuric Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel noncovalent helicene structure between nucleic acids and cyanuric acid is revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. The previously proposed hexameric rosette structure is disfavored during the simulation.







Abstract
Cyanuric acid (CA), a triazine heterocycle, is extensively utilized for noncovalent self&#8208;assembly. The association between poly(adenine) and CA into micron&#8208;length fibers was a remarkable observation made by Sleiman and co&#8208;workers, who proposed that adenine and CA adopt a hexameric rosette configuration in analogy with previously reported structures for CA assemblies. However, recent experimental observations from the Krishnamurthy group led to a reevaluation of the hexameric rosette model, wherein they have proposed a hydrogen&#8208;bonded helicene model as an alternative. Our molecular dynamics simulations show that the hexad model is indeed unlikely and that this novel noncovalent helicene geometry, where the adenine and CA bases form an extended helical hydrogen&#8208;bond network across the system, is a more probable structural motif. The existence of noncovalent helicene compounds may have wide&#8208;ranging applications in DNA nanotechnology and helicene chemistry.

         <title>Tris(pentafluoroethyl)difluorophosphorane: A Versatile Fluoride Acceptor for Transition Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of titanium, nickel, and copper complexes stabilized by the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) [(C2F5)3PF3]&#8722; (FAP anion) was obtained on reaction of the parent fluoride complexes with the strong Lewis acid (C2F5)3PF2. The reaction products depend on the solvent used or additional Lewis bases present during the fluoride transfer from the metal complexes to the phosphorane.







Abstract
Fluoride abstraction from different types of transition metal fluoride complexes [LnMF] (M=Ti, Ni, Cu) by the Lewis acid tris(pentafluoroethyl)difluorophosphorane (C2F5)3PF2 to yield cationic transition metal complexes with the tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate counterion (FAP anion, [(C2F5)3PF3]&#8722;) is reported. (C2F5)3PF2 reacted with trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(ArF)F] (iPr2Im=1,3&#8208;diisopropylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; ArF=C6F5, 1&#8201;a; 4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6F4, 1&#8201;b; 4&#8208;C6F5&#8208;C6F4, 1&#8201;c) through fluoride transfer to form the complex salts trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(solv)(ArF)]FAP (2&#8201;a&#8208;c[solv]; solv=Et2O, CH2Cl2, THF) depending on the reaction medium. In the presence of stronger Lewis bases such as carbenes or PPh3, solvent coordination was suppressed and the complexes trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(PPh3)(C6F5)]FAP (trans&#8208;2&#8201;a[PPh3]) and cis&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(Dipp2Im)(C6F5)]FAP (cis&#8208;2&#8201;a[Dipp2Im]) (Dipp2Im=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were isolated. Fluoride abstraction from [(Dipp2Im)CuF] (3) in CH2Cl2 or 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene led to the isolation of [{(Dipp2Im)Cu}2]2+2&#8201;FAP&#8722; (4). Subsequent reaction of 4 with PPh3 and different carbenes resulted in the complexes [(Dipp2Im)Cu(LB)]FAP (5&#8201;a&#8211;e, LB=Lewis base). In the presence of C6Me6, fluoride transfer afforded [(Dipp2Im)Cu(C6Me6)]FAP (5&#8201;f), which serves as a source of [(Dipp2Im)Cu)]+. Fluoride abstraction of [Cp2TiF2] (7) resulted in the formation of dinuclear [FCp2Ti(&#956;&#8208;F)TiCp2F]FAP (8) (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5) with one terminal fluoride ligand at each titanium atom and an additional bridging fluoride ligand.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Promoted Fluorination Reactions of &#945;&#8208;Bromoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly inverted: Silver&#8208;promoted fluorination of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides proceeds under mild conditions via an aziridinone intermediate with double inversion of configuration. This approach can provide a variety of fluorinated products with high yield, chemoselectivity, and stereospecificity.







Abstract
Silver&#8208;promoted C&#8722;F bond formation in &#945;&#8208;bromoamides by using AgF under mild conditions is reported. This simple method enables access to tertiary, secondary, and primary alkyl fluorides involving biomolecular scaffolds. This transformation is applicable to primary and secondary amides and shows broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. Kinetics experiments revealed that the reaction rate increased in the order of 3&#176;&gt;2&#176;&gt;1&#176; &#945;&#8208;carbon atom. In addition, it was found that the acidic amide proton plays an important role in accelerating the reaction. Mechanistic studies suggested generation of an aziridinone intermediate that undergoes subsequent nucleophilic addition to form the C&#8722;F bond with stereospecificity (i.e., retention of configuration).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doubly inverted&lt;/b&gt;: Silver&#8208;promoted fluorination of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides proceeds under mild conditions via an aziridinone intermediate with double inversion of configuration. This approach can provide a variety of fluorinated products with high yield, chemoselectivity, and stereospecificity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver&#8208;promoted C&#8722;F bond formation in &#945;&#8208;bromoamides by using AgF under mild conditions is reported. This simple method enables access to tertiary, secondary, and primary alkyl fluorides involving biomolecular scaffolds. This transformation is applicable to primary and secondary amides and shows broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. Kinetics experiments revealed that the reaction rate increased in the order of 3&#176;&amp;gt;2&#176;&amp;gt;1&#176; &#945;&#8208;carbon atom. In addition, it was found that the acidic amide proton plays an important role in accelerating the reaction. Mechanistic studies suggested generation of an aziridinone intermediate that undergoes subsequent nucleophilic addition to form the C&#8722;F bond with stereospecificity (i.e., retention of configuration). The synthesis of sterically hindered alcohols and ethers by using Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; is also demonstrated. Examples of reactions of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides with O nucleophiles are presented.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Aerobic Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Salicylaldehydic Cformyl&#8722;H Arylations with Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A challenging copper&#8208;catalyzed Cformyl&#8722;H arylation of salicylaldehydes with arylboronic acids has been developed. It involves unique salicylaldehydic copper species that differ from reported salicylaldehydic rhodacycles and palladacycles, as well as high chemoselectivity for Cformyl&#8722;H bond compared to the phenolic O&#8722;H bond based on copper catalysis.







Abstract
We report a challenging copper&#8208;catalyzed Cformyl&#8722;H arylation of salicylaldehydes with arylboronic acids that involves unique salicylaldehydic copper species that differ from reported salicylaldehydic rhodacycles and palladacycles. This protocol has high chemoselectivity for the Cformyl&#8722;H bond compared to the phenolic O&#8722;H bond involving copper catalysis under high reaction temperatures. This approach is compatible with a wide range of salicylaldehyde and arylboronic acid substrates, including estrone and carbazole derivatives, which leads to the corresponding arylation products. Mechanistic studies show that the 2&#8208;hydroxy group of the salicylaldehyde substrate triggers the formation of salicylaldehydic copper complexes through a CuI/CuII/CuIII catalytic cycle.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Higher Nuclearity Polyazanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chain gang: Polyazanes of up to five &#963;&#8208;bonded nitrogen atoms were prepared by sequential addition to diazo reagents. Structural analyses showed that the polynitrogen chains adopt a helical conformation maintained by the carboxyl substituents. The conformations persist in solution. Polyazanes are increasingly less reducing the more N atoms are in the chain.







Abstract
Polyazanes (i.e., higher nuclearity homologues of hydrazines) with increasing numbers of bound nitrogen atoms (from 3 to 5), including the first pentazane ever described, were prepared by the addition of lower&#8208;order polyazanes to diazo reagents. A structure was obtained. It was shown that the polynitrogen chains adopt a helical conformation. DFT modeling shows that the arrangement persists in solution. Although the polyazanes are all reducing agents, they become less so as the number of nitrogens increases.

         <title>Novel Arylindigoids by Late&#8208;Stage Derivatization of Biocatalytically Synthesized Dibromoindigo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indigoids represent natural product&#8208;based compounds applicable as organic semiconductors and photoresponsive materials. Yet modified indigo derivatives are difficult to access by chemical synthesis. Thus a biocatalytic approach applying several consecutive selective C&#8211;H functionalizations was developed that selectively provides access to various indigoids: Enzymatic halogenation of l&#8208;tryptophan followed by indole generation with tryptophanase yields 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;bromoindoles. Subsequent hydroxylation using a flavin monooxygenase furnishes dibromoindigo that is derivatized by acylation. This four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot cascade gives Boc&#8208;protected dibromoindigo in good isolated yields. The halogen substituent allows for late&#8208;stage diversification by cross&#8208;coupling directly performed in the crude mixture, thus enabling synthesis of 5,5&#8217;&#8208; and 6,6&#8217;&#8208;diarylindigo derivatives. This chemoenzymatic approach provides a modular platform towards novel indigoids with attractive spectral properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrothermal&#8208;induced formation of well&#8208;defined hollow carbons with curvature&#8208;activated N&#8208;C sites for Zn&#8208;air batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free carbons have been regarded as one of the promising materials alternative to precious metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), due to their high activity and stability. In this paper, well&#8208;defined N&#8208;doped hollow carbons (NHCs) are firstly achieved by an ammonia hydrothermal synthesis that are environmentally friendly and suitable for mass production in industry, using a commercial solid&#8208;type black carbon as raw material. Moreover, the shell thickness of the NHCs can be easily tuned by this hydrothermal strategy. Zn&#8208;air battery test results reveal the shell thickness&#8208;dependent activity and durability for ORR over the NHCs, which exceed that obtained by commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%, JM). The enhanced battery performance can be attributed to the curvature&#8208;activated N&#8208;C moieties on the hollow carbon surface, served as the main active sites for ORR as evidenced by DFT calculations. The proposed approach may open a way for designing curved hollow carbons with high graphitization degree and dopant nitrogen level for metal&#8208;air batteries or fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>The Prospect of Dimensionality in Porous Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the advent of silicon&#8208;based semiconductors, a plethora of previously unknown technologies became possible. The development of lightweight low&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductors followed soon after. However, the efficient charge/electron transfers enabled by the non&#8208;porous 3D structure of silicon is rather challenging to be realized by their (metal&#8208;)organic counterparts. Nevertheless, the demand for lighter, more efficient semiconductors is steadily increasing resulting in a growing interest in (metal&#8208;) organic semiconductors. These novel materials are faced with a variety of challenges originating from their chemical design, their packing and crystallinity. Although the effect of molecular design is quite well understood, the influence of dimensionality and the associated change in properties i.e., porosity, packing, conjugation is still an uncharted area in (metal&#8208;) organic semiconductors, yet highly important for their practical utilization. In this minireview, an overview on the design and synthesis of porous semiconductors, with a particular emphasis on organic semiconductors, is presented and the influence of dimensionality is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational molecular design of multifunctional blue material based on phenanthroimidazole derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with EQEs over 5% are still scarce in OLEDs. In this work, by introducing the [1,2,4] triazolo [1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit to the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole, two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPBTPA were obtained. Based on systematic photophysical analysis, we found that the TP block is suitable for constructing HLCT emitters. Its moderate electron withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring the color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the increased phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increases the oscillator strength, but also shortens the stokes shift. TDDFT calculations point to facile RISC processes in PTPBTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. PTPBTPA presents impressive performances when serving as non&#8208;doped device (EQE  max  = 7.11%, CIE: (0.15, 0.09)), as well as a high&#8208;performance host for yellow and red PhOLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dye into PTPBTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85% was achieved. The successful design of PTPBTPA not only provides an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrates the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>High temperature proton conduction in LaSbO4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanum orthoantimonate was synthesized using a solid&#8208;state synthesis method. To enhance the possible protonic conductivity, samples with the addition of 1 mol% Ca in La&#8208;site, were also prepared. The structure was studied by the means of X&#8208;ray diffraction, which showed that both specimens were single phase. The materials crystallized in the space group P2  1  /n. Dilatometry revealed that material expands non&#8208;linearly with the temperature. The nature of this deviation is unknown, however, the calculated linear fraction thermal expansion coefficient was 9.56&#215;10  &#8208;6  1/K. Electrical properties studies showed that the material is a proton conductor in oxidizing conditions, which was confirmed both by temperature studies in wet in dry air, but also by the H/D isotope exchange experiment. The conductivity was rather modest, peaking at order 10  &#8208;6  S/cm at 800&#176;C, but this can be further improved by microstructure and doping optimization. This is the first time when protonic conductivity in lanthanum orthoantimonates is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Twisting versus Delocalization in CAAC&#8208; and NHC&#8208;Stabilized Boron&#8208;Based Biradicals: The Roles of Sterics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twist or not: A thorough computational investigation of the origin of the distinct electrostructural properties of twisted boron&#8208;based biradicals featuring unsaturated C2R2 (R=Et, Me) bridges is presented. Steric effects are mostly responsible for the preference of twisted over planar structures, while the ground state multiplicity of the twisted structure is modulated by the &#963; framework of the bridge, with different R groups leading to distinct multiplicities.







Abstract
Twisted boron&#8208;based biradicals featuring unsaturated C2R2 (R=Et, Me) bridges and stabilization by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) were recently prepared. These species show remarkable geometrical and electronic differences with respect to their unbridged counterparts. Herein, a thorough computational investigation on the origin of their distinct electrostructural properties is performed. It is shown that steric effects are mostly responsible for the preference for twisted over planar structures. The ground&#8208;state multiplicity of the twisted structure is modulated by the &#963; framework of the bridge, and different R groups lead to distinct multiplicities. In line with the experimental data, a planar structure driven by delocalization effects is observed as global minimum for R=H. The synthetic elusiveness of C2R2&#8208;bridged systems featuring N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) was also investigated. These results could contribute to the engineering of novel main group biradicals.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Property Relationships in Bithiophenes with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Side&#8208;chain engineering through hydrogen bonding: Hydrogen&#8208;bonding terminal substituents can be used as structure&#8208;directing motifs to tailor the optoelectronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials in the solid&#8208;state. This approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.







Abstract
The use of crystal engineering to control the supramolecular arrangement of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in the solid&#8208;state is of considerable interest for the development of novel organic electronic materials. In this study, we investigated the effect of combining of two types of supramolecular interaction with different geometric requirements, amide hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions, on the &#960;&#8208;overlap between calamitic &#960;&#8208;conjugated cores. To this end, we prepared two series of bithiophene diesters and diamides with methylene, ethylene, or propylene spacers between the bithiophene core and the functional groups in their terminal substituents. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded bithiophene diamides showed significantly denser packing of the bithiophene cores than the diesters and other known &#945;,&#969;&#8208;disubstituted bithiophenes. The bithiophene packing density reach a maximum in the bithiophene diamide with an ethylene spacer, which had the smallest longitudinal bithiophene displacement and infinite 1D arrays of electronically conjugated, parallel, and almost linear N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O=C hydrogen bonds. The synergistic hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions were attributed to the favorable conformation mechanics of the ethylene spacer and resulted in H&#8208;type spectroscopic aggregates in solid&#8208;state absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that the optoelectronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials in the solid&#8208;state may be tailored systematically by side&#8208;chain engineering, and hence that this approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.

Capacitors in the cold: Although graphene fiber&#8208;based supercapacitors are promising for wearable electronic devices, their performance is limited in cold environments. Herein, porous nitrogen/sulfur dual&#8208;doped graphene fibers (NS&#8208;GFs) are synthesized by hydrothermal self&#8208;assembly followed by thermal annealing, exhibiting an excellent capacitive performance of 401&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitor assembled with NS&#8208;GF and graphene oxide exhibits a solar&#8211;thermal energy conversion of the electrolyte, extending the operating temperature range of the supercapacitor to 0&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Although graphene fiber&#8208;based supercapacitors are promising for wearable electronic devices, the low energy density of electrodes and poor cold resistance of aqueous electrolytes limit their wide application in cold environments. Herein, porous nitrogen/sulfur dual&#8208;doped graphene fibers (NS&#8208;GFs) are synthesized by hydrothermal self&#8208;assembly followed by thermal annealing, exhibiting an excellent capacitive performance of 401&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3 because of the synergistic effect of heteroatom dual&#8208;doping. The assembled symmetric all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitor with polyvinyl alcohol/H2SO4/graphene oxide gel electrolyte exhibits a high capacitance of 221&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and a high energy density of 7.7&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3. Interestingly, solar&#8211;thermal energy conversion of the electrolyte with 0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% graphene oxide extends the operating temperature range of the supercapacitor to 0&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the photocatalysis effect of the dual&#8208;doped heteroatoms increases the capacitance of NS&#8208;GFs. At an ambient temperature of 0&#8201;&#176;C, the capacitance increases from 0 to 182&#8197;F cm&#8722;3 under 1&#8197;sun irradiation because of the excellent solar light absorption and efficient solar&#8211;thermal energy conversion of graphene oxide, preventing the aqueous electrolyte from freezing. The flexible supercapacitor exhibits a long cycle life, good bending resistance, reliable scalability, and ability to power visual electronics, showing great potential for outdoor electronics in cold environments.

         <title>How to Build Prussian Blue Based Water Oxidation Catalytic Assemblies: Common Trends and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blue is the color: Cobalt&#8208;based Prussian blue analogues (CoFe PBAs) have been established as one of the well&#8208;known non&#8208;oxide bulk water oxidation catalysts, which can operate even under harsh acidic conditions. This review presents the common synthetic strategies to enhance their catalytic activities and general trends in Prussian blue based photocatalytic, photoelectrocatalytic, and dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical assemblies.







Abstract
Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) have at least a three&#8208;century&#8208;long history in coordination chemistry. Recently, cobalt&#8208;based PBAs have been acknowledged as efficient and robust water oxidation catalysts. Given the flexibility in their synthesis, the structure and morphology of cobalt&#8208;based PBAs have been modified for enhanced catalytic activity under electrochemical (EC), photocatalytic (PC), and photoelectrochemical (PEC) conditions. Here, in this review, the work on cobalt&#8208;based PBAs is presented in four sections: i)&#8197;electrocatalytic water oxidation with bare PBAs, ii)&#8197;photocatalytic processes in the presence of a photosensitizer (PS), iii)&#8197;photoelectrochemical water oxidation by coupling PBAs to proper semiconductors (SCs), and iv)&#8197;the utilization of PBA&#8208;PS assemblies coated on SCs for the dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical water oxidation. This review will guide readers through the structure and catalytic activity relationship in cobalt&#8208;based PBAs by describing the role of each structural component. Furthermore, this review aims to provide insight into common strategies to enhance the catalytic activity of PBAs.

Design and use of perylene monoimide dyes: Novel perylene monoimide dyes have been synthesized, and their properties characterized by XRD, spectroscopic and electrochemical methods. A custom&#8208;made photoreactor was used to exhibit light&#8208;driven hydrogen&#8208;evolution catalysis in the presence of (NH4)2[Mo3S13] catalyst and poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) solubilizing template for the organic photosensitizers.







Abstract
In this work, we present a new synthetic strategy for fourfold&#8208;substituted perylene monoimides via tetrabrominated perylene monoanhydrides. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unveiled the intramolecular stacking orientation between the substituents and semicircular packing behavior. We observed the remarkable influence of the substituent on the longevity and nature of the excited state upon visible light excitation. In the presence of poly(dehydroalanine)&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol) graft copolymers as solubilizing template, the chromophores are capable of sensitizing [Mo3S13]2&#8722; clusters in aqueous solution for stable visible light driven hydrogen evolution over three days.

Bending DNA: The structure of the non&#8208;canonical DNA duplex containing 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;BNA/LNA in the presence of AgI ions was obtained using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Novel AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs at N1 positions of adenine, A&#8208;AgI&#8208;A, were obtained in the duplex. A highly bent duplex structure was formed at the center of AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs. This is useful for inducing large conformational change in the duplex by adding AgI ions.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;mediated base pairs have widespread applications, such as in DNA&#8208;metal nanodevices and sensors. Here, we focused on their sugar conformation in duplexes and observed the crystallographic structure of the non&#8208;canonical DNA/DNA duplex containing 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;methylene bridged nucleic acid in the presence of AgI ions. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure was successfully obtained at a resolution of 1.5&#8197;&#197;. A novel type of AgI&#8208;mediated base pair between the N1 positions of anti&#8208;conformation of adenines in the duplex was observed. In the central non&#8208;canonical region, a hexad nucleobase structure containing AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs between the N7 positions of guanines was formed. A highly bent non&#8208;canonical structure was formed at the origin of AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs in the central region. The bent duplex structure induced by the addition of AgI ions might become a powerful tool for dynamic structural changes in DNA nanotechnology applications.

         <dc:description>
Improved optical limiting performances: Benzothiadiazole moieties act as powerful electron&#8208;withdrawing auxiliaries enforcing the accepting character of aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes and resulting in a significant redshift of both absorption and emission and a remarkable enhancement of the nonlinear optical properties (two&#8208;photon absorption and optical limiting) compared with traditional aryl substituents.







Abstract
Aza&#8208;boron dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPYs) presenting a benzothiadiazole substitution on upper positions are described. The strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the benzothiadiazole moiety permits enhancement of the accepting strength and improves the delocalization of the aza&#8208;BODIPY core to attain a significant degree of electronic communication between the lower donating groups and the upper accepting groups. The nature of the intramolecular charge transfer is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Linear spectroscopy highlighted the strongly redshifted absorption and emission of the synthesized molecules with recorded fluorescence spectra over 1000&#8197;nm. Nonlinear optical properties were also investigated. Strong enhancement of the two&#8208;photon absorption of the substituted dyes compared with the unsubstituted one (up to 4520&#8197;GM at 1300&#8197;nm) results in an approximately 15&#8211;20&#8201;% improvement of the optical power limiting performances. These dyes are therefore a good starting point for further improvement of optical power limiting in the short&#8208;wave IR range.

         <title>Coordination Behavior of a P4&#8208;Butterfly Complex towards Transition Metal Lewis Acids: Preservation versus Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly flexible: By coordination to Lewis acids the P4 butterfly complex can preserve the initial P4 butterfly scaffold and act as a 4&#963; e&#8722; donor. However, in the presence of weakly ligated d6 metals, the P4 unit tends to rearrange. This leads to a rare octaphospha&#8208;cobalt&#8208;sandwich complex in which the P4 units have isomerized into aromatic cyclo&#8208;P4[Fe]2 units ([Fe]=Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2). Additionally, also a dimerization to an all&#8208;phosphorus derivative of bicylo[3.3.0]octane is observed.







Abstract
The reactivity of the P4 butterfly complex [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;1:1&#8208;P4)] (1, Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H2tBu3) towards divalent Co, Ni and Zn salts is investigated. The reaction with the bromide salts leads to [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2}2(&#956;3,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4){MBr2}] (M=Co (2Co), Ni (2Ni), Zn (2Zn)) in which the P4 butterfly scaffold is preserved. The use of the weakly ligated Co complex [Co(NCCH3)6][SbF6]2, results in the formation of [{(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2)2(&#956;3,&#951;4:1:1&#8208;P4)}2Co][SbF6]3 (3), which represents the second example of a homoleptic&#8208;like octaphospha&#8208;metalla&#8208;sandwich complex. The formation of the threefold positively charged complex&#8197;3 occurs via redox processes, which among others also enables the formation of [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2}4(&#956;5,&#951;4:1:1:1:1&#8208;P8){Co(CO)2}][SbF6] (4), bearing a rare octaphosphabicyclo[3.3.0]octane unit as a ligand. On the other hand, the reaction with [Zn(NCCH3)4][PF6]2 yields the spiro complex [{(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2)2(&#956;3,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4)}2Zn][PF6]2 (5) under preservation of the initial structural motif.

         <title>Dirhodium Complexes as Panchromatic Sensitizers, Electrocatalysts, and Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paddlewheel dirhodium complexes have been shown to act as single&#8208;chromophore photocatalysts for H2 evolution with red/near&#8208;IR light and as electrocatalysts for the selective reduction of CO2 to HCOOH. Modification of the coordination sphere of Rh2(II,II) complexes renders them versatile candidates as homogeneous panchromatic photosensitizers, photocatalysts, and electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Dinuclear rhodium complexes are attractive candidates as homogeneous panchromatic photosensitizers and photocatalysts. Modification of the coordination sphere of the Rh2(II,II) compounds results in photophysical and redox properties that are highly desirable for electro&#8208; and photocatalysis. Specifically, Rh2(II,II) complexes have shown promising catalytic activity towards proton reduction to generate H2, a clean fuel, and for the selective reduction of CO2 to HCOOH. In addition, paddlewheel Rh2(II,II) complexes provide robust platforms for the design of efficient and stable single&#8208;component photocatalysts. Optimization of the Rh2(II,II) catalysts is crucial to realize their future application in devices or systems designed for the production of fuels from sunlight.

         <title>Ferrous to Ferric Transition in Fe&#8208;Phthalocyanine Driven by NO2 Exposure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the FePc/Cu(100) interface, the possibility to control, via nitrogen dioxide (NO2) dissociation at the interface, the magnetic properties of the chelated ion the FePc array is demonstrated. Three different spin configurations have been stabilized within the same metalorganic/metal interface.







Abstract
Due to its unique magnetic properties offered by the open&#8208;shell electronic structure of the central metal ion, and for being an effective catalyst in a wide variety of reactions, iron phthalocyanine has drawn significant interest from the scientific community. Nevertheless, upon surface deposition, the magnetic properties of the molecular layer can be significantly affected by the coupling occurring at the interface, and the more reactive the surface, the stronger is the impact on the spin state. Here, we show that on Cu(100), indeed, the strong hybridization between the Fe d&#8208;states of FePc and the sp&#8208;band of the copper substrate modifies the charge distribution in the molecule, significantly influencing the magnetic properties of the iron ion. The FeII ion is stabilized in the low singlet spin state (S=0), leading to the complete quenching of the molecule magnetic moment. By exploiting the FePc/Cu(100) interface, we demonstrate that NO2 dissociation can be used to gradually change the magnetic properties of the iron ion, by trimming the gas dosage. For lower doses, the FePc film is decoupled from the copper substrate, restoring the gas phase triplet spin state (S=1). A higher dose induces the transition from ferrous to ferric phthalocyanine, in its intermediate spin state, with enhanced magnetic moment due to the interaction with the atomic ligands. Remarkably, in this way, three different spin configurations have been observed within the same metalorganic/metal interface by exposing it to different doses of NO2 at room temperature.

         <title>Sb6O7(SO4)2: A Promising Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Material with an Enhanced Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Response Activated by SbIII Lone&#8208;Pair Stereoactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seesaw structures: An anhydrous sulfate, Sb6O7(SO4)2, featuring considerable environmental stability, is prepared through a solvent&#8208;free method. It exhibits an enhanced phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) response and an appropriate birefringence. Functional SbIII, with a stereochemically active lone pair, makes a predominant contribution to the enhanced SHG effect.







Abstract
The stereochemical activity of lone pairs (SCALP) in a cation favors the formation of acentric materials and can enhance the second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) response and/or the birefringence. By introducing functional SbIII into sulfates, an anhydrous sulfate of Sb6O7(SO4)2 (1) is explored. Sb3+ cations are in seesaw configurations and in&#8208;phase aligned in a 3D asymmetric dense structure. Compound 1 exhibits an enhanced phase&#8208;matching SHG response, a moderate birefringence, a wide transparency window, and considerable environmental stabilities, which result in it being a promising UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material. Theoretical studies reveal that the stereoactive lone pairs on Sb3+ cations make the predominant contribution to the SHG effect. This work will attract more interest from scientists for research into SCALP&#8208;cation&#8208;based NLO materials.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Oxidative Selective Esterification of Methylarenes and Benzaldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P beats N: A mild and green electro&#8208;oxidative protocol to construct aromatic esters from methylarenes and alcohols is reported. Importantly, the reaction has a broad functional group tolerance and is free of metals, chemical oxidants, bases, acids, while operating at room temperature. The design of the electrolyte was found critical for the oxidation state and structure of the coupling products.







Abstract
A mild and green electro&#8208;oxidative protocol to construct aromatic esters from methylarenes and alcohols is herein reported. Importantly, the reaction is free of metals, chemical oxidants, bases, acids, and operates at room temperature. Moreover, the design of the electrolyte was found critical for the oxidation state and structure of the coupling products, a rarely documented effect. This electro&#8208;oxidative coupling process also displays exceptional tolerance of many fragile easily oxidized functional groups such as hydroxy, aldehyde, olefin, alkyne, as well as neighboring benzylic positions. The enantiomeric enrichment of some chiral alcohols is moreover preserved during this electro&#8208;oxidative coupling reaction, making it overall a promising synthetic tool.

         <title>Ni2P Interlayer and Mn Doping Synergistically Expedite the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics of Co2P</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst consisting of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) coral&#8208;like Mn&#8208;doped Co2P@an intermediate layer of Ni2P generated in situ by phosphorization on Ni foam (MnCoP/NiP/NF) is prepared. Note that there is an electron channel between NiP and MnCoP, electrons in Ni transfer to Co and P, which effectively weakens the strong adsorption capacity of H* and expedites the HER kinetics of Co2P.







Abstract
Transition metal phosphide is regarded as one of the most promising candidates to replace noble&#8208;metal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, the controllable design and synthesis of transition metal phosphide electrocatalysts with efficient and stable electrochemical performance are still very challenging. Herein, a novel hierarchical HER electrocatalyst consisting of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) coral&#8208;like Mn&#8208;doped Co2P@an intermediate layer of Ni2P generated in situ by phosphorization on Ni foam (MnCoP/NiP/NF) is reported. Notably, both the incorporation of Mn and introduction of the Ni2P interlayer promote Co atoms to carry more electrons, which is beneficial to reduce the force of the Co&#8722;H bond and optimize the adsorption energy of hydrogen intermediate (|&#916;GH*|), thereby making MnCoP/NiP/NF exhibit outstanding HER performance with onset overpotential and Tafel slope as low as 31.2&#8197;mV and 61&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, respectively, in 1&#8201;m KOH electrolyte.

         <title>Iron catalyzed double bond isomerization: evidence for an Fe(I)/Fe(III) catalytic cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of alkenes is reported using an iron(II) &#946;&#8208;diketiminate pre&#8208;catalyst. The reaction proceeds with a catalytic amount of a hydride source, such as pinacol borane (HBpin) or ammonia borane (H 3 N&#183;BH 3 ). Reactivity with both allyl arenes and aliphatic alkenes has been studied. The catalytic mechanism was investigated by a variety of means, including deuteration studies, Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The data obtained support a pre&#8208;catalyst activation step that gives access to an &#951; 2 &#8208;coordinated alkene Fe(I) complex, followed by oxidative addition of the alkene to give an Fe(III) intermediate, which then undergoes reductive elimination to allow release of the isomerization product.</dc:description>

         <title>Helically and Linearly Fused Rylenediimide&#8208;Hexabenzocoronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perylene&#8208; as well as naphthalenediimides were fused to hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) at their imide position to realize highly &#960;&#8208;extended D&#8208;A&#8208;hybrids. Successful isomer separation in the first step was decisive to guarantee a straightforward synthetic sequence. Hexaphenylbenzenes (HPBs) as precursors were accessed  via  Diels&#8208;Alder reactions and reacted in a Scholl oxidation to yield the respective HBC derivatives. The fully conjugated benzimidazole linker, which separates the electron donating HBC from the electron accepting rylenediimide enables the formation of either a linear or a helical configuration. Largely different chemical, physical, and optoelectrical characteristics are noted for the two configurations. What stands out is their aggregation and their excited state deactivation depending on the solvent polarity. Results from global analysis of the femtosecond transient absorption data corroborate the formation of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state that is stabilized in the helically fused configuration relative to the linear analogue. But, a comparison with spectroelectrochemical experiments failed to disclose evidence for a charge&#8208;separated (CS) state.</dc:description>

         <title>Tenfold Metalation of Ferrocene: Synthesis, Structures and Metallophilic Interactions in FeC10(HgX)10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The permercuration of ferrocene is achieved by reacting ferrocene with 10 equivalents of mercury(II) butyrate Hg(O2CC3H7)2  in a facile one&#8208;pot reaction in multi&#8208;gram scale and high yields. The butyrate groups in FeC10(HgX)10  (X = O2CC3H7) can be exchanged by treatment with trifluoro&#8208; or trichloroacetic acid (X = O2CCF3, O2CCCl3). Substitution of the trifluoroacetate groups by halides (X = Cl, F) proceeds easily in aqueous THF. The completeness of metalation was confirmed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, mass spectrometry as well as elemental analysis. Additionally, we present the first crystal structures of permetallated metallocenes: FeC10(HgX)10  (X = Cl, O2CCF3, O2CCCl3).</dc:description>

         <title>Dominant Pseudocapacitance Filling Charge&#8208;Discharge Voltage Gap of Flexible Hybrid Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high charge&#8208;discharge voltage gap is one of the main bottlenecks of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) because of kinetically sluggish rate of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) on the oxygen electrode side, and thus an efficient bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER is highly pursued. Here, a honeycomb&#8208;like MnCo2O4.5 spheres, as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst, has been demonstrated that both ORR and OER catalytic activity are promoted by the Mn (IV) induced oxygen vacancy defects and multi&#8208;active sites. Importantly, the rich multivalent ion and defect structure endow stable pseudocapacitance within the inactive&#8208;region of ORR and OER, thus affording a low charge&#8208;discharge voltage gap (0.43 V at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) when it is employed in the flexible hybrid Zn&#8208;base battery. This mechanism provides unprecedented and valuable insights in the development of next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Photohomolysis and Photoheterolysis in Aryl Sulfonates and Aryl Phosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemistry of aryl sulfonates and phosphates (ArOX) has a role in different respects including the application in eco&#8208;sustainable arylations, in the design of innovative photoacid generators and in biological applications. However, the fate of the photoreaction depends on several factors namely the nature of the sulfonate/phosphate group, the substituents present on the aromatic ring and the polarity of the medium. Aim of this work is the photophysical investigation of selected aryl sulfonates and phosphates by laser flash photolysis experiments, to have insights on their photoreactive pathways for their possible applications. The judicious choice of the leaving group and on the nature of the substituents on the aromatic ring may lead either to a photohomolysis of the ArO&#8208;X bond or a photoheterolysis of the Ar&#8208;OX bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and related BF2 derivatives with significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of new &#946;&#8208;ketoimines containing a ferrocene moiety and related BF&#8322; derivatives were synthesized and structurally characterized. The solvatochromism of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines was studied, putting in evidence a red shift by increasing the solvent polarity. This positive solvatochromism can be attributed to the more polarized excited state, with respect to the ground state, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. &#946;&#8208;ketoimines exhibit a weak emission, attributable to the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon. This ESIPT effect is suppressed upon restriction of the keto&#8208;enamine tautomerism by addition of BF&#8323;&#183;OEt&#8322; which affords the related BF&#8322; complexes, characterized by an enhancement of the fluorescence through the ICT effect. Both b&#8208;ketoimines and BF&#8322; complexes, examined in mixtures of CH&#8323;CN/H&#8322;O, exhibit a significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, due to restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) in the aggregated state. The frontier molecular orbital levels, ground and excited state dipole moments (&#956;g and &#956;e), and the origin of electronic absorption spectra were studied by using time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were determined by the EFISH technique. The &#956;&#946;1907 value of all &#946;&#8208;ketoimines increases upon the formation of the related BF&#8322; complex, mainly due to an enhancement of the ground state dipole moment. Some of these novel compounds are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined Dynamic Kinetic Resolution and C&#8208;H Functionalization for Facile Synthesis of Non&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;Atropisomer&#8208;type Axially Chiral Organosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite asymmetric C&#8208;H functionalization has been available for the synthesis structurally diverse molecules, catalytic dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) approaches to change racemic stereogenic axes remain synthetically challenges in this field. Here we present a concise palladium&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution combined with C&#8208;H functionalization involving olefination and alkynylation for the highly efficient synthesis of non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;atropisomer&#8208;type (NBA) axially chiral oragnosilanes. The chemistry proceeds through two different and distinct dynamic kinetic resolutions: first, an atroposelective C&#8208;H olefination or alkynylation produced axially chiral vinylsilanes or alkynylsilanes as a new family of non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers (NBA), and second, the extension of this DKR strategy to twofold o,o'&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization led to the multifunctional axially chiral organosilicon compounds with up to &gt;99% ee.</dc:description>

Inspired by Greek mythology, Orion is shown in the cover image as a lion&#8208;hearted hunter; he hits acyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated imides and N,N&#8242;&#8208;dialkylanilines with the club to give 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines (1,2,3,4&#8208;THQs; the lion fur in the cover image). There are three stars in Orion&#8242;s Belt; i.e., &#1013; Ori, &#950; Ori, and &#948; Ori, which enhance his toughness. The trio applied to the novel iridium(III) complex photo&#8208;sensitizer, the thiourea, and the azo compound, works cooperatively and powerfully to achieve the photochemical synthesis of structurally diverse 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQs with excellent diastereoselectivity. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Itoh, H. Fujii, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004186).

There are three stars in Orion&#8242;s Belt; i.e., &lt;i&gt;&#1013;&lt;/i&gt; Ori, &lt;i&gt;&#950;&lt;/i&gt; Ori, and &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt; Ori, which enhance his toughness. The trio applied to the novel iridium(III) complex photo&#8208;sensitizer, the thiourea, and the azo compound, works cooperatively and powerfully to achieve the photochemical synthesis of structurally diverse 1,2,3,4&#8208;THQs with excellent diastereoselectivity.

Caged: A self&#8208;assembled hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded/metal&#8208;coordinated cage, where both hydrogen&#8208;bonding and metal&#8208;coordination form the crucial part of the topology. The hybrid cage is prepared combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded rosette motif and palladium(II)/platinum(II) coordination to a pyridine ligand.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of a unique molecular container is reported: a hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded/metal&#8208;coordinated cage where both hydrogen&#8208;bonding and metal&#8208;coordination form the crucial part of the topology. The hybrid cage was prepared combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded rosette motif and palladium(II)/platinum(II) coordination to a pyridine ligand. It was also shown that the hybrid cage could be prepared by integrative self&#8208;sorting from simple components. For the first time the genuine dual character of the hybrid cage was manifested as both self&#8208;assembling parts responded selectively to different stimuli (such as phosphine and cyanurate), which resulted in the disassembly of the cage.

         <title>Forty Years after the Discovery of Its Nucleolytic Activity: [Cu(phen)2]2+ Shows Unattended DNA Cleavage Activity upon Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation by fluorination: By introducing fluorine&#8208;containing substituents in the 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands of a [Cu(phen)2]2+ complex, nucleolytic activity in the absence of classical, bioabundant external reducing agents is observed. Such an activity is unknown for the unsubstituted [Cu(phen)2]2+, the first and otherwise one of the most efficient artificial nucleases. Also, the cytotoxicity profiles of the new complexes were different&#8212;though less toxic, cancer cells were more harmed than healthy cells.







Abstract
[Cu(phen)2]2+ (phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) is the first and still one of the most efficient artificial nucleases. In general, when the phen ligand is modified, the nucleolytic activity of its CuII complex is significantly reduced. This is most likely due to higher steric bulk of such ligands and thus lower affinity to DNA. CuII complexes with phen ligands having fluorinated substituents (F, CF3, SF5, SCF3) surprisingly showed excellent DNA cleavage activity&#8212;in contrast to the unsubstituted [Cu(phen)2]2+&#8212;in the absence of the otherwise required classical, bioabundant external reducing agents like thiols or ascorbate. This nucleolytic activity correlates well with the half&#8208;wave potentials E1/2 of the complexes. Cancer cell studies show cytotoxic effects of all complexes with fluorinated ligands in the low &#956;m range, whereas they were less toxic towards healthy cells (fibroblasts).

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Chemodivergent Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Allylic Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3 or N1? Chemodivergent regio&#8208; and enantioselective allylic alkylation of indoles was developed by using a rhodium/bisoxazolinephosphane catalyst. C3 or N1 selectivity could be selectively achieved by changing the counteranion of Rh, the allylic carbonate, the reaction temperature, and the ligand.







Abstract
The control of C3/N1 chemoselectivity in indole alkylation with the same electrophiles is still challenging. An Rh/bisoxazolinephosphane&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent regio&#8208; and enantioselective allylic alkylation of indoles was developed. Chiral C3&#8208; and N1&#8208;allylindoles can be selectively obtained with high branched/linear ratio and up to 99&#8201;% ee by changing the counteranion of Rh, the allylic carbonate, the reaction temperature, and the ligand.

         <title>Zinc Oxide Defect Microstructure and Surface Chemistry Derived from Oxidation of Metallic Zinc: Thin&#8208;Film Transistor and Sensor Behavior of ZnO Films and Rods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin&#8208;film transistors: Zinc oxide layers can be obtained conveniently through the oxidation of sputter&#8208;deposited thin films of zinc metal at temperatures between 250 and 450&#8201;&#176;C. Positron annihilation studies hint at vacancy clusters rather than isolated point defects as the dominating feature in the defect chemistry of these films. This allows the description of the influence of annealing temperature on the resulting electronic performance of the semiconducting layers in thin&#8208;film transistors.







Abstract
Zinc oxide thin films are fabricated by controlled oxidation of sputtered zinc metal films on a hotplate in air at temperatures between 250 and 450&#8201;&#176;C. The nanocrystalline films possess high relative densities and show preferential growth in (100) orientation. Integration in thin&#8208;film transistors reveals moderate charge carrier mobilities as high as 0.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1s&#8722;1. The semiconducting properties depend on the calcination temperature, whereby the best performance is achieved at 450&#8201;&#176;C. The defect structure of the thin ZnO film can be tracked by Doppler&#8208;broadening positron annihilation spectroscopy as well as positron lifetime studies. Comparably long positron lifetimes suggest interaction of zinc vacancies (VZn) with one or more oxygen vacancies (VO) in larger structural entities. Such VO&#8208;VZn defect clusters act as shallow acceptors, and thus, reduce the overall electron conductivity of the film. The concentration of these defect clusters decreases at higher calcination temperatures as indicated by changes in the S and W parameters. Such zinc oxide films obtained by conversion of metallic zinc can also be used as seed layers for solution deposition of zinc oxide nanowires employing a mild microwave&#8208;assisted process. The functionality of the obtained nanowire arrays is tested in a UV sensor device. The best results with respect to sensor sensitivity are achieved with thinner seed layers for device construction.

         <title>Twisting Versus Delocalization in CAAC&#8208; and NHC&#8208;Stabilized Boron&#8208;Based Biradicals: The Roles of Sterics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron chemistry offers many systems in which slight variations lead to drastic geometrical and electronic perturbations. This article explains the reasons for variations observed in a system consisting of two boron centers stabilized by CAAC or NHC donors and connected by C2R2 (R=Et, Me, H) bridges. For CAAC and R=Me, Et the bridge is twisted, and the molecule is a biradical. For CAAC and R=H the bridge is not twisted, leading to a closed&#8208;shell structure. For NHC&#8208;stabilized systems we predict closed&#8208;shell molecules with partially twisted bridges. This is attributed to a delicate interplay of steric and electronic effects.

     alt="Twisting Versus Delocalization in CAAC&#8208; and NHC&#8208;Stabilized Boron&#8208;Based Biradicals: The Roles of Sterics and Electronics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boron chemistry offers many systems&lt;/b&gt; in which slight variations lead to drastic geometrical and electronic perturbations. This article explains the reasons for variations observed in a system consisting of two boron centers stabilized by CAAC or NHC donors and connected by C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (R=Et, Me, H) bridges. For CAAC and R=Me, Et the bridge is twisted, and the molecule is a biradical. For CAAC and R=H the bridge is not twisted, leading to a closed&#8208;shell structure. For NHC&#8208;stabilized systems we predict closed&#8208;shell molecules with partially twisted bridges. This is attributed to a delicate interplay of steric and electronic effects.

         <title>Construction of Helical Structures with Multiple Fused Anthracenes: Structures and Properties of Long Expanded Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical structures are constructed by successive fusion of anthracene units in a helicene&#8208;like manner like a dragon rising in a spiral. In the derivatives with four or more anthracene units, interlayer &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions play an important role in the structures and properties of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The helical inversion occurred via multistep mechanisms at relatively high barriers. This molecular design is valuable as a new helical motif based on the expanded and conjugated &#960; systems. More information can be found in the Communication by S. Toyota et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004720).

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Nitric Oxide Release by a Photosensitizer to Combat Bacterial Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon light irradiation, a novel dual&#8208;functional ruthenium compound releases nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). NO induces Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm dispersal and liberates bacteria. The free&#8208;floating bacteria are subsequently sterilized by ROS. Therefore, the compound can readily eradicate mature biofilms at low concentration, which reduces cytotoxicity to mammalian cells. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z.&#8208;W. Mao, W. Xia, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004698).

         <title>Synthetic Processes toward Nitriles without the Use of Cyanide: A Biocatalytic Concept Based on Dehydration of Aldoximes in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrile synthesis with enzymes: An overview of a biocatalytic process technology suitable for the efficient and cyanide&#8208;free synthesis of nitriles by means of dehydration of aldoximes in water is given. A broad range of nitriles are obtained in such biotransformations. Chiral nitriles can be obtained in high enantiomeric excess. The aldoxime substrates are readily available by condensation of aldehydes with NH2OH.







Abstract
While belonging to the most fundamental functional groups, nitriles represent a class of compound that still raises challenges in terms of an efficient, cost&#8208;effective, general and, at the same time, sustainable way for their synthesis. Complementing existing chemical routes, recently a cyanide&#8208;free enzymatic process technology based on the use of an aldoxime dehydratase (Oxd) as a biocatalyst component has been developed and successfully applied for the synthesis of a range of nitrile products. In these biotransformations, the Oxd enzymes catalyze the dehydration of aldoximes as readily available substrates to the nitrile products. Herein, these developments with such enzymes are summarized, with a strong focus on synthetic applications. It is demonstrated that this biocatalytic technology has the potential to &#8220;cross the bridge&#8221; between the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, on one hand, and bulk and commodity chemicals, on the other.

         <title>Dimesitylborylethynylated Arenes: Unique Electronic and Photophysical Properties Caused by Ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) Spacers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic hydrocarbons containing one or two dimesitylborylethynyl peripherals possess rich photophysical and electrochemical properties. The inserted ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) spacer canceled steric hindrance between the bulky dimesitylboryl groups and the aromatic rings, leading to effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation over the B&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ar linkages. Despite the small structural differences, the benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene derivatives showed characteristic photophysical behaviors. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Mishiba, Y. Tanaka, and M. Akita. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004744).

         <title>Impact of Heteroatom Substitution on Dual&#8208;State Emissive Rigidified 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole Dyes: Towards Ultra&#8208;Bright ESIPT Fluorophores**

         <dc:description>
A series of HBX derivatives (HBX=(2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole)), mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;functionalized with ethynyl&#8208;TIPS substituents at various positions, were synthesized and characterized structurally and spectroscopically. Variation of the nature of the heteroring revealed a strong influence of the heteroatom, in terms of emission wavelength, stabilization of the first excited&#8208;state and most importantly quantum yields values.







Abstract
2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl)benzazole (HBX) fluorophores are well&#8208;known excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) emitters largely studied for their synthetic versatility, photostability, strong solid&#8208;state fluorescence and ability to engineer dual emission, thus paving the way to applications as white emitters, ratiometric sensors, and cryptographic dyes. However, they are heavily quenched in solution, due to efficient non&#8208;radiative pathways taking place as a consequence of the proton transfer in the excited&#8208;state. In this contribution, the nature of the heteroring constitutive of these rigidified HBX dyes was modified and we demonstrate that this simple structural modification triggers major optical changes in terms of emission color, dual emission engineering, and importantly, fluorescent quantum yield. Investigation of the photophysical properties in solution and in the solid state of a series of ethynyl&#8208;TIPS extended HBX fluorophores, along with ab initio calculations demonstrate the very promising abilities of these dyes to act as bright dual&#8208;state emitters, in both solution (even in protic environments) and solid state.

         <title>Enthalpically and Entropically Favorable Self&#8208;Assembly: Synthesis of C4h&#8208;Symmetric Tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes by Regioselective Introduction of Pyridine Rings</title>

Fujin (the wind god) and Raijin (the thunder god) hold each other's hands: The cover image depicts the collaboration of enthalpy and entropy. This work reports the synthesis of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes, which undergo unique self&#8208;assembly. The self&#8208;assembly in chloroform and methanol is favored by both enthalpic and entropic factors. The unique association behavior is due to the presence of pyridinic nitrogen atoms, which weakly coordinate to the hydrogen atoms of these solvents and reduce the &#960;&#8208;electron density of the circulene cores. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Miyake et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005077).

         <title>De Novo Design of Selective Quadruplex&#8211;Duplex Junction Ligands and Structural Characterisation of Their Binding Mode: Targeting the G4 Hot&#8208;Spot</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Finding the G4 spot: The unusual electrostatic potential of G&#8208;tetrads at the interface with a duplex in quadruplex&#8211;duplex junctions inspires the design of cationic aromatic frameworks for the selective targeting of these hybrid DNA architectures, thus providing a stepping stone to quadruplex discrimination.







Abstract
Targeting the interface between DNA quadruplex and duplex regions by small molecules holds significant promise in both therapeutics and nanotechnology. Herein, a new pharmacophore is reported, which selectively binds with high affinity to quadruplex&#8211;duplex junctions, while presenting a poorer affinity for G&#8208;quadruplex or duplex DNA alone. Ligands complying with the reported pharmacophore exhibit a significant affinity and selectivity for quadruplex&#8211;duplex junctions, including the one observed in the HIV&#8208;1 LTR&#8208;III sequence. The structure of the complex between a quadruplex&#8211;duplex junction with a ligand of this family has been determined by NMR methods. According to these data, the remarkable selectivity of this structural motif for quadruplex&#8211;duplex junctions is achieved through an unprecedented interaction mode so far unexploited in medicinal and biological chemistry: the insertion of a benzylic ammonium moiety into the centre of the partially exposed G&#8208;tetrad at the interface with the duplex. Further decoration of the described scaffolds with additional fragments opens up the road to the development of selective ligands for G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;forming regions of the genome.

         <title>Investigation of Luminescent Triplet States in Tetranuclear CuI Complexes: Thermochromism and Structural Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly luminescent tetranuclear CuI complexes are discussed in this work, along with their synthesis and in&#8208;depth photophysical characterization. These promising candidates for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes show a huge luminescence thermochromism with completely different emission colors ranging from orange&#8208;red (290&#8197;K) to blue (10&#8197;K). The underlying strongly temperature&#8208;dependent excited state structures are determined by applying time&#8208;resolved step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy in combination with DFT calculations. More information can be found in the Full Paper by W. Klopper, S. Br&#228;se, M. Gerhards, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004539).

         <title>How Oriented External Electric Fields Modulate Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
External electric fields can be used to control the reactivity and selectivity of chemical reactions. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical computations, this work provides a desperately needed causal model to explain how judiciously oriented external electric fields catalyze and steer the stereoselectivity of the Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. These results provide a complete framework for the design of novel electric field catalyzed organic reactions. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T.&#8197;A. Hamlin, F.&#8197;M. Bickelhaupt, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004906).

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Dithioacetals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithioacetals are frequently used in organic chemistry, but examples of unsymmetrical dithioacetals are less common, presumably due to the lack of a general synthetic protocol towards these compounds. A direct synthesis of a variety of unsymmetrical dithioacetals with one aromatic and one aliphatic thiol moiety from the aldehyde and thiols has been developed. Statistical product distribution is overcome by kinetic control delivering unsymmetrical dithioacetals in high yields. More information can be found in the Communication by S. Bognar and M. van&#8197;Gemmeren. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004835).

         <title>In situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Investigation of the Crystallisation of Perfluorinated Ce(IV)&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140 architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the results of an  in situ  synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the crystallisation in aqueous medium of two recently discovered perfluorinated Ce(IV)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), analogues of the already well investigated Zr(IV)&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140A, namely, F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) and F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce). The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid (HNO  3  ) and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid (AcOH). When only HNO  3  is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57 &#176;C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO  3  , mixed&#8208;phased products are obtained. F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) is always formed faster and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate determining step. A higher amount of HNO  3  favours the formation of F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce). Based on the  in situ  results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high quality F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60 &#176;C, 1 h) is also identified.</dc:description>

         <title>Natural and Synthetic Oligoarylamides &#8211; priviledged structures for medical applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  The term "privileged structure" refers to a single molecular substructure or scaffold that can serve as a starting point for high&#8208;affinity ligands for more than one receptor type. In this report we are adressing a hithertho overlooked group of privileged substructures, namely aromatic oligoamides, for which there are natural models in the form of cystobactamides, albicidin, distamycin A, netropsin and others.
&#160;
The aromatic and heteroaromatic core, together with a flexible selection of substituents, form conformationally well&#8208;defined scaffolds capable of specifically binding to conformationally well&#8208;defined regions of biomacromolecules such as helices in proteins or DNA often by acting as helices mimicks themselves. As such, these aromatic oligoamides have already been employed to inhibit protein&#8208;protein and nucleic acid&#8208;protein interactions. This article is the first to bring together the scattered knowledge about aromatic oligoamides in connection with biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free N&#8208;Arylation of Amino Acid Esters with Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition metal&#8208;free approach for the N&#8208;arylation of amino acid derivatives has been developed. Key to this method is the use of unsymmetric diaryliodonium salts with anisyl ligands, which proved important to obtain high chemoselectivity and yields. The scope includes the transfer of both electron deficient, electron rich and sterically hindered aryl groups with a variety of different functional groups. Furthermore, a cyclic diaryliodonium salt was successfully employed in the arylation. The N&#8208;arylated products were obtained with retained enantiomeric excess.</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates: The Effect of Ligand Modification on the Reactivity of Square&#8208;Planar Aluminum Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural constraint represents an attractive tool to modify  p  &#8208;block element properties without the need for unusual oxidation or valence states. The recently reported methyl&#8208;calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate established the effect of forcing a tetrahedral aluminum anion into a square&#8208;planar coordination mode. However, the generality of this structural motif and any consequence of ligand modification remained open. Herein, we launch a systematic ligand screening and broaden the class of square&#8208;planar aluminum anions by two derivatives that differ in the  meso  &#8208;substitution at the calix[4]pyrrolato ligand. Strikingly, this modification provokes opposing trends in the preference for a Lewis acidic binding mode with &#963;&#8208;donors  versus  the aluminum&#8208;ligand cooperative binding mode with carbonyls. Insights into the origin of these counterintuitive experimental observations are provided by computation and bond analysis. Importantly, this rationale might allow to exploit mode&#8208;selective binding for catalytic rate control.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the electrocatalytic reduction of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2  ) into hydrocarbons involving a main group element&#8208;based molecular triazole&#8208;porphyrin electrocatalyst  H2PorT8  is reported. This catalyst converted CH2Cl2  in acetonitrile to various hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, and ethylene) with a Faradaic efficiency of 70% and current density of &#8211;13 mA/cm2  at a potential of &#8211;2.2 V vs. Fc/Fc  +  using water as a proton source. The findings of this study and its mechanistic interpretations demonstrated that  H2PorT8  was an efficient and stable catalyst for the hydrodechlorination of CH2Cl2  and that main group catalysts could be potentially used for exploring new catalytic reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent PMMA Films and PMMA@SiO2 Nanoparticles with Embedded Ln3+ Complexes for Highly Sensitive Optical Thermometers in the Physiological Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent materials doped with Ln  3+  ions have attracted in recent years a large amount of attention for their applications as optical thermometers based both on down shifting and upconversion processes. This study presents research done on development of highly sensitive optical thermometers in the physiological temperature range based on PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) films doped with two series of visible Ln  3+  complexes (Ln  3+  = Tb  3+  , Eu  3+  and Sm  3+  ) and silica (SiO  2  ) nanoparticles (NPs) coated with these PMMA films. The best performing PMMA films doped with Tb  3+  and Eu  3+  complexes, was the  PMMA[TbEuL  1  tppo]1  film (L  1  = 4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate and tppo = triphenylphosphine oxide), which showed good temperature sensing S  r  = 4.21% K  &#8208;1  at 313 K, while for the PMMA films doped with Tb  3+  and Sm  3+  complexes, was the  PMMA[TbSmL  2  tppo]3  film (L  2  = 4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate) showed S  r  = 3.64% K  &#8208;1  at 313 K. Additionally, SiO  2  nanoparticles coated with the best preforming films from each of the series of PMMA films (Tb&#8208;Eu and Tb&#8208;Sm) and their temperature sensing properties were studied in water showing excellent performance in the physiological temperature range (  PMMA[TbEuL  1  tppo]1@SiO  2  S  r  = 3.84% &#176;C at 20 &#176;C and  PMMA[TbSmL  2  tpp]3@SiO  2  S  r  = 3.27% &#176;C at 20 &#176;C) and the toxicity of these nanoparticles on human cells was studied showing that they are not toxic.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8211;&#960; Catalysis in Carbon Flatland&#8212;Flipping [8]Annulene on Graphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flipping catalysts! Unlike hydrogen bonding, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions are rarely the sole driving force of catalysis. Computational modeling shows that pristine graphene flakes may efficiently catalyze the skeletal inversions of various benzannulated [8]annulene derivatives. An energy decomposition analysis highlights the increasingly important role played by dispersion interactions in this catalysis with increasing system size.







Abstract
Noncovalent interactions are an integral part of the modern catalysis toolbox. Although stronger noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding are commonly the main driving force of catalysis, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions typically provide smaller additional stabilizations, for example, to afford selectivity enhancements. Here, it is shown computationally that pristine graphene flakes may efficiently catalyze the skeletal inversions of various benzannulated cyclooctatetraene derivatives, providing an example of a catalytic process driven solely by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. Hereby, the catalytic effect results from disproportionate shape complementarity between catalyst and transition structure compared with catalyst and reactant. An energy decomposition analysis reveals electrostatic and, especially with increasing system size, to a larger extent, dispersion interactions as the origin of stabilization.

Coming together: The cooperative action of an IrIII complex photosensitizer, a thiourea, and an azo compound enables the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced formal [4+2] cycloaddition of acyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides and imides with N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines to synthesize structurally diverse 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines possessing contiguous stereogenic centers in a highly diastereoselective manner. The chemoselective removal of the auxiliary can be achieved.







Abstract
1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrahydroquinolines should be applicable to the development of new pharmaceutical agents. A facile synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines that is achieved by a photoinduced formal [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of acyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated amides and imides with N,N&#8208;dialkylanilines under visible&#8208;light irradiation, in which a new IrIII complex photosensitizer, a thiourea, and an oxidant act cooperatively in promoting the reaction, is reported. The photoreaction enables the synthesis of a wide variety of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinolines, while controlling the trans/cis diastereoselectivity (&gt;99:1) and constructing contiguous stereogenic centers. A chemoselective cleavage of an acyclic imide auxiliary is demonstrated.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going with the flow: This Minireview summarizes the most recent reports (2017&#8211;2020) on continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of functional molecules. Notably, several complex active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) have been prepared by the continuous&#8208;flow approach. Key technologies to the successes and remaining challenges are discussed. These results exemplify the feasibility of using modern continuous&#8208;flow chemistry for complex synthetic targets, and bode well for the future development of integrated, automated artificial synthetic systems.







Abstract
Continuous&#8208;flow multi&#8208;step synthesis takes the advantages of microchannel flow chemistry and may transform the conventional multi&#8208;step organic synthesis by using integrated synthetic systems. To realize the goal, however, innovative chemical methods and techniques are urgently required to meet the significant remaining challenges. In the past few years, by using green reactions, telescoped chemical design, and/or novel in&#8208;line separation techniques, major and rapid advancement has been made in this direction.

         <title>Enthalpically and Entropically Favorable Self&#8208;Assembly: Synthesis of C4h&#8208;Symmetric Tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes by Regioselective Introduction of Pyridine Rings</title>

         <dc:description>
Doubly favored self&#8208;assembly: The synthesis and properties of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes are disclosed. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that the tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes form face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked dimers owing to the circularly arranged dipole moments. Formation of self&#8208;assemblies of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes is favored by both enthalpic and entropic factors. The unique behavior is due to the presence of sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in solution generally occurs owing to either an enthalpic or an entropic gain; however, designing &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems that simultaneously exhibit enthalpically and entropically favorable self&#8208;assembly behavior is challenging. Herein, the self&#8208;assembly behavior of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes is disclosed, which is driven by both enthalpy and entropy. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that molecules of these tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes form face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked dimers with a 1D columnar structure owing to the circularly arranged dipole moments. Importantly, concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent 1H&#8197;NMR spectra revealed that the formation of self&#8208;assemblies of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes in chloroform and methanol is favored by both enthalpic and entropic factors. The unique association behavior is due to the presence of sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen atoms, which weakly coordinate to the hydrogen atoms of these solvents and reduce the &#960;&#8208;electron density of the circulene cores.

Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that molecules of these tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes form face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked dimers with a 1D columnar structure owing to the circularly arranged dipole moments. Importantly, concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectra revealed that the formation of self&#8208;assemblies of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes in chloroform and methanol is favored by both enthalpic and entropic factors. The unique association behavior is due to the presence of sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;hybridized nitrogen atoms, which weakly coordinate to the hydrogen atoms of these solvents and reduce the &#960;&#8208;electron density of the circulene cores.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Interface Amorphization of Two&#8208;Dimensional Black Phosphorus upon Treatment with Diazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of diazonium salts to black phosphorus intercalation compounds does not lead to covalent functionalization, instead it causes a drastic structural evolution in the interface of few&#8208;layer BP leading to amorphous red phosphorus.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) represents one of the most appealing 2D materials due to its electronic, optical, and chemical properties. Many strategies have been pursued to face its environmental instability, covalent functionalization being one of the most promising. However, the extremely low functionalization degrees and the limitations in proving the nature of the covalent functionalization still represent challenges in many of these sheet architectures reported to date. Here we shine light on the structural evolution of 2D&#8208;BP upon the addition of electrophilic diazonium salts. We demonstrated the absence of covalent functionalization in both the neutral and the reductive routes, observing in the latter case an unexpected interface conversion of BP to red phosphorus (RP), as characterized by Raman, 31P&#8208;MAS NMR, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS). Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (TG&#8208;GC&#8208;MS), as well as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) gave insights into the potential underlying radical mechanism, suggesting a Sandmeyer&#8208;like reaction.

         <title>A Series of Bisamide&#8208;Substituted Diacetylenes Exhibiting a Terminal Alkyl Odd/Even Parity Effect on Mechanoactivated Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Odd versus even: A series of bisamide&#8208;substituted diacetylenes with varying terminal alkyl spacer length showed unique pressure&#8208;induced photopolymerizability. The odd or even parity of the terminal alkyl gave a light&#8208;active and light&#8208;inert pristine state, respectively. It is revealed that the intermolecular hydrogen bonds were highly influenced by the terminal alkyl parity, resulting in the different crystalline packings and photopolymerization properties.







Abstract
Diacetylene derivatives exhibit solid&#8208;state polymerization to polydiacetylene initiated by UV light or &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation. The activation of the photopolymerization relies on the monomer diynes arrangement. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the first mechanoresponsive bisamide substituted diacetylenes (DAs) show dramatic switching from light&#8208;inert to light&#8208;reactive states at a given pressure. The origin of this unique phenomenon was apparently related to the pressure&#8208;sensitive crystalline transition in DAs, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. To obtain more insight, herein a series of DAs with varying terminal alkyl spacer length is presented, and their molecular structural effect on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and steric repulsion is examined. In pristine states, even&#8208;parity DAs were inactive upon UV irradiation (&#955;=254&#8197;nm) unless external pressure was applied. By contrast, odd&#8208;parity DAs were easily polymerized upon UV irradiation without pressure application. However, the pressure&#8208;induced crystalline phase transition exhibiting photopolymerization was valid for all DAs regardless of their alkyl spacer length. A systematic investigation revealed that the terminal alkyl spacer length, especially its odd/even parity plays a key role in determining the intrinsic intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding nature of DA crystals and the resultant molecular packing. In addition, the relevant thermochromic behavior was also observed from photopolymerized polydiacetylenes.

         <title>Multiscale Approach of Spin Crossover Materials: A Concept Mixing Russian Dolls and Domino Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1483-1486, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although of purely atomic origin, spin crossover (SCO) spreads like a cascade of dominoes to all dimensions of a material, which fit together like Russian dolls with not only extremely different effects in nature and in amplitude, but also with a mutual interdependence. The multi&#8208;scale description is the only way to understand the full impact of a SCO on a material, incidentally showing the power of the crystallography approach. This concept could be extended to many other molecular phenomena.







Abstract
The spin crossover (SCO) phenomenon corresponds to a modification that originates at the atomic scale. However, the simple consideration of the transformations that occur following the SCO at this scale or in its close vicinity does not allow anyone to truly understand, anticipate and thus take advantage of what happens at the scale of the material, and even less at the device one. As the fruit of years of work and experience on this phenomenon, we formalize here the concept of the multiscale understanding of SCO. Clearly, the deflagration generated by the initial impressive atomic modification on all the physical scales of the solid must be understood in terms of structure&#8208;properties relationships that fit together, like Russian dolls, and propagate according to a kind of domino effect. Each scale can both give different and independent consequences from those of the other scales but at the same time can influence those of a larger or smaller scale, the whole being imperatively to take into account. The concept appears well illustrated by the volume modification, always the same at the atomic level but drastically different and adaptable, in amplitude and sense, at any other physical scale. This approach results in a much wider range of potential applications than the atomic level alone initially suggests, including one serious path to shape memory materials.

         <title>What's in an Atom? A Comparison of Carbon and Silicon&#8208;Centred Amidinium&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Carboxylate Frameworks**

One atom makes all the difference: Changing the central atom from carbon to silicon in a tetraamidinium building block causes a dramatic change in the resulting hydrogen bonded amidinium/carboxylate frameworks. Generally, the silicon&#8208;containing systems are less likely to form predictable materials. DFT calculations and CSD searches reveal that tetraarylsilanes have a more stringently tetrahedral geometry than tetraarylmethanes.







Abstract
Despite their apparent similarity, framework materials based on tetraphenylmethane and tetraphenylsilane building blocks often have quite different structures and topologies. Herein, we describe a new silicon tetraamidinium compound and use it to prepare crystalline hydrogen bonded frameworks with carboxylate anions in water. The silicon&#8208;containing frameworks are compared with those prepared from the analogous carbon tetraamidinium: when biphenyldicarboxylate or tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)methane anions were used similar channel&#8208;containing networks are observed for both the silicon and carbon tetraamidinium. When terephthalate or bicarbonate anions were used, different products form. Insights into possible reasons for the different products are provided by a survey of the Cambridge Structural Database and quantum chemical calculations, both of which indicate that, contrary to expectations, tetraphenylsilane derivatives have less geometrical flexibility than tetraphenylmethane derivatives, that is, they are less able to distort away from ideal tetrahedral bond angles.

         <title>Temperature as an Extra Dimension in Multidimensional Protein NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1753-1767, January 21, 2021. </description>

Time&#8208;saving processing: The rates of temperature&#8208;dependent chemical shift changes help in protein structure analysis. Three&#8208;dimensional experiments to reveal these changes are often lengthy to the extent of being barely feasible. Two specially tailored data processing techniques yield temperature coefficients and their non&#8208;linearities to overcome this limitation.







Abstract
NMR spectroscopy is a particularly informative method for studying protein structures and dynamics in solution; however, it is also one of the most time&#8208;consuming. Modern approaches to biomolecular NMR spectroscopy are based on lengthy multidimensional experiments, the duration of which grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. The experimental time may even be several days in the case of 3D and 4D spectra. Moreover, the experiment often has to be repeated under several different conditions, for example, to measure the temperature&#8208;dependent effects in a spectrum (temperature coefficients (TCs)). Herein, a new approach that involves joint sampling of indirect evolution times and temperature is proposed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time&#8208;saving processing&lt;/b&gt;: The rates of temperature&#8208;dependent chemical shift changes help in protein structure analysis. Three&#8208;dimensional experiments to reveal these changes are often lengthy to the extent of being barely feasible. Two specially tailored data processing techniques yield temperature coefficients and their non&#8208;linearities to overcome this limitation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NMR spectroscopy is a particularly informative method for studying protein structures and dynamics in solution; however, it is also one of the most time&#8208;consuming. Modern approaches to biomolecular NMR spectroscopy are based on lengthy multidimensional experiments, the duration of which grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. The experimental time may even be several days in the case of 3D and 4D spectra. Moreover, the experiment often has to be repeated under several different conditions, for example, to measure the temperature&#8208;dependent effects in a spectrum (temperature coefficients (TCs)). Herein, a new approach that involves joint sampling of indirect evolution times and temperature is proposed. This allows TCs to be measured through 3D spectra in even less time than that needed to acquire a single spectrum by using the conventional approach. Two signal processing methods that are complementary, in terms of sensitivity and resolution, 1)&#8197;dividing data into overlapping subsets followed by compressed sensing reconstruction, and 2)&#8197;treating the complete data set with a variant of the Radon transform, are proposed. The temperature&#8208;swept 3D HNCO spectra of two intrinsically disordered proteins, osteopontin and CD44 cytoplasmic tail, show that this new approach makes it possible to determine TCs and their non&#8208;linearities effectively. Non&#8208;linearities, which indicate the presence of a compact state, are particularly interesting.

         <title>Methylene Bridging Effect on the Structures, Lewis Acidities and Optical Properties of Semi&#8208;planar Triarylboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1736-1743, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of semi&#8208;planar triarylboranes were obtained by three procedures. The effects of the planarization induced by the methylene bridge on their steric shielding, Lewis acidities and optical properties were investigated by experiments and quantum chemical calculations. These methods can be extended to the preparation of functionalized spirocyclic amine&#8208;boranes and unsymmetrical triarylboranes, which might be used in frustrated Lewis pair chemistry or as pH and photo&#8208;responsive boron Lewis acids.







Abstract
Three synthetic methods towards semi&#8208;planar triarylboranes with two aryl rings connected by a methylene bridge have been developed. The fine&#8208;tuning of their stereoelectronic properties and Lewis acidities was achieved by introducing fluorine, methyl, methoxy, n&#8208;butyl and phenyl groups either at their exocyclic or bridged aryl rings. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provided quantitative information on the structural distortion experienced by the near planar hydro&#8208;boraanthracene skeleton during the association with Lewis bases such as NH3 and F&#8722;. Though the methylene bridge between the ortho&#8208;positions of two aryl rings of triarylboranes decreased the Gibbs free energies of complexation with small Lewis bases by less than 5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 relative to the classical Lewis acid BAr3, the steric shielding of the CH2 bridge is sufficient to avoid the formation of Lewis adducts with larger Lewis bases such as triarylphosphines. A newly synthesized spirocyclic amino&#8208;borane with a long intramolecular B&#8722;N bond that could be dissociated under thermal process, UV&#8208;irradiation, or acidic conditions might be a potential candidate in Lewis pairs catalysis.

Understanding oxygenases: The mechanism for the enzymatic cofactor&#8208;independent oxidation of 3,5&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetyl&#8208;CoA (DPA&#8208;CoA) is studied by combining multireference calculations on a model system with QM/MM calculations. The results reveal that intersystem crossing takes place without requiring the previous protonation of molecular oxygen.







Abstract
Despite being a very strong oxidizing agent, most organic molecules are not oxidized in the presence of O2 at room temperature because O2 is a diradical whereas most organic molecules are closed&#8208;shell. Oxidation then requires a change in the spin state of the system, which is forbidden according to non&#8208;relativistic quantum theory. To overcome this limitation, oxygenases usually rely on metal or redox cofactors to catalyze the incorporation of, at least, one oxygen atom into an organic substrate. However, some oxygenases do not require any cofactor, and the detailed mechanism followed by these enzymes remains elusive. To fill this gap, here the mechanism for the enzymatic cofactor&#8208;independent oxidation of 3,5&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetyl&#8208;CoA (DPA&#8208;CoA) is studied by combining multireference calculations on a model system with QM/MM calculations. Our results reveal that intersystem crossing takes place without requiring the previous protonation of molecular oxygen. The characterization of the electronic states reveals that electron transfer is concomitant with the triplet&#8211;singlet transition. The enzyme plays a passive role in promoting the intersystem crossing, although spontaneous reorganization of the water wire connecting the active site with the bulk presets the substrate for subsequent chemical transformations. The results show that the stabilization of the singlet radical&#8208;pair between dioxygen and enolate is enough to promote spin&#8208;forbidden reaction without the need for neither metal cofactors nor basic residues in the active site.

         <title>Influence of Metal&#8208;Alkyls on Early&#8208;Stage Ethylene Polymerization over a Cr/SiO2 Phillips Catalyst: A Bulk Characterization and X&#8208;ray Chemical Imaging Study</title>

Tailoring polymerization processes: The addition of the proper type and amount of co&#8208;catalyst in a Cr/SiO2 Phillips&#8208;type ethylene polymerization system tailors the molecular weight distribution and degree of short chain branching. We have now used scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy for investigating how these properties affect the polyethylene crystallinity in the early stages of ethylene polymerization.







Abstract
The Cr/SiO2 Phillips catalyst has taken a central role in ethylene polymerization since its invention in 1953. The uniqueness of this catalyst is related to its ability to produce broad molecular weight distribution (MWD) PE materials as well as that no co&#8208;catalysts are required to attain activity. Nonetheless, co&#8208;catalysts in the form of metal&#8208;alkyls can be added for scavenging poisons, enhancing catalyst activity, reducing the induction period, and tailoring polymer characteristics. The activation mechanism and related polymerization mechanism remain elusive, despite extensive industrial and academic research. Here, we show that by varying the type and amount of metal&#8208;alkyl co&#8208;catalyst, we can tailor polymer properties around a single Cr/SiO2 Phillips catalyst formulation. Furthermore, we show that these different polymer properties exist in the early stages of polymerization. We have used conventional polymer characterization techniques, such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and 13C&#8197;NMR, for studying the metal&#8208;alkyl co&#8208;catalyst effect on short&#8208;chain branching (SCB), long&#8208;chain branching (LCB) and molecular weight distribution (MWD) at the bulk scale. In addition, scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM) was used as a synchrotron technique to study the PE formation in the early stages: allowing us to investigate the produced type of early&#8208;stage PE within one particle cross&#8208;section with high energy resolution and nanometer scale spatial resolution.

         <title>What Determines the Selectivity of Arginine Dihydroxylation by the Nonheme Iron Enzyme OrfP?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1795-1809, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations on the arginine dihydroxylating dioxygenase OrfP focus on the mechanism of arginine activation. We find a selective initial C3&#8722;H oxygenation pathway followed by a second oxygenation cycle on the C4&#8722;H group. A comparison with other arginine activating enzymes highlight a tight substrate binding pocket that locks the product and enables two oxygenation cycles.







Abstract
The nonheme iron enzyme OrfP reacts with l&#8208;Arg selectively to form the 3R,4R&#8208;dihydroxyarginine product, which in mammals can inhibit the nitric oxide synthase enzymes involved in blood pressure control. To understand the mechanisms of dioxygen activation of l&#8208;Arg by OrfP and how it enables two sequential oxidation cycles on the same substrate, we performed a density functional theory study on a large active site cluster model. We show that substrate binding and positioning in the active site guides a highly selective reaction through C3&#8722;H hydrogen atom abstraction. This happens despite the fact that the C3&#8722;H and C4&#8722;H bond strengths of l&#8208;Arg are very similar. Electronic differences in the two hydrogen atom abstraction pathways drive the reaction with an initial C3&#8722;H activation to a low&#8208;energy 5&#963;&#8208;pathway, while substrate positioning destabilizes the C4&#8722;H abstraction and sends it over the higher&#8208;lying 5&#960;&#8208;pathway. We show that substrate and monohydroxylated products are strongly bound in the substrate binding pocket and hence product release is difficult and consequently its lifetime will be long enough to trigger a second oxygenation cycle.

     alt="What Determines the Selectivity of Arginine Dihydroxylation by the Nonheme Iron Enzyme OrfP?"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Density functional theory&lt;/b&gt; calculations on the arginine dihydroxylating dioxygenase OrfP focus on the mechanism of arginine activation. We find a selective initial C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H oxygenation pathway followed by a second oxygenation cycle on the C&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H group. A comparison with other arginine activating enzymes highlight a tight substrate binding pocket that locks the product and enables two oxygenation cycles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonheme iron enzyme OrfP reacts with &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;Arg selectively to form the 3&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,4&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;dihydroxyarginine product, which in mammals can inhibit the nitric oxide synthase enzymes involved in blood pressure control. To understand the mechanisms of dioxygen activation of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;Arg by OrfP and how it enables two sequential oxidation cycles on the same substrate, we performed a density functional theory study on a large active site cluster model. We show that substrate binding and positioning in the active site guides a highly selective reaction through C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H hydrogen atom abstraction. This happens despite the fact that the C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H and C&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H bond strengths of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;Arg are very similar. Electronic differences in the two hydrogen atom abstraction pathways drive the reaction with an initial C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H activation to a low&#8208;energy &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#963;&#8208;pathway, while substrate positioning destabilizes the C&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H abstraction and sends it over the higher&#8208;lying &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#960;&#8208;pathway. We show that substrate and monohydroxylated products are strongly bound in the substrate binding pocket and hence product release is difficult and consequently its lifetime will be long enough to trigger a second oxygenation cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

Anti&#8208;c&#8208;Met activity using cyclophane framework: Bithiazolophane 1, which was conveniently prepared under reflux for only 15&#8197;min by Hantzsch thiazoles synthesis, exhibited anti&#8208;activity (IC50=603&#8197;nm) against c&#8208;Met. The computational site identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS&#8208;MC) showed 1 blocked access to the active site of c&#8208;Met by acting as a hatch.







Abstract
A simple approach to the synthesis of heterocyclophane consisting of two 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bithiazoles has been developed in mild conditions. The heterocyclophane with two short chains was conveniently prepared by Hantzsch thiazoles synthesis using the reaction of 3&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl&#8208;3&#8208;azapentanethiocarboxamide with 1,4&#8208;dibromobutane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione in methanol under reflux for only 15&#8197;min. Amino groups at the linkers of this heterocyclophane can be functionalized to give acylated and carbamate derivatives. Their properties as protein kinase inhibitors were investigated, and one of the heterocyclophanes exhibited specific anti&#8208;activity for c&#8208;mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (IC50=603&#8197;nm), among seven types of protein kinases investigated. The computational site identification by ligand competitive saturation method was used to determine why the one heterocyclophane exhibited strong anti&#8208;activity for c&#8208;mesenchymal epithelial transition factor.

         <title>Urchin&#8208;Type Architecture Assembled by Cobalt Phosphide Nanorods Encapsulated in Graphene Framework as an Advanced Anode for Alkali Metal Ion Batteries</title>

Urchin&#8208;type cobalt phosphide is encapsulated in a graphene framework membrane as a binder&#8208;free electrode for alkali metal ion batteries. This membrane exhibits enhanced reversible lithium, sodium, and potassium storage capabilities. Moreover, the energy storage properties of the membrane electrodes are in the order of Li&gt;Na&gt;K, which is further studied by the adsorption energy of CoP surfaces for Li, Na, and K using DFT calculations.







Abstract
Urchin&#8208;type cobalt phosphide microparticles assembled by nanorod were encapsulated in a graphene framework membrane (CoP@GF), and used as a binder&#8208;free electrode for alkali metal ion batteries. Electrochemical measurements indicate that this membrane exhibits enhanced reversible lithium, sodium, and potassium storage capabilities. Moreover, the energy storage properties of CoP@GF electrodes in alkali metal ion batteries display an order of Li&gt;Na&gt;K. DFT calculations on adsorption energy of CoP surfaces for Li, Na, and K indicated that CoP surfaces were more favorable to transfer electrons to Li atoms than Na and K, and the surface reactivity can be ordered as Li&#8208;CoP&gt;Na&#8208;CoP&gt;K&#8208;CoP; thus, CoP@GF exhibits better storage capacity for lithium. This work provides experimental and theoretical basis for understanding the electrochemical performance of cobalt phosphide&#8208;based membranes for alkali metal ion batteries.

Planar cyclometalated complexes [Pt(C^N^N)CN] bearing a cyanide ligand can participate in the formation of halogen&#8208;bonded adducts. This allows their molecular packing and optical properties to be influenced by means of noncovalent interactions.







Abstract
Luminescent cyclometalated complexes [M(C^N^N)CN] (M=Pt, Pd; HC^N^N=pyridinyl&#8208; (M=Pt 1, Pd 5), benzyltriazolyl&#8208; (M=Pt 2), indazolyl&#8208; (M=Pt 3, Pd 6), pyrazolyl&#8208;phenylpyridine (M=Pt 4)) decorated with cyanide ligand, have been explored as nucleophilic building blocks for the construction of halogen&#8208;bonded (XB) adducts using IC6F5 as an XB donor. The negative electrostatic potential of the CN group afforded CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I noncovalent interactions for platinum complexes 1&#8211;3; the energies of XB contacts are comparable to those of metallophilic bonding according to QTAIM analysis. Embedding the chromophore units into XB adducts 1&#8211;3&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;IC6F5 has little effect on the charge distribution, but strongly affects Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt bonding and &#960;&#8208;stacking, which lead to excited states of MMLCT (metal&#8211;metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer) origin. The energies of these states and the photoemissive properties of the crystalline materials are primarily determined by the degree of aggregation of the luminophores via metal&#8211;metal interactions. The adduct formation depends on the nature of the metal and the structure of the metalated ligand, the variation of which can yield dynamic XB&#8208;supported systems, exemplified by thermally regulated transition 3&#8596;3&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;IC6F5.

         <title>Efficient Emission of Ultraviolet Light by Solid State Organic Fluorophores: Synthesis and Characterization of 1,4&#8208;Dialkeny&#8208;2,5&#8208;dioxybenzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1626-1637, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond visible&#8208;light region: 1,4&#8208;Dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dioxybenzenes were developed as organic fluorophores whose emission maxima appears in the ultraviolet region with good&#8208;to&#8208;high solid&#8208;state quantum yields. The synthesis of the UV&#8208;emissive benzenes is easy, and the use of an adamantylidene moieties as the alkenyl parts results in efficient solid&#8208;state UV fluorescence. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the electronic structures of the UV&#8208;emissive benzenes differ depending on whether the substituents on the phenolic oxygen atoms are carbonaceous or aryl silyl groups.







Abstract
The design and development of organic luminophores that exhibit efficient ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence in the solid state remains underexplored. Here, we report that 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzenes and 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;disiloxybenzenes act as such UV&#8208;emissive fluorophores. The dialkenyldioxybenzenes were readily prepared in three steps from 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diacetylbenzene or 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diformylbenzene via two to four steps from 1,4&#8208;bis(diethoxyphosphonylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzene. The dialkenyldioxybenzenes emit UV light in solution (&#955;em=350&#8211;387&#8197;nm) and in the solid state (&#955;em=328&#8211;388&#8197;nm). In addition, the quantum yields in the solid state were generally higher than those in solution. In particular, the adamantylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes fluoresced in the UV region with high quantum yields (&#934;=0.37&#8211;0.55) in the solid state. Thin films of poly(methyl methacrylate) doped with the adamantylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes also exhibited UV emission with good efficiency (&#934;=0.27&#8211;0.45). Density functional theory calculations revealed that the optical excitation of the dialkenyldimethoxybenzenes involves intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the ether oxygen atoms to the twisted alkenyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;alkenyl moiety, whereas the dialkenylbis(triphenylsiloxy)benzenes were optically excited through intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the oxygen atoms and twisted &#960;&#8208;system to the phenyl&#8208;Si moieties of each triphenylsilyl group.

     alt="Efficient Emission of Ultraviolet Light by Solid State Organic Fluorophores: Synthesis and Characterization of 1,4&#8208;Dialkeny&#8208;2,5&#8208;dioxybenzenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond visible&#8208;light region&lt;/b&gt;: 1,4&#8208;Dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dioxybenzenes were developed as organic fluorophores whose emission maxima appears in the ultraviolet region with good&#8208;to&#8208;high solid&#8208;state quantum yields. The synthesis of the UV&#8208;emissive benzenes is easy, and the use of an adamantylidene moieties as the alkenyl parts results in efficient solid&#8208;state UV fluorescence. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the electronic structures of the UV&#8208;emissive benzenes differ depending on whether the substituents on the phenolic oxygen atoms are carbonaceous or aryl silyl groups.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design and development of organic luminophores that exhibit efficient ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence in the solid state remains underexplored. Here, we report that 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzenes and 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;disiloxybenzenes act as such UV&#8208;emissive fluorophores.

&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt;=328&#8211;388&#8197;nm). In addition, the quantum yields in the solid state were generally higher than those in solution.

         <title>Chalice&#8208;Type Tridentate Silicon Lewis Acids of C3 Symmetry in a Single Step Starting from Hexadehydrotribenzo[12]annulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1821-1828, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;step one&#8208;pot synthesis, the hydrosilylation of the planar hydrocarbon hexadehydrotribenzo[12]annulene, provides access to chalice&#8208;like trifunctional Lewis acids of C3 symmetry with all functions oriented to the same side of the molecule. The synthesis of such poly&#8208;functionalized donor&#8208;free hydrocarbon derivatives is important for the development of new poly&#8208;Lewis acids.







Abstract
Tridentate Lewis acids with aligned functions were synthesized based on the rigid framework hexadehydrotribenzo[12]annulene. The backbone and its fluorinated analogue were synthesised in one&#8208;pot syntheses, with alkyne deprotection and Sonogashira cross coupling reaction being carried out in one step. Hydrosilylation of the annulene with chlorohydrosilanes proceeded highly selectively and afforded rigid poly&#8208;Lewis acids with three SiCl3 or SiCl2Me substituents perfectly oriented to one side of the molecule in a single step. The progress of hydrosilylation was investigated by time&#8208;correlated NMR spectroscopic studies. The crystal structures show that the framework is symmetrically functionalised and the silyl substituents are aligned in one direction. To increase the acidity of the Lewis acids the chlorosilyl substituents were fluorinated with SbF3. Further investigation of hydrometallation reactions (M=B, Al, Ga, Sn) did not lead to corresponding structures.

         <title>A Functional Hexaphenylbenzene Library Comprising of One, Three, and Six Peripheral Rylene&#8208;Diimide Substituents</title>

One, three and six rylene&#8208;diimide units, namely NDIs and PDIs, were attached to a HPBs core, generating a unprecedent library of star&#8208;like architectures, which were investigated toward their physicochemical properties. A direct connection between the rylenes and HPB via the imide N&#8208;position was chosen, rather than using a spacer. Successful Scholl oxidation generates mono&#8208;substituted HBCs as promising donor&#8211;acceptor hybrids.







Abstract
Synthesis and characterization of a series of rylene&#8208;diimide substituted hexaphenylbenzenes (HPBs) is presented. The direct connection of the rylene&#8208;diimide units to the HPBs via the imide&#8208;N&#8208;position without any linkers as well as the use of naphthalene&#8208;diimides (NDIs) next to perylene&#8208;diimides (PDIs) is unprecedented. While mono&#8208;substituted products were obtained by imidization reactions with amino&#8208;HPB and the respective rylene&#8208;monoimides, key step for the formation of tri&#8208; and hexa&#8208;substituted HPBs is the Co&#8208;catalysed cyclotrimerization. Particular emphasis for physic&#8208;chemical characterization was on to the number of NDIs/PDIs per HPB and the overall substitution patterns. Lastly, Scholl oxidation conditions were applied to all HPB systems to generate the corresponding hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs). Importantly, the efficiency of the transformation strongly depends on the number of NDIs/PDIs. While three rylene&#8208;diimide units already hinder the Scholl reaction, the successful synthesis of mono&#8208;substituted HBCs is possible.

         <title>Smart Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell Nanoparticles with Tunable Perylene Fluorescence in the Organic Interlayer</title>

         <dc:description>
Adjustable fluorescence features of a perylene unit in the organic interlayer of SbS&#8208;functionalized Al2O3 NPs were described. A perylene terminated phosphonic acid is attached covalently onto the NP surface, amphiphiles generated the second ligand shell. Depending on the type of amphiphile, changes in the initial fluorescence properties of the perylene were observed, that could be matched to aggregation, disaggregation, or electronic effects.







Abstract
A new series of shell&#8208;by&#8208;shell (SbS)&#8208;functionalized Al2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) containing a perylene core in the organic interlayer as a fluorescence marker is introduced. Initially, the NPs were functionalized with both, a fluorescent perylene phosphonic acid derivative, together with the lipophilic hexadecylphosphonic acid or the fluorophilic (1&#8201;H,1&#8201;H,2&#8201;H,2H&#8208;perfluorodecyl)phosphonic acid. The lipophilic first&#8208;shell functionalized NPs were further implemented with amphiphiles built of aliphatic chains and polar head&#8208;groups. However, the fluorophilic NPs were combined with amphiphiles consisting of fluorocarbon tails and polar head&#8208;groups. Depending on the nature of the combined phosphonic acids and the amphiphiles, tuning of the perylene fluorescence can be accomplished due variations of supramolecular organization with the shell interface. Because the SbS&#8208;functionalized NPs dispose excellent dispersibility in water and in biological media, two sorts of NPs with different surface properties were tested with respect to biological fluorescent imaging applications. Depending on the agglomeration of the NPs, the cellular uptake differs. The uptake of larger agglomerates is facilitated by endocytosis, whereas individualized NPs cross directly the cellular membrane. Also, the larger agglomerates were preferentially incorporated by all tested cells.

Different metal combinations and different linker ratios have been used to synthesize isoreticular mixed&#8208;metal/mixed&#8208;linker MIL&#8208;53 materials. The direct synthesis procedure at ambient pressure resulted in a statistical distribution of all components within the framework structure. The material properties, particularly the breathing behavior, can be tailored by the selection of suitable combinations and ratios of the components.







Abstract
The isoreticular mixed&#8208;component concept is a promising approach to tailor the material properties of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. While isoreticular mixed&#8208;metal or mixed&#8208;linker materials are commonly synthesized, the combination of both concepts for the development of isoreticular materials featuring both two metals and two linkers is still rarely investigated. Herein, we present the development of mixed&#8208;metal/mixed&#8208;linker MIL&#8208;53 materials that contain different metal combinations (Al/Sc, Al/V, Al/Cr, Al/Fe) and different linker ratios (terephthalate/2&#8208;aminoterephthalate). The possibility of changing the metal combination and the linker ratio independently from each other enables a large variety of modifications. A thorough characterization (PXRD, ATR&#8208;IR, TGA, 1H&#8197;NMR, ICP&#8208;OES) confirmed that all components were incorporated into the framework structure with a statistical distribution. Nitrogen physisorption measurements showed that the breathing behavior can be tailored by adjusting the linker ratio for all metal combinations. All materials were successfully used for post&#8208;synthetic modification reactions with maleic anhydride.

Organocatalytic step&#8208;growth polymerization: fossil&#8208; and biobased polyamides are obtained under mild ambient conditions by polycondensation of diamines and dialdehydes promoted by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene in the presence of recyclable external oxidant and nucleophilic additive.







Abstract
The polycondensation of diamines and dialdehydes promoted by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyst in the presence of a quinone oxidant and hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) is herein presented for the synthesis of oligomeric polyamides (PAs), which are obtained with a number&#8208;average molecular weight (Mn) in the range of 1.7&#8211;3.6&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1 as determined by NMR analysis. In particular, the utilization of furanic dialdehyde monomers (2,5&#8208;diformylfuran, DFF; 5,5&#8217;&#8208;[oxybis(methylene)]bis[2&#8208;furaldehyde], OBFA) to access known and previously unreported biobased PAs is illustrated. The synthesis of higher molecular weight PAs (poly(decamethylene terephthalamide, PA10T, Mn = 62.8&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1; poly(decamethylene 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylamide, PA10F, Mn = 6.5&#8197;kg&#8201;mol&#8722;1) by a two&#8208;step polycondensation approach is also described. The thermal properties (TGA and DSC analyses) of the synthesized PAs are reported.

Abstract
The synthesis of two series of gold(I) complexes with the general formulae PR3&#8208;Au&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;phenanthrene (PR3=PPh3 (1&#8201;a/2&#8201;a), PMe3 (1&#8201;b/2&#8201;b), PNaph3 (1&#8201;c/2&#8201;c)) or (diphos)(Au&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;phenanthrene)2 (diphos=1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane, dppm (1&#8201;d/2&#8201;d), 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane, dppb (1&#8201;e/2&#8201;e)) has been realized. The two series differ in the position of the alkynyl substituent on the phenanthrene chromophore, being at the 9&#8208;position (9&#8208;ethynylphenanthrene) for the L1 series and at the 2&#8208;position (2&#8208;ethynylphenanthrene) for the L2 series. The compounds have been fully characterized by 1H, 31P&#8197;NMR, and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction resolution in the case of compounds 1&#8201;a, 1&#8201;e, 2&#8201;a, and 2&#8201;c. The emissive properties of the uncoordinated ligands and corresponding complexes have been studied in solution and within organic matrixes of different polarity (polymethylmethacrylate and Zeonex). Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is observed for all gold(I) complexes whereas only fluorescence can be detected for the pure organic chromophore. In particular, the L2 series presents better luminescent properties regarding the intensity of emission, quantum yields, and RTP effect. Additionally, although the inclusion of all the compounds in organic matrixes induces an enhancement of the observed RTP owing to the decrease in non&#8208;radiative deactivation, only the L2 series completely suppresses the fluorescence, giving rise to pure phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Dithieno[a,e]pentalenes: Highly Antiaromatic Yet Stable &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems without Bulky Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1638-1647, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pentalenes that bear thiophenes in a fused fashion were synthesized as stable antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;electron systems. The fused thiophene rings result in a pentalene moiety with high thermal stability, even without bulky substituents, while retaining antiaromaticity. In particular, the thienyl&#8208;substituted derivative with hydrophilic side chains exhibited thermochromic behavior, most likely due to the formation of aggregates in polar solvents.







Abstract
Dithieno[a,e]penalenes (DTPs) with various substituents were synthesized as a class of antiaromatic compounds. Annulation of thiophene rings imparts the pentalene moiety with high thermal stability even without bulky substituents, while retaining antiaromaticity. The higher magnitude of antiaromaticity in DTPs, in addition to the differences in the electronic structures of the fused aromatic rings, resulted in a narrower HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap than that of the corresponding dibenzo[a,e]pentalene analog, giving rise to red&#8208;shifted electronic absorption that reaches the near&#8208;infrared region. Moreover, systematic investigations on the solid&#8208;state packing structure revealed that DTPs prefer offset face&#8208;to&#8208;face packing motifs rather than face&#8208;centered &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. In particular, the thienyl&#8208;substituted DTP bearing hydrophilic side chains exhibited thermochromic behavior in polar solvents, which was ascribed to the formation of aggregates.

         <title>Microwave Detection of Wet Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP): Non&#8208;Covalent Forces and Water Dynamics</title>

Detecting explosives: Wetting triacetone triperoxide (TATP) makes possible the rotational detection of this non&#8208;polar explosive through forming TATP&#8208;H2O and TATP&#8208;(H2O)2 adducts. The dynamics of water in the TATP&#8208;H2O adduct leads to a symmetric top. The main interaction is a four&#8208;center trifurcated donor Ow&#8208;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond, not observed previously in the gas phase. Structural signatures and theoretical calculations show the weakness of the interactions between water and TATP.







Abstract
The water adducts of triacetone triperoxide (TATP) have been observed by using broadband rotational spectroscopy. This work opens a new way for the gas&#8208;phase detection of this improvised explosive. The observed clusters exhibit unusual water dynamics and rarely observed multicenter interactions. TATP&#8208;H2O is formed from the D3 symmetry conformer of TATP with water lying close to the C3 axis. Water rotation around this axis with a very low barrier gives rise to the rotational spectrum of a symmetric top. The main interaction of the monohydrate is a four&#8208;center trifurcated donor Ow&#8208;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond, not observed previously in the gas phase, reinforced by a weak four&#8208;center trifurcated acceptor C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ow interaction. Surprisingly, all structural signatures show the weakness of these interactions. The complex TATP&#8208;(H2O)2 is formed from the monohydrated TATP by the self&#8208;association of water.

         <title>Impact of N&#8208;Truncated A&#946; Peptides on Cu&#8208; and Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Generated ROS: CuI Matters!</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1777-1786, January 21, 2021. </description>

Truncated but important: The ability of N&#8208;truncated amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides to either contribute to or prevent the production of deleterious reactive oxygen species by Cu or Cu(amyloid&#8208;&#946;) is examined, and evidence for the key role of copper(I) is presented.







Abstract
In vitro Cu(A&#946;1&#8211;x)&#8208;induced ROS production has been extensively studied. Conversely, the ability of N&#8208;truncated isoforms of A&#946; to alter the Cu&#8208;induced ROS production has been overlooked, even though they are main constituents of amyloid plaques found in the human brain. N&#8208;Truncated peptides at the positions 4 and 11 (A&#946;4&#8211;x and A&#946;11&#8211;x) contain an amino&#8208;terminal copper and nickel (ATCUN) binding motif (H2N&#8208;Xxx&#8208;Zzz&#8208;His) that confer them different coordination sites and higher affinities for CuII compared to the A&#946;1&#8211;x peptide. It has further been proposed that the role of A&#946;4&#8211;x peptide is to quench CuII toxicity in the brain. However, the role of CuI coordination has not been investigated to date. In contrast to CuII, CuI coordination is expected to be the same for N&#8208;truncated and N&#8208;intact peptides. Herein, we report in&#8208;depth characterizations and ROS production studies of Cu (CuI and CuII) complexes of the A&#946;4&#8211;16 and A&#946;11&#8211;16 N&#8208;truncated peptides. Our findings show that the N&#8208;truncated peptides do produce ROS when CuI is present in the medium, albeit to a lesser extent than the unmodified counterpart. In addition, when used as competitor ligands (i.e., in the presence of A&#946;1&#8211;16), the N&#8208;truncated peptides are not able to fully preclude Cu(A&#946;1&#8211;16)&#8208;induced ROS production.

         <title>Synthesis and Coordination Behavior of a New Hybrid Bidentate Ligand with Phosphine and Silylene Donors</title>

A ligand with different Lewis base donor sites of phosphorus(III) and silicon(II). The ligands are arranged in 1,2&#8208;position at the benzene ring to generate mainly five&#8208;membered ring compounds containing a metal atom. The exceptions of the compounds show clearly that the metal is preferentially coordinated to the silylene atom rather than to the phosphane site of the ligand.







Abstract
This work describes the synthesis and coordination behavior of a new mixed&#8208;donor ligand PhC(NtBu)2SiC6H4PPh2 (1) containing both silylene and phosphine donor sites. Ligand 1 was synthesized from a reaction of ortho&#8208;lithiated diphenylphosphinobenzene (LiC6H4PPh2) with chlorosilylene (PhC(NtBu)2SiCl). Treatment of 1 with Se and GeCl2 resulted in SiIV compounds 2 and 3 by selective oxidation of the silylene donor. This strong &#963;&#8208;donor ligand induces dissociation of CuCl and PhBCl2 leading to formation of ionic complexes 4 and 5 respectively. The reaction of 1 with ZnCl2 and AlCl3 resulted in the formation of chelate complexes 5 and 7, respectively, while treatment with EtAlCl2 and GaCl3 forms monodentate complexes 8 and 9. X&#8208;ray analysis of 4 showed that the copper is in the spiro center of the two five&#8208;membered rings. Moreover, the copper(I)chloride has not been oxidized but dissociates to Cu+ and [CuCl2]&#8722;. All the compounds are well characterized by mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, NMR spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

         <title>[Gd(AAZTA)]&#8722; Derivatives with n&#8208;Alkyl Acid Side Chains Show Improved Properties for Their Application as MRI Contrast Agents**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1849-1859, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The good properties of Gd(AAZTA) (AAZTA=6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;methylperhydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazepine tetra acetic acid) as a MRI contrast agent are further improved by simply attaching a short n&#8208;alkyl function on the ligand's surface. The variable temperature (VT)&#8208;T2 measurements of the 17OH2 resonance suggest the occurrence of two interconverting isomers in solution characterized by very different exchange rates of the coordinated water molecules.







Abstract
Herein, the synthesis and an extensive characterization of two novel Gd(AAZTA) (AAZTA=6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;methylperhydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazepine tetra acetic acid) derivatives functionalized with short (C2 and C4) n&#8208;alkyl acid functions are reported. The carboxylate functionality is the site for further conjugations for the design of more specific contrast agents (CAs). Interestingly, it has been found that the synthesized complexes display enhanced properties for use as MRI contrast agents on their own. The stability constants determined by using potentiometric titration and UV/Vis spectrophotometry were slightly higher than the one reported for the parent Gd(AAZTA) complex.

As far as concerns the kinetic stability, transmetallation experiments with endogenous ions (e.g. Cu2+) implied that the Gd3+ ions present in these Gd(AAZTA) derivatives show somewhat smaller susceptibility to chemical exchange towards these ions at 25&#8201;&#176;C, close to the physiological condition. The 1H&#8197;NMR spectra of the complexes with EuIII and YbIII displayed a set of signals consistent with half the number of methylene protons present on each ligand. The number of resonances was invariant over a large range of temperatures, suggesting the occurrence of a fast interconversion between structural isomers. The relaxivity values (298&#8197;K, 20&#8197;MHz) were consistent with q=2 being equal to 8.8&#8197;mm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for the C2 derivative and 9.4&#8197;mm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for the C4 one, that is, sensibly larger than the one reported for Gd(AAZTA) (7.1&#8197;mm&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Variable&#8208;temperature (VT)&#8208;T2 17O&#8197;NMR measurements showed, for both complexes, the presence of two populations of coordinated water molecules, one in fast and one in slow exchange with the bulk water. As the high&#8208;resolution 1H&#8197;NMR spectra of the analogs with EuIII and YbIII did not show the occurrence of distinct isomers (as frequently observed in other macrocyclic lanthanide(III)&#8208;containing complexes), we surmised the presence of two fast&#8208;interconverting isomers in solution. The analysis of the 17O&#8197;NMR VT&#8208;T2 profiles versus temperature allowed their relative molar fraction to be established as 35&#8201;% for the isomer with the fast exchanging water and 65&#8201;% for the isomer with the water molecules in slower exchange. Finally, 1H&#8197;NMRD profiles over an extended range of applied magnetic field strengths have been satisfactory fitted on the basis of the occurrence of the two interconverting species.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The good properties&lt;/b&gt; of Gd(AAZTA) (AAZTA=6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;methylperhydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazepine tetra acetic acid) as a MRI contrast agent are further improved by simply attaching a short &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alkyl function on the ligand's surface. The variable temperature (VT)&#8208;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; measurements of the &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resonance suggest the occurrence of two interconverting isomers in solution characterized by very different exchange rates of the coordinated water molecules.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, the synthesis and an extensive characterization of two novel Gd(AAZTA) (AAZTA=6&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;methylperhydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazepine tetra acetic acid) derivatives functionalized with short (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alkyl acid functions are reported. The carboxylate functionality is the site for further conjugations for the design of more specific contrast agents (CAs). Interestingly, it has been found that the synthesized complexes display enhanced properties for use as MRI contrast agents on their own. The stability constants determined by using potentiometric titration and UV/Vis spectrophotometry were slightly higher than the one reported for the parent Gd(AAZTA) complex. This observation might be accounted for by the larger sigma&#8208;electron donation of the acyl substituents with respect to the one provided by the methyl group in the parent complex. As far as concerns the kinetic stability, transmetallation experiments with endogenous ions (e.g. Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) implied that the Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions present in these Gd(AAZTA) derivatives show somewhat smaller susceptibility to chemical exchange towards these ions at 25&#8201;&#176;C, close to the physiological condition. The &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectra of the complexes with Eu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; and Yb&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; displayed a set of signals consistent with half the number of methylene protons present on each ligand. The number of resonances was invariant over a large range of temperatures, suggesting the occurrence of a fast interconversion between structural isomers. The relaxivity values (298&#8197;K, 20&#8197;MHz) were consistent with &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;=2 being equal to 8.8&#8197;m&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; derivative and 9.4&#8197;m&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; one, that is, sensibly larger than the one reported for Gd(AAZTA) (7.1&#8197;m&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Variable&#8208;temperature (VT)&#8208;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O&#8197;NMR measurements showed, for both complexes, the presence of two populations of coordinated water molecules, one in fast and one in slow exchange with the bulk water. As the high&#8208;resolution &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR spectra of the analogs with Eu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; and Yb&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; did not show the occurrence of distinct isomers (as frequently observed in other macrocyclic lanthanide(III)&#8208;containing complexes), we surmised the presence of two fast&#8208;interconverting isomers in solution.

         <title>Discordant Supramolecular Fibres Reversibly Depolymerised by Temperature and Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1829-1838, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterisation of a chiral supramolecular motif are reported. The BTA motif self&#8208;assembles into helical structures, wherein the hydrogen&#8208;bonded core is of opposite helicity from the surrounding double helix formed by azobenzenes. This discordant structure is confirmed the most favoured conformation by MD simulations. The supramolecular fibres can be reversibly (de)polymerised by thermal cues and light irradiation.







Abstract
Synthetic stimuli responsive supramolecular polymers attract increasing interest for their ability to mimic the unique properties of natural assemblies. Here we focus on the well&#8208;studied benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) motif, and substitute it with two (S)&#8208;3,7&#8208;dimethyloctyl groups and an azobenzene photoswitch. We demonstrate the UV (&#955;=365&#8197;nm) induced depolymerisation of the helical hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymers in methylcyclohexane (MCH) through circular dichroism and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy in dilute solution (15&#8197;&#956;m), and NMR and iPAINT super&#8208;resolution microscopy in concentrated solution (300&#8197;&#956;m). The superstructure can be regenerated after thermal depolymerization, whilst repeated depolymerisation can be reversed without degradation by irradiating at &#955;=455&#8197;nm. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the most energetically favourable configuration for these polymers in MCH is a left&#8208;handed helical network of hydrogen&#8208;bonds between the BTA cores surrounded by two right&#8208;handed helices of azobenzenes. The responsiveness to two orthogonal triggers across a broad concentration range holds promise for use in, for example, photo&#8208;responsive gelation.

In their review article on page 1487, S.&#8197;R. McAlpine et&#8197;al., describe recent strategies used to develop cell permeable cyclic peptides that retain binding to their biological target once inside the cell. They discuss chemical strategies that have produced molecules with improved cell permeability however negatively impact biological activity. They also highlight the most promising approach involving side chain alterations.

Efficient solid&#8208;state emission of ultraviolet light is achieved with 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dialkoxybenzenes and 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;disiloxybenzenes. The twisted molecular conformation and weak intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the ether oxygen atoms to the alkenyl&#8211;benzene&#8211;alkenyl moiety are the keys for the realization of the solid&#8208;state UV emission with high efficiency.

Dancing people parade along the rings: The cover image depicts the movement of electrons on tetracyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems under a magnetic field. While the annulation of benzene rings with a pentalene moiety resulted in the local aromatic character in the six&#8208;membered rings, the thiophene&#8208;fused analog retains the pronounced antiaromatic character of pentalene moiety. The fused thiophene rings also offer sufficient stability to the antiaromatic pentalene even without bulky substituents, enabling the formation of aggregates.

         <title>Cover Feature: Microwave Detection of Wet Triacetone Triperoxide (TATP): Non&#8208;Covalent Forces and Water Dynamics (Chem. Eur. J. 5/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1481-1481, January 21, 2021. </description>

Triacetone triperoxide (TATP) is an explosive which, due to its ease of synthesis and difficulty of detection, is a common choice for the improvised explosive devices used by terrorists. TATP has no dipole moment so it is undetectable using conventional rotational spectroscopy. However, using supersonic jets it is possible to observe the TATP&#8211;H2O polar adducts opening a way to TATP microwave detection. The main interaction of the adduct is a four&#8208;center trifurcated Ow&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;C. L&#243;pez et&#8197;al. on page 1680.

         <title>Cyclic Peptides as Drugs for Intracellular Targets: The Next Frontier in Peptide Therapeutic Development</title>

This review describes recent strategies used to develop cell permeable cyclic peptides that retain binding to their biological target once inside the cell. Discussed are chemical strategies that have produced molecules with improved cell permeability however negatively impact biological activity. Highlighted is the most promising approach involving side chain alterations.







Abstract
Developing macrocyclic peptides that can reach intracellular targets is a significant challenge. This review discusses the most recent strategies used to develop cell permeable cyclic peptides that maintain binding to their biological target inside the cell. Macrocyclic peptides are unique from small molecules because traditional calculated physical properties are unsuccessful for predicting cell membrane permeability. Peptide synthesis and experimental membrane permeability is the only strategy that effectively differentiates between cell permeable and cell impermeable molecules. Discussed are chemical strategies, including backbone N&#8208;methylation and stereochemical changes, which have produced molecular scaffolds with improved cell permeability. However, these improvements often come at the expense of biological activity as chemical modifications alter the peptide conformation, frequently impacting the compound's ability to bind to the target. Highlighted is the most promising approach, which involves side&#8208;chain alterations that improve cell permeability without impact binding events.

C(1)&#8208;Ammonium enolates have found widespread application for the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;functionalisation of carboxylic acid derivatives. This minireview highlights the recent advances in the generation of C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolate intermediates by using isothiourea Lewis base organocatalysts and various precursors. The synthetic utility is showcased in intra&#8208; and intermolecular enantioselective C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bond forming processes on reaction with various electrophiles utilising two distinct catalyst turnover approaches.







Abstract
C(1)&#8208;Ammonium enolates are powerful, catalytically generated synthetic intermediates applied in the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;functionalisation of carboxylic acid derivatives. This minireview describes the recent developments in the generation and application of C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolates from various precursors (carboxylic acids, anhydrides, acyl imidazoles, aryl esters, &#945;&#8208;diazoketones, alkyl halides) using isothiourea Lewis base organocatalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C(1)&#8208;Ammonium enolates are powerful, catalytically generated synthetic intermediates applied in the enantioselective &#945;&#8208;functionalisation of carboxylic acid derivatives. This minireview describes the recent developments in the generation and application of C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolates from various precursors (carboxylic acids, anhydrides, acyl imidazoles, aryl esters, &#945;&#8208;diazoketones, alkyl halides) using isothiourea Lewis base organocatalysts. Their synthetic utility in intra&#8208; and intermolecular enantioselective C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bond forming processes on reaction with various electrophiles will be showcased utilising two distinct catalyst turnover approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Induced Emission from Tetraphenylethylene Units and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1556-1575, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motions of the tetraphenylethylene (TPE) units are restricted by coordination bonds through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, thereby their non&#8208;radiative decay is reduced to induce fluorescence emission. This minireview offers a summary of recent advances that have been made in the design and synthesis of TPE&#8208;based metallacycles, metallacages, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and coordination polymers (CPs). Their potential applications as materials for chemical sensors, cell imaging agents and light&#8208;harvesting materials, among others, are outlined.







Abstract
Thanks to the potential of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) phenomena, improved stabilities, and the good selectivity and sensitivity of the chemical responses exhibited by the products, coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly with tetraphenylethylene (TPE) units has recently received much attention and has been widely investigated for application in chemical sensors, cell imaging agents, light&#8208;harvesting systems, and others. Several reviews have emerged on the topics of AIE chemistry and aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based supramolecular assembles, however, there is still a distinct lack of full overviews of emission enhancement from the viewpoint of metal&#8208;coordination effects. Thus, this minireview offers recent advances that have been made in the design and application of TPE&#8208;based metallacycles, metallacages, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and coordination polymers (CPs).

Small scale: Miniaturized spectrometers have revolutionized near&#8208;infrared spectroscopy by opening up a spectrum of new applications for this already mature analytical technique. This review presents current issues in this thriving field. The diversity of underlying technology, miniaturization versus performance, and very active research areas of systematic feasibility studies aimed at establishing the applicability of these devices are highlighted.







Abstract
This review article focuses on the principles and applications of miniaturized near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectrometers. This technology and its applicability has advanced considerably over the last few years and revolutionized several fields of application. What is particularly remarkable is that the applications have a distinctly diverse nature, ranging from agriculture and the food sector, through to materials science, industry and environmental studies. Unlike a rather uniform design of a mature benchtop FTNIR spectrometer, miniaturized instruments employ diverse technological solutions, which have an impact on their operational characteristics. Continuous progress leads to new instruments appearing on the market. The current focus in analytical NIR spectroscopy is on the evaluation of the devices and associated methods, and to systematic characterization of their performance profiles.

A productive collaboration: W.&#8197;H. Perkin, Jr. (left) and R. Robinson (right) had perhaps the most productive and broad collaboration between a professor and one's student. Together, during and after Robinson's student days, they had 71 joint publications, 25 of which involved just the two of them, 17 of which involved the structure determination of strychnine, and eight of which were published after Perkin's death in 1929. This Essay examines the professional relationship of Perkin, Jr. and Robinson as revealed in their joint publications on the structure of strychnine.







Abstract
William Henry Perkin, Jr. FRS, the son of the inventor of mauve and other commercial dyes and credited for initiating the industrialization of chemistry, was himself a notable chemist. He was the Professor of Organic Chemistry at Manchester from 1892&#8211;1912 and then was the Waynflete Professor of Chemistry at Oxford and the first Head of the Dyson Perrins Laboratory from 1912&#8211;1929. One of Perkin's graduate students and research assistants at Manchester was Robert Robinson, subsequently Sir Robert Robinson, FRS and recipient of the 1947 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Perkin and Robinson had perhaps the most productive and broad collaboration between a professor and one's student. Together, during and after Robinson's student days, they had 71 joint publications, 25 of which involved just the two of them, 17 of which involved the structure determination of strychnine, and eight of which were published after Perkin's death in 1929. Upon Perkin's early death, Robinson succeeded him as the fourth Waynflete Professor of Chemistry at the Dyson Perrins Laboratory, Oxford University. This Essay will examine the professional relationship of Perkin, Jr. and Robinson as revealed in their joint publications on the structure of strychnine.

         <title>Characterizing Polyoxovanadate&#8208;Alkoxide Clusters Using Vanadium K&#8208;Edge X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>

Lindqvist iron&#8208;functionalized and hexavanadium polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide clusters were characterized by using V K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Substantial changes in the pre&#8208;edge peak intensities were observed that tracked with the V 3d&#8208;electron count. The data also suggested substantial delocalization between the vanadium cations. Meanwhile, the FeIII cations were electronically isolated from the polyoxovanadate core.







Abstract
A number of technologies would benefit from developing inorganic compounds and materials with specific electronic and magnetic exchange properties. Unfortunately, designing compounds with these properties is difficult because metal&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;metal coupling schemes are hard to predict and control. Fully characterizing communication between metals in existing compounds that exhibit interesting properties could provide valuable insight and advance those predictive capabilities. One such class of molecules are the series of Lindqvist iron&#8208;functionalized and hexavanadium polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide clusters, which we characterized here using V K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Substantial changes in the pre&#8208;edge peak intensities were observed that tracked with the V 3d&#8208;electron count. The data also suggested substantial delocalization between the vanadium cations. Meanwhile, the FeIII cations were electronically isolated from the polyoxovanadate core.

A cobalt catalyst was developed, which is nanostructured, reusable, and easy to handle. It mediates the selective reductive alkylation of nitriles with carbonyl compounds. The key to a broad scope and the tolerance of numerous functional groups, including hydrogenation sensitive examples, is the earth&#8208;abundant metal in combination with a porous N&#8208;doped SiC catalyst support material.







Abstract
The development of C&#8722;N bond formation reactions is highly desirable due to their importance in biology and chemistry. Recent progress in 3d metal catalysis is indicative of unique selectivity patterns that may permit solving challenges of chemical synthesis. We report here on a catalytic C&#8722;N bond formation reaction&#8212;the reductive alkylation of nitriles. Aldehydes or ketones and nitriles, all abundantly available and low&#8208;cost starting materials, undergo a reductive coupling to form secondary alkylamines and inexpensive hydrogen is used as the reducing agent. The reaction has a very broad scope and many functional groups, including hydrogenation&#8208;sensitive examples, are tolerated. We developed a novel cobalt catalyst, which is nanostructured, reusable, and easy to handle. The key seems the earth&#8208;abundant metal in combination with a porous support material, N&#8208;doped SiC, synthesized from acrylonitrile and a commercially available polycarbosilane.

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structure Revision of Halioxepine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1615-1619, January 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assemble and reassign: The first total synthesis of halioxepine is presented, along with a structural revision. Due to two stereoclusters separated by two methylene groups, there was some uncertainty about the relative configuration for halioxepine. Mismatched spectroscopic data for both suggested structures caused a new analysis and led to reassignment of the relative configuration between C10 and C15 (see figure).







Abstract
The first total synthesis of halioxepine is accomplished using a 1,4&#8208;addition for constructing the quaternary center at C10 and a halo etherification for the generation of the tertiary ether at C7. The correct structure of halioxepine was determined by assembling different enantiomeric building blocks and by changing the relative configuration between C10 and C15.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonded BODIPY Frameworks with Tunable Optical Features**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1603-1608, January 21, 2021. </description>

The importance of packing correctly: Here, we present the targeted design and synthesis of halogen bonding (XB)&#8208;mediated BODIPY supramolecular frameworks. The optical features of these frameworks, including the fluorescence intensity and optical band gap, were successfully tuned by XB&#8208;driven crystal packing.







Abstract
The ability to tune the optical features of BODIPY materials in the solid state is essential for their photorelated application and requires efficient control of the crystal packing. In this study, such control of BODIPY supramolecular assemblies was achieved by deliberate design and synthesis of a BODIPY containing a strong halogen&#8208;bond (XB) acceptor (&#8722;NO2) and donor (I, Br) to mediate XB interactions. The di&#8208;halogenated structures formed isostructural mono&#8208;coordinate motif B3, B4 (1D tubular structure) and symmetric bifurcated motif B4&#8208;II (1D zigzag chains structure) through N&#8722;O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I, Br XB interactions. These XB interactions promote singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet reverse intersystem crossing due to partial delocalization of oxygen electrons onto Br and I, which leads to unexpected fluorescence enhancement of B4&#8208;II. Finally, the indirect optical band gaps of B3, B4 and B4&#8208;II were amenable to tuning in the range of 1.85&#8211;2.50&#8201;&#8201;eV by XB&#8208;driven crystal packings.

Abstract
A novel metal&#8211;organic framework [Zn3(Ni&#8208;H2TPPP)(Ni&#8208;H4TPPP)(Ni&#8208;H5TPPP)&#8901;7(CH3)2NH2&#8901;DMF&#8901;7&#8201;H2O] (where Ni&#8208;HxTPPP (x=2,4,5) are partially deprotonated [5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(3&#8208;(phosphonatophenyl)&#8208;porphyrinato(2&#8208;))]nickel(II) species), IPCE&#8208;2Ni, with outstanding proton conductivity (1.0&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 75&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% relative humidity) has been obtained. The high concentration of free phosphonate groups and compensating dimethylammonium cations bound by hydrogen bonds in the unique crystal structure of IPCE&#8208;2Ni is a key factor responsible for the observed high proton conductivity, which is one order of magnitude higher than for the corresponding MOF based on 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;(phosphonatophenyl)porphyrinato(2&#8208;))]nickel(II) IPCE&#8208;1Ni and comparable with that of leaders among MOFs.

         <title>Ring Expansion of Thiolactams via Imide Intermediates: An Amino Acid Insertion Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 5, Page 1620-1625, January 21, 2021. </description>

Put a ring on it: AgI&#8208;promoted reaction of thiolactams and amino acids enables an insertion&#8208;ring expansion process of an amino acid into the thioamide bond to generate medium&#8208;sized heterocycles. Application to the site&#8208;specific insertion of amino acids into cyclic peptides is demonstrated.







Abstract
The AgI&#8208;promoted reaction of thiolactams with N&#8208;Boc amino acids yields an N&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;aminoacyl) lactam that can rearrange through an acyl transfer process. Boc&#8208;deprotection results in convergence to the ring&#8208;expanded adduct, thereby facilitating an overall insertion of an amino acid into the thioamide bond to generate medium&#8208;sized heterocycles. Application to the site&#8208;specific insertion of amino acids into cyclic peptides is demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Put a ring on it&lt;/b&gt;: Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;promoted reaction of thiolactams and amino acids enables an insertion&#8208;ring expansion process of an amino acid into the thioamide bond to generate medium&#8208;sized heterocycles. Application to the site&#8208;specific insertion of amino acids into cyclic peptides is demonstrated.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;promoted reaction of thiolactams with &lt;i&gt;N&#8208;&lt;/i&gt;Boc amino acids yields an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;aminoacyl) lactam that can rearrange through an acyl transfer process. Boc&#8208;deprotection results in convergence to the ring&#8208;expanded adduct, thereby facilitating an overall insertion of an amino acid into the thioamide bond to generate medium&#8208;sized heterocycles. Application to the site&#8208;specific insertion of amino acids into cyclic peptides is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

&#8220;The annulation of thiophene rings at the 2,3&#8208;positions imparts sufficient stability to the pentalene moieties even in the absence of bulky substituents, while retaining the pronounced antiaromatic character. This result is a stark contrast with the fact that the condensation of benzene rings diminishes the antiaromatic character of the resulting &#960;&#8208;electron systems.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;1638&#8197;ff.

         <title>Reactions of Late First&#8208;Row Transition Metal (Fe&#8211;Zn) Dichlorides with a PGeP Pincer Germylene</title>

         <dc:description>The reactivity of the PGeP germylene 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;isopropylphosphanylmethyl)&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyldipyrromethane&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;diylgermanium(II), Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  , with late first raw transition metal (Fe&#8211;Zn) dichlorides has been investigated. All reactions led to PGeP pincer chloridogermyl complexes.

While the iron complex maintains an intermediate spin state (S1; &#956;eff=3.0 &#956;B) over the temperature range 50&#8211;380 K, the cobalt complex presents a gradual spin crossover behavior (the magnetic moment varies linearly with temperature from 1.9 &#956;B  at 10 K to 3.6 &#956;B  at 380 K, the effective magnetic moment of the cobalt complex varies linearly with temperature from 1.9 &#956;B  at 10 K to 3.6 &#956;B  at 380 K, indicating a spin crossover behavior that involves  S1/2  (predominant at  T&lt;180 K) and  S3/2  (predominant at&#160;  T  &gt; 200 K). Both cobalt(II) species have been detected by EPR at  T&lt;20 K). The reaction of Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  with [NiCl2(dme)] (dme = dimethoxyethane) gave a square planar nickel(II) complex, [NiCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}], whereas the reaction with CuCl2  involved a redox process that rendered a mixture of the germanium(IV) compound GeCl2(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  and a binuclear copper(I) complex, [Cu2{&#956;&#8208;&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPi  Pr2)2CMe2}2  ], whose metal atoms are in tetrahedral environments.

         <title>Polymerization&#8208;Driven Photoluminescence in Alkanolamine&#8208;Based C&#8208;Dots</title>

On the dot: Unveiling the relation between structure and optical properties is one of the most intriguing challenges in polymeric carbon dots (CPDs). Most of CPDs present high quantum yields (QYs) but the structures are still under debate. In this work, a new type of CPDs from citric acid and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol with a QY of 80&#8201;% and the correlation of the fluorescence efficiency with the structure are discussed.







Abstract
Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs), a peculiar type of carbon dots, show extremely high quantum yields, making them very attractive nanostructures for application in optics and biophotonics. The origin of the strong photoluminescence of CPDs resides in a complicated interplay of several radiative mechanisms. To understand the correlation between CPD processing and properties, the early stage formation of carbonized polymer dots has been studied. In the synthesis, citric acid monohydrate and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol have been thermally degraded at 180&#8201;&#176;C. The use of an oil bath instead of a more traditional hydrothermal reactor has allowed the CPD properties to be monitored at different reactions times. Transmission electron microscopy, time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and Raman spectroscopy have revealed the formation of polymeric species with amide and ester bonds. Quantum chemistry calculations have been employed to investigate the origin of CPD electronic transitions. At short reaction times, amorphous C&#8208;dots with 80&#8201;% quantum yield, have been obtained.

         <title>Synthesis of Carbapenems Containing Peptidoglycan Mimetics and Inhibition of the Cross&#8208;Linking Activity of a Transpeptidase of l,d Specificity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Main and side chains mimetics: A synthetic route to carbapenems modified at position C8 was developed to assess the impact of mimetics of the main and side chains of peptidoglycan precursors on cross&#8208;linking activity of l,d&#8208;transpeptidase from E. faecium. Substitution at position C8 can be therefore used to modulate the properties of carbapenem without deleterious effects on the efficacy of l,d&#8208;transpeptidase inhibition.







Abstract
The carbapenem class of &#946;&#8208;lactams has been optimized against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria producing extended&#8208;spectrum &#946;&#8208;lactamases by introducing substituents at position C2. Carbapenems are currently investigated for the treatment of tuberculosis as these drugs are potent covalent inhibitors of l,d&#8208;transpeptidases involved in mycobacterial cell wall assembly. The optimization of carbapenems for inactivation of these unusual targets is sought herein by exploiting the nucleophilicity of the C8 hydroxyl group to introduce chemical diversity. As &#946;&#8208;lactams are structure analogs of peptidoglycan precursors, the substituents were chosen to increase similarity between the drug and the substrate. Fourteen peptido&#8208;carbapenems were efficiently synthesized. They were more effective than the reference drug, meropenem, owing to the positive impact of a phenethylthio substituent introduced at position C2 but the peptidomimetics added at position C8 did not further improve the activity. Thus, position C8 can be modified to modulate the pharmacokinetic properties of highly efficient carbapenems.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Study on the Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydrofunctionalization of Olefins Using Glycine&#8208;Extended AQ&#8208;Auxiliaries</title>

Understanding the hydrofunctionalization: A tridentate ligand bearing a quinoline, aryl amide and alkyl amine moieties is highly&#8208;reactive for the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of tethered unactivated olefins, allowing reactions at temperatures as low as 25&#8201;&#176;C, while its regioisomer with the amide carbonyl transposed only one position away shows limited reactivity. This experimental and computational study explores the scope of this reaction and demonstrates how the Pd&#8208;substrate complexes employ various favorable or unfavorable protonation states during the mechanism.







Abstract
Two similar tridentate directing groups derived from glycine and 8&#8208;aminoquinoline were shown to enable the palladium&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of 4&#8208;pentenylamine with drastically different efficiencies. A computational investigation into the origin of the reactivity difference between these isomeric, carbonyl&#8208;transposed auxiliaries suggests that protonation state, thus charge of the substrate&#8208;metal complex prior to nucleopalladation is key. These investigations have culminated in a directing group design that can undergo Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization under relatively mild conditions, as low as room temperature.

         <title>Isolation and Structural Determination of a Hexacoordinated Antimony(V) Dication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How unusual! A rare hexacoordinated dication of SbV has been synthesized (see scheme). This [12&#8211;Sb&#8211;6]2+ species exhibits remarkable stability due to the synergistic kinetic and thermodynamic stabilization provided by donor&#8211;acceptor interactions with its 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)phenyl ligands. This dicationic species preferentially adopts a meridional form both in solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
The hexacoordinated antimony(V) dication [(ppy)3Sb]2+ ([1]2+; ppy=2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)phenyl), stabilized by three intramolecular donor&#8211;acceptor interactions, has been isolated as its hexachloroantimonate salt [1][SbCl6]2, prepared by the oxidative addition of chlorine to the neutral stibine [(ppy)3Sb] (1), followed by the abstraction of chloride. Air&#8208;stable [1][SbCl6]2 exhibits remarkable thermal stability and the three ppy ligands on the antimony atom are shown to be magnetically inequivalent in the 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR spectra. A hexacoordinated, meridional octahedral bonding geometry has been determined for [1][SbCl6]2 by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Theoretical calculations were performed to investigate why the meridional form was generated preferentially over the facial form. In addition, the dynamics of the ppy ligands were investigated by variable&#8208;temperature 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The potential to generate dications by using a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reagent has also been investigated. The dication [1]2+ is the first [12&#8211;Sb&#8211;6]2+ chemical species to have been structurally determined.

         <title>From Carbohydrates to Complex Organofluorines: Synthesis, Conformation, and Lipophilicity of Multivicinal&#8208;Fluorine&#8208;Containing Hexitol Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet organofluorines: Multi&#8208;vicinally fluorinated hexitol analogues have been synthesized. The solution and solid&#8208;state conformations of trifluorohexitol analogues were uncovered, and the stereochemistry of the fluorine atoms was found to show a preferential gauche effect, avoiding repulsive 1,3&#8208;interactions. Finally, the log&#8201;P values of a large set of polyfluorohexitols were obtained by using 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
There is growing interest in the preparation of fluorine&#8208;containing organic molecules. Multivicinal&#8208;fluorine analogues are among the most intriguing and promising compounds, but their physical and biological investigations are held back by challenging syntheses. Herein, we report on the synthesis of a large set of novel polyfluorohexitols. The dominant solution&#8208;state conformation of all trifluorohexitols was determined, and the solid&#8208;state conformations of some analogues were compared. Finally, the lipophilicity of a large set of polyfluorinated hexopyranose and hexitol analogues was attributed by using a log&#8201;P determination method based on 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>How Oriented External Electric Fields Modulate Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's electrifying! Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital theory is employed for the first time to rationalize how a judiciously directed oriented external electric field can steer the reactivity and selectivity of a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction. These results provide a toolbox for the design of novel electric&#8208;field&#8208;catalyzed organic reactions.







Abstract
A judiciously oriented external electric field (OEEF) can catalyze a wide range of reactions and can even induce endo/exo stereoselectivity of cycloaddition reactions. The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride is studied by using quantitative activation strain and Kohn&#8211;Sham molecular orbital theory to pinpoint the origin of these catalytic and stereoselective effects. Our quantitative model reveals that an OEEF along the reaction axis induces an enhanced electrostatic and orbital interaction between the reactants, which in turn lowers the reaction barrier. The stronger electrostatic interaction originates from an increased electron density difference between the reactants at the reactive center, and the enhanced orbital interaction arises from the promoted normal electron demand donor&#8211;acceptor interaction driven by the OEEF. An OEEF perpendicular to the plane of the reaction axis solely stabilizes the exo pathway of this reaction, whereas the endo pathway remains unaltered and efficiently steers the endo/exo stereoselectivity. The influence of the OEEF on the inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is also investigated; unexpectedly, it inhibits the reaction, as the electric field now suppresses the critical inverse electron demand donor&#8211;acceptor interaction.

         <title>Understanding the C&#8722;F Bond Activation Mediated by Frustrated Lewis Pairs: Crucial Role of Non&#8208;covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;F activation: The activation of single C&#8722;F bonds in di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl groups mediated by frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) exhibits a peculiar cooperative action, which is markedly different from related FLP&#8208;mediated processes, and where non&#8208;covalent interactions established between the Lewis base and the substrate play a decisive role.







Abstract
The activation of a single C&#8722;F bond in di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl groups by frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) has been computationally explored by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. It is found that in this activation reaction the FLP partners exhibit a peculiar cooperative action, which is markedly different from related FLP&#8208;mediated processes, and where non&#8208;covalent interactions established between the Lewis base and the substrate play a decisive role. In addition, the process proceeds through the intermediacy of a hypervalent species featuring a pentacoordinate carbon atom, which is rare in the chemistry of FLPs. The physical factors controlling this process as well as the bonding situation of these hypervalent intermediates have been quantitatively analyzed in detail by using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods to not only rationalize the mechanism of the transformation but also to guide experimentalists towards the realization of these so far elusive hypervalent systems.

         <title>Nonclassical Abramov Products Formed on Orifices of Cage&#8208;Opened C60 Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleophilic addition of phosphites to a cage&#8208;opened fullerene C60 derivative gave &#945;&#8208;hydrophosphates and enol phosphates as kinetic and thermodynamic products, respectively. Different from classical Abramov reactions, which give phosphonates bearing a P&#8722;C bond, these products possess a P&#8722;O bond. Theoretical calculations suggested that the charge delocalization of zwitterionic intermediates along with the &#960;&#8208;framework facilitate the phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement, thus forming nonclassical Abramov products. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Murata et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202004035).

         <title>Single point mutant inverts stereoselectivity of a carbonyl reductase toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with enhanced activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme stereoselectivity control is still a major challenge. To gain insight into the molecular basis of enzyme stereo&#8208;recognition and expand the source of anti&#8208;Prelog carbonyl reductase toward  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters, the rational design aiming at stereoselectivity inversion was performed. The designed variant Q139G switched the enzyme stereoselectivity toward  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters from Prelog to anti&#8208;Prelog, providing corresponding alcohols in high enantiomeric purity (89.1%&#8208;99.1% ee). More importantly, the well&#8208;known trade&#8208;off between stereoselectivity and activity was not found. Q139G exhibited higher catalytic activity than the wildtype enzyme, the enhancement of the catalytic efficiency (  k  cat  /  K  m  ) varied from 1.1&#8208; to 27.1&#8208;fold. Interestingly, the mutant Q139G did not lead to reversed stereoselectivity toward aromatic ketones. Analysis of enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes showed that the structural flexibility of  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters and a newly formed cave together facilitated the formation of the anti&#8208;Prelog&#8208;preferred conformation. In contrast, the relatively large and rigid structure of the aromatic ketones prevents them from forming the anti&#8208;Prelog&#8208;preferred conformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Properties of a Novel Indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole Diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes the synthesis and properties of a dicyanomethylene&#8208;susbtituted indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole diradical  ICz&#8208;CN.This quinoidal system dimerises almost completely to (ICz&#8208;CN)2  containing two long C(sp3 )&#8208;C(sp  3) &#963;&#8208;bonds between the dicyanomethylene units . The minor open&#8208;shell ICz&#8208;CN component in the solid state mixture was identify with EPR spectroscopy. The cyclic voltammetric and UV&#8208;vis spectroelectrochemical data, and comparison with reference monomer  ICz&#8208;Br  reveal that the nature of the one&#8208;electron oxidation of (ICz&#8208;CN)2  at ambient temperature and  ICz&#8208;CN  at elevated temperature is very similar in all these compounds due to the prevailing localization of their HOMO on the  ICz  backbone. The involvement of the dicyanomethylene groups stabilizes the close&#8208;lying LUMO and LUMO+1 of (ICz&#8208;CN)  2  and especially  ICz&#8208;CN  compared to  ICz&#8208;Br  , resulting in the distinctive cathodic behaviour at low overpotentials. Differently from neutral  ICz&#8208;CN  , its radical anion and dianion are remarkably stable at ambient conditions. The UV&#8208;Vis(&#8208;NIR) electronic transitions in parent (  ICz&#8208;CN  )  2  and  ICz&#8208;CN  and their different redox forms have been assigned with the aid of TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The s&#8208;bond cleavage in neutral (  ICz&#8208;CN  )  2  is achieved in solution and in the solid&#8208;state upon soft external stimuli (time, temperature, pressure), showing a strong chromism from light yellow to blue&#8210;green. Notably, in solid state, the predominant formation of the monomeric diradical species is achieved under high hydrostatic pressure conditions (&gt;1 GPa).</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorides of silver under large compression</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The silver&#8208;fluorine phase diagram has been scrutinized as a function of external pressure using theoretical methods. Our results indicate that two novel stoichiometries containing Ag  +  and Ag  2+  cations (Ag  3  F  4  and Ag  2  F  3  ) are thermodynamically stable at ambient and low pressure. Both are computed to be magnetic semiconductors at ambient pressure conditions. For Ag  2  F  5  , containing both Ag  2+  and Ag  3+  , we find that strong 1D antiferromagnetic coupling is retained throughout the pressure&#8208;induced phase transition sequence up to 65 GPa. Our calculations show that throughout the entire pressure range of their stability the mixed valence fluorides preserve a finite band gap at the Fermi level. We also confirm the possibility of synthesizing AgF  4  as a paramagnetic compound at high pressure. Our results indicate that this compound is metallic in its thermodynamic stability region. Finally, we present general considerations on the thermodynamic stability of mixed valence compounds of silver at high pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Separation of xylene isomers in the anion&#8208;pillared square grid material SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8209;Cu</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Xylene isomer separation is considered one of the seven separation challenges that changed the world. In addition, the high&#8208;energy demand of xylene separation highlights the need for efficient novel adsorbents. Herein, the liquid&#8208;phase separation potential of the anion&#8208;pillared hybrid material SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu was studied for preferential adsorption of o&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene over p&#8208;xylene, which was inspired by a previous complexation crystallization method for separating m&#8208;xylene. We report detailed experimental liquid&#8208;phase adsorption experiments, yielding selectivities of 3.0 for o&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene and 2.6 for m&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene. Our theoretical calculations thus provide a reasonable explanation that the xylene adsorption selectivity is attributed to the C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;F interaction, and the host&#8208;guest interaction order agrees with the adsorption priority: o&#8208;xylene &gt; m&#8208;xylene &gt; p&#8208;xylene.</dc:description>

Our theoretical calculations thus provide a reasonable explanation that the xylene adsorption selectivity is attributed to the C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;F interaction, and the host&#8208;guest interaction order agrees with the adsorption priority: o&#8208;xylene &amp;gt; m&#8208;xylene &amp;gt; p&#8208;xylene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Development of Guanidinate and Amidinate Based Cerium and Ytterbium Complexes as Atomic Layer Deposition Precursors: Synthesis, Modeling, and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic engineering of Ce and Yb based amidinate and guanidinate complexes resulted in precursors suitable for atomic layer deposition (ALD) applications. Computational modeling reveals the reactivity of the complexes towards water and oxygen. A water assisted ALD process for the growth of CeO2 thin films was demonstrated with the Ce tris&#8208;guanidinate precursor.







Abstract
Owing to the limited availability of suitable precursors for vapor phase deposition of rare&#8208;earth containing thin&#8208;film materials, new or improved precursors are sought after. In this study, we explored new precursors for atomic layer deposition (ALD) of cerium (Ce) and ytterbium (Yb) containing thin films. A series of homoleptic tris&#8208;guanidinate and tris&#8208;amidinate complexes of cerium (Ce) and ytterbium (Yb) were synthesized and thoroughly characterized. The C&#8208;substituents on the N&#8208;C&#8208;N backbone (Me, NMe2, NEt2, where Me=methyl, Et=ethyl) and the N&#8208;substituents from symmetrical iso&#8208;propyl (iPr) to asymmetrical tertiary&#8208;butyl (tBu) and Et were systematically varied to study the influence of the substituents on the physicochemical properties of the resulting compounds. Single crystal structures of [Ce(dpdmg)3] 1 and [Yb(dpdmg)3] 6 (dpdmg=N,N'&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;dimethylamido&#8208;guanidinate) highlight a monomeric nature in the solid&#8208;state with a distorted trigonal prismatic geometry. The thermogravimetric analysis shows that the complexes are volatile and emphasize that increasing asymmetry in the complexes lowers their melting points while reducing their thermal stability. Density functional theory (DFT) was used to study the reactivity of amidinates and guanidinates of Ce and Yb complexes towards oxygen (O2) and water (H2O). Signified by the DFT calculations, the guanidinates show an increased reactivity toward water compared to the amidinate complexes. Furthermore, the Ce complexes are more reactive compared to the Yb complexes, indicating even a reactivity towards oxygen potentially exploitable for ALD purposes. As a representative precursor, the highly reactive [Ce(dpdmg)3] 1 was used for proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle ALD depositions of CeO2 thin films using water as co&#8208;reactant. The self&#8208;limited ALD growth process could be confirmed at 160&#8201;&#176;C with polycrystalline cubic CeO2 films formed on Si(100) substrates. This study confirms that moving towards nitrogen&#8208;coordinated rare&#8208;earth complexes bearing the guanidinate and amidinate ligands can indeed be very appealing in terms of new precursors for ALD of rare earth based materials.

         <title>Synthesis and biological activity of ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl analogues of etoposide &#8211; discovery of a novel dual inhibitor of topoisomerase II activity and tubulin polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two series of the ferrocenyl and ruthenocenyl analogues of etoposide bearing 1,2,3&#8208;triazolyl or aminoalkyl linker were synthesized and evaluated for their cytotoxic properties, influence on the cell cycle, ability to induce tubulin polymerization and inhibition of topoisomerase II activity. We found that the replacement of etoposide carbohydrate moiety by metallocenyl group lead to organometallic conjugates exhibiting differentiated antiproliferative activity. Biological studies demonstrated that two ferrocenylalkylamino conjugates were notably more active than etoposide with submicromolar or low&#8208;micromolar IC50  &#160;values towards SW620, etoposide&#8208;resistant SW620E and methotrexate&#8208;resistant SW620M cancer cell lines. Moreover, the simplest ferrocenylmethylamino conjugate exerted dual inhibitory action against tubulin polymerization and topoisomerase II activity while other studied compounds affected only topoisomerase II activity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Chromium(III)&#8208;based Metallacrowns complete this class of compounds important in molecular recognition, catalysis, and magneto chemistry. While metallacrowns are usually built via self&#8208;assembly reactions, the solvothermal reaction paves the way for new kinetically and thermodynamically stable metallacrowns.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal Carbides as Hydrogen Evolution Reduction Electrocatalysts: Synthetic Methods and Optimization Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbides in catalysis: Electrochemical water splitting provides a promising strategy for effective and sustainable hydrogen production through renewable electricity, and one of the immediate challenges is the availability of low&#8208;cost and efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Transition&#8208;metal carbides (TMCs) show catalytic properties resembling the platinum group noble metals, attracting intensive attention for prospective industrial electrochemical water splitting. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in the preparation and modification of TMC electrocatalysts toward high&#8208;performance HER.







Abstract
With the strengths of zero carbon emission and high gravimetric energy density, hydrogen energy is recognized as a primary choice for future energy supply. Electrochemical water splitting provides a promising strategy for effective and sustainable hydrogen production through renewable electricity, and one of the immediate challenges toward its large&#8208;scale application is the availability of low&#8208;cost and efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Given the enormous efforts in the exploration of potential transition&#8208;metal carbide (TMC) electrocatalysts, this review aims to summarize the recent advances in synthetic methods and optimization strategies of TMC electrocatalysts. Additionally, the perspectives for the development of novel efficient TMC&#8208;based catalysts are also proposed.

         <dc:description>We report on the polymorphism in helical nanofilament (HNF, B  4  ) liquid crystal (LC) phase depending on the fabrication methods, here UV light&#8208;driven formation and templated assisted self&#8208;assembly in the nanoconfined geometries. As a result, uniaxially oriented HNFs with different helical structures are obtained, in which the polymorphs, twisted ribbon, and cylindrical ribbon are generated to show even molecular lattice has a different orientation. The detailed structures are directly observed using scanning electron microscopy and grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation. Our resultant polymorph would be used in the chiro&#8208;optical applications due to the capability of fine control of the helical structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Approaches to the Synthesis of Perfluoroalkyl&#8208;Modified Carbohydrates and Derivatives: thiosugars, iminosugars, and tetrahydro(thio)pyrans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates play relevant roles in diverse areas such as supramolecular chemistry, glycoconjugation, liquid crystals and surfactants, with direct applications as wetting, antifreeze, and coating agents. In the light of these promising properties, new methodologies for the late&#8208;stage incorporation of fluoroalkyl R  F  groups into carbohydrates and derivatives are herein presented as they became relevant to the synthetic carbohydrate community. Previously reviewed protocols for the installation of R  F  groups onto carbohydrates and derivatives will be succinctly summarized in the light of the new achievements. Fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars, on the other hand, are also interesting glycomimetic derivatives with prominent roles as glycosidases and glycosyltransferases inhibitors, as has recently been demonstrated. Also, they positively contribute to the study of sugar&#8208;protein interactions and enzyme mechanisms. New advances in the syntheses of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted iminosugars will also be presented here.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure High&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Mixed Nitridosilicatephosphates and Luminescence of AESiP3N7:Eu2+ (AE = Sr, Ba)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahedra based nitrides with network structures have emerged as versatile materials with a broad spectrum of properties and applications. Both nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates are well&#8208;known examples of such nitrides which upon doping with Eu  2+  exhibit intriguing luminescence properties that make them attractive for applications. Nitridosilicates and nitridophosphates show manifold structural variability, however, no mixed nitridosilicatephosphates except SiPN  3  and SiP  2  N  4  NH have been described so far. The compounds  AE  SiP  3  N  7  (  AE  = Sr, Ba) were synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach using the multianvil technique (8 GPa, 1400 &#8211; 1700 &#176;C) starting from the respective alkaline earth azides and the binary nitrides P  3  N  5  and Si  3  N  4  . The latter were activated by NH  4  F, probably acting as a mineralizing agent. SrSiP  3  N  7  and BaSiP  3  N  7  were obtained as single crystals. They crystallize in the barylite&#8208;1  O  (  M  = Sr) and barylite&#8208;2  O  structure types (  M  = Ba), respectively, with P and Si being occupationally disordered. Cation disorder is further supported by solid&#8208;state NMR and EDX mapping of BaSiP  3  N  7  with atomic resolution. Upon doping with Eu  2+  , both compounds show blue emission under UV excitation.</dc:description>

         <title>MODs vs NPs: vying for the future of printed electronics.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This Minireview compares two distinct ink types, namely metal&#8208;organic decomposition (MOD) or nanoparticle (NP) formulations, for use in the printing of some of the most conductive elements: silver, copper and aluminium. Printing of highly conductive features has found purpose across a broad array of electronics and as processing times and temperatures reduce, the avenues of application expand to low&#8208;cost flexible substrates, materials for wearable devices and beyond. Printing techniques such as screen, aerosol jet and inkjet printing are scalable, solution&#8208;based processes that historically have employed NP formulations to achieve low resistivity coatings printed at high resolution. Since the turn of the century, the rise in MOD inks has vastly extended the range of potentially applicable compounds that can be printed, whilst simultaneously addressing shelf life and sintering issues. A brief introduction to the field and requirements of an ink will be presented followed by a detailed discussion of a wide array of synthetic routes to both MOD and NP inks. Unindustrialized materials will be discussed, with the challenges and outlook considered for the market leaders: silver and copper, in comparison with the emerging field of aluminium inks.</dc:description>

         <title>Specific Ion&#8208;Protein Interactions Influence Bacterial Ice Nucleation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ice nucleation&#8208;active bacteria are the most efficient ice nucleators known, enabling the crystallization of water at temperatures close to 0 &#730;C, and thereby overcoming the kinetically hindered phase transition process at these conditions. Using highly&#8208;specialized ice&#8208;nucleating proteins (INPs), they can cause frost damage to plants and influence the formation of clouds and precipitation in the atmosphere. In nature, the bacteria are usually found in aqueous environments containing ions. The impact of ions on bacterial ice nucleation efficiency, however, has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that ions can profoundly influence the efficiency of bacterial ice nucleators in a manner that follows the Hofmeister series. Weakly hydrated ions inhibit bacterial ice nucleation, whereas strongly hydrated ions apparently facilitate ice nucleation. Surface&#8208;specific sum&#8208;frequency generation spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the different effects are due to specific interactions of the ions with the INPs on the surface of the bacteria. Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous ice nucleation facilitated by bacteria is strongly dependent upon the nature of the ions, and specific ion&#8208;protein interactions are essential for the complete description of heterogeneous ice nucleation by bacteria.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal structure and ferroelectric evidences of BaZnSi3O8 low&#8208;permittivity microwave dielectric ceramic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic was prepared via the conventional solid&#8208;state method and sintered at 1100 &#176;C. XRD and synchrotron Rietveld refinement analyses revealed the BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic presented monoclinic structure with a space group of P  2 1  /a (No.14), which was reported for the first time. The BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic presented a weak ferroelectricity, which was confirmed by the P&#8208;E  loop and the 90&#176; nanoscale ferroelectric domain. Although &#949;  r  &#8208; T  displayed two &#949;  r  abnormal peaks at 400 &#176;C and 460 &#176;C, the Curie temperature ( T  &#173; c  ) was located at 460 &#176;C according to the dielectric loss and Curie&#8211;Weiss law. Moreover, the BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic exhibited optimised microwave dielectric properties with &#949;  r  = 6.55, Q  &#215; f  = 52400 GHz, and &#964; f  = &#8722;24.5 ppm/&#176;C. Hence, the BaZnSi 3  O 8  ceramic in the ternary BaO&#8211;ZnO&#8211;SiO 2  system possessed both weak ferroelectricity and microwave dielectric properties. These results are expected to break the technical barrier of ferroelectric phase shifter applications in microwave and even millimeter&#8208;wave frequency bands.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembling catalytic peptide&#160;nanomaterials capable of highly efficient peroxidase activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of short peptides gives rise to versatile nanomaterials capable of promoting efficient catalysis. We have shown that short, seven&#8208;residue peptides bind hemin to produce functional catalytic materials displaying highly efficient peroxidation activity, reaching a catalytic efficiency of 3 x 10  5  &#160;M  &#8208;1&#160;  s  &#8208;1  . Self&#8208;assembly is essential for catalysis as non&#8208;assembling controls show no activity. We have also observed peroxidase activity even in the absence of hemin, suggesting the potential to alter redox properties of substrates upon association with the assemblies. These results demonstrate the practical utility of self&#8208;assembled peptides in various catalytic applications and further support the evolutionary link between amyloids and modern&#8208;day enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic zinc hydrides catalyzed CO2 reduction to formate: Deciphering elementary reactions, isolation of intermediates and computational investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc has been an element of choice for carbon dioxide reduction in recent years. Zinc compounds have been showcased as catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrosilylation and hydroboration. The extent of carbon dioxide reduction can depend on various factors, including electrophilicity at the zinc centre and the denticity of the ancillary ligands. In a few cases, the addition of Lewis acids to zinc hydride catalysts markedly influences CO  2  reduction. We have investigated these factors by exploring elementary reactions of CO  2  hydrosilylation and hydroboration using cationic zinc hydrides bearing the tetradentate tris[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine and the tridentate N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine in the presence of triphenylborane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane.</dc:description>

We have investigated these factors by exploring elementary reactions of CO  2  hydrosilylation and hydroboration using cationic zinc hydrides bearing the tetradentate tris[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]amine and the tridentate N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine in the presence of triphenylborane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogenation of secondary amides using phosphane oxide and frustrated Lewis pair catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenation of secondary carboxylic acid amides is developed. The reduction is realized by two new catalytic reactions. First, the amide is converted into the imidoyl chloride by triphosgene (CO(OCCl3)2) using novel phosphorus(V) catalysts. Second, the in situ generated imidoyl chlorides are hydrogenated in high yields by an FLP&#8208;catalyst. Mechanistic and quantum mechanical calculations support an autoinduced catalytic cycle for the hydrogenation with chloride acting as unusual Lewis base for FLP&#8208;mediated H2&#8208;activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined, Versatile and Recyclable Half&#8208;Sandwich Nickelacarborane Catalyst for Selective Carbene Transfer Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic carbene&#8208;transfer reactions constitute a class of highly useful transformations in organic synthesis. Although catalysts based on a range of transition&#8208;metals have been reported, the readily accessible nickel(II)&#8208;based complexes have been rarely used. Herein, an air&#8208;stable nickel(II)&#8208;carborane complex is reported as a well&#8208;defined, versatile and recyclable catalyst for selective carbene transfer reactions with low catalyst loading under mild conditions. This catalyst is effective for several types of reactions including diastereoselective cyclopropanation, epoxidation, selective X&#8722;H insertions (X = C, N, O, S, Si), particularly for the unprotected substrates. This represents a rare example of carborane ligands in base metal catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A comparative study on the photophysical properties of anthocyanins and pyranoanthocyanins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anthocyanins and pyranoanthocyanins are flavonoids that are present in various food products (e.g. fruit, vegetables, wine, etc.). The large chemical diversity amongst these molecules leads to compound specific properties such as color and stability towards external conditions. These properties are also attractive for food and non&#8208;food applications. The photophysical experimental characterization is not easy as this generally demands advanced analytical techniques along with optimized separation procedures. Molecular modeling can provide insights into the fundamental understanding of the photophysical properties of these compounds in a uniform way for a broad set of compounds. However, the current literature is quite fragmented on this topic. Herein, a large set of 140 naturally derived anthocyanins was evaluated in a systematic way with three functionals (B3LYP, PBE0 and CAM&#8208;B3LYP). The accuracy of these functionals was determined with experimental literature &#955;  max,vis  &#8208;values. Next to &#955;  max,vis  &#8208;values, TD&#8208;DFT calculations also provided oscillator strengths, molar absorption coefficients and orbital energies, which define whether specific natural anthocyanin&#8208;based compounds can be deployed in food and non&#8208;food applications such as food additives/colorants, textile dyeing, analytical standards and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Nickel(II)&#8208;Mediated Thiocarbonylation as a Direct Route to Isotopically Labeled Aliphatic Carboxamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of pharmaceutically relevant small molecules and biopharmaceuticals bearing aliphatic carboxamides have been successfully labeled with carbon&#8208;13. Key to the success of this novel carbon isotope labeling technique is the observation that 13C&#8208;labeled NiII&#8208;acyl complexes, formed from a 13CO insertion step with NiII&#8208;alkyl intermediates, rapidly react in less than one minute with 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl disulfide to quantitatively form the corresponding 2&#8208;pyridyl thioesters. Either the use of 13C&#8208;SilaCOgen or 13C&#8208;COgen allows for the stoichiometric addition of isotopically labeled carbon monoxide. Subsequent one&#8208;pot acylation of a series of structurally diverse amines provides the desired 13C&#8208;labeled carboxamides in good yields. A single electron transfer pathway is proposed between the NiII&#8208;acyl complexes and the disulfide providing a reactive NiIII&#8208;acyl sulfide intermediate, which rapidly undergoes reductive elimination to the desired thioester. By further optimization of the reaction parameters, reaction times down to only 11 min. were identified, opening up the possibility of exploring this chemistry for carbon&#8208;11 isotope labeling. Finally, this isotope labeling strategy could be adapted&#160; to the synthesis of 13C&#8208;labeled liraglutide and insulin degludec, representing two antidiabetic drugs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The f&#8208;block chemistry of phospholyl and arsolyl ligands, heavier p&#8208;block analogues of substituted cyclopentadienyls (Cp  R  , C  5  R  5  ) where one or more CR groups are replaced by P or As atoms, is less developed than for lighter isoelectronic C  5  R  5  rings. Heterocyclopentadienyl complexes can exhibit properties that complement and contrast with Cp  R  chemistry. Given that there has been renewed interest in phospholyl and arsolyl f&#8208;block chemistry in the last two decades, coinciding with a renaissance in f&#8208;block solution chemistry, a review of this field is timely. Here we cover the syntheses of all structurally characterised examples of lanthanide and actinide phospholyl and arsolyl complexes to date, including benzannulated derivatives, and together with group 3 complexes for completeness. We review the physicochemical properties of these complexes, with the intention of motivating further research into this field.</dc:description>

         <title>The Developments in the Dehydrogenative Electrochemical Synthesis of 3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;Tetramethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The symmetric biphenol 3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol (  2  ) is a well&#8208;known ligand building block and is used in transition&#8208;metal catalysis. In the literature, there are several synthetic routes for the preparation of this exceptional molecule. In this review article we focus on the sustainable electrochemical synthesis of  2  . Here, we provide a brief overview of the developmental history of this inconspicuous molecule, which is of great interest for technical application but reveals many challenges in its synthesis. The electro&#8208;organic method is a powerful, sustainable, and efficient alternative to conventional synthesis to obtain this symmetric biphenol up to a kg&#8208;scale. Another section of this article is devoted to different process management strategies in batch&#8208;type and flow electrolysis and their respective advantages.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Coupling of (Fluoro)&#8208;Pyridines by Linear 3d&#8208;Metal(I) Silylamides of Cr &#8211; Co: A Tale of C&#8211;C Bond Formation, C&#8211;F Bond Cleavage and a Pyridyl Radical Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this manuscript the facile reduction of pyridine (and derivatives) by linear metal(I) silylamides of chromium to iron is disclosed. This results in intermolecular C&#8722;C coupling giving dinuclear metal(II) complexes bearing a bridging 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dihydropyridyl ligand. For iron we demonstrate that the C&#8722;C coupling is reversible in solution, either directly or by reaction with substrates, via a presumed monomeric metal(II) pyridyl radical anion. In due process the isomerisation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene is observed, leading to benzene, cyclohexadiene and 1,3&#8208;cyclo&#8211;hexadiene. Further, deliberate formation and structural characterisation of a non&#8208;3d&#8208;metal bound pyridyl radical anion is presented. Employing perfluoropyridine C&#8722;F bond cleavage takes place under formation of metal(II) fluoride complexes of manganese, iron and cobalt as well as the homocoupling or reductive degradation of the substrate. In case of cobalt, the use of lesser fluorinated pyridines leads to C&#8722;F bond cleavage but no homocoupling. Overall, we give insights on the multifaceted behaviour of simple (fluoro)pyridines in the presence of moderately to highly reducing metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Solar Thermal Batteries through Combination of Magnetic Nanoparticle Catalysts and Tailored Norbornadiene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the immobilization of cobalt catalysts on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles for the preparation of highly active quasi&#8209;homogeneous catalysts towards an efficient release of photochemically stored energy in norbornadiene based photoswitches. The facile separation of the iron oxide nanoparticles,  via  the intrinsic magnetic properties of this material enables efficient cyclization of energy storage and release. Through the transition from cobalt (II) salphen to cobalt porphyrins we achieved a 22.6&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of the QC&#8208;NBD back&#8209;conversion&#160;with an initial TOF of up to 3.64 s  &#8208;1  and excellent TON of over 3305. In addition, we prepared a series of novel &#8220;push&#8208;pull&#8221; functionalized norbornadiene derivatives that feature excellent absorption properties with maxima up to 366&#160;nm, quantum yields around 70&#160;%, high energy storage capacities of up to 98.4&#160;kJ/mol and outstanding thermal stability with T  1/2  &#160;(25&#160;&#176;C) over 100 days. Finally, we harnessed the energy storage potential of these MOST systems in a heat release experiment. This demonstrates the potential of norbornadiene based photoswitches in combination with efficient magnetic catalysts for the generation of environmentally benign process heat.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Lanthanide&#8208;to&#8208;Lanthanide Energy Transfer in a Family of Site&#8208;Resolved [Ln(III)Ln(III)&#8217;] Heterodimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ligand H  3  L (6&#8208;(3&#8208;oxo&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)propionyl)&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid), which exhibits two different coordination pockets, has been exploited to engender and study energy transfer (ET) in two dinuclear [Ln(III)Ln(III)&#8217;] analogues of interest, [EuYb] and [NdYb]. Their structural and physical properties have been compared with the also newly synthesised analogues featuring no possible ET ([EuLu], [NdLu] and [GdYb], respectively) and with the corresponding homometallic [EuEu] and [NdNd] analogues, previously reported. Photophysical data suggest that ET between Eu(III) and Yb(III) does not occur to a significant extent, while emission from Yb(III) originates via sensitization from the ligand. In contrast, energy migration seems to be occurring between the two Nd(III) centers in [NdNd], as well as in [NdYb], where Yb(III) luminescence is thus in part sensitised by ET from Nd. This study shows the versatility of this molecular platform to further the investigation of lanthanide&#8208;to&#8208;lanthanide ET phenomena in defined molecular systems.</dc:description>
