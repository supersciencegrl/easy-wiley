         <title>Responsive Surfactant&#8208;Driven Morphology Transformation of Block Copolymer Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Block copolymer (BCP) microparticles, which exhibit rapid change of morphology and physicochemical property in response to external stimuli, represent a promising avenue for the development of programmable smart materials. Among the methods available for generating BCP microparticles with adjustable morphologies, the confined assembly of BCPs within emulsions has emerged as a particularly facile and versatile approach. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the role of responsive surfactants in modulating interfacial interactions at the oil&#8208;water interface, which facilitates controlled BCP microparticle morphology. We elucidate how variations in the properties of responsive surfactants, activated by external stimuli, influence BCP chain arrangement and interfacial selectivity. Additionally, this review explores the applications of shape&#8208;switchable microparticles in advanced technologies such as smart display, fluorescence modulation, magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, and photonic crystal. Finally, the challenges and prospective future directions in this rapidly evolving field are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Colorimetric Detection of Naphthalene Enabled by Intra&#8208; to Intermolecular Charge Transfer Interplay Induced by &#960;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; Interactions of a TPA&#8208;Attached Pyrazinacene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new Donor&#8208;Acceptor type pyrazinacene derivative (1) featuring strong ICT was synthesized by linking electron&#8208;donating triphenylamine (TPA) and electron&#8208;accepting CN groups via a pyrazinacene core. The compound exhibits a dramatic color change from greenish blue to red&#8208;violet upon selective recognition of naphthalene (3) to form a 1:1 co&#8208;crystal (1&#8226;3). This color change is induced by intermolecular CT between pyrazinacene and naphthalene&#8217;s aromatic moieties, driven by &#960;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. Crystal structure analysis and DFT calculations confirm that the molecular recognition process is facilitated by the unique &#960;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions, leading to a reversible color switching mechanism. The findings offer new insights into selective molecular recognition and ICT&#8208;CT interplay in nonporous adaptive crystals.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to examine the effects of the fused heterole on the electronic properties of aromatic and antiaromatic smaragdyrins, 2,3&#8208;thiophene&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;indole&#8208;fused [20]smaragdyrins were synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and subsequent oxidative fusion reaction, and were reduced with NaBH4 to the corresponding [22]smaragdyrins. Fused&#8208;thiophene&#8208; and fused&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;bridged [20]&#8208; and [22]smaragdyrin dimers were also synthesized in the similar manner. The installed fused heteroles mitigate the paratropic ring current of the [20]smaragdyrin but exert only minor effects on the diatropic ring current of the [22]smaragdyrin. Similar features are also observed for the fused&#8208;heterole&#8208;bridged [20]&#8208; and [22]smaragdyrin dimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent progress of mechanofluorochromism and mechanoluminescence for phenothiazine derivatives and analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanofluorochromism (MFC) and mechanoluminescence (ML) materials have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, optical recording, photodynamic therapy, bioimaging, stress sensing, display technology, and ink&#8208;free printing paper. Among the various building blocks utilized in these materials, phenothiazine (PTZ) has emerged as a widely employed fundamental component owing to its distinctive electronic and optical properties as well as its facile modification capabilities. Summarizing the recent progress of PTZ derivatives and analogues in this field holds practical significance. In this review article, we classify over one hundred compounds into few classes based on the positions of substituents and provide detailed descriptions of their contributions to MFC and ML research respectively. This comprehensive review aims to offer theoretical insights and practical examples for researchers engaged in designing and developing new phenothiazine functional materials while serving as a bridge for further exploration of MFC or ML studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of Tertiary Aliphatic Cations with Silylated Alkynes: Substitution, Cyclization and Unexpected C&#8208;H Activation Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capozzi's groundbreaking work in 1982 introduced a fascinating reaction involving highly reactive tertiary aliphatic cations and silylated alkynes. This reaction provided an innovative solution to the challenge of coupling a fully substituted tertiary aliphatic fragment with an alkyne moiety. Building upon Capozzi's pioneering efforts, we started an extensive exploration of reaction conditions to expand the initial scope of this reaction. Through meticulous control of the reaction parameters, we uncovered conditions capable of accommodating various functional groups, thereby enhancing the reaction's applicability. Intriguingly, our study revealed remarkable high diastereoselectivities for substrates with substitution in the a&#8209;position. Additionally, we made an unexpected discovery: an intriguing C&#8208;H activation of a cyclooctane ring furnishing a cyclooctane&#8208;fused cyclobutene. These findings not only extend the utility of Capozzi's original concept but also underscore the potential of highly reactive cations &#160;in modern organic C&#8208;H activation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the J&#8208; and H&#8208;Aggregates and Supramolecular Polymerization Pathways of Anthanthrene by Tuning the Hydrogen Bonding Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated building blocks for construction of supramolecular polymers is at the forefront of self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we incorporate a highly planar anthanthrene skeleton into the design of two supramolecular monomers 1 and 2. Their supramolecular polymerization have been comprehensively investigated by spectroscopic studies. Our results reveal that the number and/or position of the amide groups exert pronounced effect on the molecular aggregations and the mechanisms of the supramolecular polymerization. Monomer 1 self&#8208;assembles in a cooperative manner to form 1D nanofibers though face&#8208;to&#8208;face H&#8208;type aggregation. In contrast, 2 adopts J&#8208;aggregation to form supramolecular polymer via isodesmic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Alternative and Sustainable Route to Explore a New Class of Amidines by Photochemical Synergistic Effect of Copper/Nitroxyl Radical Catalysis via Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amidines are a vital class of bioactive compounds and often necessitate multiple components for their synthesis. Therefore, exploring efficient and sustainable methodologies for their synthesis is indispensable. Herein, we disclose an alternative and greener method for synthesizing an unexplored new class of amidines through the photochemical synergistic effect of copper/nitroxyl radical catalysis. This approach facilitates site&#8208;selective radical amination of unactivated imine C(sp2)&#8208;H bond in C,N,N&#8208;cyclic imines over favored selectivity via halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT). This greener method ticks 11 out of 12 green chemistry metrics (GCM), effectively sidestepping the need for oxidants, bases, ligands, multistep processes, and harsh conditions, distinguishing it from conventional methods described in previous studies. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational tools have been employed to elucidate the synergistic effect of Cu/nitroxyl radical, the role of light, XAT, the influence of substituents, and the order of the reaction in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;healing behavior of metallopolymers in complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This current study focusses on the investigation of the self&#8208;healing abilities of metallopolymers containing different kinds of metal complexes, which were processed by direct digital light processing (DLP) based three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing. For this purpose, 2&#8209;phenoxyethyl acrylate is mixed with ligand&#8208;containing monomers either based on triphenylmethyl(trt)&#8208;histidine or terpyridine, respectively. Either zinc(II) or nickel(II) salts are successfully applied for a complexation of the ligand monomers in solution and, subsequently, photopolymerization is performed. The thermo&#8208;mechanical properties of the obtained metallopolymers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as well as&#160;dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Multiple damages with defined forces ranging from 20 to 1500 mN were introduced into the 3D&#8208;structures and successfully healed within 24&#160;h at 70&#160;&#176;C or 120&#160;&#176;C, respectively without losing the structural integrity of the overall 3D&#8208;structures. Herein, excellent healing efficiencies up to 97% were determined. Consequently, these hollow structures not only feature very good self&#8208;healing abilities but also excellent retention of the 3D&#8208;structure at and above the healing temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Investigation of Isotope&#8208;selective Breathing in MIL&#8208;53 during Dihydrogen Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of smart materials capable of separating dihydrogen isotopologues has risen recently. Among potential candidates, the flexible MIL&#8208;53 (Al) has been gaining attention due to its structural flexibility providing the so&#8208;called &#8216;&#8217;breathing mechanism&#8217;&#8217; that can be useful to separate hydrogen isotopologues selectively. In the present work, an in situ continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance investigation has been proven as a sensitive technique to follow the isotopologue&#8208;selective adsorption&#8208;desorption of dihydrogen species on the paramagnetic metal&#8208;doped MIL&#8208;53 (Al0.99Cr0.01) and MIL&#8208;53 (Al0.99V0.01), respectively. The presence of paramagnetic spin probes such as Cr3+ and V4+ inside the MIL&#8208;53 framework allows for monitoring the framework transition including the 2nd transition step that selectively occurs at p &gt; 100 mbar when D2 gas is adsorbed on the pores at 23 K. Furthermore, investigation of D2 desorption from MIL&#8208;53 (Al0.99V0.01) by temperature&#8208;dependent hyperfine spectroscopy provides a more detailed analysis of the D2 desorption process on a microscopic scale with respect to the embedded spin probe.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced K&#8208;storage kinetics for N&#8208;doped carbon via controllable dedoping strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a potential alternative to next&#8208;generation LIBs, carbonous materials have garnered significant attention as anode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries due to their low cost and environmental friendliness. However, carbonaceous materials cannot fulfill the demand of anode for PIBs, due to volume expansion and poor stability during charging/discharging process. It is well&#8208;known that N doping can provide active sites for K&#8208;storage, and expand the layer distance between graphite layers. Therefore, a simple one&#8208;step pyrolysis strategy was proposed to synthesize different nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon to investigate the effects of N&#8208;doping and dedoping on K&#8208;storage performance. Through the synergistic action of N&#8208;doping and the carbon vacancy defects formed during the de&#8208;doping process, which alleviated volume expansion and promoted K+ transport rate. As a result, the PNC demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance, showing good long&#8208;term cycling stability (with a capacity of 195 mAh/g after 300 cycles at a current density of 200 mA/g) and outstanding rate performance. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and development of advanced anode materials with efficient potassium ion storage capabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Fused Phosphepines: Synthesis by Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroarylation and Ring Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation of dialkynyl(biaryl)phosphine oxides provided versatile benzo&#8208;fused phosphepine oxides. O&#8208;exo adducts were obtained as the major product, and O&#8208;endo adducts were the minor product. O&#8208;exo and O&#8208;endo indicate the position of an oxygen atom with respect to the central phosphepine framework. The isomers of dibenzo[b,d]phosphepine oxides with methyl and phenyl groups in an adjacent position (shown as 2a and 3a in the main text) were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. O&#8208;exo and O&#8208;endo adducts are diastereomers owing to the central chirality of the phosphorus atom and the planar chirality of phosphepine, and they are interconverted through a ring inversion of phosphepine via a transition state with a planar structure. The inversion barrier, fully estimated through theoretical calculations, drastically&#160;varied depending on the substituents in the phosphepine framework and/or the fusion of benzene and thiophene rings. Furthermore, the kinetics of the thermal isomerization of less stable O&#8208;endo product 3a into O&#8208;exo product 2a was examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated Macrocycle for Adsorptive Separation and Chromatographic Separation of Toluene and Methylcyclohexane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving the adsorptive separation and chromatographic separation of industrially the important chemicals toluene and methylcyclohexane using the same material is a highly desirable goal. We have successfully accomplished this using a fluorinated macrocycle tetrafluoroterphen[3]arene (4FTP3), which was synthesized and used for gas chromatographic separation in our previous work. The macrocycle 4FTP3 permitted the adsorptive separation of toluene from a toluene/methylcyclohexane mixture (1:1, v/v) with a purity of 99.3% in a single adsorption cycle. Additionally, the use of 4FTP3 as a gas chromatographic stationary phase permitted the high&#8208;resolution separation of a toluene/methylcyclohexane mixture, with a retention capacity decreasing in the order of: toluene&gt;methylcyclohexane. Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis revealed that the C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions between 4FTP3 and toluene resulted in an enhanced binding affinity, association enthalpy, and longer retention time for toluene. This macrocycle is of particular interest for use as a separation material due to its simultaneous adsorptive separation and gas chromatographic separation of toluene/methylcyclohexane. The present fluorinated macrocycle may therefore have roles to play in both analytical science and the chemical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Functionalized Bulky&#8208;Cyclopentadiene Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of significantly bulky mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted cyclic alkyl&#8208;amino carbene (cAAC)&#8208; functionalized cyclopentadiene ring (Cp) compounds were synthesized. The functionalization of the Cp ring with cAAC ligands makes them significantly bulkier, while retaining their ligation properties. These compounds display interesting fluorescence properties. In these compounds, intra&#8208;molecular charge transfer is observed from electron&#8208;rich carbene to electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadiene unit. These high yielding compounds have been characterized by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction and their emission properties have been studied. Rotational conformers (via C&#8722;C bond rotation) play a pivotal role with possible different extent of intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) from carbene to cyclopentadiene ring.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A series of significantly bulky mono- and di-substituted cyclic alkyl-amino carbene (cAAC)- functionalized cyclopentadiene ring (Cp) compounds were synthesized. The functionalization of the Cp ring with cAAC ligands makes them significantly bulkier, while retaining their ligation properties. These compounds display interesting fluorescence properties. In these compounds, intra-molecular charge transfer is observed from electron-rich carbene to electron-deficient cyclopentadiene unit. These high yielding compounds have been characterized by X-ray single-crystal diffraction and their emission properties have been studied.

         <title>Tolane&#8208;Based Phosphino&#8208; and Arsino&#8208;Ruthenium Complexes in Three Different Oxidation States: Ru(I), Ru(II) and Ru(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium(II) complexes featuring iPr2P&#8208; and iPr2As&#8208;functionalized diphenylacetylene scaffolds were examined with respect to 1e&#8722; reduction and oxidation. An octahedral ruthenium(III) complexes was obtained for the iPr2As&#8208;functionalized ligand and a square&#8208;planar ruthenium(I) complex was isolated for the phospha&#8208;derivative. The latter ruthenium(I) complex was found to react with TlPF6 to produce a trinuclear species containing a nearly linear Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru moiety.







Abstract
Targeting Ru(III) and Ru(I) &#951;2&#8208;alkyne species, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;(iPr2E)2&#8208;substituted diphenylacetylenes (1&#8208;E, E=P, As) were employed for the preparation of [ECCE]&#8208;coordinated ruthenium complexes. The reactions between 1&#8208;E and cis&#8208;(MeCN)2(COD)RuCl2 led to the required Ru(II) starting materials cis&#8208;[ECCE]RuCl2(MeCN) (3&#8208;E). Upon oxidation of 3&#8208;E with PhICl2, the Ru(III) target complexes [ECCE]RuCl3 (7&#8208;E) were detectable for E=P and E=As, but only the arsa&#8208;derivative 7&#8208;As was obtained in a pure form, namely via oxidation of cis&#8208;[AsCCAs]RuCl2(THT) (THT=tetrahydrothiophene). Upon reduction of compounds 3&#8208;E, a hitherto unprecedented Ru(I) &#951;2&#8208;alkyne complex, [PCCP]RuCl (9), was obtained for E=P. The former square planar Ru(I) complex (9) was characterized comprehensively and examined in detail by means of DFT and CASSCF calculation. Upon treatment of 9 with TlPF6, a diamagnetic &#956;&#8208;Tl&#8208;bridged compound (10) with a nearly linear Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru array was formed and isolated in high yields. Careful analysis of the bonding situation suggested that the Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru moiety in 10 is best interpreted in terms of a 3c&#8211;4e&#8722; bond.

         <title>Tetrylenes are Able to Discern between Isomeric Structures of Unsaturated Osmium(IV) Polyhydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexahydride OsH6(PiPr3)2 releases H2 to form two isomers of general formula OsH4(PiPr3)2, which are selectively trapped with the tetrylenes Ge{N(SiMe3)2}2 and Sn{N(SiMe3)2}2, there being a direct relationship between the size of the ligand donor atom (Ge vs Sn) and the trapped isomer. Ge{N(SiMe3)2}2 generates OsH4{Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 which has a piano stool geometry, while Sn{N(SiMe3)2}2 gives OsH4{Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 with a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry.







Abstract
Hexahydride OsH6(PiPr3)2 (1) releases H2 to form the isomeric tetrahydrides 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b of general formula OsH4(PiPr3)2. Tetrylenes E{N(SiMe3)2}2 (E=Ge, Sn) are able to selectively trap these isomers distinguishing between them. Tetrylene Ge{N(SiMe3)2}2 catches 2&#8201;b to generate OsH4{Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 (3), which has a piano stool geometry, while Sn{N(SiMe3)2}2 captures 2&#8201;a to give OsH4{Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 (4) with the donor atoms defining a pentagonal bipyramid around the osmium center.

         <title>Broken Symmetry and Elastic Frustration in Isostructural MnIII Spin Crossover Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Opening of both symmetry breaking and non&#8208;symmetry breaking thermal evolution pathways is demonstrated for isostructural crystals of a MnIII spin crossover cationic complex embedded in lattices with heavy anions ReO4&#8722;, AsF6&#8722; and SbF6&#8722;. This highlights the power of crystal engineering in coupling structural and electronic instabilities in molecular systems and the potential for tuning transition profiles.







Abstract
Symmetry breaking spin state transitions in two of three isostructural salts of MnIII spin crossover cations, [MnIII(3&#8208;OMe&#8208;5&#8208;NO2&#8208;sal2323)]+, with heavy anions are reported. The ReO4&#8722; (1) salt undergoes two&#8208;step spin crossover which is coupled with a re&#8208;entrant symmetry breaking structural phase transition between a high temperature phase (S=2, C2/c), an intermediate ordered phase (S=1/S=2, P21/c), and a low temperature phase (S=1, C2/c). The AsF6&#8722; (2) complex undergoes an abrupt transition between a high temperature phase (S=2, C2/c) and a low temperature ordered phase (S=1/S=2, P

1&#8254;

 ${\bar{1}}$



). The SbF6&#8722; (3) complex undergoes a gradual transition between a high temperature phase (S=2, P

1&#8254;

 ${\bar{1}}$



) and a low temperature spin state ordered phase (S=1/S=2, P&#8208;

1&#8254;

 ${\bar{1}}$



). Correlation of the volume of the anion and the T1/2 of the transitions in these complexes and three analogous complexes with similar anions, BF4&#8722; (4), ClO4&#8722; (5), PF6&#8722; (6), reveals an increase in T1/2 upon increasing the anion volume. We rationalise that the volume of the anions used modulates the elastic interactions between the MnIII sites in the lattice, with increasing elastic frustration with the larger anions resulting in a two&#8208;stepped transition for 1 and the stabilisation of the mixed (HS:LS) state to low temperature for 2 and 3.

         <title>Structures and Properties of Axially Chiral (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;Nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;Tetraenoate Derivatives Highly Substituted by Aryl Groups</title>

         <dc:description>
We found that unique (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetraenoate derivatives highly substituted by aryl groups had axial chirality. Although racemization of an enantiomer of a representative compound was observed even at a low temperature, a cyclic dimer synthesized by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail transesterification of a modified analog showed stable axial chirality. Those compounds showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), and the chiral cyclic dimer exhibits solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).







Abstract
Unprecedented (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetraenoate derivatives highly substituted by aryl groups have been synthesized by the reaction of rhodium complexes having aryl&#8208;substituted hexa&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trienyl ligands with acrylates. These compounds have potential axial chirality, and their enantiomers are isolable by the chiral HPLC technique. Although the racemization barrier of isolated enantiomers was not high, it was found that a cyclic dimer synthesized by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail transesterification of a modified analog has quite a stable axial chirality even at a high temperature. From a structural analogy with tetraphenylethene, those compounds are emissive in the solid state, and the chiral cyclic dimer exhibits solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.

         <title>What Factors Determine the Brevione B Desaturation Mechanism in the Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase BrvJ?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations on the nonheme iron desaturase BrvJ show that desaturation happens through two consecutive hydrogen atom abstraction barriers, while the OH rebound barrier is stereochemically hindered. We also tested a second reaction cycle and show that product is not released but can undergo a second cycle with small barriers to from brevione C products.







Abstract
The natural product synthesis of brevione J undergoes a cascade of reactions including an oxidative desaturation and a ring&#8208;expansion. The C1&#8722;C2 desaturation of brevione B is catalyzed by the nonheme iron dioxygenase BrvJ using one molecule of O2 and &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate (&#945;KG). However, whether the subsequent oxidative ring expansion reaction is also catalyzed by the same enzyme is unknown and remains controversial. To gain insight into the mechanism of brevione J biosynthesis a computational study is reported here using molecular dynamics and density functional theory approaches. The work predicts that both cycles can proceed in the same protein structure on an iron center with O2 and &#945;KG for each cycle. The rate&#8208;determining step is a hydrogen atom abstraction step in both reaction cycles. Interestingly, the OH rebound barriers are high in energy in cycle 1 due to stereochemical interactions and substrate positioning that enable an efficient desaturation reaction.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Propargylation of Azinium Ions via Hydroxydihydroazine Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic propargylations of azinium ions with a propargylboronate give functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines, 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines, and 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrazines in good yields and high regioselectivities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that hydroxydihydroazine intermediates formed by the addition of LiOH to the azinium ions are the reactive electrophiles.







Abstract
The nucleophilic propargylation of azinium ions with a propargylboronate proceeds efficiently under gold(I) catalysis. A range of N&#8208;alkylated pyridinium, quinolinium, and pyrazinium ions undergo propargylation with good yields and high regioselectivities to give various functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines, 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines, and 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrazines. No allenylation side&#8208;products are observed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the mechanisms of these reactions. Hydroxydihydroazine intermediates formed by the addition of LiOH to the azinium ions were found to be the reactive electrophiles in these reactions.

         <title>Transitioning to Green Discovery&#8208;Based Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The path to truly sustainable chemistry is a complex one, but an immediate area with near&#8208; and long&#8208;term benefit is improved sustainability in fundamental study of catalysis. Examples from catalytic hydrophosphination not only show success under more green conditions but how green choices are truly advancing.







Abstract
Pressure is mounting to minimize the carbon footprint of chemical industry while increasing its sustainability. An argument is made that working from Green Chemistry principles during discovery&#8208;based catalysis results in effective chemistry and circumvents a need to &#8220;rediscover&#8221; chemical reactivity under sustainable conditions. Examples of comparative success in selected examples of hydrophosphination catalysis in various degrees of development are provided to support two main ideas: 1)&#8197;Starting from more sustainable practices in chemical discovery is inertia in methodology that should be overcome, and 2)&#8197;substantial challenges remain in catalysis for which sustainable solutions would positively impact other areas of chemistry. Examples of successes, even in the face of the challenges noted, are presented herein as indications that even as a starting point, sustainability can meet short&#8208; and long&#8208;term needs. These ideas indicate critical but simple strategies for fundamental research to be impactful in the sustainability of the chemical industry broadly.

         <title>Binding&#8208;Site Directed Selection and Large&#8208;Scale Click&#8208;Synthesis of a Coagulation Factor XIa&#8208;Inhibiting Circular DNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coagulation factor XIa&#8208;inhibiting circular aptamer is discovered from an asymmetrical dumbbell structured DNA library through a binding&#8208;site directed selection strategy. The pre&#8208;designed structure facilitates quantitative cyclization using click chemistry. With significantly enhanced functionality and satisfactory scalability in synthesis, this circular aptamer presents a promising option as a next&#8208;generation DNA&#8208;based anticoagulant.







Abstract
Factor XIa (FXIa) is a plasma protease that catalyzes the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, thus being regarded as a promising antithrombotic target. Circular DNA aptamers, with their dramatically enhanced biological and structural stability, hold great potential as new&#8208;generation DNA&#8208;based anticoagulants. However, the functional selection of circular aptamers and large&#8208;scale synthesis of them remains a substantial challenge. In this study, we explored a binding&#8208;site directed selection strategy to enrich circular DNA aptamers that can target the catalytic domain of FXIa and inhibit its function. An asymmetrical dumbbell structured DNA library with self&#8208;shielding primer&#8208;binding site was utilized for selection. This approach has resulted in the identification of a circular DNA aptamer, named FICAPT1, which demonstrates a high binding affinity (Kd=20&#8197;nM), notable stability (with a half&#8208;life of 16&#8197;h in human plasma) and outstanding anticoagulation activity (with significantly prolonged aPTT), showing great promise as a novel anticoagulant. Moreover, a refined version of FICAPT1, named as CC&#8208;FICAPT1, was quantitatively synthesized (~2&#8197;mg/mL) by taking advantage of the pre&#8208;designed structure and high cyclization efficiency of click chemistry. The approach presented in this study enables the efficient generation of functional circular DNA aptamers and allows for their synthesis in a satisfactory scale, making it adaptable for the production of various circular aptamers for therapeutic applications.

&lt;p&gt;Factor XIa (FXIa) is a plasma protease that catalyzes the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, thus being regarded as a promising antithrombotic target. Circular DNA aptamers, with their dramatically enhanced biological and structural stability, hold great potential as new-generation DNA-based anticoagulants. However, the functional selection of circular aptamers and large-scale synthesis of them remains a substantial challenge. In this study, we explored a binding-site directed selection strategy to enrich circular DNA aptamers that can target the catalytic domain of FXIa and inhibit its function. An asymmetrical dumbbell structured DNA library with self-shielding primer-binding site was utilized for selection. This approach has resulted in the identification of a circular DNA aptamer, named FICAPT1, which demonstrates a high binding affinity (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;=20&#8197;nM), notable stability (with a half-life of 16&#8197;h in human plasma) and outstanding anticoagulation activity (with significantly prolonged aPTT), showing great promise as a novel anticoagulant. Moreover, a refined version of FICAPT1, named as CC-FICAPT1, was quantitatively synthesized (~2&#8197;mg/mL) by taking advantage of the pre-designed structure and high cyclization efficiency of click chemistry. The approach presented in this study enables the efficient generation of functional circular DNA aptamers and allows for their synthesis in a satisfactory scale, making it adaptable for the production of various circular aptamers for therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Unique Case of &#8242;in Situ&#8217; Bifluoride Triggered Formation of Supramolecular Organogels Using Isophthalamide Hydrogen Bond Donating Receptors.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isopthalamide based receptor H2L2 featuring two p&#8208;benzoic acid units deprotonates in the presence of TBAF and the deprotonated L22&#8722; binds the in&#8197;situ formed HF2&#8722;. Combination of the H&#8208;bond donor abilities of the isophthalamide motif and the presence of the carboxylic acid moieties promotes a complex and unexpected isodesmic self&#8208;assembly process uniquely with HF2&#8722; leading to the formation of a stable thixotropic supramolecular gel.







Abstract
A novel isopthalamide based receptor H2L2 featuring two p&#8208;benzoic acid units has been synthesised and its anion binding properties analysed by 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy in DMSO&#8208;d6/0.5&#8201;% H2O. As expected, in the presence of tetrabutylammonium (TBA) fluoride the deprotonation of the carboxylic acid moieties was observed. However, the deprotonated receptor L22&#8722; was able to bind the in&#8197;situ formed HF2&#8722; via the formation of H&#8208;bonds with the amide NHs. When H2L2 was dissolved in THF and 4 equivalents of TBAF were added in CH3CN a unique sol&#8208;gel transition occurred giving rise to a stable thixotropic supramolecular gel. Theoretical calculations elucidated the gelation mechanism and strongly support the findings observed experimentally.

         <title>Methylaluminoxane Reactivities and Anionic Structures: From Small Oligomers to Large Sheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure and reactivity of small methylaluminoxane (MAO) species (MeAlO)n(Me3Al)m (n = 1&#8208;8) have been investigated using DFT (M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations. This hierarchy of methods reveals that DFT artificially stabilizes structures containing 4&#8208;coordinate oxygen atoms while higher&#8208;level calculations demonstrate a clear preference for structures with 3&#8208;coordinate oxygen and 4&#8208;coordinate aluminum centers. Analysis of ionization pathways shows these neutral MAO molecules form anions through either methide or Me2Al+ abstraction, with the latter mechanism dominant for sheet structures (n = 5&#8208;8). Smaller species (n = 1&#8208;4, m &#8805; n) show minimal reactivity toward either ionization pathway. The resulting anions consistently adopt sheet structures with 3&#8208;coordinate oxygen and 4&#8208;coordinate aluminum at all levels of theory. We introduce a comprehensive stability metric incorporating both ionization energies and neutral precursor stability, which successfully explains the distribution of anions observed in ESI&#8208;MS spectra during Me3Al hydrolysis. Extension of this analysis to larger species, including the recently isolated and characterized sheet (MeAlO)26(Me3Al)9 (Luo et al., Science, 2024, 384, 1424&#8208;1428), reveals unexpected trends in reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Core&#8208;Functionalised Naphthalenediimides from Naphthalenetetracarboxylic Dianhydride using a Vibratory Ball Mill: Bromination, Imidization and Heck&#8208;Type Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimides (c&#8208;NDIs) are an important component in organic electronics. Current methods for their production frequently require long reaction times, large quantities of solvent and inert conditions. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series c&#8208;NDIs by a 3&#8208;step synthesis from naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (NDI) using only environmentally sustainable mechanochemical methods and without excluding air or moisture.







Abstract
The synthesis of 9 core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimide (c&#8208;NDI) residues is reported via a 3&#8208;step synthesis from naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride using only mechanochemical activation. Selective dibromination and subsequent diimidization were achieved for the first time in a vibratory ball mill, resulting in the key structural intermediate, 2,6&#8208;dibromonaphthalenediimide (DBND), which is the basis for elaboration into a multitude of organic electronic materials. Our new synthesis of DBND is achieved in just 5&#8197;hours reaction time over two steps compared to typical solution state times of 24&#8197;hours. Subsequent Heck&#8208;type cross coupling reactions, with a range of styrene residues, produced a series of c&#8208;NDIs in good yields. The Heck&#8208;type reactions are rapid (1.5&#8197;hours), require no additional heating or solvent and are tolerant of atmospheric moisture and air.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of well&#8208;engineered bifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial for achieving durable and efficient performance in overall water splitting. In this study, Ru&#8208;doped FeMn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 itself has Ru sites and generates FeMnOOH under catalytic conditions, forming dual active sites for overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Ru dopants exhibit optimized binding strength for H* and enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. Moreover, the Mn sites within FeMnOOH lower the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (from O* to OOH*), serving as the active centre for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The incorporation of Ru significantly improves the electron transfer properties of FeMn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and enhances its water adsorption capacity, synergistically boosting its bifunctional activity. This strategy of designing dual active sites provides new insights into the development of bifunctional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for efficient overall water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Meso&#8208;&#946; Monofused Porphyrins: Synthesis, Structural, Spectral, Electrochemical and DFT Studies and Their Efficient Third&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promising Fusion! &#946;&#8208;to&#8208;ortho monofused porphyrins and their derivatives have been successfully synthesized and characterized. These porphyrins exhibit electronic spectral features in the low&#8208;energy region and demonstrate tuneable electrochemical redox properties, resulting from their tailored design and peripheral fusion. Ultrafast third&#8208;order nonlinear optical studies reveal promising two&#8208;photon absorption coefficients and effective cross&#8208;section values, highlighting their potential for future optoelectronic applications.







Abstract
Three new series of &#946;&#8208;to&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenyl monofused porphyrins, denoted as MMFP(MN)X2 (where MFP=monofused porphyrin, MN=malononitrile and X=H or Br) and MMFP(MN)MB (where MB=mono benzo, M=2H, Co(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II)) were designed and successfully synthesized with good yields. These compounds were thoroughly characterized using various spectroscopic techniques and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. Notably, three of the monofused porphyrins; CoMFP(MN)Br2, CuMFP(MN)Br2 and ZnMFP(MN)MB crystallized unambiguously in a triclinic crystal system with a 

P1&#8254;

 space group. The twist angle values for these structures ranged from 14.03&#176; to 21.35&#176;. The meso&#8208;&#946; peripheral fusion and substituents led to tunable electronic spectral features across the synthesized porphyrins. The first reduction and oxidation potentials of all the investigated monofused porphyrins exhibited significant anodically shift as compared to their parent tetraphenylporphyrins (TPPs), attributed to peripheral fusion and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, which collectively led to a reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. Ultrafast third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) studies revealed that these monofused porphyrins showed a strong two&#8208;photon absorption coefficient (&#946;=0.18&#8211;39.06&#215;10&#8722;11&#8197;m/W) and effective cross&#8208;section (

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Promising Fusion&lt;/b&gt;! &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-to-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; monofused porphyrins and their derivatives have been successfully synthesized and characterized. These porphyrins exhibit electronic spectral features in the low-energy region and demonstrate tuneable electrochemical redox properties, resulting from their tailored design and peripheral fusion. Ultrafast third-order nonlinear optical studies reveal promising two-photon absorption coefficients and effective cross-section values, highlighting their potential for future optoelectronic applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three new series of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-to-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-phenyl monofused porphyrins, denoted as MMFP(MN)X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (where MFP=monofused porphyrin, MN=malononitrile and X=H or Br) and MMFP(MN)MB (where MB=mono benzo, M=2H, Co(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II)) were designed and successfully synthesized with good yields. These compounds were thoroughly characterized using various spectroscopic techniques and single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. Notably, three of the monofused porphyrins; CoMFP(MN)Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CuMFP(MN)Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZnMFP(MN)MB crystallized unambiguously in a &lt;i&gt;triclinic&lt;/i&gt; crystal system with a

 space group. The twist angle values for these structures ranged from 14.03&#176; to 21.35&#176;. The &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt; peripheral fusion and substituents led to tunable electronic spectral features across the synthesized porphyrins. The first reduction and oxidation potentials of all the investigated monofused porphyrins exhibited significant anodically shift as compared to their parent tetraphenylporphyrins (TPPs), attributed to peripheral fusion and electron-withdrawing substituents, which collectively led to a reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. Ultrafast third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) studies revealed that these monofused porphyrins showed a strong two-photon absorption coefficient (&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;=0.18&#8211;39.06&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;11&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;m/W) and effective cross-section (

         <title>Unravelling the Relaxation Pathway and Excited State Dynamics of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Incorporating Phosphorus&#8208;Based Monodentate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relaxation pathway and excited state dynamics of [Ru(N3)(N2)(PTA)]2+ type Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls containing phosphorus&#8208;based monodentate ligand PTA (1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) from the photogenerated excited state suggested the involvement of 3MC excited state. The effect of N&#8208;methylation of the PTA on the photophysical properties and excited state relaxation dynamics of the complexes was rationalized.







Abstract
Herein, the photophysical, photochemical properties and photogenerated excited state dynamics of two new Ru(II) complexes, viz. [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(bpy)(PTA)]2+ [1]2+, [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(phen)(PTA)]2+ [2]2+ having a phosphorus&#8208;based ligand PTA [p&#8208;ttp=p&#8208;tolyl terpyridine; bpy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl; phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline and PTA=1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane] are reported. Upon excitation with 470&#8197;nm LED, [1]2+ and [2]2+ neither undergo ligand release nor exhibit room temperature luminescence/1O2 generation. However, when excited around their respective MLCT bands at 77&#8197;K, luminescence bands at ~600&#8197;nm were observed. N&#8208;methylation of the coordinated PTA in complex [1]2+ resulted in [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(bpy)(MePTA]3+ {[1&#8208;Me]3+} (MePTA=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane). The differences in the photophysical and electrochemical properties of [1]2+ and [1&#8208;Me]3+ were rationalized by DFT calculations. The transient absorption spectroscopic analysis was used to unravel the relaxation pathway of the complexes, suggesting the involvement of the 3MC state in the relaxation process. The effect of electronic modulation resulted from the N&#8208;methylation of PTA on the excited state dynamics of the complexes was observed. The MTT assays in various cancer cells revealed their non&#8208;cytotoxic nature in the dark or upon irradiation with 470&#8197;nm blue LED. The non&#8208;toxicity of the complexes, despite being internalized in cancer cells as established by ICP&#8208;MS, is attributed to their dark and photostability and the inability to generate 1O2.

         <title>Intermolecular 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Nitriles via Redox Gold Catalysis: Synthesis of Benzoxazoles and Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedent gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of nitriles with o&#8208;iodophenols or o&#8208;iodoanilines via Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis has been developed, leading to benzoxazoles or benzimidazoles with broad substrate scope. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the Au(III)&#8208;Ar species generated via oxidative addition of o&#8208;iodophenol to MeDalphosAu+, serves as a key intermediate. The method was also applied to the synthesis of poly aza&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
The unprecedent gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of nitriles with o&#8208;iodophenols or o&#8208;iodoanilines via Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis has been developed, providing an expedient route to the synthesis of benzoxazoles or benzimidazoles with broad substrate scope and high functional compatibility. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the Au(III)&#8208;Ar species generated via oxidative addition of o&#8208;iodophenol to MeDalphosAu+, serves as a key intermediate. Particularly, this annulation is initiated by oxidative addition, rather than the nucleophilic attack of the phenol moiety in o&#8208;iodophenol towards the nitrile. The method was also applied to the synthesis of poly aza&#8208;heterocycles via a cascade Au(I)/Au(III) and Au(I) catalysis relay.

         <title>Amino&#8208;substituted Azoxybenzenes as Potential Redox&#8208;Active Catholyte Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl diazenes, particularly azobenzenes (AB), represent a versatile class of compounds with significant historical and practical relevance, ranging from dyes to molecular machines, solar thermal and electrochemical storage. Their oxygen&#8208;substituted counterparts, azoxybenzenes (AOB), share structural similarities but have been less explored, especially in energy storage applications. This study investigates the redox properties of AOB, comparing them to AB, and evaluates their potential as redox&#8208;active materials for energy storage systems. Through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and spectro&#8208;electrochemical analyses, we demonstrate that AOBs exhibit a distinct redox behaviour, influenced by the solvent and electrolyte environment, with a reversible oxidation process. Despite their promising redox characteristics, AOBs suffer from capacity decay during galvanostatic cycling, likely due to the instability of the radical cation intermediate. These findings suggest that while AOBs offer intriguing redox properties, further investigation into stabilization strategies are needed for their application in energy storage.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of polyferrocenyldimethylsilane&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;glutamic acid) block copolymers was systematically explored. Rod&#8208;like and plate&#8208;like micelles were prepared from self&#8208;assembly of the block copolymers in aqueous solution with two different approaches. In a dissolution&#8208;dialysis approach, micelles were prepared by dissolving a block copolymer sample in excess aqueous base followed by the dialysis of the solution against water. The morphology of the resultant micelles showed composition dependence. The block copolymer sample with the lowest soluble block content formed rod&#8208;like micelles, while the other samples with higher soluble block content formed spherical micelles. In a THF&#8208;mediated approach, THF was added into a block copolymer solution, which was first prepared by the dissolution&#8208;dialysis approach, and then the THF was evaporated slowly. Plate&#8208;like micelles were obtained from all the block copolymer samples examined, and these had a broad range of soluble block content. The formation of these plate&#8208;like micelles was attributed to the crystallization of the PFDMS blocks in the presence of THF. A tendency of large platelet micelles evolving to thin filaments over time was observed. This change may have been driven by the increase in the corona&#8208;chain stretching energy as THF evaporated.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbamate&#8208;Functionalized NLOphores via a Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8208;Retroelectrocyclization Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study introduces a new donor group capable of activating click&#8208;type [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclizations, generally known for their limited scope. Target chromophores were synthesized using isocyanate&#8208;free urethane synthesis. The developed synthetic method allows for the tuning of the optical properties of the chromophores by modifying the donor groups, the acceptor units, and the side chains. The charge transfer (CT) bands of the chromophores exhibit &#955;max values ranging from 363 to 692 nm. The CT bands observed have been supported by solvatochromism and protonation experiments. The synthesized compounds exhibit positive solvatochromism. Due to their potential as NLOphore candidates, the stability of the synthesized compounds have been investigated both experimentally through TGA and theoretically by calculating parameters such as frontier orbital energy differences, electronegativity, and global hardness/softness. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were used to elucidate the nature of the electronic transitions, revealing that the bands correspond to CT arising from HOMO&#8208;to&#8208;LUMO excitations. The NLO properties of the chromophores were investigated theoretically by DFT methods and experimentally by the EFISHG technique. Both results are shown to be in agreement with HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy differences. The experimental &#956;&#946; values of the selected molecules range from 470 &#215; 10&#8211;48 to 5400 &#215; 10&#8211;48 esu.</dc:description>

         <title>Selenium Nucleophilicity and Electrophilicity in the Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular SN2 Reactions of Selenenyl Sulfide Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogenide exchange reactions are an important class of bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions (SN2) involving sulfur and selenium species as nucleophile, central atom, and/or leaving group, which are fundamental throughout redox biology and metabolism. While thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange reactions have been deeply investigated, those involving selenium are less understood, especially with regards to the polarised selenenyl sulfides RSe&#8211;SR' even though the directed reactivity of selenenyl sulfides is biologically crucial for selenoenzymes such as thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Synthetic methods to create asymmetric selenenyl sulfides with high regiochemical purity only emerged over the last five years; this functional group has already demonstrated powerful applications to cell biology, through probes for molecular imaging (e.g. the TrxR probe "RX1") or reagents for thiol&#8208;mediated uptake (e.g. remote ammonium thiaselenanes). Here, we investigate the SN2@S and SN2@Se reactions of selenenyl sulfides in silico to provide the first comprehensive overview of their kinetic and thermodynamic trends, referencing against symmetrical disulfides and diselenides. We quantify the role of alternative exchange reactions in the double&#8208;exchange chemistry of RX1. This analysis rationalises the origins of RX1's TrxR&#8208;specificity even within thiol&#8208;rich cellular environments and can support the design and applications of a range of selenenyl sulfide&#8208;based bioactive probes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In recent years, formic acid (FA) has garnered attention as a compelling molecule for various chemical and everyday applications Additionally, with recent studies demonstrating direct FA generation through CO2&#160;electrolysis, it can serve as a stable liquid hydrogen carrier. Nevertheless, FA&#8208;permeability via semi&#8208;permeable ion&#8209;exchange membranes (FA&#8208;crossover) still constitutes a major issue in scalable polymer&#8208;electrolyte separated zero&#8208;gap electrolyzers, limiting the breakthrough of the technology to the larger&#8208;scale. Herein we present a holistic route towards understanding the mechanism of FA&#8208;crossover in zero&#8208;gap cells. The gained know&#8208;how through formic acid uptake, gel&#8208;phase conductivity, and membrane permeability measurements allowed for the development of an easy&#8208;to&#8208;scale barrier layer, showing a FA&#8208;flux (JFA) decrease by 46&#160;% at 200&#160;mA cm&#8209;2&#160;compared to bare Nafion&#8208;membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Stability and Kinetics of Dioxazaborocanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron adducts with reversible bonding that dissociate slowly and completely are difficult to achieve. A new kind of dioxazaborocanes (DOAB) is reported that features dissociation kinetics in the day&#8208;to&#8208;week range. Furthermore, we investigated by substitution on various positions how the equilibrium reaction between DOAB, phenylboronic acids (BA) and diethanolamines (DEA) in water can be adjusted.







Abstract
We investigated the equilibrium reaction of boronic acid (BA), diethanolamines (DEA), and 1,3,6,2&#8208;dioxazaborocanes (DOAB) in aqueous solutions, both theoretically and experimentally. Our findings show that the association constant can be adjusted by substituting BA and DEA derivatives, ranging from 100 to 103&#8197;M&#8722;1, exhibiting a bell&#8208;shaped pH dependency. The highest stability was achieved when the pKa values of DEA and BA were closely matched. This approach enabled the preparation of a highly stable DOAB under physiological conditions. Furthermore, the hydrolysis kinetics of DOABs were controllable over a range of five orders of magnitude based on the substituent's steric effect. In the slowest case, this resulted in quasi&#8208;static stability with only 1&#8201;% cleavage in the first hour, followed by a week&#8208;long cleavage period to reach equilibrium. These insights could establish a unique chemistry platform for designing scheduled cleavability on a day&#8208;to&#8208;week timescale, relevant to protein engineering, immunotherapy, and other smart drug delivery applications.

         <title>Soy Protein Adhesive Enhanced Through Supramolecular Interaction with Tannic Acid Modified Montmorillonite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tannic (TA) modified montmorillonite (MMT) MMT@TA was prepared for the production of renewable, high&#8208;performance soy protein adhesives. MMT@TA non&#8208;covalently cross&#8208;links soy proteins through supramolecular interactions, which significantly improves the adhesive bond strength and water resistance. Natural polyphenol tannins provide mold resistance to the adhesive.







Abstract
The use of soybean meal (SM) as an alternative to petroleum&#8208;based resins in wood&#8208;based panels offers a solution to the problem of formaldehyde release. However, inherent drawbacks of soybean meal adhesives, such as poor toughness, low bond strength, and susceptibility to mold, have hindered their further development. In this study, a novel biomass adhesive, SM&#8208;MMT@TA, was developed based on supramolecular interactions between tannic acid (TA), montmorillonite (MMT), and soybean meal. Tannic acid was securely attached to the MMT surface through coordination bonds with Ca2+, Mg2+, and Al3+ ions, enhancing MMT's compatibility in the matrix via strong interfacial interactions. TA on the surface of MMT@TA effectively bonded with soy protein through strong hydrogen bonding, thereby increasing the crosslink density. As a result, the adhesive exhibited a wet shear strength of up to 1.75&#8197;MPa, which represents a 143.05&#8201;% increase compared to unmodified SM adhesive. Moreover, the moisture absorption rate of the adhesive was reduced to 26.79&#8201;%. Furthermore, abundant non&#8208;covalent interactions improved the adhesive's toughness, while natural polyphenols provided additional mold resistance. Overall, this study presents a new strategy for developing renewable, high&#8208;performance biomass&#8208;based adhesives.

         <title>Substitution of the Axial Type 1 Cu Ligand Affords Binding of a Water Molecule in Axial Position Affecting Kinetics, Spectral, and Structural Properties of the Small Laccase Ssl1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining several spectroscopic methods provided evidence that the exchange of the axial methionine of the T1 Cu site in the small laccase Ssl1 by several non&#8208;coordinating amino acids allowed a water molecule to enter the axial position, resulting in a stronger influence on the T1 Cu reduction potential and the intermolecular electron transfer than the chemical properties of the introduced amino acid side chains.







Abstract
Multicopper oxidases use Cu ions as cofactors to oxidize various substrates. High reduction potential at Type 1 Cu is considered as crucial for effective catalysis. Previous studies have shown that replacing the axial methionine ligand of the Type 1 Cu with leucine or phenylalanine leads to an increased reduction potential, but not always to higher enzyme activity. Here we present a study on six variants of the small laccase Ssl1 from Streptomyces sviceus, where the axial methionine ligand was substituted, and the effect of the axial ligand on reduction potential, activity, spectral properties and structure was investigated. Absorption, electronic circular dichroism and EPR spectra revealed the presence of a stronger coordinating axial ligand like oxygen, which influences the electronic and catalytic properties more than the nature of the amino acid side chain. The crystal structures of the Ssl1 variants were solved, which show that none of the amino acid side chains coordinate to the Cu. Instead, a water molecule is found in the axial coordination site, which support the spectroscopic data. Our findings highlight the importance of combining structural and spectroscopic methods to investigate the effect of amino acid exchange on multicopper oxidases.

         <title>Screening of an Antibacterial and Coagulation Multifunctional Peptide and Its Application in Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A five&#8208;amino acid peptide library was synthesized through solid&#8208;phase synthesis, and the peptide chain RKGAK with good antibacterial effect was screened out. Studies have found that peptide chains also have coagulation and antiviral functions. The peptide was loaded into the hydrogel and achieved good results in mouse skin wound healing experiments. This multifunctional peptide has great medical potential.







Abstract
As a new type of drug developed in the era of antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have great potential in antibacterial, antiviral and antitumor aspects. Different from the principle of action of antibiotics, AMPs have a better effect on resisting drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. We synthesized a peptide library using solid&#8208;phase synthesis and successfully screened the antimicrobial peptide RKGAK. AMPs provide effective defense against both bacteria and fungi. Research has found that the lowest inhibitory concentrations of RKGAK against S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans are 75 &#956;g/mL, 100 &#956;g/mL, and 300 &#956;g/mL. Not only that, this antibacterial peptide also has certain antiviral and coagulation effects. It is a multifunctional peptide that has great potential in many biomedical fields. It also has the advantages of being less likely to develop drug resistance, low hemolytic activity and low cytotoxicity. Loading the peptide into hydrogels has achieved good results in applications that promote wound healing.

         <title>Borenium Ion Equivalents Stabilized by BICAAC and Their Implementation as Catalysts in Hydrosilylation of Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of BICAAC&#8208;stabilized borenium ion equivalents and their application in the hydrosilylation of carbonyls and para&#8208;quinone methides. A broad library of electronically diverse aldehydes and ketones was screened, achieving a turnover frequency (TOFmax) of 1200&#8197;h&#8722;1 with benzaldehyde using 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the catalyst in 5&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Hydride abstraction from the borane adduct, (BICAAC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 afforded the hydride bridged dinuclear borenium ion equivalent complexes 1 and 2 that have been characterized by various spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques followed by the assessment of Lewis acidity using the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of complex 2 revealed the presence of discrete ions in the solid state. The complex (BICAAC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2(OTf) (3), obtained from the reaction of (BICAAC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 with MeOTf, formed the corresponding boronium cations [(BICAAC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2(L)]+(OTf)&#8722; on reaction with Lewis bases (L= pyridine (4) and DMAP (5)). Complexes 1 and 2 demonstrated notable catalytic activity in the hydrosilylation of a diverse array of carbonyls using 1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading (achieving the highest turnover frequency (TOFmax) of up to 1200&#8197;h&#8722;1 with benzaldehyde. A broad substrate scope has been presented for aldehydes and ketones decorated with various electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing substituents along with this the hydrosilylation of a few para&#8208;quinone methides has also been presented.

         <title>Basic&#8208;Functionalized Ionic Porous Organic Polymers: Triple Roles in One for Highly Efficient and Recyclable Carboxylative Cyclization of CO2 under Mild Conditions</title>

Basic&#8208;functionalized ionic porous organic polymers (IPOPs) DCX&#8208;4&#8208;Tetz/Ag2O exhibited highly efficient and recyclable performance for the cycloaddition of CO2 under mild condition due to its triple roles as adsorbent, activator and stabilizer, eliminating the use of extra organic bases.







Abstract
The transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into high&#8208;value chemicals is a significant step towards achieving the goal of &#8220;carbon neutrality&#8221;. &#945;&#8208;methylene cyclic carbonate, as an intermediate for the synthesis of many important organic compounds, is widely employed in industrial productions. In this work, a series of ionic porous organic polymers (IPOPs) with different basic&#8208;functionalized anions were successfully synthesized and adjusted to have certain BET surface areas and high contents of ion sites by post&#8208;modification. These basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs could exhibit excellent catalytic performance for carboxylative cyclization of CO2 at 30&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar in presence of silver salts, eliminating the use of the extra organic bases. In the whole catalytic reaction, the basic&#8208;functionalized anions could play triple roles: enriching CO2 for further transformation, activating the hydroxyl groups of substrates to improve the catalytic performance, while coordinating with Ag atom to stabilize and regenerate catalyst. Notably, the catalytic system of DCX&#8208;4&#8208;Tet/Ag2O exhibited excellent recyclability, and the yield of &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonate was well maintained at 99&#8201;% after 5&#8197;cycles. To the best of our knowledge, the catalytic system was the first example of basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs that played multiple roles for highly efficient CO2 cyclization under mild conditions without any extra organic bases.

The C,N&#8208;chelated aryltellurenyl triflate [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][OTf], a Lewis superacidic carbene analogue, effective activates the Si&#8722;H bonds in tertiary silanes R3SiH (R=Et, Ph, Si(SiMe3)3), which was utilized in main group redox catalysis using p&#8208;quinones, which were converted into (silylated) hydrochinones.







Abstract
The C,N&#8208;chelated aryltellurenyl triflate [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][OTf] (1) activates the Si&#8722;H bonds in the tertiary silanes R3SiH via umpolung of H&#8722; to H+ to give rise to the iminium salts (tBuN(H)CH)C6H4TeSiR3][OTf] (2R, R=Et, Ph (elusive) and R=Si(CH3)3 isolated; OTf=O3SCF3) comprising Te&#8722;Si bonds, which are capable of generating silyl triflates, R3SiOTf, under attack of a second equivalent of 1. The unprecedented Si&#8722;H activation was utilized in main group redox catalysis using p&#8208;quinones, which were converted into (silylated) hydroquinones.

         <title>Design and Evaluation of Azaspirocycles as RNA binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes efficient synthetic routes for the preparation of novel azaspirocycles. The resulting molecules exhibit unique three&#8208;dimensional structures with potential applications in drug discovery. The investigation of these compounds as RNA binders highlights promising activity as inhibitors of Tat/TAR interactions, presenting prospective therapeutic implications in HIV treatment and beyond.







Abstract
This study presents efficient synthetic pathways for preparing novel azaspirocycles. These methodologies involve functionalizing key bicyclic hydrazines with a substituent on one of their bridgehead carbon atoms. The desired spirocyclic cores were successfully obtained through double reductive amination reactions, intramolecular cyclizations, and cleavages of the N&#8722;N bond. The isolated molecules possess unique three&#8208;dimensional structures, suggesting potential applications in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. With the growing interest in targeting nucleic acids as a complementary approach to protein&#8208;targeting strategies for developing novel active compounds, we investigated the potential of the synthesized azaspirocycles as RNA binders. As a proof of concept, we highlight the promising activity of some compounds as strong binders of HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA and inhibitors of Tat/TAR interactions.

Herein, we developed glycosyl 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;methylpropionates as glycosyl donors, which can be activated by TMSOTf through remote activation. Both O&#8208;glycosylation and C&#8208;glycosylation were efficiently executed within 1&#8197;h at room temperature. The glycosylation protocol was characterized by its straightforward operation and broad applicability to various substrates.

         <title>Na Ions Doped Fe2VO4 Cathode for High Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>

We successfully created FVO&#8722;Na using a straightforward hydrothermal process. The intercalation of Na+ prevents the crystal structure from effectively stabilizing. As a result, FVO&#8242;s cycling performance increased. Additionally, at a current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the discharge capacity reached 370&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, and at a current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the capacity retention nearly reached 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are thought to be a new generation of secondary batteries that will replace lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their great safety and inexpensive cost. In the cathode materials of aqueous zinc ion batteries with long life and high capacity, abundant active sites and crystal structure stability play an important role. In the present work, the strategy of Na+ intercalation of Fe2VO4 (FVO) is proposed, aiming at the insertion of Na+, which not only enriches the active sites, but also sodium and iron ions act as guest species with the negatively charged VOx lattice to provide strong electrostatic attraction to stabilize the lamellar structure. In terms of electrochemical performance, the discharge specific capacity is 370&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and when the current density is arising 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the specific capacity also reaches 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after cycling 2000 with a capacity retention of 99&#8201;%, which is better than the electrochemical performance of Fe2VO4 (FVO) alone at 50&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. The superior electrochemical performance proves that FVO&#8722;Na is an ideal cathode material for zinc ion batteries.

         <title>The Photophysics of Naphthalimide&#8208;Phenoselenazine Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads: Revisiting the Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>

TADF: Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect Does Not Always Enhance rISC: We prepared compact orthogonal electron donor/acceptor dyads. The delayed fluorescence lifetime and triplet state lifetime of compounds containing heavy atoms are longer than the heavy atom&#8208;free counterparts, suggesting that the heavy atom effect on the rISC is not straightforward. The simultaneous observation of the presence of LE and CS triplet states in the TREPR spectra is the experimental evidence for the spin&#8208;vibronic coupling mechanism for TADF.







Abstract
We prepared thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter dyads, NI&#8208;PTZ, NI&#8208;PTZ&#8208;2Br and NI&#8208;PSeZ, with naphthalimide (NI) as electron acceptor and 10H&#8208;phenothiazine (PTZ) or 10H&#8208;phenoselenazine (PSeZ) as electron donor to study the heavy&#8208;atom effect on the intersystem crossing (ISC) and reverse ISC (rISC) in the TADF emitters. The delayed fluorescence lifetimes of the dyads containing heavy atoms (

Nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectral study and the time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra show the presence of both 3LE and 3CS states. These findings represent solid experimental evidences for the spin&#8208;vibronic coupling mechanism of TADF. Moreover, the ns&#8208;TA spectra show that the heavy atoms don't have a significant effect since the lifetime of the triplet transient species (1.3&#8197;&#956;s for NI&#8208;PTZ) is not shortened in their presence (4.5&#8197;&#956;s for NI&#8208;PSeZ and 5.3&#8197;&#956;s for NI&#8208;PTZ&#8208;2Br). These results show that the previously claimed heavy&#8208;atom effect on rISC and TADF is not a universal principle. The femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectra of the compounds indicate the occurrence of fast charge separation within 1&#8211;2&#8197;ps, and the charge recombination is slow (&gt;4 ns)

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TADF: Heavy-Atom Effect Does Not Always Enhance rISC&lt;/b&gt;: We prepared compact orthogonal electron donor/acceptor dyads. The delayed fluorescence lifetime and triplet state lifetime of compounds containing heavy atoms are longer than the heavy atom-free counterparts, suggesting that the heavy atom effect on the rISC is not straightforward. The simultaneous observation of the presence of LE and CS triplet states in the TREPR spectra is the experimental evidence for the spin-vibronic coupling mechanism for TADF.

         <title>Towards Designer Photocatalysts: Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in 2,6&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;pyryliums</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key design parameters and linear free&#8208;energy relationships were elucidated for 2,6&#8208;diarylpyrylium photocatalysts, allowing broad range control over both photophysical and electrochemical properties. Corrections to systematic errors in computational modeling of these systems were also developed.







Abstract
Fully organic photocatalyst systems are highly attractive, not merely because they are transition&#8208;metal free, but more importantly due to their unique and often potent reactivity. A detailed understanding of the various redox states, both ground and excited state, and specifically what structural parameters control them is therefore crucial for harnessing the full potential of these systems in organic synthesis. However, unlike their organometallic counterparts, detailed structure&#8208;property relationships for organic photocatalysts are largely absent from the literature. In this study, we demonstrate linear free&#8208;energy relationships across a range of key photophysical and electrochemical properties of 2,6&#8208;diarylpyryliums. Electronic absorption and emission maxima can be carefully tuned over the ranges of 83&#8197;nm and 102&#8197;nm respectively. Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions were revealed in cases of substitution with polarizable heavy&#8208;atoms. A strong linear dependence of ground state reduction potentials on substituent electronics was observed. Notably, the excited state reduction potential, E*red, could be controlled over a range of nearly 1000&#8197;mV. Systematic errors in computational modeling of ground and excited state redox potentials were identified and corrected. We believe the quantitative structure&#8208;property relationships identified here provide foundational tools for rational and predictive organic photocatalyst design.

This study demonstrates how the coordination conformation of a tris&#8208;amine molecule built on a central benzene frame changes when multimetallated by a different set of alkali metals







Abstract
Literature on Group One organoelement chemistry is dominated by lithium, though sodium and potassium also feature prominently, whereas rubidium and caesium are rarely mentioned. With recent breakthroughs hinting that organoelement compounds of these two heavier metals can perform better than their lighter congeners in particular applications, important advantages could be missed unless complete sets of alkali metals are included in studies. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a complete set of multi&#8208;alkali&#8208;metallated molecular compounds of the 1,3,5&#8208;tris[(4,6&#8208;dimethylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)aminomethyl]&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triethylbenzene framework. Made by deprotonating the framework N&#8722;H bonds by a suitable base, the set comprises six THF&#8208;solvated compounds, four of which are homometallic, either containing Li in a trinuclear structure or Na, K, and Rb in hexanuclear structures. Since deprotonation was incomplete with Cs, its homometallic compound is tetranuclear containing two un&#8208;metallated N&#8722;H bonds. A heterobimetallic trilithium&#8208;tricaesium hexanuclear compound was also obtained by using a bimetallic Li&#8722;Cs base for deprotonation. Such alkali&#8208;metallated frameworks are often precursors to other multimetallic frameworks with unique properties across different fields of science.

         <dc:description>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major pathogen linked to cystic fibrosis, relies on the virulence factors, lectins LecA and LecB, responsible for the cytotoxicity and adhesion to host cells. As inhibitors of these lectins, thiodisaccharides were synthesized including bispecific compounds targeting both lectins. Their inhibitory potential was confirmed, and structural insights were gained from ligand&#8208;lectin interactions.







Abstract
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent opportunistic human pathogen, particularly associated with cystic fibrosis. Among its virulence factors are the LecA and LecB lectins. Both lectins play an important role in the adhesion to the host cells and display cytotoxic activity. In this study, we successfully synthesized hardly hydrolysable carbohydrate ligands targeting these pathogenic lectins, including two bispecific glycans. The interactions between LecA/LecB lectins and synthetic glycans were evaluated using hemagglutination (yeast agglutination) inhibition assays, comparing their efficacy with corresponding monosaccharides. Additionally, the binding affinities of bispecific glycans were assessed using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Structural insight into the lectin&#8208;ligand interaction was obtained by determining the crystal structures of LecA/LecB lectins in complex with one of the bispecific ligands using X ray crystallography. This comprehensive investigation into the inhibitory potential of synthetic glycosides against P. aeruginosa lectins sheds light on their potential application in antimicrobial therapy.

         <title>Development of Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactions for the Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Alzheimer Drug Memantine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>

Memantine hydrochloride, an NMDA receptor antagonist used in Alzheimer's treatment, features an adamantane core with a bridgehead amino group. Its synthesis from acenaphthene involves hydrogenation, skeletal rearrangement, nitration, and reduction. Continuous&#8208;flow reactions were explored for each step to develop a continuous manufacturing process for memantine.







Abstract
Memantine hydrochloride, a non&#8208;competitive antagonist of NMDA&#8208;type glutamate receptors, is known to suppress the progression of symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. Possessing a characteristic adamantane skeleton as its core structure and an amino group at the bridgehead position, memantine was synthesized starting from acenaphthene. The synthesis involved nucleus hydrogenation of acenaphthene to perhydroacenaphthene, skeletal rearrangement of perhydroacenaphthene, nitration of 1,3&#8208;dimethyladamantane, and reduction of the nitro groups to an amino group. In each step, continuous flow reactions were investigated to achieve continuous manufacturing of memantine.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memantine hydrochloride, a non-competitive antagonist of NMDA-type glutamate receptors, is known to suppress the progression of symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. Possessing a characteristic adamantane skeleton as its core structure and an amino group at the bridgehead position, memantine was synthesized starting from acenaphthene. The synthesis involved nucleus hydrogenation of acenaphthene to perhydroacenaphthene, skeletal rearrangement of perhydroacenaphthene, nitration of 1,3-dimethyladamantane, and reduction of the nitro groups to an amino group. In each step, continuous flow reactions were investigated to achieve continuous manufacturing of memantine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanohybrids of 2D Black Phosphorus with Phthalocyanines: Role of Interfacial Interactions in Heterostructure Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 2D black phosphorus (bP)&#8211;phthalocyanine nanohybrids were prepared by liquid phase exfoliation of bP crystals with phthalocyanine (Pc) and Mn phthalocyanine (MnPc). Spectroscopic analyses revealed the development of heterostructures due to the interaction of bP with the aromatic and heteroaromatic rings of Pc, as well as coordinative bonds between P atoms and the empty d orbitals of Mn2+ in MnPc&#8208;bP hybrid.







Abstract
New 2D black phosphorus (bP)&#8211;phthalocyanine (Pc) nanohybrids have been synthesized by liquid phase exfoliation of black phosphorus crystals in the presence of two organic dyes: phthalocyanine (Pc) and manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc). The key role of the metal cation in the interfacial interaction between the organic dye and bP nanosheets was demonstrated by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and associated with an electron transfer between the metal cation Mn2+ and bP nanosheets, which resembles a coordinative chemical bond. On the other hand, the interaction between bP nanosheets and pure phthalocyanine is governed by van der Waals forces. The fluorescence of both hybrids is significantly reduced indicating effective separation of the photoinduced charge, implying the formation of a heterojunction between the organic molecules and the bP nanosheets. These findings provide important insights into the interfacial interactions in bP&#8208;Pc nanohybrids that are relevant for application in 2D organic/inorganic devices.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Insights on Gas Trapping of Noble Gases in MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Type Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

Isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks, MFU&#8208;4 and MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br, with anionic side ligands (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;), were synthesized for noble gas storage. Selecting the side ligand type fine&#8208;tuned the pore aperture size, effectively controlling gas entry and release. Experiments with krypton and xenon were complemented by computational modeling.







Abstract
Isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely MFU&#8208;4 and MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br, in which the pore apertures are defined by anionic side ligands (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;, respectively), were synthesized and loaded with noble gases. By selecting the type of side ligand, one can fine&#8208;tune the pore aperture size, allowing for precise regulation of the entry and release of gas guests. In this study, we conducted experiments to examine gas loading and release using krypton and xenon as model gases, and we complemented our findings with computational modeling. Remarkably, the loaded gas guests remained trapped inside the pores even after being exposed to air under ambient conditions for extended periods, in some cases for up to several weeks. Therefore, we focused on determining the energy barrier preventing gas release using both theoretical and experimental methods. The results were compared in relation to the types of hosts and guests, providing valuable insights into the gas trapping process in MOFs, as well as programmed gas release in air under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the crystal structure of MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br was elucidated using the three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3DED) technique, and the bulk purity of the sample was subsequently verified through Rietveld refinement.

Abstract
A cobalt(III)&#8208;catalyzed dual C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H activation of 2&#8208;arylimidazopyridines and its annulation with N&#8208;substituted maleimides leads to polycyclic aromatic heterocycles. This sustainable oxidative annulation uses earth&#8208;abundant, less toxic, and cost&#8208;effective cobalt(III) catalyst that complement expensive 2nd and 3rd&#8208;row metals. This oxidative annulation features a broad substrate scope with very good functional group tolerance. These maleimide&#8208;fused imidazopyridines display strong fluorescence in the region of 527&#8722; 536&#8197;nm with a Stokes shift of 83&#8722;87&#8197;nm and possess an excited state lifetime of 14.6&#8722;16.1 ns. Interestingly, such luminescent compounds show aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission (AEE) behavior in the iPr&#8208;OH/hexane mixed solvent system. Furthermore, field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM) reveals their spherical nano&#8208;aggregates with an average diameter of ~216.8&#8197;nm. They can also be used as cellular&#8208;imaging and picric acid&#8208;sensing probes.

         <title>Switch of Five Contiguous Chiral Centers in the Synthesis of Both Enantiomers of Hajos&#8211;Parrish Ketone Analogs via Diphenylprolinol Silyl Ether&#8208;Mediated Domino Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five continuous chiral centers were switched with excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity, which is a very rare enantiodivergent reaction. Both enantiomers of the functionalized Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone analogs were synthesized in the domino reaction using the same chiral organocatalyst under two slightly different conditions. Mechanism of the enantiodivergency was clarified.







Abstract
Both enantiomers of functionalized Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone (HPK) analogs were prepared with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities using the same chiral catalyst under two slightly different conditions. In condition A, dioxane was used as the solvent with 3 equivalents of water. In condition B, acetonitrile was used as the solvent with 30 equivalents of water, followed by epimerization with a base in a one&#8208;pot. The reaction consisted of a domino reaction including a diphenylprolinol silyl ether&#8211;mediated asymmetric Michael reaction and an intramolecular Henry reaction. In the Michael reaction, depending on the solvent and water amounts, syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;isomers were selectively synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity, in which the absolute configuration at C5 (indanone numbering) was opposite. The subsequent Henry reaction was diastereoselective, in which the C5 substituent controlled the three chiral centers in a highly diastereoselective manner. The final base treatment in condition B caused epimerization, changing the configuration at C6. Switching more than two chiral centers with high enantioselectivity is extremely difficult using the same chiral catalyst; the present reaction is a very rare enantiodivergent reaction that switches five continuous chiral centers with high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Potassium Phosphate&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of C4&#8208;Phosphorylated Quinolines via Cascade Cycloisomerization of Ynones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an efficient base&#8208;promoted cascade cycloisomerization of &#946;&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones with diphenylphosphine oxides, enabling straightforward synthesis of C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinolines under mild conditions. The method demonstrates broad substrate scope, high yields, and scalability. More importantly, a representative C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinoline exhibited potent inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus, highlighting the potential antimicrobial applications of these novel compounds.







Abstract
A cascade phosphorylation cycloisomerization of readily accessible ynones and diphenylphosphine oxides facilitated by potassium phosphate is described, allowing for the straightforward synthesis of C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinoline scaffolds. The formation of a C&#8722;P bond and a C&#8722;N bond is achieved in a single procedure without the need for pre&#8208;assembled quinoline cores prior to phosphorylation. This transformation operates without the requirement for metals or oxidants and exhibits excellent compatibility with various functional groups. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity evaluation demonstrated that the synthesized C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinoline derivatives exhibited potent inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus.

         <title>Open Sn Framework Structure Hosting Bi Guest atoms&#8211;Synthesis, Crystal and Electronic Structure of Na13Sn26Bi</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na13Sn26&#8208;xBi1+x is the first compound in the Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Bi ternary system. Sn atoms form a three&#8208;dimensional open framework hosting Na and also one loosely bound Bi guest atom. Interestingly, for both x=0 and x=2 results a semiconducting small indirect band gap Zintl compound owning the same atomic structure but different electron numbers.







Abstract
The large variety of structures of Zintl phases are generally well understood since their anionic substructures follow bonding rules according to the valence concept. But there are also exceptions, which make the semiconductors especially interesting in terms of structure&#8208;property relationships. Although several Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Pnictides with a variety of structural motives are known, up to this point no ternary compound in the Na&#8208;Sn&#8208;Bi system has been described. In this paper we present the Zintl&#8208;phase Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 comprising a complex, open&#8208;framework structure of Sn atoms, with one mixed Sn/Bi site, hosting Na atoms. An additional Bi atom is loosely connected with only weak contacts to the framework filling a larger cavity within the network. According to band structure calculations of the two ordered variants with either full occupation of the mixed site with Sn or Bi, resulting in Na13Sn26Bi and Na13Sn24Bi3, respectively, both compounds are semiconductors with band gaps of 0.5&#8197;eV. A comparison of the band structures with the structurally related binary compounds Na5Sn13 and Na7Sn12 shows that only the perfectly charge balanced Na7Sn12 is a semiconductor whereas Na5Sn13 is metallic. The rather specific electronic situation in the ternary compound is traced back to the loosely bound Bi atom, which acts as a guest atom according to Bix@Na13Sn26&#8208;yBiy, with x=1 and y=0.27, capable to change its oxidation state and thus to uptake additional electrons allowing the system to be a semiconductor. Therefore, Na13Sn25.73Bi1.27 can be understood as a rare example of an open framework structure of Sn atoms comprising Bi atoms in the cavities.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective &#947;&#8208;Trihalomethylation and &#947;&#8208;Dihalomethylidenation of Silyl Dienol Ethers under Organophotoredox Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
The first general synthesis of &#947;&#8208;tribromo and &#947;&#8208;trichloromethylated enals was achieved under mild organophotoredox catalyzed conditions with perfect regioselectivity. Importantly, a one&#8208;pot protocol was also reported to furnish the corresponding &#947;&#8208; dihalomethylidenated adducts.







Abstract
We report a general remote tribromo&#8208; and trichloromethylation process using CBr4 and CBrCl3 as ready available sources of trihalomethyl radicals. This method operates under mild and metal&#8208;free photocatalyzed conditions and enables the access to &#947;&#8208;trihalomethylated enals with complete regioselectivity in up to 71&#8201;% isolated yield. Importantly, this protocol is easily adapted to the selective one&#8208;pot synthesis of the corresponding &#947;&#8208;dihalomethylidenated enals in up to 49&#8201;% overall yield. Mechanistic studies are in favor of a radical chain propagation initiated by an oxidative quenching of the photocatalyst.

Self&#8208;assembly synthesis of silsesquioxane/acetate complex allows to isolate record high nuclear copper(II) Cu13&#8208;cage. Complex was evaluated as precatalyst in the Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone towards &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone.

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly synthesis of mixed&#8208;ligand (silsesquioxane/acetate) complex allows to isolate record high nuclear copper(II) Cu13&#8208;cage (1). In the presence of two additional sodium ions, a unique molecular architecture, with triple combination of ligands (cyclic and acyclic silsesquioxanes as well as acetates), has been formed. The structure was established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction based on the use of synchrotron radiation. Complex 1 was evaluated as precatalyst in the Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone towards &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone, employing hydrogen peroxide, tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) or m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) as oxidants, in an aqueous acidic acetonitrile medium. The direct formation of the lactone from cyclohexane via a tandem peroxidative oxidation/Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation was also studied. For both substrates, the best results (&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone yields up to 100&#8201;% or 26&#8201;%, from cyclohexanone or cyclohexane, respectively) were achieved with mCPBA under considerably mild conditions, i.&#8201;e., conventional heating at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 4&#8197;h or microwave (MW) irradiation at 80&#8201;&#176;C for only 30&#8197;minutes.

         <title>A Kagome Lattice of Lanthanide Atoms in a 2D Er&#8208;Directed Metal&#8208;Organic Coordination Network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deposition and subsequent annealing of TTDP molecules, bestowing pyridyl moieties to promote metal&#8208;organic bonding, along with Er atoms on a Au(111) surface, enables the creation of a well&#8208;defined kagome lattice of lanthanide elements.







Abstract
Kagome lattices have attracted much attention due the very interesting properties they can exhibit, both from the electronic and the magnetic points of view, although much of the experimental studies have been reported on 3D metals or 2D nanosheets. In the past few years, on&#8208;surface synthesis has allowed the fabrication of strictly monolayer 2D metal&#8208;organic networks, many of them containing transition metals. In this paper we report the fabrication and the study of the electronic and magnetic properties of a monolayer 2D metal&#8208;organic network where the nodes are lanthanide atoms forming a kagome lattice.

         <title>Biotin Conjugated Fe(III)&#8208;Triscatecholate Complex as Tumour Targeting T1 MRI Contrast Agent via Second Sphere Water Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biotin&#8208;conjugated Fe(III)&#8208;complex is reported as a potential T1&#8208;MRI contrast agent (CA), which functions via second&#8208;sphere water relaxation. It shows a comparable formation constant to the known siderophore Fe(III) model complexes. The biotin group is attached as a carrier to improve the specificity of CA and to increase the &#8216;payload&#8217; in the tumour cells.







Abstract
The biotin&#8208;conjugated Fe(III) catecholate complex [Fe(BioL)3]3&#8722;, Fe(BioL)3 (BioLH2=N&#8208;(3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenethyl)&#8208;5&#8208;((3aS,4S,6aR)&#8208;2&#8208;oxohexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;thieno[3,4&#8208;d]imidazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pentanamide) is reported as targeted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents (CAs) to increase the payload for early&#8208;stage imaging of tumours. The high spin state and octahedral coordination of the Fe(III) complex are confirmed by EPR spectra and DFT optimized structure, respectively. The overall formation constant (log K) of Fe(BioL)3 is determined as 45, which is higher than the known, more stable complex [Fe(EDTA)]. The complex Fe(BioL)3 exhibited r1 relaxivity of 3.09&#177;0.10 and 1.95&#177;0.09&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 37&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, at 1.41&#8197;T and pH&#8197;7.35 via second&#8208;sphere water interactions as due to the absence of inner water coordination. The interaction of Fe(BioL)3 with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) displayed enhanced relaxivity of 5.16&#177;0.15 and 10.0&#177;0.19&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, at 25&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;7.3 possibly via lengthening of rotational correlational time. The complex Fe(BioL)3 uptake studies with the avidin, a biotin&#8208;binding protein pocket, showed 46 and 37&#8201;% enhancements of r1 and r2 relaxivities. Complex Fe(BioL)3 showed 80&#8201;% cell viability of the human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells, and 89&#8201;% of iron has been uptaken into cells.

The catalyst F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF with three&#8208;dimensional nanosphere structure, which promotes the exposure of active sites through an increase in specific surface area, thereby enhancing both mass and charge transfer pathways. Furthermore, partial oxidation of CoFe hydroxide to CoFe (oxy)hydroxide as the active center can accelerating the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;related intermediates, which improves the corrosion resistance of alkaline electrolyte and seawater.







Abstract
Green hydrogen production can be achieved through electrolysis of fresh water or the use of renewable energy to electrolyze seawater. However, due to the low activity and poor stability of oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, direct electrolysis of alkaline seawater faces significant challenges. Herein, The catalyst F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF with three&#8208;dimensional nanosphere structure was prepared, The introduction of CO32&#8722; into the intermediate layer of CoFe hydroxide improves the corrosion resistance of alkaline electrolyte and the doping of F&#8722; is to design three&#8208;dimensional layered nanostructures, increase the active site, and accelerate the diffusion of the electrolyte. By in&#8197;situ Raman analysis, partial oxidation of CoFe hydroxide to CoFe (oxy)hydroxide as the active center can accelerating the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;related intermediates. In 1&#8197;M KOH, it requires overpotentials of 210&#8197;mV and 251&#8197;mV to drive current densities of 10 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. And it remained stable at the current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 120&#8197;h in 1&#8197;M KOH. F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF can also catalyzes the decomposition of electrolytic seawater. Compared with hydroxide, anion&#8208;doped carbonate hydroxide is more efficient and stable in electrolyte solution, which is of great importance for the development of a new stable electrocatalyst for water decomposition.

         <title>One&#8208;step Macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;Macrocycle Conversion Towards Two New Macrocyclic Arenes with Different Structures and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new macrocyclic arenes that showed different structures and photophysical properties were synthesized by a one&#8208;step macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;macrocycle conversion from carboxylic acid substituted octopus[3]arene. Moreover, both macrocycles had fixed conformations and electron&#8208;rich cavities, which enabled them to effectively complex various nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic guests in solution and the solid state.







Abstract
Two new macrocyclic arenes H1 and H2 were conveniently synthesized by the one&#8208;step reaction of carboxylic acid substituted octopus[3]arene. It was found that H1 was composed of three ethenoanthracene subunits with a rigid hexagonal structure and H2 contained two ethenoanthracene subunits and one anthracene subunit with a rigid house&#8208;shaped structure. Among them, H2 exhibited strong blue fluorescence due to the existence of an anthracene subunit. Moreover, both H1 and H2 showed large and electron&#8208;rich cavities, which enable them to effectively complex different nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic salt guests in solution and the solid state. It was further found that H2 exhibited stronger complexation towards the tested guests than H1 probably due to the stronger charge&#8208;transfer interactions between H2 and the guests.

         <title>Hybrid Particle Size Template Method for Controllable Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Multilevel Porous Carbon as High&#8208;Rate Zn&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitor Cathode Materials</title>

Nitrogen&#8208;doped multilevel porous carbon (NMPC) was prepared using a hybrid particle size (20 and 40&#8197;nm) MgO templates. Utilized as a cathode material for zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors, the NMPC prepared with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mass ratio of the two templates exhibited a high energy density and rate performance due to the unique pore structure and nitrogen doping.







Abstract
Achieving high rate performance without compromising energy density has always been a critical objective for zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs). The pore structure and surface properties of carbon cathode materials play a crucial role. We propose utilizing a hybrid particle size (20 and 40&#8197;nm) magnesium oxide templates to regulate the pore structure of nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon derived from the soybean isolate. The multilevel pore structure enhanced ion transport efficiency while also improving the utilization of micropores. Nitrogen doping and oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups enhanced the wettability of carbon materials with aqueous electrolytes and facilitated the chemisorption of Zn2+ on the carbon material surface. The nitrogen&#8208;doped multilevel porous carbon material (HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1) prepared with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mass ratio of the two templates exhibited a specific capacity of 146.65&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, the Swagelok cells assembled with HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1 and Zn foil achieved a high energy density of 121.5&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1, high power output of 166&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and 93.09&#8201;% capacity retention after 8000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Therefore, HT&#8208;NMPC&#8208;1/1 is a highly promising candidate for ZHSCs cathode materials. Furthermore, the novel pore regulation strategy and straightforward preparation method offer valuable reference points for other porous carbon&#8208;based functional materials.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Spacer Engineering: Driving Near&#8208;infrared Aggregation Induced&#8208;emission and Mechanofluorochromism in Carbazole&#8208;biscyanostilbenes</title>

Unveiling the power of &#960;&#8208;spacer engineering, two novel carbazole&#8208;based bis&#8208;cyanostilbenes featuring phenyl and thiophene reveal distinct photophysical behaviors. The thiophene derivative shifts to far&#8208;red/NIR solid&#8208;state emission (732&#8197;nm), while the phenyl analogue stands out with exceptional quantum yields and strong solid&#8208;state luminescence. Both compounds demonstrate strong AIE, thermal stability, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior, highlighting their potential for next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;emissive optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
In this study, we report the design and synthesis of two novel carbazole&#8208;based bis&#8208;cyanostilbenes incorporating phenyl and thiophene &#960;&#8208;spacer units to investigate their distinct impacts on photophysical properties. Notably, the thiophene&#8208;based derivative exhibits remarkable far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) solid&#8208;state emission, with an emission peak at 732&#8197;nm, which shifts to 750&#8197;nm upon mechanical grinding, demonstrating pronounced mechanochromic fluorescence in the NIR region. Although its quantum yield is moderate, the ability to modulate its emission through mechanical stimuli opens exciting opportunities for stimuli&#8208;responsive NIR applications. Conversely, the phenyl&#8208;based analogue shows excellent solid&#8208;state emission at 596&#8197;nm, achieving significantly higher quantum yields, due to suppressing &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. Both compounds also exhibit strong AIE, with the thiophene system emitting at 730&#8197;nm and the phenyl&#8208;based analogue at 580&#8197;nm in the aggregate state. In addition to their optical properties, both derivatives demonstrate remarkable thermal stability and reversible MFC. These intriguing behaviors highlight the critical role of &#960;&#8208;spacer engineering in fine&#8208;tuning solid&#8208;state emission, enhancing stimuli&#8208;responsive capabilities, and ensuring robust thermal performance. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the design of next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;emissive materials, with promising potential for advancing applications in optoelectronics, bioimaging, and smart sensing technologies.

         <title>Orthogonal Functionalization of Oxo&#8208;Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxo&#8208;graphene nanoribbons (oxo&#8208;GNRs), created by unzipping single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs), are orthogonally functionalized at their rims and &#960;&#8208;surfaces using hydrazine derivatives and diazonium salts. This study highlights successful sequential functionalization of up to 40&#8201;% edge atoms and 4&#8201;% basal plane atoms. Such modifications enhance oxo&#8208;GNRs&#8217; potential in nanoelectronics and offer broader application possibilities for oxo&#8208;functionalized materials.







Abstract
Oxo&#8208;graphene nanoribbons (oxo&#8208;GNRs) can be prepared by the oxidative unzipping of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes. We present an orthogonal functionalization method for the functionalization of the rims and the &#960;&#8208;surface, respectively, what is only possible due to the high rim portion in oxo&#8208;GNRs. In particular, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy could be used to follow the reaction and detect the marker atoms contained in the addends. We propose that the reported orthogonal functionalization strategy can also be applied on other oxo&#8208;functionalized carbon materials, such as graphene quantum dots, or reduced graphene oxide flakes.

         <title>Activation of CO2, CS2, and COS by &#945;&#8208;Diimine&#8208;Stabilized Gallylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New &#945;&#8208;diimine&#8208;ligated gallylenes [LGa:]&#8722; were synthesized, which react with CO2, CS2, and COS via diverse pathways. 1) Reductive disproportionation of CO2 gives carbonate and oxo&#8208;carbonate complexes; 2) Reductive coupling of CS2 affords ethenetetrathiolate [C2S4]4&#8722; complexes; 3) Reductive disproportionation of COS yields a disulfide&#8208;bridged complex or a dithiocarbonate (S2CO)2&#8722; complex.







Abstract
Several gallylenes [LPhGaM(THF)n] stabilized by an &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand (LPh=[(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(Ph)]22&#8722;; M=Li, n=3, 3&#8208;Li; M=Na, n=4, 3&#8208;Na; M=K, n=1, 3&#8208;K) were prepared, which display diverse reactivities toward carbon dioxide and its sulfurized analogues. The reaction of 3 with CO2 yielded a trimeric carbonate complex [{LPhGa(CO3)2}3{&#956;&#8208;K9(THF)6}] (4) and a dinuclear oxo&#8208;carbonate complex [K2(THF)6][LPhGa(&#956;&#8208;CO3)(&#956;&#8208;O)GaLPh] (5) in one pot through reductive disproportionation of CO2. For CS2, two ethenetetrathiolate gallium complexes, [M2(Solv)4][LPhGa(&#956;&#8208;C2S4)GaLPh] (M=Na, Solv=THF, 6; M=K, Solv=DME, 7), were obtained via reductive coupling of CS2. In the case of COS, disproportionation gave a disulfide&#8208;bridged complex [K2(THF)6] [LPhGa(&#956;&#8208;S)2GaLPh] (8) at room temperature, but a dithiocarbonate [Na2(THF)5][LPhGa(S2CO)]2 (9) at low temperature, the latter being the first example of dithiocarbonates of p&#8208;block elements.

         <title>Imaging Dihydrogen Bond&#8208;Driven Assembly of Borazine on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the first observation of dihydrogen bonding (DHB) in borazine assemblies on a Au(111) surface using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the stabilization mechanisms behind single and double DHB configurations, revealing the crucial role of DHBs in the self&#8208;assembly processes of borazine on metal surfaces.







Abstract
Dihydrogen bonding (DHB) is a peculiar type of attractive interaction occurring between a partially positively charged hydrogen atom and a partially negatively charged hydrogen atom. Borazine represents a prototypical molecule exhibiting dihydrogen bonding in both gas phase, as well as in its crystalline form. For borazine assemblies on solid surfaces, a direct observation and characterization of dihydrogen bonding has remained elusive, possibly due to an intricate interplay of substrate&#8208;molecule and intermolecular interactions. Here we present evidence of dihydrogen bonding occurring in borazine assemblies on a Au(111) surface. By means of low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we unveiled distinct configurations, exhibiting single and double dihydrogen bonding. Density functional theory calculations elucidate the interplay between substrate adsorption and intermolecular interactions to stabilize the formation of borazine dimers on Au(111). The dimers constitute the building blocks for the formation of larger assemblies.

         <title>Triskelion&#8208;Shaped Hexabenzocoronenes: Synthesis and Characterization of Tris&#8208;Substituted HBC Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 5, January 22, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new five step synthetic approach for tris&#8208;iodinated hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs). These molecules serve as precursors for the synthesis of a library of seven triskelion&#8208;shaped HBCs via Sonogashira cross coupling reactions. Furthermore, the optoelectronic properties of the compounds are presented and discussed.







Abstract
The synthesis of unprecedented triskelion&#8208;shaped hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with C3, C3h or D3h symmertry is reported. We present a new, five step synthetic access to tris&#8208;iodinated HBC derivatives carrying different solubilizing moieties (tert&#8208;butyl and mesityl), which serve as suitable building blocks for further functionalization. These molecules can undergo Sonogashira cross coupling reactions to obtain a series of seven ethynyl tris&#8208;substituted HBCs. The coupling partners range from carbon&#8208;based aromatic scaffolds (tBu&#8208;benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene) to ligands for metal complexes (bipyridine, phenanthroline, terpyridine, acetylacetone). The optoelectronic properties were investigated by UV/vis absorption spectroscopy resulting in a significant bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum compared to the iodinated starting material. Semiempirical calculations were used to determine the conformation and symmetry of the compounds.

Boron in focus: Lewis acidic borocations have been stabilized by singlet and highly ambiphilic bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (BICAAC). These borocations, well separated from the weakly coordinating bulky counterion, are an attractive choice for homogeneous Lewis acid catalysis. The reactivity of these borocations with hydride functionality has been demonstrated in the hydrosilylation of carbonyls. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Singh and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403322).

         <dc:description>
Dihydrogen bonding (DHB) is a unique interaction between hydrogen atoms with opposite partial charges. Our study provides the first direct observation of DHB in borazine assemblies on Au(111) by using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Supported by density functional theory, we reveal how DHB stabilizes single&#8208; and double&#8208;bonding configurations, playing a pivotal role in borazine's self&#8208;assembly on metal surfaces.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dihydrogen bonding&lt;/b&gt; (DHB) is a unique interaction between hydrogen atoms with opposite partial charges. Our study provides the first direct observation of DHB in borazine assemblies on Au(111) by using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Supported by density functional theory, we reveal how DHB stabilizes single- and double-bonding configurations, playing a pivotal role in borazine's self-assembly on metal surfaces.

The Cover Feature illustrates the different kinetics in the association/dissociation reaction of methylated 1,3,6,2&#8208;dioxazaborocanes (DOAB). The observed rate constants were very fast for non&#8208;methylated DOAB and up to 100&#8201;000 times slower for the tetramethylated analogue.

         <dc:description>
In this study, the fundamental theories of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries are systematically reviewed. Then, focusing on solid electrolytes, key challenges faced by solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries are systematically discussed, and the interface modification strategies of solid electrolytes are reviewed in detail. Finally, the future industrial development of sodium&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state batteries is prospected.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries have abundant sources of raw materials, uniform geographical distribution, and low cost, and it is considered an important substitute for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Thereinto, solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries have the advantages of low raw material cost, high safety, and high energy density, and it has shown great potential for application in the fields of mobile power, electric vehicles, and large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, the commercial development and large&#8208;scale application of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries urgently need to address issues such as the low room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes, high interfacial charge transfer impedance, and poor compatibility and contact between the solid electrolytes and the electrodes. Herein, this paper systematically discusses the basic theories of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries, including working principles and characteristics, electrode materials and components, and solid electrolytes. Then, focusing on solid electrolytes, the key scientific challenges faced by solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries were systematically discussed, and the application of interface modification in enhancing solid&#8208;state electrolytes was reviewed. Finally, the future industrial development of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries was prospected. This review helps to deepen the understanding of the interface scientific issues of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries and provides theoretical guidance for its development and application. Furthermore, this review also provides the necessary engineering theoretical guidance to accelerate the large&#8208;scale commercial application of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which has significant scientific value and profound social significance.

         <title>Exploring the Metal&#8208;Centered Reactivity of Isomeric, N&#8208;Bridged Biscyclometalated Platinum(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of new N&#8208;bridged bis(phenylpyridine)platinum(II) complexes is explored, uncovering the chemical and photophysical properties of Pt(IV) monomers and Pt(III) dimers. The mystery of the Pt(III) dimers is unraveled, implicating the bulky phenylenes on the bridging nitrogen and the isomeric binding pockets as co&#8208;factors in destabilizing the rare intermetallic Pt&#8211;Pt bond.







Abstract
The field of platinum chemistry is ubiquitous in the research of anticancer drugs and new OLED materials. Within the vast library of existing compounds, the majority of work focuses on complexes in the +2 and +4 oxidation states, with comparatively few examples of PtIII complexes reported without bridging ligands. PtIII complexes with metal&#8208;metal bonding can be made by mild oxidation of PtII complexes having bis(phenylpyridine) ligands. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of two new PtII complexes bearing tetradentate N&#8208;bridged bis(phenylpyridine) ligands with N^C*C^N and C^N*N^C coordinating atoms. Through chemical oxidation with PhICl2 and N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide, we obtained four new complexes containing PtIV and PtIII centres. The dynamics of the PtIII&#160;complexes were explored by variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies and showed surprisingly free rotation of the appended N&#8208;aryl group. This work uncovers the importance of the destabilizing nature of the bulky N&#8208;aryl group on intermetallic bonds, and sheds light on how the molecular rotation observed in the PtIII compounds could inspire new molecular rotors driven by intermetallic bonds.

         <title>Peptide&#8211;Bismuth Tricycles: Maximizing Stability by Constraint</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A challenge in drug discovery is creating peptides that are sufficiently stable. By progressively increasing structural constraint through macrocyclization chemistry in combination with bismuth binding &#8211; from linear to cyclic, bicyclic, and finally tricyclic peptides &#8211; we greatly enhance peptide stability without compromising activity. This yields bismuth&#8211;peptide tricycles that remain stable at cellular glutathione concentrations and in plasma.







Abstract
Constrained peptides possess excellent properties for identifying lead compounds in drug discovery. While it has become increasingly straightforward to discover selective high&#8208;affinity peptide ligands, especially through genetically encoded libraries, their stability and bioavailability remain significant challenges. By integrating macrocyclization chemistry with bismuth binding, we generated series of linear, cyclic, bicyclic, and tricyclic peptides with identical sequences. Utilizing bismuth to rigidify the peptide structure allows for a better comparison of different constraint levels, reducing confounding effects of interactions often seen with hydrophobic stapling reagents. Our study facilitated the identification of a peptide&#8211;bismuth tricycle that fully withstands cellular levels of glutathione, acts as a nanomolar protease inhibitor without being proteolytically digested by its target, and is fully stable in human plasma. Importantly, this multicyclic peptide does not possess any non&#8208;canonical amino acid modifications. Using oxime ligation, we conjugated an analogue of this tricycle to the N&#8208;terminus of two nanobodies to demonstrate potential applications in targeted therapy.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 Reductive Elimination from Neutral Four&#8208;Coordinate Cu(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct pathways for C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination from a well&#8208;defined neutral 4&#8208;coordinate Cu(III) complex were identified. In medium polar solvent DCE, the reaction occurs mainly via a concerted bond&#8208;break/bond formation pathway, while in polar solvent DMF, the reaction proceeds via a rate&#8208;determining ligand dissociation pathway.







Abstract
A solvent dependent C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 bond&#8208;forming reductive elimination from neutral four&#8208;coordinate Cu(III) complexes [(L)CuIII(CF3)2(CH2CO2tBu)] (L=pyridine or its derivatives) is described. Reactions in less polar solvent ClCH2CH2Cl proceed via a concerted bond breaking/bond forming process along with the reorientation of the ligand, while reaction in polar solvent DMF occurs via a rate limiting ligand&#8208;dissociation, followed by C(sp3)&#8722;CF3 reductive elimination from the resulting three&#8208;coordinate intermediate. These mechanistic proposals are supported by kinetic studies that included ligand and temperature effects, as well as DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;Two distinct pathways for C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bond-forming reductive elimination from a well-defined neutral 4-coordinate Cu(III) complex were identified. In medium polar solvent DCE, the reaction occurs mainly via a concerted bond-break/bond formation pathway, while in polar solvent DMF, the reaction proceeds via a rate-determining ligand dissociation pathway.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solvent dependent C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bond-forming reductive elimination from neutral four-coordinate Cu(III) complexes [(L)Cu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu)] (L=pyridine or its derivatives) is described. Reactions in less polar solvent ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl proceed via a concerted bond breaking/bond forming process along with the reorientation of the ligand, while reaction in polar solvent DMF occurs via a rate limiting ligand-dissociation, followed by C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reductive elimination from the resulting three-coordinate intermediate. These mechanistic proposals are supported by kinetic studies that included ligand and temperature effects, as well as DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stepwise Modulation of Bridged Single&#8208;Benzene&#8208;Based Fluorophores for Materials Science</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library consisting of five single&#8208;benzene&#8208;based fluorophores was designed. Changing the bridging atoms between oxygen and nitrogen significantly impacts the photophysical properties in solution, the solid&#8208;state, and 3D&#8208;printed materials. This results in high quantum yield values and environmentally insensitive behavior. Using the full&#8208;color range of these compounds, white light emission was attained utilizing stereolithography.







Abstract
In recent years, researchers studying fluorogenic samples have steadily shifted from using large, expensive, poorly soluble fluorophores with complex synthetic sequences to smaller, simpler &#960; scaffolds with low molecular weight. This research article presents an in&#8208;depth study of the photophysical properties of five bridged single&#8208;benzene&#8208;based fluorophores (SBBFs) investigated for their solution and solid&#8208;state emission (SSSE) properties. The compounds O4, N1O3, N2O2, N3O1, and N4 are derived from a central terephthalonitrile core and vary in the amount of oxygen and nitrogen bridging atoms. These minimalized emitters show full&#8208;color tunable emission properties and exhibit moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield values reaching up to 0.78 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In addition to demonstrating excellent compatibility in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films and additive manufacturing using stereolithography (SLA), white light emission was achieved in both solution and 3D&#8208;printed materials by controlling the mixing ratio of the compounds. Employing density&#8208;functional theory (DFT), well&#8208;correlating theoretical absorption and emission wavelengths were calculated as average values of the different possible conformers. Furthermore, cellular internalization of the substances was accomplished using Pluronic&#174; F&#8208;127 nanoparticles. Overall, this study emphasizes the remarkable properties of single&#8208;benzene&#8208;based emitters, showcasing their accessibility and potential applications in biomedical fields and materials science.

         <title>Programming Green Light&#8208;Responsive Hydrogels: From Photo&#8208;Weakening to Photo&#8208;Unresponsiveness and Photo&#8208;Strengthening</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light response of CarHc protein&#8208;based hydrogels can be alterted from photo&#8208;weakening, to photo&#8208;strengthening, or becoming light&#8208;unresponsive depending on the added cofactors AdoCbl and Co2+. Under green light, CarHc tetramers disassembly weakens the hydrogel, while excess AdoCbl crosslinking poly&#8208;histidine tags strengthens it. This AdoCbl&#8208;induced photo&#8208;responsiveness expands the potential applications of these hydrogels as adaptable responsive systems.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive hydrogels are highly valued for their dynamic mechanical properties and biocompatibility. In this study, we present a hydrogel system that can either soften or strengthen on green light exposure, or remain unresponsive to light, depending on the addition of adenosyl cobalamin (AdoCbl) and Co2+. These protein&#8208;based hydrogels were formed using genetically encoded SpyTag&#8208;SpyCatcher chemistry and included green light&#8208;sensitive CarHc protein domains. As previously reported, these hydrogels formed in the dark with the addition of AdoCbl, due to the tetramerization of the CarHc domains. Upon green light exposure, the CarHc tetramers disassembled, leading to a rapid transition from gel to sol. Interestingly, we discovered that an excess of AdoCbl leads to photo&#8208;strengthening rather than photo&#8208;weakening. This occurred because light exposure induces interchain crosslinks between AdoCbl and poly&#8208;histidine tags (His6&#8208;tags) of the proteins. Furthermore, incorporating Co2+ ions enhanced hydrogel stiffness by coordinating to His6&#8208;tags. This not only suppressed photo&#8208;weakening but also promoted photo&#8208;strengthening behaviour. These findings highlight the role of His6&#8208;tags in photochemical crosslinking with excess AdoCbl and in coordination to Co2+ ions, providing a novel strategy for designing tuneable, light responsiveness in materials.

We have developed an efficient synthesis of fluoroalkenes via tandem electrochemical dehalogenation&#8208;elimination protocol. The key step is the generation of carbon anion by electrochemical reductive dehalogenation of alkyl halides. Various gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and monofluoroalkenes were prepared in moderate to good yields from &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylated/&#945;&#8208;trifluoro methylated benzyl halides.

         <title>Electrochemical Deconstruction of Waste Polyvinylidene Chloride (PVDC) to Value&#8208;Added Products in Batch and Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical deconstruction of polyvinylidene chloride produces value&#8208;added chemicals and provides a solution to recycle halogenated polymers. The inevitable challenges, e.&#8201;g., high chlorine content and facile release of HCl, are found advantageous in the present strategy, which was further translated to flow at a 6.0&#8197;mmol scale. Chlorinated compounds were produced with high efficiency, together with a very high degree of dechlorination (98&#8201;%).







Abstract
Chlorinated polymers have made enormous contributions to materials science and are commercially produced on a large scale. These chlorinated polymers could be recycled as chlorine sources to efficiently produce valuable chlorinated compounds owing to their facile release of HCl. Although the thermal stability of PVDC is low compared to PVC, this can be advantageous in terms of easy and fast dehydrochlorination. Herein, we report an efficient electrochemical chlorination using poly(vinylidene chloride) (PVDC) as a chlorine source that works in an undivided cell and applies to a good number of examples. This method works on commodity polymers such as waste PVDC&#8208;PVC pharma blister film, PVDC&#8208;PO multilayer food packaging, and compression molded sheets of Ixan PVDC (with heat stabilizer) with similar efficiency. Furthermore, this method also provides the dechlorination of PVDC up to 98&#8201;%, leading to unsaturated dechlorinated material. Converting PVDC into more stable unsaturated compounds, the release of harmful chlorine&#8208;containing gases during incineration can be minimized. Additionally, this method is not only restricted to batch processes but an electroflow process for PVDC dechlorination and electrosynthesis has also been demonstrated.

         <title>Synthesis and Chiroptical Activity of &#960;&#8208;Expanded Electron&#8208;rich Heterohelicenes Based on the 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and chiroptical characteristics of the first (double) helicenes possesing the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole (DHPP) moiety as their central core. We have developed a three&#8208;step synthesis with 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization accompanied with HBr elimination as its key step. We found that, whereas for smaller periphereal arms double 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization occurs smoothly forming a double helicene, in the case of longer policyclic aromatic hydrocarbons the reaction becomes less efficient and mono&#8208;helicenes are the only products. An analysis of the electron density distribution of LUMO explains the different regioselectivity of 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization. The synthesized heterohelicenes are characterized by greenish blue emission, distinct solvatofluorochromism and good fluorescence quantum yields (up to 42%). Moreover, the chiralooptical measurements reveal that unsymmetrical double heterohelicene exhibits excellent circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) reaching 30 M&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;1. The combined experimental and computational study has revealed that a charge&#8208;transfer state is responsible for the observed emission (hence the solvatochromism), while low&#8208;energy absorption derives from multiple transitions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Transient Cationic Phosphaborene and its Trapping by Facile Aliphatic C&#8211;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of a transient cationic phosphaborene [(Mes*)P=B(CAAC)]+ (Mes* = 2,4,6,&#8208;trit&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl, CAAC = cyclic alkylamino carbene) by halide abstraction from the B&#8208;brominated analogue is reported. This species was found to undergo rapid and selective intramolecular aliphatic C&#8211;H bond activation to yield a phosphinoborenium cation, which undergoes facile deprotonation to give a cyclic base&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene. Computational investigation of the mechanism of C&#8211;H activation indicates a boron&#8208;centred activation route with an exceptionally low barrier of 8 kJ mol&#8722;1, followed by a nearly barrierless hydride migration from boron to phosphorus. This underscores the enhanced reactivity of phosphaborenes compared to their lighter iminoborane analogues and indicates that steric stabilization alone is likely insufficient to isolate persistent cationic phosphaborenes, necessitating the use of alternative design strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Serine Labeling in Nonaqueous, Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemoselective modification of alkylalcohols (e.g., serine residues) on proteins has been a daunting challenge especially in aqueous media. Herein, we report chemical modifications of alkylalcohols in protein and cell lysate samples using carboxylic acid&#8208;based bioconjugation media. The acidic medium is not only useful to suppress reactivity of other nucleophiles in proteins, but the medium also serves as a potentially biomolecule&#8208;compatible solvent. The acid&#8208;catalyzed acylation strategy has a unique selectivity paradigm compared to the common active&#8208;serine&#8208;targeted method and would act as a new strategy for studying biological roles of serine residues.</dc:description>

         <title>A Unique Intramolecular Redox Reaction by Unidirectional Migration of Three Hydrogen Atoms: Theoretical Elucidation of the 3H&#8208;Transfer Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intramolecular migration of three hydrogen atoms from one moiety of a gaseous radical cation to the other prior to fragmentation is an extremely rare type of redox reaction. Within the scope of this investigation, this scenario requires an ionized but electron&#8208;rich arene acceptor bearing a para&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxyalkyl) residue. The precise mechanism of such unidirectional 3H transfer processes, including the order of the individual H transfer steps, has remained unclear in spite of previous isotope labelling and recent infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS) studies. Herein, the details of this peculiar process have been investigated for ionized 4&#8208;(N,N&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;butanol, 2, by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energetically most favorable pathway consists of a sequence of successive 1,4&#8208;, 1,6&#8208; and 1,5&#8208;H steps. During these steps the secondary alcohol functionality is oxidized to a carbonyl group and the radical&#8208;cationic aniline ring is reduced to an ionized 2,3&#8208;dihydroaniline unit. Several alternative sequences, such as three successive 1,5&#8208;H shifts, could be excluded. A concomitant unidirectional 2H migration reaction of the ion 2 was also investigated and the intermediacy of ion&#8208;neutral complexes (INCs) enabling sequential hydride and proton transfer was confirmed by the calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Liquid Synthesis of Atomic Molybdenum Nitride Clusters as Bifunctional Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Zn&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A bifunctional molybdenum nitride (MoN) atomic cluster electrocatalyst, synthesized via an in&#8208;situ and ionic&#8208;liquid process, exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic activities for zinc&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMNs) have garnered considerable attention for energy conversion applications owing to their exceptional electronic structures and high catalytic activities. However, the scarcity of active sites in TMNs impedes their large&#8208;scale application. This study describes the use of wetness impregnation and ionic&#8208;liquid methods to enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency of molybdenum nitride (MoN) atomic clusters finely dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (MoN@NC) substrates. The as&#8208;synthesized electrocatalysts feature atomically dispersed MoN clusters, achieving an impressive onset potential of 0.93&#8197;V vs. RHE for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and maintaining an overpotential of just 295&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA/cm2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The MoN@NC&#8208;based zinc&#8211;air battery demonstrated a high&#8208;power density of 151&#8197;mW/cm2, a robust specific discharge capacity of 759 mAh/gZn at 20&#8197;mA/cm2, and superior charge&#8211;discharge cycling stability exceeding 190 cycles. The detailed experimental characterization revealed that the uniformly dispersed MoN clusters served as the primary active sites driving the observed catalytic performance. Additionally, the present findings suggested significant correlations between the phase of the material, crystallization, atomic cluster distribution, support porosity, and nitridation temperature. These insights are expected to refine strategies for achieving atomically dispersed nitrides with optimized ORR performance.

         <title>Structures of Gas&#8208;Phase Hydrated Phosphotyrosine Revealed by Soft X&#8208;ray Action Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;phase near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption mass spectrometry (NEXAMS) reveals the effects of a single water molecule on protonated phosphotyrosine at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges. The water molecule bonds with the phosphate group, altering the spectral features. Comparisons with density functional theory calculations identify three potential hydrated structures.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;phase near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption mass spectrometry (NEXAMS) was employed at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges to probe the influence of a single water molecule on the protonated phosphotyrosine molecule. The results of the photodissociation experiments revealed that the water molecule forms two bonds, with the phosphate group and another chemical group. By comparing the NEXAMS spectra at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges with density functional theory calculations, we attributed the electronic transitions responsible for the observed resonances, especially the transitions due to the presence of the water molecule. We showed that the water molecule leads to a specific spectral feature in the partial ion yield of hydrated fragments at 536.4&#8197;eV. Moreover, comparing the NEXAMS spectra with the calculated structures allowed us to identify three possible structures for singly hydrated phosphotyrosine that agree with the observed fragmentation and resonances.

         <title>Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of CO2, Esters and Epoxides with Pinacolborane: Selective Synthesis of Methanol in Multigram Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a selective reduction of CO2 to methanol with HBpin in 99&#8201;% yield catalyzed by homoleptic cerium amide, establishing its potential as an excellent catalyst by preparing multigram&#8208;scale methanol. A practical application is also shown by reducing motorbike emitted CO2 to methanol. We also hydroborated challenging esters and reduced epoxides selectively.







Abstract
In this work, we have reduced CO2 with HBpin to afford borylated methanol product selectively in ~99&#8201;% yield using Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as a catalyst. This led to multigram scale isolation of methanol obtained from CO2 reduction via the hydrolysis of borylated methanol, this establishes the potential of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as an efficient homogeneous catalyst for the bulk scale methanol synthesis. A practical application of this catalytic system was also shown by reducing CO2&#8208;containing motorbike exhaust efficiently and selectively. Further, C&#8722;O bond activation of esters and epoxides using HBpin and 1&#8211;2&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 at 60&#8201;&#176;C afforded the borylated alcohols in good to excellent yields, which can easily be hydrolysed to the eco&#8208;friendly corresponding alcohol. The stoichiometric experiments were performed to prove the formation of in&#8208;situ generated cerium hydride [Ce]&#8208;H as an active catalyst.

This work presents a modular chemo&#8208;optogenetic system using azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) to reversibly control protein dimerization/proximity. This system enables reversible control of protein function using orthogonal green/blue and red/blue light







Abstract
Chemically induced dimerization/proximity (CID/CIP) systems controlled by chemical dimerizers (also known as molecular glues) provide valuable means for understanding and manipulating complex, dynamic biological systems. In this study, we present the development of versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic systems utilizing azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) for reversible protein dimerization controlled by visible light. These systems allow multiple cycles of light&#8208;induced dimerization, overcoming the limitations of irreversible photolysis in previous systems. Through optimizing photoswitch properties and linker strategies, we achieved efficient and reversible control using blue, green, and red light. We demonstrate that these systems enable rapid and reversible control of protein function in&#8197;vitro and in cells. The findings represent a significant advancement in chemo&#8208;optogenetics, offering opportunities to expand applications requiring precise spatiotemporal regulation of dynamic biological processes.

Two pairs of AIE&#8208;active TADF enantiomers were successfully designed and synthesized through isomer engineering. Notably, the CP&#8208;OLED devices, fabricated by solution&#8208;process, exhibited vivid CP&#8208;EL signals with the EQEmax of 2.7&#8201;%/10.2&#8201;%, low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 3.7&#8201;%/16.7&#8201;% at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 and |gEL| values of 6.73&#215;10&#8722;4/1.19&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively.







Abstract
Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) have significant promise for naked&#8208;eye 3D displays. However, most devices are fabricated using vacuum deposition technology, and development of efficient solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs, particularly those exhibiting low efficiency roll&#8208;off, remains a formidable challenge. This research successfully designed and synthesized two pairs of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) enantiomers through isomer engineering, namely (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;5&#8208;TPA and (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;4&#8208;TPA, which features fifth and fourth substitution sites of phthalimide (acceptor) by tri&#8208;phenylamine (donor), respectively. Both molecules displayed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Notably, the CP&#8208;OLED devices, fabricated by solution&#8208;process, exhibited vivid blue&#8208;green and green emission with the maximum current efficiency of 7.4 and 29.6&#8197;cd A&#8722;1, the external quantum efficiency of 2.7&#8201;% and 10.2&#8201;%, and the low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 3.7&#8201;% and 16.7&#8201;%. Moreover, these devices demonstrated CP&#8208;EL signals with gEL values of +6.61&#215;10&#8722;4 /&#8722;6.84&#215;10&#8722;4 and +1.13&#215;10&#8722;3/&#8722;1.25&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively.

         <title>Influence of Asymmetrical Ligand Substitution on the Formation, Stability, and Reactivity of Ruthenium(III)&#8208;Hypochlorite Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the role of hypochlorite enzymes in biological processes, particularly metal&#8208;hypochlorite. Researchers examined the effects of methyl substitution on ligands and characterized non&#8208;heme Ru(III)&#8208;hypochlorite intermediates. Stable ruthenium hypochlorite adducts were synthesized and shown to mimic heme&#8208;dependent enzymes, catalyzing key reactions like hydrogen atom abstraction and oxygen atom transfer.







Abstract
Hypohalites are commonly generated in biological systems, mostly with functions related to defense and immune system response. These hypohalites can bind to metal centers and are known for their strong oxidizing properties that play crucial roles in various biological processes. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of novel biomimetic Ru(III)&#8208;hypochlorite complexes and focus the work on the electronic effects associated with the incorporation of methyl groups in a pentadentate ligand framework in an asymmetric fashion. The intermediates are stable at room temperature and were characterized by mass spectrometry, UV&#8208;vis absorption, resonance Raman and EPR spectroscopy. We show for the first time that the resultant ruthenium&#8208;hypochlorite adducts function as an electrophilic oxidant and efficiently catalyze hydrogen atom abstraction reactions from phenol and oxygen atom transfer reactions with dimethylsulfide.

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Experimentation Enables the Development of a Nickel&#8208;catalyzed Cyanation Platform for (Hetero)aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE), we have identified a general set of conditions to rapidly assess the feasibility of nickel&#8208;catalyzed cyanation of (hetero)aryl halides at low catalyst loading (1.5&#8197;mol%). This novel screening platform provides a useful starting point for the selection of other nickel precatalysts or for further optimization of reluctant substrates.







Abstract
A novel screening platform for the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cyanation of (hetero)aryl halides relying on the use of air&#8208;stable Ni(COD)DQ at low loading is reported. Through high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE), various ligand and solvent combinations are systematically explored, allowing the fast identification of suitable conditions. This standardized workflow serves as an excellent starting point for selecting other competent nickel precatalysts and for further optimization of reluctant substrates. The transformation exhibits broad functional group tolerance and can be readily scaled up to gram&#8208;scale.

     alt="High-throughput Experimentation Enables the Development of a Nickel-catalyzed Cyanation Platform for (Hetero)aryl Halides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using high-throughput experimentation (HTE), we have identified a general set of conditions to rapidly assess the feasibility of nickel-catalyzed cyanation of (hetero)aryl halides at low catalyst loading (1.5&#8197;mol%). This novel screening platform provides a useful starting point for the selection of other nickel precatalysts or for further optimization of reluctant substrates.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel screening platform for the nickel-catalyzed cyanation of (hetero)aryl halides relying on the use of air-stable Ni(COD)DQ at low loading is reported. Through high-throughput experimentation (HTE), various ligand and solvent combinations are systematically explored, allowing the fast identification of suitable conditions. This standardized workflow serves as an excellent starting point for selecting other competent nickel precatalysts and for further optimization of reluctant substrates. The transformation exhibits broad functional group tolerance and can be readily scaled up to gram-scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;dimensional Branched PdAg Nanoalloy Rich in Defects for Boosting Glycerol and Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdAg nanoalloys (NAs) are successfully synthesized via a facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase method. The optimized one&#8208;dimensional (1D) PdAg NA, abundant in defects, exhibits exceptional electrochemical properties in both glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). Furthermore, this study introduces controllable strategies for defect generation in catalysts and clarifies the correlation between defect structure and catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
The development of Pd&#8208;based bimetallic nanoalloys (NAs) with abundant active sites for achieving highly efficient electrocatalysis in alcohol oxidation deserves continuous attention. Herein, we utilized a facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase method involving adjusting reaction time to generate active sites, successfully synthesizing one&#8208;dimensional (1D) PdAg NAs rich in defects. The optimized 1D PdAg NA exhibits remarkable electrochemical activity, stability, and antipoisonous properties in glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), far exceeding pure Pd and commercial Pd/C catalysts. Notably, compared to glycerol oxidation (1496&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pd and 4.13&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), the optimized PdAg NA demonstrated higher mass activity (2990&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pd) and specific activity (7.86&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in ethanol oxidation. In summary, this work may provide a strategy for designing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts enriched with defects, thereby promoting the development of high&#8208;performance alcohol oxidation reactions.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;based Photocatalysis: From Fundamental Principles to Applications in the Generation of C&#8208;X (X = C, O, N, H, Si) Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past few decades, the merger of photocatalysis and transition metal&#8208;based catalysis or self&#8208;photoexcitation of transition metals has emerged as a useful tool in organic transformations. In this context, cobalt&#8208;based systems have attracted significant attention as sustainable alternatives to the widely explored platinum group heavy metals (iridium, rhodium, ruthenium) for photocatalytic chemical transformations. This review encompasses the basic types of cobalt&#8208;based homogeneous photocatalytic systems, their working principles, and the recent developments (2018&#8208;2024) in C&#8208;X (X = C, N, O, H, Si) bond formations. Noteworthy to mention that cobalt&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalysis is beyond the scope of the present review. An elaborate presentation on the mechanistic intricacies of cobalt&#8208;based photocatalysis, without any external photocatalyst, and cobalt&#8208;based dual organophotoredox catalysis have been provided in this comprehensive review, excluding the dual&#8208;metal photoredox catalysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only contemporary review encompassing the aforementioned two major types of cobalt&#8208;based photocatalysis, in general synthetic chemistry, covering all types of C&#8208;X bond formations spanning a range of the last six years.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Effects of Fe3O4/N&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Nanospheres for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing transition metal oxide (TMO)/porous carbon composite materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a promising strategy in high&#8208;performance fuel cell technology. In this study, we used the isolation effect and pore&#8208;creating properties of Zn2+ to fabricate a composite material comprising ultrasmall Fe3O4 particles anchored on hierarchically N&#8208;doped porous carbon nanospheres. This material, referred to as CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1, serves as an efficient ORR electrocatalyst in alkaline fuel cells. CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1 exhibits outstanding ORR catalytic activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86 V in a 0.1 M KOH solution, surpassing that of the Pt/C catalyst (0.82 V). Furthermore, CPZ1.0&#8208;Fe0.1 exhibited excellent stability with minimal current degradation after 18 h of continuous testing. The superior ORR catalytic performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect between the catalytic sites and the high conductivity of porous carbon. The porous carbon nanospheres effectively address the low conductivity of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, while the ultra&#8208;small Fe3O4 nanoparticles anchored on the carbon surface provide efficient catalytic sites for the ORR.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation of the voltage&#8208;Gated Potassium channels by Amphiphilic Glycopeptides.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Voltage&#8208;gated ion channels (VGICs) are allosterically modulated by glycosaminoglycan proteoglycans and sialic acid glycans. However, the structural diversity and heterogeneity of these biomolecules pose significant challenges to precisely delineate their underlying structure&#8208;activity relationships. Herein, we demonstrate how heparan sulfate (HS) and sialic acid synthetic glycans appended on amphiphilic glycopeptide backbone influence cell membrane persistence and modulate the gating of the Kv2.1 channel. &#160;Utilizing a panel of amphiphilic glycopeptides comprising HS disaccharides and sialic acid trisaccharide glycans, we observed that sulfation of HS and flexible &#945;(2&#8208;6) sialylation result in prolonged persistence of glycopeptides on the cell membrane compared to non&#8208;sulfated HS and &#945;(2&#8208;3) sialylation respective. This variation in glycocalyx composition was associated with a noticeable difference in the effects of these compounds on the activation and inactivation properties of the voltage&#8208;gated Kv2.1 channel with our strongest membrane associating compound demonstrating the most potent channel&#8208;activation propensity. Our findings demonstrate that sulfation charges on glycopeptide play a critical role in their membrane association propensities and endow them with VGIC activation properties. and provide a valuable insight into the role of cell surface glycans in VGIC activities.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The 18e saturated rhodium(III) species [Rh(H)(X)(&#954;2&#8208;NSitBu2)(bipyMe2)] (NSitBu2 = {4&#8208;methylpyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yloxy}ditertbutylsilyl; bipyMe2 = 4,4&#180;&#8208;dimethylbipyridine) (X = Cl, 1; OTf, 2) have been prepared and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and in the case of 2 it has been possible to determine its solid&#8208;state structure by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Complex 1 has proven to be an effective catalyst precursor for the reaction of styrene derivatives with hydrosilanes in CD2Cl2. However, under catalytic conditions complex 2 decomposes. The performance of the 1&#8208;catalyzed reaction of styrene with hydrosilanes strongly depends on the nature of the silane, the best catalytic performance was achieved using HSiMe2Ph. Theoretical and 1H NMR studies indicate that the hemilabile nature of the NSi ligand is key to understanding the catalytic activity of compound 1.</dc:description>

         <title>I2&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of N&#8208;Heteroaromatic Benzothiazoles and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biquinolines via Deaminative Cyclization of Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A straightforward I2&#8208;promoted Povarov multicomponent reaction strategy for the synthesis of N&#8208;heteroaromatic benzothiazole and 2, 2'&#8208;biquinolines was described. This methodology involved a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedure, tandem iodination/Kornblum oxidation, and [4 + 2] condensation. This protocol was characterized by broad scope of substrates (49 examples, 31&#8208;80% yields), applicable for large&#8208;scale preparation, and downstream derivatization of the product. Photophysical property of the two classes of bisheteroaryl compounds were investigated. Based on the rotatable C&#8208;C bond, 2&#8208;(6&#8208;methylquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[d]thiazole (4a) was successfully developed as a viscosity probe, which opened up new hopes and prospects for biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hysteresis Photomodulation within photochromic assemblies of [Dy(Tp2&#8208;py)F]+ Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets : Influence of the supramolecular magnetic couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 1D coordination compound made of a photochromic dithienylethene linker and [Dy(Tp2&#8208;py)F]+ units (with Tp2&#8208;py = tris(3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolyl)hydroborate) and having tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate counterions is reported. Full photoconversion from the closed isomer to the open isomer of the dithienyethene within single crystals allow for monitoring of the transformation by photocrystallography. Magnetic slow relaxation as well as magnetic hysteresis are observed and can be both modulated upon light irradiation. Comparison with previously published structures with similar components highlights the role of the supramolecular organization, and of dipolar couplings within these compounds, in driving the nature of the observed hysteresis photomodulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Dynamic Mechanism in V&#8208;Shaped Flexible Carbazole Aromatic Imides Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cofacial electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads exhibiting through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) characteristics are widely employed in the development of optoelectronic functional materials. The flexible molecular frameworks between the electron donor and acceptor components allow dynamic modulation of electronic coupling, influenced by excited&#8208;state structural relaxation or intermolecular interactions, thereby affecting the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) dynamics and the emission properties of TSCT states. In this work, we examine the TSCT dynamic processes of two electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, CzPhNI and CzPhPI formed by ortho&#8208;substitution of phenyl linkage with V&#8208;shaped flexible TSCT structures using carbazole as donor and naphthalimide or phthalimide as acceptor. A pseudo&#8208;cofacial TSCT conformation formed in the excited state effectively shortens the donor&#8208;acceptor distance and enhances CT coupling. Femtosecond spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast TSCT kinetics in the (200 fs)&#8208;1 timescale. Moreover, the intermolecular interaction&#8208;induced D&#8208;A stacking further strengthens the electronic coupling, accelerating the TSCT reaction rate from (2.07 ps)&#8208;1 to (174 fs)&#8208;1 as solution concentrations increases from 10&#8208;5 to 10&#8208;3 M. The results obtained in this work offers valuable physical insights into the TSCT dynamic mechanism, potentially explaining the widely observed emission enhancement in weakly&#8208;coupled, flexible TSCT emitters transitioning from solution to aggregation states.</dc:description>

In this work, we examine the TSCT dynamic processes of two electron donor-acceptor dyads, CzPhNI and CzPhPI formed by ortho-substitution of phenyl linkage with V-shaped flexible TSCT structures using carbazole as donor and naphthalimide or phthalimide as acceptor. A pseudo-cofacial TSCT conformation formed in the excited state effectively shortens the donor-acceptor distance and enhances CT coupling. Femtosecond spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast TSCT kinetics in the (200 fs)-1 timescale. Moreover, the intermolecular interaction-induced D-A stacking further strengthens the electronic coupling, accelerating the TSCT reaction rate from (2.07 ps)-1 to (174 fs)-1 as solution concentrations increases from 10-5 to 10-3 M. The results obtained in this work offers valuable physical insights into the TSCT dynamic mechanism, potentially explaining the widely observed emission enhancement in weakly-coupled, flexible TSCT emitters transitioning from solution to aggregation states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free Electrocatalysts for Selective Hydrogen Peroxide Generation via Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a versatile chemical widely used in various industries. The traditional anthraquinone method for H2O2 synthesis has environmental and safety concerns due to the use of organic solvents and hazardous by&#8208;products. The direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 poses risks of flammability and explosion. Recently, the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208; ORR) method has emerged as a promising alternative, offering safety, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. This method utilizes gas diffusion electrodes to efficiently generate H2O2 without the need for additional dilution. In this review, we focus on the recent advancements in noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free materials for 2e&#8208; ORR electrocatalysis, which play a crucial role in the efficient production of H2O2. These materials, including transition metal compounds, macrocyclic complexes, carbon&#8208;based catalysts, framework materials, and MXene catalyst, demonstrate significant advantages in enhancing H2O2 yield. The development of these non&#8208;precious metal catalysts can reduce costs and improve sustainability and promote the commercialization of related technologies. The review concludes with an outlook on the future trends of 2e&#8208; ORR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitochondrial Localization of Antioxidant Nanodrug Suppresses Ocular Inflammation by Alleviating Oxidative Stress on Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>External environments (e.g., pollutants, irritants, ultraviolet radiation, etc) probably activate oxidative stress on the ocular surface, further leading to inflammatory responses and cellular apoptosis. For treating ophthalmic diseases, one of the strategies is to regulate oxidative stress through antioxidants. Here we conjugate a polyphenolic antioxidant drug (i.e., caffeic acid) with a small peptide of protein tag to generate a peptide&#8208;drug conjugate as a nanodrug. With a self&#8208;assembled ability to form nanoparticles, the nanodrug mainly enters human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) by caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis, succeeds lysosomal escape, and achieves mitochondrial localization of caffeic acid. Revealed by free radical scavenging experiments, the nanodrug shows considerable antioxidant capacities. In mouse leukemia cells of monocyte macrophage (RAW 264.7) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the nanodrug inhibits various pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines (e.g., NO, IL&#8208;6, and TNF&#8208;&#945;) by up&#8208;regulating the expression of anti&#8208;apoptotic protein (e.g., Bcl&#8208;2). As an investigation of alleviating oxidative stress by the mitochondrial localization of antioxidant, this work may establish an experimental foundation for the regulation of cellular redox balance, as well as provide different insights for the clinical development of antioxidant drug delivery systems in the treatment of ocular disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Organoselenium Ligand Enabled Selective Electron Tuning for Switchable Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the electronic structure of metal complexes can bring various catalytic possibilities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).&#160;However, the electronic effect of metal and ligands modulating and switching the reaction center for HER has yet to be comprehensively analyzed.&#160;Herein, we report nickel selenoether electrocatalysts which show tunable reaction centers (nickel or ligand) for HER using mild weak acetic acid in less deprotonating DMF solvent.&#160;Synthesized nickel selenoether electrocatalysts which follow a ligand&#8208;centered pathway demonstrated remarkably high turnover frequency (kobs) upto 14000 s&#8208;1 with 93% Faradaic Efficiency (F.E.).&#160;Whereas Ni&#8208;electrocatalyst having N&#8208;donor and selenoether ligands follow a metal&#8208;centered HER and show kobs value of 2110 s&#8208;1 with F.E. of 98%. A kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) study using CD3CO2D provides kH/kD = 0.49 and 13.01 values for two types of catalysts suggestive of metal&#8208;centered and ligand&#8208;centered catalytic behavior, respectively.&#160;Also, EPR studies revealed nickel&#8208;centered and ligand&#8208;centered radicals in two types of Ni&#8208;electrocatalysts. Mechanistically, the EPR, CV, and DFT computation studies suggest that the electron density of the selenoether ligand plays a crucial role by acting as an electron reservoir in deciding the reaction pathways, whether hydride formation occurs at metal&#8208;centered leading to Ni&#8208;H intermediate or ligand&#8208;centered pathways for HER.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Schwartz&#8217;s reagent Cp2Zr(H)Cl is a well known stoichiometric reagent for the reduction of unsaturated organic molecules but it has rarely been used in catalytic transformations. Herein, we describe the reduction of a variety of organic carbonates using the catalyst Cp2Zr(H)Cl in combination with Me(MeO)2SiH (DMMS) as reductant. This method was further applied to the reductive depolymerization of some polycarbonate materials and yielded silylated alcohols and diols in mild conditions. This method for the recycling polycarbonates is characterized by its stability to the additives contained in household plastics as well as its ability to selectively depolymerize the polycarbonate PC&#8208;BPA when mixed with the polyester PET. Experimental investigations brought evidences on a mechanism based on the succession of a three steps sequence comprising the hydrozirconation of the carbonyl fragment, thermal &#963; C&#8211;O bond cleavage, and an ultimate Zr&#8211;OR/Si&#8211;H &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reaction to regenerate the hydride catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Off&#8208;On Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probes for Sensitive In Vivo Imaging of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Species with Enhanced Pharmacokinetic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fluorescent imaging of pathologically accumulated &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) proteins is of significant importance to the diagnosis of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). In the paper, we prepared two new NIR probes, NIR&#8208;1 and NIR&#8208;2, through hydrophilic modification of introducing water&#8208;soluble bioactive groups such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and morpholine to tune in vivo pharmacokinetics for specific detection of soluble and insoluble A&#946; species. The in vitro assessments confirm that both NIR&#8208;1 and NIR&#8208;2 display strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence (FL) enhancement upon association with A&#946;42 monomers, oligomers or aggregates (&#955;em &gt; 670 nm) and show high sensitive, rapid and selective response towards A&#946;42 species. After i.v. injection, each probe showed fast blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) penetration and immediately produced intense FL signals in the brain of APP/PS1 AD model mice at 10 min. Moreover, compared with NIR&#8208;2, NIR&#8208;1 bearing hydrophilic PEG chain displayed not only more rapid clearance but also lower background signal to efficiently distinguish APP/PS1 mice and wild&#8208;type mice with higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, which was further validated by ex vivo histological staining of brain tissues. Therefore, due to its excellent pharmacokinetics, NIR&#8208;1 shows great promise as an effective NIR probe for specific detection of A&#946; species.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Selenization Induced Electron&#8208;Rich Pd with Weakened O2 Adsorption for Boosted Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;transfer strategy of constructing Bi2Se3&#8722;Pd as a cocatalyst with weakened Pd&#8722;Oads bonds by designing efficient electron&#8208;enriched Pd&#948;&#8722; cocatalyst is successfully realized for improving H2O2&#8208;production kinetics.







Abstract
Pd cocatalysts show great potential for the photocatalytic production of H2O2. However, the catalytic efficiency of Pd cocatalyst is limited due to the strong adsorption of O2, which promotes O&#8722;O bond cleavage and thus reduces selectivity for the two&#8208;electron O2 reduction reaction. Considering that adjusting the electron density of Pd can predominately optimize Pd&#8722;Oads bond strength, in this work, electron&#8208;rich Pd sites are constructed by introducing Bi2Se3 middle layer between Pd cocatalysts and (010) facet of BiVO4 using an in&#8208;situ selenization strategy. The photocatalytic results indicate that the designed BiVO4/Bi2Se3&#8722;Pd(0.3&#8201;%) photocatalyst achieves a high H2O2 yield of 2166&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 in 2&#8197;h, which is 36 times and 3.75 times higher than BiVO4/Bi2Se3 and BiVO4/Pd photocatalyst, respectively. Additionally, the corresponding AQE value of BiVO4/Bi2Se3&#8722;Pd is 6.71&#8201;%. The subsequent Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and XPS spectra confirm that the introduction of Bi2Se3 via in&#8208;situ selenization increases the electron density of Pd. This enhances the formation of electron&#8208;rich Pd sites, reduces O2 adsorption, and ultimately improves the photocatalytic H2O2 yield. This strategy provides insights into designing efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production through electronic structure modulation.

         <title>Geometric Effects on C&#8722;C Coupling of Aryl&#8208;Carbenes under 2D Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the effects of 2D confinement on an aryl carbene reactivity, independent of charge transfer with conductive walls. Using a NaBr(100) decoupling bilayer on Ag(111), the research explores photoinduced C&#8722;C coupling of 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;9&#8208;fluorenylidene. This approach reveals that the decoupling layer suppresses metal interference, enabling clearer observations of carbene chemistry.







Abstract
It is well established that the confinement of reactants to two dimensions influences their reactivity. However, such confinement is often dominated by charge transfer effects between the reactants and the confining walls, in particular if the walls are conductive. Also, the reactivity of carbenes on metal surfaces is significantly affected by the charge transfer between the carbene and the metal, rendering the carbene more nucleophilic or electrophilic. Here, we investigate the geometrical effects of 2D confinement without an influence of the supporting metal for a photoinduced reaction of an aryl carbene on an ionic decoupling layer. We demonstrate the decoupling concept for the C&#8722;C coupling of 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;9&#8208;fluorenylidene (C14H10O) on a NaBr(100) bilayer on Ag(111). We combine scanning tunneling microscopy with infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy to follow the photoinduced C&#8722;C coupling of the carbene from its diazo&#8208;protected precursor in two dimensions. Our study demonstrates that the NaBr decoupling bilayer efficiently suppresses the effects of the metal surface, facilitating carbene chemistry under geometrical confinement.

         <title>Overcoming the Tradeoff Between Reaction Rate and Overpotential in Dinuclear Cobalt Complex Catalyzed Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of the identity of dinuclear Co electrocatalysts and reaction media on their water oxidation reaction performance were investigated. The synergistic effect of these factors resulted in distinct reaction intermediates and catalytic cycles. Modulating the catalytic potentials, as well as water, acid, and base concentrations, realized high turnover frequencies at low overpotentials.







Abstract
This study focuses on enhancing the water oxidation reaction (WOR) efficacy of dinuclear cobalt complex catalysts from both kinetic (turnover frequency, TOF) and thermodynamic (overpotential, &#951;) perspectives. For this purpose, we synthesized six dinuclear cobalt complexes 1&#8211;6 comprising non&#8208;innocent ligands with different electronically active substituents (&#8722;OMe (1), &#8722;Me (2), &#8722;H (3), &#8722;F (4), &#8722;Cl (5), and &#8722;CN (6)). The electronic effects on the electrochemical WOR under neutral, acidic, and alkaline conditions were investigated experimentally and computationally. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that the valence state of the cobalt complexes was affected by electronic effects, affording different catalytic potentials, as evidenced by electrochemical measurements. Kinetic and spectroscopic studies confirmed that the synergistic effect of catalyst identity and reaction media changes the reaction mechanism of each catalyst. The WOR performance of 1&#8211;6 was tunable through ligand electronics and solvent effects, with the log(TOF)&#8722;&#951; analysis highlighting an operational &#951; as low as 40&#8197;mV. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing WOR catalysis through molecular design and environmental tuning.

         <title>Controllable Self&#8208;Assembly Morphologies of PPV&#8208;Based Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PPV based block copolymers in &#8220;rod&#8208;coil&#8221; type are always build to prepare controllable and uniform nanostructures. By adjusting the packing mode of PPV blocks, the formed morphologies can be controlled. Uniform 1D micelles are resulted from conjugated interaction in favor orientation by CDSA or ROMP, while the shapes of 2D micelles are determined by molecular arranging angle and distance.







Abstract
Poly(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene) (PPV) is a classic semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer with outstanding optical and electronic properties, which shows important applications in the fields of optoelectronic, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells (OSCs), and organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). In the working process of the device, the microstate of PPV decides its property. Therefore, it is significant to achieve ordered morphologies based on PPV at micro scale. Due to the long rigid backbone and large area of delocalized electron, PPV has a strong tendency towards ordered aggregation through intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, and &#8220;rod&#8208;coil&#8221; type block copolymer (BCP) based on PPV with a corona chain to improve the solubility is always built for self&#8208;assembly in&#8197;situ solution. However, obtaining regular PPV based micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;structures in a controllable and uniform form remains challenging. In this review, we summarize the progresses in constructing multi&#8208;dimensional regular self&#8208;assembly morphologies based on PPV BCPs and exploring the application potential of these delicate functional nanomaterials. The molecular design strategy and growth mechanism can be extended to regulate the aggregation state of functional semiconducting conjugated polymers, which is beneficial to improving their performance in application of microelectronics, optoelectronics, biology and so on.

         <title>In Vitro Selection of Collagen&#8208;Binding Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Containing Genetically Encoded Mussel&#8208;Inspired Adhesive Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have incorporated an artificial amino acid found in marine mussels, L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), into a fusion library of random and known vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) sequences and identified a collagen&#8208;binding VEGF by in&#8197;vitro selection.







Abstract
Protein immobilization technology is important in medical and industrial applications. We previously reported all&#8208;in&#8208;one in&#8197;vitro selection, wherein a collagen&#8208;binding vascular endothelial growth factor (CB&#8208;VEGF) was identified from a fusion library of random and VEGF sequences. However, its interaction chemistry is mainly limited to the interaction established by the 20 canonical amino acids. Herein, we incorporated an adhesive non&#8208;natural amino acid found in marine mussels, L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), into the library for all&#8208;in&#8208;one in&#8197;vitro selection. After selection, we identified DOPA&#8208;containing CB&#8208;VEGF. CB&#8208;VEGF binds to collagen with an apparent dissociation constant of 2&#8197;nM; na&#239;ve VEGF does not bind to collagen. The collagen&#8208;binding peptide domain of CB&#8208;VEGF (CB&#8208;peptide) exhibited stronger binding to collagen than a mutant peptide (substitution from DOPA to tyrosine), indicating the importance of DOPA to collagen binding. The collagen&#8208;binding affinity of CB&#8208;VEGF is 10&#8208;fold higher than that of CB&#8208;peptide, suggesting that the collagen&#8208;binding ability of CB&#8208;VEGF is not due to the additive function of CB&#8208;peptide to VEGF, but is synergistic. Furthermore, increased cell growth was observed on CB&#8208;VEGF&#8208;treated collagen surfaces, not VEGF&#8208;treated collagen surfaces. Thus, integrating all&#8208;in&#8208;one in&#8197;vitro selection and DOPA incorporation shows promise in generating adhesive proteins on solid supports.

         <title>Three Dimensional CNTs Interweaved Layered MnTe Nanoparticles as a New Cathode For Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step ball milling method is applied to enhance the conductivity of commercial MnTe cathode by constructing three dimensional (3D) CNTs&#8208;interweaved MnTe nanoparticles, which can achieve ultrafast ion conduction. The stable cycling benefits from the synergistic effects between layered MnTe and 3D CNTs, which can improve the electrons/ions diffusion kinetics for AZIB.







Abstract
Currently, the development of suitable transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) for aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) is plagued by the terrible conductivity and electrochemical properties. Herein, a one&#8208;step ball milling method is applied to enhance the conductivity of commercial MnTe cathode by constructing three dimensional (3D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) interweaved MnTe nanoparticles (abbreviated as MnTe@CNTs), which can achieve ultrafast ion conduction. The stable electrochemistry properties benefit from the synergistic effects between layered MnTe and 3D CNTs, which can improve the electrons/ions diffusion kinetics as cycling. So MnTe@CNTs achieves a ultra&#8208;high capacity of 427.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and superior capacity retention of 97.6&#8201;% at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 200 cycles. Zinc&#8208;storage mechanisms can be revealed with the aid of operando XRD and ex situ XPS spectra. MnTe as a new cathode presents superior Zn&#8208;storage ability for high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <title>Light&#8208;Dependent Amide or Thioamide Formation of Acylsilanes with Amines using Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From the same starting materials, light versus thermal conditions have been found to activate elemental sulfur to generate alternate sets of either amides or thioamides, respectively. The umpolung of reactivity of the acylsilanes was confirmed mechanistically and the complimentary ligation methods tolerate highly functionalized chemical environments, even in the generation and crosslinking of co&#8208;polymers.







Abstract
Due to the diverse chemical and physical properties of functional groups, mild and controllable ligation methods are often required to construct complex drugs and functional materials. To make diverse sets of products with tunable physicochemical properties, it is also useful to employ complimentary ligation methods that adopt the same starting materials. Here, we disclose the efficient and modular synthesis of amides or thioamides through the chemical ligation of acylsilanes with amines, simply by turning a light on or off. This method is fast, mild, high&#8208;yielding and displays excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. The versatility of these reactions is highlighted by their ability to perform post&#8208;synthetic modifications on a variety of marketed medications, peptides, natural substances, and compounds with biological activity. In&#8208;depth computational and experimental studies clarified the photo&#8208;dependent umpolung of reactivity of acylsilanes, namely: photoexcitation leads to nucleophilic O&#8208;silyl carbenes that react with S8 to form O&#8208;silyl thionoesters and eventually amides. In contrast, acylsilanes react as electrophiles with amines thermally in the dark, with C&#8594;O silyl transfer, prior to reacting with S8 to form thioamides.

     alt="Light-Dependent Amide or Thioamide Formation of Acylsilanes with Amines using Elemental Sulfur"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the same starting materials, light versus thermal conditions have been found to activate elemental sulfur to generate alternate sets of either amides or thioamides, respectively. The umpolung of reactivity of the acylsilanes was confirmed mechanistically and the complimentary ligation methods tolerate highly functionalized chemical environments, even in the generation and crosslinking of co-polymers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the diverse chemical and physical properties of functional groups, mild and controllable ligation methods are often required to construct complex drugs and functional materials. To make diverse sets of products with tunable physicochemical properties, it is also useful to employ complimentary ligation methods that adopt the same starting materials. Here, we disclose the efficient and modular synthesis of amides or thioamides through the chemical ligation of acylsilanes with amines, simply by turning a light on or off. This method is fast, mild, high-yielding and displays excellent functional-group tolerance. The versatility of these reactions is highlighted by their ability to perform post-synthetic modifications on a variety of marketed medications, peptides, natural substances, and compounds with biological activity. In-depth computational and experimental studies clarified the photo-dependent umpolung of reactivity of acylsilanes, namely: photoexcitation leads to nucleophilic O-silyl carbenes that react with S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; to form O-silyl thionoesters and eventually amides. In contrast, acylsilanes react as electrophiles with amines thermally in the dark, with C&#8594;O silyl transfer, prior to reacting with S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; to form thioamides. These mechanistic details are expected to guide the development of similar coupling reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One Step Synthesis of 4,6,8&#8208;Trimethoxyazulenes &#8208; as Building Block for 2&#8208;Functionalized Azulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4,6,8&#8208;Trimethoxyazulenes can now be generated from commercially available cheap starting materials. The methoxy substituents change the regioselectivity of electrophilic substitution at the azulene core to the 2&#8208;position which makes 4,6,8&#8208;trimethoxyazulenes good building blocks for 2&#8208;functionalized azulene compounds otherwise difficult to access.







Abstract
Here we present a simple gold&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of easily available diarylbutadiynes, with trimethoxybenzene as solvent and reactant to synthesize 4,6,8&#8208;trimethoxyazulenes. The methoxy substituents, which render the azulene very electron&#8208;rich, enable a change of azulenes typical regioselectivity for electrophilic substitutions, which enables facile electrophilic 2&#8208;substitution with iodine, bromine, chlorine, selenium or sulfur. Especially the 2&#8208;haloazulenes which can usually only be obtained through lengthy multistep syntheses are valuable building blocks for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted azulene derivatives.

         <title>A Practical Synthetic Route to Cinnolines: Application to the Design and Synthesis of RSV NNI Inhibitor JNJ&#8208;8003 Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The manuscript describes the development of an efficient synthetic route to cinnolines, facilitating faster access to JNJ&#8208;8003 related Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) non&#8208;nucleoside (NNI) inhibitors. Starting from correctly functionalized aryl halides, a Sonogashira reaction followed by SNAr reaction with hydrazine 1,2&#8208;dicabroxylate reagents provided dihydrocinnolines directly via in situ 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization. The dihydrocinnolines were conveniently transformed to corresponding cinnolines in one step. Notably, this three&#8208;step route to cinnolines is more practical and safer than traditional methods that involve hazardous diazo intermediates. The methodology demonstrated a broad substrate scope. Strategic selection of a readily available aryl halide enabled the synthesis of diverse cinnolines that served as JNJ&#8208;8003 analogues through late&#8208;stage functionalization. Furthermore, by capitalizing the inherent reactivity of aryl halides toward SNAr reactions, we explored the synthesis of various heteroaromatic cinnolines. Given the extensive biological properties exhibited by cinnolines, our approach is poised to inspire further investigations in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Carborane&#8208;decorated siloles with highly efficient solid&#8208;state emissions &#8211; what drives the photophysical properties?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New hybrids were synthesised by linking carboranes and siloles, both of which are known as aggregation&#8208;induced emission active units. Although most of the newly synthesised systems do not display notable quantum yield either in solution or in the aggregated state, they emit strongly in the solid&#8208;state, and a quantum yield of up to 100% can be achieved. The tailorable quantum yield can be attributed to the packing of the molecules in the crystal lattice ruled by the carborane and phenyl moieties according to the SC&#8208;XRD data. Our experimental results, complemented by density functional theory calculations, show that the silole moiety primarily influences the photophysical properties. At the same time, the carborane serves as a steric building block without direct responsibility for the aggregation&#8208;induced emission property. The patterns of substituents can alter the absorption and emission properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In vitro multi&#8208;enzyme synthesis pathways harness the core elements of cellular synthesis while simplifying the complexities of cellular processes, facilitating the production of high&#8208;value chemicals. However, these in vitro synthesis processes often operate like a &#8220;black box,&#8221; with limited monitoring of each reaction step, leading to a low substrate conversion efficiency. In this study, we present an intelligent multi&#8208;enzyme molecular machine(iMEMM) as a model system for achieving the deracemization of D, L&#8208;phosphinothricin (D, L&#8208;PPT). The entire system leverages electrochemical power and enzyme&#8208;catalyzed (cascade) reactions to establish substrate channel and enhance efficiency. By modularizing each reaction step and using electrochemical real&#8208;time monitoring of the reaction process, a single&#8208;step electrobiotransformation efficiency of up to 98% and a chiral target L&#8208;PPT synthesis efficiency exceeding 99% have been achieved. This iMEMM eliminates the need for intermediate separation, enabling a "substrate in, product out" process. Our research paves the way for future green, intelligent, and automated biological manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching Photoluminescence Wavelength of Arylated Single&#8208;walled Carbon Nanotubes by Utilizing Steric Hindrance in Reductive Arylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(6,5)&#8208;enriched single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were reductively arylated using sodium naphthalenide and monosubstituted and disubstituted iodobenzene derivatives to control their photoluminescence (PL) properties. In the reactions with substituted iodobenzenes, the degree of functionalization was influenced by the substituents on the aryl groups depending on their position, which allowed us to realize control of the PL intensity. The substituents at the 2&#8208;position and methyl groups at the 3,5&#8208;positions of the phenyl group respectively increased the E11** PL and E11* PL selectivity at ~1230 and ~1100 nm. Methyl groups at the 2,6&#8208;positions emerged two new E11** PL peaks.&#160;These PL characteristics were prominently observed in the (6,4) SWCNT adducts, which were separated by gel chromatography. Theoretical calculations of model compounds showed that the effect of the substituent at the 2&#8208;position on the relative stability of the isomers with different binding configurations was greater for the diarylated SWCNTs than for the hydroarylated SWCNTs. Experimental and theoretical calculation results revealed that the choice of substituents on the benzene ring was effectively used to modulate the PL wavelength, and these substituents had a considerable effect on the favorable binding configuration of the SWCNT adduct and relative stability and PL wavelength of the conformational isomers.</dc:description>

Experimental and theoretical calculation results revealed that the choice of substituents on the benzene ring was effectively used to modulate the PL wavelength, and these substituents had a considerable effect on the favorable binding configuration of the SWCNT adduct and relative stability and PL wavelength of the conformational isomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile In Situ Formation of Potassium Sodium Niobate (KNN) Using The Hexaniobate Polyoxometalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead&#8208;based piezoceramics are the dominant materials used in electronic devices, despite the known toxicity of lead. Developing safer piezoelectric materials has inspired the pursuit of lead&#8208;free piezoceramics, however some challenges remain in accessing these materials reproducibly. Here we demonstrate a simple and robust method for synthesis of the lead&#8208;free piezoceramic material, potassium sodium niobate (KxNa1&#8208;xNbO3, KNN) via an aqueous route. Stochiometric KNN (K0.5Na0.5NbO3) was prepared, by combining alkali&#8208;nitrate salts (NaNO3 and KNO3) with the hexaniobate ([HxNb6O19]8&#8208;x, Nb6) species in water, followed by heating at elevated temperatures for at least one hour. Ex situ heating of the amorphous alkali&#8208;Nb6 precursor reveals stoichiometric control and phase uniformity are possible in making KNN, versus a solid&#8208;state route. In situ heating in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), with selected area electron diffraction (SAED), facilitates monitoring the real&#8208;time transformation of the amorphous alkali&#8208;Nb6 precursor, to yield monoclinic KNN, in agreement with ex situ results. Therefore, an aqueous route via hexaniobate is an attractive alternative approach for developing lead&#8208;free piezoceramic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Boosting Strategy of Photovoltaics by Stacking Monolayer InSe and &#946;&#8208;Sb into Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying two&#8208;dimensional (2D) high&#8208;efficiency solar photovoltaic devices remains an urgent challenge in addressing current energy demands. Considering the limits of isolated 2D systems in photovoltaics, one most effective solution is stacking them into van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs). However, the favorable factors for photovoltaics in vdWHs is still uncertain, nor the intrinsic principles is clear. Here, based on monolayer InSe and &#946;&#8208;Sb, we propose a boosting strategy on photovoltaics through stacking them into vdWH. After confirming its experimental feasibility, several superior photovoltaic characteristics of such vdWH are verified than its components. Including more moderately indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct band gap, higher electron mobilities, the hindrance of carrier recombination due to the staggered type&#8208;II band alignment, and the stronger and red&#8208;shifted optical harvesting abilities owing to the band redistribution. In addition, superior characteristics in the InSe/Sb vdWH based photovoltaic devices are further confirmed, including the red&#8208;shifted photocurrent into the infrared&#8208;light range, the superior photoelectric conversion efficiencies in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;region, and the higher photovoltaic quality factors (Rph ,&#964;eqe et.al.) than each component and many other typical vdWHs. Obviously, the design principles and promotion mechanisms of 2D vdWH on photovoltaics can provide powerful theoretical guidances for next design and applications of 2D high&#8208;efficiency solar photovoltaic cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Chlorination&#8208;Supported Shrinkage of C60 Fullerene to Non&#8208;classical C58 Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We provide important novel insights into skeletal transformations of fullerene by reporting new cases of cage shrinkage in the most abundant C60 fullerene via a C2 loss. High&#8208;temperature (400&#8211;500 oC) chlorination of IPR C60 with SbCl5 or SbCl5/SbCl3 mixtures predominantly gives non&#8208;IPR C60Cln compounds via Stone&#8208;Wales rearrangements, but the present study further reveals non&#8208;classical C58Cln chlorofullerenes as by&#8208;products. The new C58(NC1)Cl20 and C58(NC1)Cl24 chlorides have been isolated by air&#8208;free HPLC and structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their non&#8208;classical carbon cages feature one heptagon, two pairs of fused pentagons, one triple&#8208;pentagon junction, and one quartet of sequentially fused pentagons. However, the chlorination patterns and molecular shapes of C58(NC1)Cl20 and C58(NC1)Cl24 are essentially different. We propose the likely multistep transformation pathways toward the new compounds and further report the chlorination&#8208;promoted formation of chlorofullerenes with still smaller fullerene cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Label&#8208;free 3D cell imaging using hydrogels functionalized with switchable iridium complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of fluorescent labels is the most common tool to visualize cells. However, the internalization of dye molecules often modifies the cell behavior. In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to transiently label cells using a 3D scaffold, a hydrogel, covalently functionalized with luminescent cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes. The unique feature of our design is that the complexes are emissive only when they interact with the cell membrane while their emission is quenched in water. We exploited this feature to perform real&#8208;time and staining&#8208;free cell visualization and imaging. The hydrogels immerged in culture media are non&#8208;luminescent, however, when cells are added to it, they interact with the iridium complexes, covalently linked to the gel, and their lipophilic membrane &#8220;switches on&#8221; the luminescence enabling a clear and dynamic, real&#8208;time 3D visualization of cell proliferation. A complete photophysical and biological study of the materials is presented which demonstrates the potential of our methodology for 3D&#8208;realtime cell tracking.</dc:description>

CPs 1 and 2 are a pair of solvent&#8208;mediated supramolecular isomers where the former shows a two&#8208;fold interlocked 2D &#8594; 2D polyrotaxane&#8208;like entangled net and the latter reveals a four&#8208;fold interpenetrated 2D &#8594; 3D polyrotaxane entanglement. CP 3 is structure analgue of 1. The formation of 1&#8211;3 implies the realization of interpenetration control and supramolecular isomerism in polyrotaxanes by fine&#8208;tuning the solvent compositions and ligand steric&#8208;modulation. CPs 1&#8211;3 all show high thermal stability approaching 400 &#176;C and good chemical stability in various solvents at room temperature for 24 h. Further, CPs 1&#8211;3 all are excellent turn&#8208;off sensors to recognize Fe3+ in water with high selectivity and sensitivity, great anti&#8208;inference ability, and low limit of detection (LOD). The sensing mechanisms are found to be competitive absorption of excitation wavelength energy and the occurrence of framework&#8211;Fe3+ interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the Titanium(III) Tris(alkyl) Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 and its Conversion to a Dimeric Alkyl&#8208;bridged Titanium(IV) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of three equivalents of LiCH(SiMe3)2 with TiCl3(NMe3)2 afforded the rare homoleptic Ti(III) alkyl Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 (1) which crystallized as blue needles in 32 % yield. Single crystal X&#8208;Ray data for 1 showed a trigonal pyramidal coordination geometry around titanium, which could be ascribed to weak interactions between the C&#8211;H bonds and the Ti(III) atom based on computational results.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The reaction of three equivalents of LiCH(SiMe3)2 with TiCl3(NMe3)2 afforded the rare homoleptic Ti(III) alkyl Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 (1) which crystallized as blue needles in 32 % yield. Single crystal X-Ray data for 1 showed a trigonal pyramidal coordination geometry around titanium, which could be ascribed to weak interactions between the C&#8211;H bonds and the Ti(III) atom based on computational results. X-band EPR spectroscopy give spectral parameters consistent with the proposed Ti(III) formulation. Solutions of 1 are unstable at room temperature owing to intramolecular C&#8211;H activation that gave a dimeric Ti(IV) complex [{(Me3Si)2HC}Ti{&#956;-CH HSiMe3}]2 (2).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Bisphosphonate&#8208;Based Viologens as Negolytes for Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viologen derivatives feature two reversible one&#8208;electron redox processes and have been extensively utilized in aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs). However, the early variant, methyl viologen (MVi), exhibits low stability in aqueous electrolytes, restricting its practical implementation in AOFB technology. In this context, leveraging the tunability of organic molecules, various substituents have been incorporated into the viologen core to achieve better stability, lower redox potential, and improved solubility. In this work, we introduce bisphosphonate&#8208;substituted viologens as candidates for AOFBs. The bulkiness and negative charges of the bisphosphonate groups enhance the solubility and the electrostatic repulsion among viologen molecules, minimizing the bimolecular side reactions that lead to degradation. Additionally, the electron&#8208;donating effect of this new substituent significantly lowers the redox potential. As a result, the proposed viologen derivatives exhibit high solubility (1.66 &#8208; 1.81 M in water) and stability (capacity decay of 0.009%/cycle or 0.229%/day when tested at 0.5 M). These parameters are coupled with the lowest redox potentials exceeding all previously reported viologens utilized in AOFBs (&#8211;0.503 V and &#8211;0.550 V against SHE for mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;phosphonate viologen, respectively).</dc:description>

         <title>A Hybrid BN&#8208;doped nanographene with narrow emission bandwidths for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe synthesis of BN&#8208;doped nanographene containing five phenylene units, boron and nitrogen atoms with both alternating ortho&#8208;disposition as well as direct B&#8208;N connection. Resulting BN doped nanographene exhibits blue fluorescence at 441 nm with extraordinary narrow fluorescence peak with full width at half maximum (FWHM) = 10&#8208;11 nm. Crystallography reveals supramolecular organization of this compound in the crystal phase. Initial organic light emitting device (OLED) data suggest that the presence of a directly connected B&#8208;N isostere can lead to devices with sufficiently long lifetime as well as narrow emission electro&#8208;luminescence peaks for OLED applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The Unusual Mesophases and Properties Exhibited by a Family of Glycosteroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article we describe research on the synthesis and characterization of a family of &#8220;Janus&#8221; amphiphiles composed of disaccharide head groups and alkaloid units joined together via a methylene linker, and bearing a lateral aliphatic chain of varying length. The condensed phases formed by self&#8208;organization of the products as a function of temperature were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, thermal polarized light microscopy, and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, allied with computational modelling and simulations. Structural studies on heating specimens from the solid showed that some homologues exhibited lamellar, columnar and bicontinuous mesophases, whereas the same homologues revealed different phase sequences on cooling from the amorphous liquid. We explore these unusual results, which are revealed via supercooling.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of UCST&#8208;Responsive Claw&#8208;Like Polysulfobetaines for Efficient Capture of Cellulase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recyclable UCST&#8208;type claw shaped PSPA was used to significantly recycle cellulase from lignocellulosic hydrolyzate, and the process was sustainable.







Abstract
The high cost of enzymatic glycolysis has seriously restricted the industrialization of lignocellulose&#8208;based sugar platform technology. Recovering and recycling cellulase can reduce the cost. Here, a thermo&#8208;responsive claw&#8208;type polysulfobetaine (PSPA) was constructed for hydrophobic grasping and efficient recycling of cellulase. Compared with the linear sulfobetaine homopolymer (PSPE), PSPA had more sensitive temperature response and strong cellulase recovery ability. PSPE&#8208;3 (Mw=355.1&#8197;kDa) was added to the hydrolysis system of corncob residue (CCR) (50&#8201;&#176;C), at 0.4 mass ratio of PSPE&#8208;3 to cellulase, and after enzymatic hydrolysis, 50&#8201;% of the cellulase was saved when cooling to 25&#8201;&#176;C. But only 0.05 times PSPA&#8208;1 (Mw=30.0&#8197;kDa) was added to the CCR system, and 70&#8201;% of the cellulase was saved when cooling to 25&#8201;&#176;C. This work presents a claw shaped protein&#8208;capture agent, polysulfobetaine for capturing cellulase, which is of great significance to reduce the lignocellulosic hydrolysis cost, and efficiently separate enzyme proteins.

         <title>Nucleophilic Functionalization of Activated P4 in [CpFe(CO)2&#8208;(&#951;1&#8208;P4)][Al(ORF)4] with Alcohols R&#8208;OH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of P4 in [Fp&#8208;P4][Al(ORF)4] (1) (Fp = (CO)2CpFe) with nucleophiles R&#8208;OH (R = H, Me, Et, Ph) was investigated. Detailed NMR data on the formed P1 building blocks and DFT calculations provide insights to fragmentation mechanisms of the very rapid functionalization of P4 yielding free, coordinated or protonated phosphites [Fp&#8208;P(H)x(OR)3&#8208;x)][Al(ORF)4] (x=3&#8211;0) (2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;d), [Fp&#8208;PH2&#8208;Fp][Al(ORF)4] (2&#8201;e) and [HP(OR)3][Al(ORF)4] (2&#8201;f).







Abstract
The bonding situation in [Fp&#8722;P4][Al(ORF)4] (1) (Fp = (CO)2CpFe, RF = C(CF3)3) gives rise to an Umpolung of the P4 fragment, which should make it accessible for nucleophiles. To investigate this projected reactivity, the complex was combined with a series of hydroxy&#8208;nucleophiles &#8211; that all do not react with free P4 &#8211; leading to a variety of P1 building blocks. With excess of R&#8208;OH (R = Me, Et, Ph), the thermodynamically more stable complex salts [Fp&#8722;P(H)x(OR)3&#8208;x)][Al(ORF)4] (x=2,1,0) (2b&#8211;2d) are formed and show that the phosphonium type pathway is accessible. Quantum chemical calculations display a variety of reaction pathways that all lead very rapidly to the P1 building blocks. With stoichiometric amounts of R&#8208;OH, [Fp&#8208;PH3][Al(ORF)4] (2&#8201;a) as well as [HP(OR)3][Al(ORF)4] (2&#8201;f) were observed as products. Hence, activation of the P4&#8208;cage in complex 1 was confirmed.

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured Yb3+, Er3+ Codoped CeO2 with Upconverted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral mesostructured lanthanides codoped CeO2 materials have been synthesized via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal route. They exhibit both circular dichroism and upconverted circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Upconverted circularly polarized luminescence (UC&#8208;CPL) active organic and organic&#8208;inorganic composite materials have garnered increasing attention due to their vast potential applications in areas such as 3D displays, encryptions, spintronics and optoelectronic devices. However, effective methods for fabricating chiral inorganic materials exhibiting UC&#8208;CPL remain a challenge. Herein, we propose an approach for the synthesis of UC&#8208;CPL active chiral mesostructured CeO2 powders (CMCs) via a hydrothermal growth method, using L/D&#8208;aspartic acid as symmetry&#8208;breaking and structure&#8208;directing agents. Two levels of chirality exist in CMCs: primary nanoplates constructed from nanoparticles and the helical stacking of these nanoplates to form a twisting nanofusiform. Yb3+ and Er3+ ions can be codoped into the CMCs through a one&#8208;step synthesis to achieve UC&#8208;CPL. The 1&#8201;% Yb3+, 1&#8201;% Er3+ codoped CMCs exhibited absorption&#8208;based optical activities in the range of 350&#8211;500&#8197;nm, similar to undoped CMCs, and displayed circularly polarized luminescence in the range of 520&#8211;610&#8197;nm under the excitation by a 980&#8197;nm laser. This luminescence is attributable to the energy transfer process between Yb3+ and Er3+. This work may provide new insights into designing chiral photon upconversion inorganic materials.

         <title>Organic Luminescent Cocrystals&#160;Based on&#160;Benzotriazole&#160;Derivatives: Synthesis, Characterization,&#160;Crystal&#160;Structure and&#160;Fluorescence&#160;Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cocrystals have garnered significant research attention owing to their distinctive properties and promising applications. However, challenges in molecular structure design and control of intermolecular interactions continue to impede further advancements. In this study, two novel cocrystals were successfully formed from a series of synthesized benzotriazole derivatives.&#160;The resulting cocrystals exhibit bright green and yellow fluorescence under 365 nm light.&#160;To elucidate the microstructure of the obtained cocrystals, systematic characterization techniques such as solid&#8208;state fluorescence emission spectroscopy, Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), Power X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and density functional theory (DFT) were performed. These benzotriazole&#8208;based cocrystals demonstrate distinct fluorescent responses to alkaline and acidic environments, respectively. Additionally, preliminary tests for fingerprint recognition yielded satisfactory results. These findings suggest that the two cocrystals hold potential applications in acid&#8208;alkali sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels, and smart material development, while also providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of solid&#8208;state luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Divergent Synthesis of Naphthalene&#8208; and Phenanthrene&#8208;Fused Azahelicenes by Turning Rearrangement On or Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Scholl reaction has been used to synthesize&#160;a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, where 1,2&#8208;aryl shifts have sometimes occurred to yield unique rearrangement products. However, such 1,2&#8208;aryl shifts are often uncontrollable, and the selective and divergent synthesis with or without rearrangement is desired. Here, we achieved the&#160;control of the rearrangement&#160;in the Scholl reaction of carbazoles by the&#160;N&#8208;substituents.&#160;The Scholl reaction of&#160;3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(2&#8208;naphthyl)phenyl}carbazoles and 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(9&#8208;phenanthrenyl)phenyl}carbazoles&#160;with an&#160;N&#8208;benzyl group gave multiple azahelicenes via double rearrangement, while those with an&#160;N&#8208;benzoyl group gave aza[9]helicene and quadruple [4]helicene in the former and latter cases, respectively. The reaction mechanisms on the divergent reaction pathways were investigated by DFT calculations, which well supported the experimental results.</dc:description>

         <title>Me2Se and Me2Te: their structures and synergistic effects of halogen/chalcogen bonding with C6F5Br and C6F5I</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work combines halogen and chalcogen bonding. Short, polarity directed C&#8211;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch (X = Br or I, Ch = Se or Te) contacts were prepared by in situ low&#8208;temperature cocrystallization of liquid mixtures of neutral pentafluorohalogenobenzenes C6F5X and dimethyl chalco&#173;genides Me2Ch. Solid&#8208;state structures of Me2Se and Me2Te were determined 150 and 125 years after their first description. Significant C&#8211;Ch&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts make Me2Se dimeric and Me2Te polymeric. The cocrystals comprise C6F5X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Me2Ch&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;XC6F5 aggregates, except the combination X/Ch = I/Te which shows polymeric C6F5I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Me2Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;TeMe2&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;IC6F5 aggregation. The observed C&#8211;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te interactions are the shortest of this type, and the C&#8211;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts are shorter than the corresponding C&#8211;Br&#183;&#183;&#183;Ch interactions. Heteromole&#173;cular C&#8211;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts are accompanied by F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/F and X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H con&#173;tacts in the cocrystals. The analysis of packing and contacts in all (co)crystals was complemented by computational studies. They both show that short interactions can be designed and engineered with reasonable predictability.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Buffering Mechanism Enhances Stability and Water Oxidation Efficiency of CeO2@NiFe&#8208;LDH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a hierarchically structured heterostructure catalyst, CeO2@NiFe LDH, was achieved through a straightforward two&#8208;step hydrothermal process. The electronic buffering mechanism provided by CeO2 enhanced the oxygen affinity at the surface of the heterojunction material, accelerated electron transfer for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In overall water splitting, the CeO2@NiFe LDH demonstrated excellent activity and stability.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide shows significant promise as an electrocatalyst in facilitating oxygen evolution reactions. But its development is hindered by low conductivity and insufficient cycling stability. Herein, the synthesis of a hierarchically structured heterostructure catalyst, CeO2@NiFe LDH, is reported through a straightforward two&#8208;step process involving hydrothermal treatment. The catalyst realizes a significant breakthrough in OER catalytic performance and stability. At a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the overpotentials amount to 255&#8197;mV in 1&#8197;M KOH, 263&#8197;mV in simulated seawater with alkaline conditions, and 346&#8197;mV in actual alkaline seawater. After 200&#8197;hours of continuous operation under high current density in simulated alkaline seawater, the morphology with no significant alterations observed, highlighting its high stability in complex seawater environments. Introducing CeO2 optimizes the binding energy of the OH intermediate, which facilitates the formation and dissociation of the OOH intermediate. In situ Raman analysis demonstrates the positive impact of CeO2 on the generation of active species. This research emphasizes the efficacy of CeO2 in improving the performance and durability of NiFe LDH for oxygen evolution reactions.

         <title>PDA/PMMA Blend Membrane Utilized for the Selective Adsorption and Separation of Heavy Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy metal ion pollution in water has severely threatened human health. Membrane separation technology is often used to adsorb and remove heavy metal ions from water. However, efficiently separating and removing heavy metal ions in water is still a challenging task. We fabricated a PDA/PMMA blend membrane drawing inspiration from mussel silk protein. Relying on the dopa group within the blend membrane, the selective adsorption and removal of heavy metal ions in water can be accomplished.







Abstract
The detrimental effects of heavy metal aqueous pollution are attracting people's attention increasingly. Membrane separation technology plays a pivotal role in the treatment of aqueous pollution due to its low energy consumption and excellent separation effect. Inspired by the strong adhesion of heavy metal ions by the dopamine in mussel protein, we have fabricated the 5&#8201;%, 10&#8201;%, 20&#8201;% and 30&#8201;% proportion of polydopamine (PDA)/Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blend membranes with dopamine structure by solvent&#8208;induced phase conversion. I&#8722;V current, UV titration and transmission tests examined the membrane's selective adsorption and retention capabilities for Fe3+, Cu2+ and Cr3+. These experiments indicated the different selectivity for Fe3+ of four blend membranes with varying PDA/PMMA fractions. Based on Langmuir's adsorption theory, the 10&#8201;% blend membranes exhibited the most outstanding selective adsorption for Fe3+ with an LOD of 4.724&#215;10&#8211;9 M. Moreover, the ability to retain Fe3+ is still close to 100&#8201;% after 48&#8197;h of transmission. This study manifested that the PDA/PMMA blend membrane is capable of adsorbing trace amounts of Fe3+ from water, thereby contributing to aqueous purification.

         <title>A Prebiotic Route to Lactate from Acetaldehyde, Cyanide and Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dioxide (CO2) in prebiotic chemistry: CO2 facilitates the synthesis of crucial C3&#8208;building block, particularly lactate through redox&#8208;economic cycles involving cyanide (C1) and acetaldehyde (C2) under ambient conditions. Our findings lend support to theories regarding the emergence of life in CO2&#8208;rich environments, highlighting CO2&#8242;s significance in forming biologically relevant molecules, supporting both warm pond and hydrothermal vent theories.







Abstract
The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has fluctuated throughout Earth's history. However, the role of CO2 in prebiotic chemistry has been predominantly and limitedly postulated as a C1 precursor, which can be reduced to carbon monoxide or methane mimicking the Wood&#8208;Ljungdahl pathway. Herein we present neglected roles of CO2 as an active promoter in accessing biologically important C3&#8208;builidng blocks such as lactate, via redox&#8208;economic reaction cycles starting from cyanide (C1) and acetaldehyde (C2). We verified that Lewis acidic CO2 facilitates the formation of cyanohydrin of acetaldehyde under ambient conditions. Furthermore, selective protection of cyanohydrin to carbonate by atmospheric CO2 led to anchimeric assisted hydrolysis of the nitrile group to generate lactate. This work supports both warm pond and hydrothermal vent hypotheses, postulating that a CO2&#8208;rich primordial atmosphere and the acidic aqueous solution could have fostered the emergence of biologically relevant molecules and life itself.

         <title>Methane to Methanol Transformation on Cu2+/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite. Characterization of Copper State and Mechanism of the Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane to methanol transformation on Cu&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite has been studied by UV&#8208;vis, EPR, EXAFS, FTIR, MAS NMR methods. Methane activation is found to occur on paired Cu2+ sites with the surface methoxy species being formed. DFT calculations suggest methane activation occurs through the &#8220;alkyl&#8221; pathway and the formed copper&#8208;methyl species are further transformed to methoxy ones.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;modified zeolites provide methane conversion to methanol with high selectivity under mild conditions. The activity of different Cu&#8208;sites for methane transformation is still under discussion. Herein, ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite has been loaded with Cu2+ cations (1.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% Cu) as characterized by UV&#8208;vis DRS, EPR, EXAFS, and 1H MAS NMR. It is inferred that Cu2+ cations, attached to the cation&#8208;exchange Al&#8722;O&#8722;&#8722;Si sites of the zeolite framework, can exist in the form of either isolated or paired Cu2+ sites. The transformation of methane to methanol on Cu2+/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 has been verified by the observation of the methoxy species formation with 13C MAS NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. The related mechanisms have been analyzed by DFT calculations. The calculations show that the paired Cu2+ sites enable heterolytic C&#8722;H bond dissociation via the &#8220;alkyl&#8221; pathway resulting in methylcopper species, which however are not detected experimentally due to further rapid transformation to surface methoxy species through methyl radical formation and recombination with Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al site. Based on the obtained data, it has been concluded that methane transformation to methanol on paired Cu2+ sites, having no extra&#8208;framework oxygen ligand, is possible in Cu&#8208;modified zeolites. The pathways of Cu2+ cations regeneration with O2 and H2O have been experimentally explored.

         <title>Systematic Investigations of the Solid Solution Zr(V1&#8211;xAlx)2 Adopting the Laves Phase Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigations of the ternary system Zr&#8211;V&#8211;Al show that no superstructures can be observed within the solid solution Zr(V1&#8211;xAlx)2. For high values of x the hexagonal MgZn2 type structure is found while low values lead to the cubic MgCu2 type. 27Al MAS NMR investigations confirm the absence of ordered superstructures.







Abstract
Laves phases are an interesting field of research when it comes to structural chemistry and physical properties. Investigations of the ternary system Zr&#8211;V&#8722;Al showed, in contrast to the system Hf&#8211;V&#8722;Al, that no superstructures can be observed within the solid solution Zr(V1&#8211;xAlx)2. High values of x form aluminum rich phases that adopt the hexagonal MgZn2 type structure while low values of x lead to vanadium rich phases that adopt the cubic MgCu2 type. All samples were investigated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. Single crystal studies indicated that no superstructure formation is present in the investigated samples. 27Al MAS NMR investigations confirmed these findings. For ZrAl2, quantum&#8208;chemical calculations helped with the analysis of the 27Al NMR spectrum of the binary endmember of the solid solution. Some of the prepared samples were investigated with respect to their magnetic properties. The investigated compounds show Pauli&#8208;paramagnetism, in Zr(V0.875Al0.125)2 in addition superconductivity with a critical temperature of TC=4.17(1)&#8197;K was observed. Investigations of compositions that do not belong to the Laves phase regime clearly indicate that the MgZn2 type structure is still the dominant phase. Regardless of the starting composition chosen, the hexagonal Laves phase was mostly present.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laves phases are an interesting field of research when it comes to structural chemistry and physical properties. Investigations of the ternary system Zr&#8211;V&#8722;Al showed, in contrast to the system Hf&#8211;V&#8722;Al, that no superstructures can be observed within the solid solution Zr(V&lt;sub&gt;1&#8211;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt; High values of &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; form aluminum rich phases that adopt the hexagonal MgZn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; type structure while low values of &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; lead to vanadium rich phases that adopt the cubic MgCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; type. All samples were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction experiments. Single crystal studies indicated that no superstructure formation is present in the investigated samples. &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al MAS NMR investigations confirmed these findings. For ZrAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, quantum-chemical calculations helped with the analysis of the &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al NMR spectrum of the binary endmember of the solid solution. Some of the prepared samples were investigated with respect to their magnetic properties. The investigated compounds show Pauli-paramagnetism, in Zr(V&lt;sub&gt;0.875&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.125&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in addition superconductivity with a critical temperature of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;=4.17(1)&#8197;K was observed. Investigations of compositions that do not belong to the Laves phase regime clearly indicate that the MgZn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; type structure is still the dominant phase. Regardless of the starting composition chosen, the hexagonal Laves phase was mostly present.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Non&#8208;Volatile Pro&#8208;Dicamba Herbicide Inspired by Meclofenoxate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dicamba is a long&#8208;successful herbicide with an Achille's heel, namely its propensity to volatilize, drift and burn neighboring plants. Here we develop a non&#8208;volatile and efficacious pro&#8208;herbicide for dicamba by an ester coupling of 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol that is stable but becomes hydrolyzed once inside plants.







Abstract
Dicamba is a popular herbicide with rising use but is also notorious for volatility drift. Inspired by meclofenoxate, which we show to be highly herbicidal, we developed a derivative of dicamba with an ester&#8208;bond to 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol. It remained herbicidal but is non&#8208;volatile, entering plants intact and hydrolyzing inside leaves to dicamba and 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol. This pro&#8208;dicamba is compatible with the relatively novel dicamba monooxygenase tolerance technology, suggesting pro&#8208;dicamba might be a suitable, non&#8208;volatile replacement for dicamba.

         <title>Photoresponsive Helical Foldamers: Conformational Control Through Double Helix Formation and Light&#8208;Induced Protonation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mastering the shape adopted by helical foldamers is critical for future applications in pharmaceutics and materials sciences. Herein, we report a dual control on tetraphenylethylene&#8208;containing foldamers, since the helix shape could be tuned by means of simple concentration variations or through light irradiation.







Abstract
Helical foldamers constitute particularly relevant targets in the field of host&#8208;guest chemistry, be that as hosts or substrates. In this context, the strategies reported so far to control the dimensions and shape of foldamers mainly involve modifications of the skeleton through covalent synthesis. Herein, we prepared an oligopyridine dicarboxamide foldamer substituted by photo&#8208;active tetraphenylethylene units (TPE). We demonstrate that it is possible to toggle the length of a helical foldamer by two means. First, the elongation of foldamers can be tuned by adjusting the concentration, as demonstrated by DOSY NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses on both the single and the double helix structures. Secondly, and in a more original manner, a photo&#8208;induced protonation process triggered by TPE units promotes a novel pathway to unfold helical foldamers, leading to dramatic conformational and spectroscopic changes.

&#945;&#8208;D 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine forms a transparent self&#8208;healing hydrogel. Fluorescent gels are obtained from &#945;&#8208;D 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine and &#945;&#8208;D 8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine. A toolbox of &#945;&#8208;D nucleoside hydrogels is now available, providing gels with long&#8208;term stability and thixotropic properties in combination with intrinsic fluorescence for potential applications in biomedicine, diagnostics or therapeutics, and in nanotechnology.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of &#945;&#8208;D nucleosides to supramolecular hydrogels is described in detail. Hydrogel formation is studied on &#945;&#8208;D 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine (&#945;&#8208;dG), and the fluorescent 8&#8208;azapurine &#945;&#8208;D nucleosides 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (&#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad) and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine (&#945;&#8208;z8iGd). These compounds were prepared from &#945;&#8208;D 8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine by an activation/amination protocol followed by deamination. Protonation and deprotonation pKa values of monomeric nucleosides were determined. Fluorescence measurements displayed the pH&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity of &#945;&#8208;D 8&#8208;azapurine nucleosides. &#945;&#8208;dG and &#945;&#8208;z8iGd self&#8208;assemble to gels that are selective for K+&#8208;ions. The &#945;&#8208;dG gel is transparent and the &#945;&#8208;z8iGd gel shows fluorescence. &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad forms fluorescent gels in the presence of alkali metal ions of different size. SEM images expose a large condensed and flat structure for the &#945;&#8208;dG gel, whereas the &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad gel consists of flakes that are connected to bundles. A porous structure generated by helical cylindric fibers was found for the &#945;&#8208;z8iGd gel. All &#945;&#8208;D hydrogels show long&#8208;term lifetime stability. The &#945;&#8208;z8iGd hydrogel in KCl solution has the highest Tgel value. The minimum gelation concentration of the hydrogels is 0.3&#8208;0.5&#8197;mg nucleoside/100&#8197;&#956;L alkali ion solution. In periodical step&#8208;strain experiments, the hydrogels of &#945;&#8208;dG, &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad and &#945;&#8208;z8iGd displayed thixotropy. Based on their self&#8208;healing and shear&#8208;thinning properties the hydrogels are injectable.

         <title>Synthesis and Redox Chemistry of Co3E4 (E=P, As) Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward synthesis of homotrimetallic Co polypnictogen cage complexes of the type [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)3(&#956;3,&#951;2:&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;E3)(&#956;3&#8208;E)] (E=P (3), As (4)) is presented. These clusters were elucidated in terms of their redox chemistry by cyclic voltammetry. Stepwise reduction and oxidation over four stages give access to the corresponding salts containing monoanions, monocations and dications, which were comprehensively characterized in solution and in the solid state, respectively.







Abstract

Abstract
The systematic nucleophilic functionalization of the cationic pentaphosphole ligand complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5Me)][OTf] (A) with group 16/17 nucleophiles is reported. This method represents a highly reliable and versatile strategy for the design of novel transition&#8208;metal complexes featuring twofold substituted end&#8208;deck cyclo&#8208;P5 ligands, bearing unprecedented hetero&#8208;element substituents. By the reaction of A with classical group 16 nucleophiles, complexes of the type [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeE)] (E=OEt (1), OtBu (2), SPh (3), SePh (4)) are obtained. By transferring this protocol to group 17 nucleophiles, the highly sensitive complexes [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeX)] (X=F (5), Cl (6), Br (7), I (8)) could be isolated. All products show exclusively 1,1'&#8208;substitution at the cyclo&#8208;P5 ring. Interestingly, further studies on the reactivity of the halogenated species revealed their ability to undergo ring&#8208;opening reactions with cyclic ethers such as THF and ethylene oxide yielding [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC4H8X)] (X=Br (9), I (10)) or [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC2H4X)] (X=Br (11), I (12)), respectively. Furthermore, the use of acyclic ethers such as dimethoxyethane led to the formation of [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC2H4OCH3)] (13) mediated by C&#8722;O bond cleavage, followed by subsequent P&#8722;O bond formation, as further enlightened by DFT calculations.

         <title>Microbial&#8208;induced Synthesis of nano NiFe LDH for High&#8208;efficiency Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts were synthesized using the microbial&#8208;induced mineralization method, which results in formation of a relatively homogeneous rod shell structure on the nickel foam surface, acceleration of the formation of nanosheets, and modulation of the electronic structure of nanosheets. This study provides new insights into microbial in&#8197;situ mineralization&#8208;induced microstructural changes in catalysts for the OER.







Abstract
NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) currently are the most efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline environments. However, the development of high&#8208;performance low cost OER electrocatalysts using straightforward strategies remains a significant challenge. In this study, we describe an innovative microbial mineralization&#8208;based method for in&#8197;situ&#8208;induced preparation of NiFe LDH nanosheets loaded on nickel foam and demonstrate that this material serves as an efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. In the microbial mineralization process, bacteria adhere to electrode materials and promote the surface nucleation of nanomaterials when metal ions are present. Specifically, our findings indicate that biomineralization accelerates the formation and regulation of NiFe LDH. The new electrocatalyst displays excellent OER performance, with a small overpotential of 220&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope down to 38.6&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in alkaline solution. The remarkable OER performance of the microbial mineralization&#8208;derived electrocatalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect of NiFe LDH and a bacterial&#8208;specific surface area that contains multiple active sites. This study has uncovered a new approach for the assembly of NiFe LDH that relies on biomineralization to bring about morphological and structural modification of LDH nanosheets.

         <title>Supramolecular Preorganization of Amine&#8208;functionalized Diacetylene Monomers in their Crystals Allows their Topochemical Polymerization to Polydiacetylenenes Capable of CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed and synthesized three diacetylene monomers M1&#8208;M3 having two NH2 groups. As anticipated, the NH2 groups aided the preorganization of these monomers by N&#8208;H&#8230;N hydrogen bonding. In the crystals of monomer M1 and M2, the intermolecular N&#8211;H&#8230;N hydrogen bonding preorganized the diyne units in an orientation suitable for their topochemical polymerization, but in the case of monomer M3, the distance was slightly larger than that recommended for the topochemical reaction. However, upon heating, all the three monomers underwent topochemical polymerization to yield polydiacetylenes P1&#8208;P3 respectively. All three polymers have been characterized using PXRD, Raman, MALDI&#8208;TOF and solid&#8208;state UV spectroscopy. Furthermore, we investigated the abilities of these amine&#8208;functionalized polymers to capture CO2 gas. Polymer P1, which had a larger surface area, demonstrated the highest CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.28 mmol g&#8722;1 at 273 K and 1 bar, compared to the other two polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Structural Control of the Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Balance in Solids: Structure&#8208;Phase Correlation in DADQs with Enhanced/Switchable Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amorphous/crystalline (A/C) assembly in molecular solids has a direct bearing on their attributes and applications, including mechanical, pharmaceutical, electronic and photophysical.&#160; A systematic analysis of the molecular features and interactions that determine the predilection towards the A, C or bi&#8208;stable A&#8208;C states is critical.&#160; This fundamental problem is addressed through an exhaustive investigation of a large family of alkoxyalkyl diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes (ROR&#8242;&#8208;DADQs); enhancement of their fluorescence from the solution, to the A, to the C state serves as an excellent signature of the phase preference and temporal stability.&#160; Their thermal characteristics and single crystal structure investigations coupled with Hirshfeld surface analysis of the intermolecular interactions, not only confirm the spectroscopic observations, but also reveal the significant impact of the molecular structural features, key interactions like H&#8208;bonds, and molecular orientations in the lattice, on the phase stability.&#160; These explorations lead to a basic structure&#8208;phase correlation; its predictive power is demonstrated by identifying the borderline systems as functional phase change materials, and the subsequent verification through the reversible cycles of fluorescence switching between the A/C states.&#160; The factors promoting the A or C forms of molecular solids can guide the design of novel materials exploiting such supramolecular structures and their interconversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Balances as Physical Organic Chemistry Tools to Quantify Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noncovalent interactions are present in numerous synthetic and biological systems, playing an essential role in vital processes for life such as stabilization of proteins&#8217; structures or reversible binding in substrate&#8208;receptor complexes. Their study is relevant, but it presents challenges due to its inherent weak nature. In this context, molecular balances (MBs) are one of the most efficient physical organic chemistry tools to quantify noncovalent interactions, bringing beneficial knowledge regarding their nature and strength. Herein, we report an overview and critical discussion of recent studies related to various MBs in the quantification of a collection of noncovalent interactions: from the well&#8208;known aryl&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;aryl and CH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;aryl interaction to the newest fullerene&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;aryl and chalcogen&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;chalcogen interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles Derived from Chelating N&#8208;Donor Ligands: Historical Advances, Recent Highlights, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles derived from chelating N&#8208;donor ligands is an area of research that has lagged behind the development of similar heterocycles based on other main group elements, most notably boron. The fact that phosphorus and nitrogen are both group 15 elements and that their compounds are most commonly viewed as Lewis bases likely contributes to this observation. However, through judicious ligand design and creative use of phosphorus sources that render phosphorus as Lewis acidic and/or electron poor, a variety of heterocyclic architectures are possible. In this article, we highlight selected examples of phosphorus adducts of bidentate, tridentate, and tetradentate N&#8208;donor ligands that have shown utility as functional molecular materials, in small molecule activation and catalysis, and as therapeutics and diagnostics in chemical biology. Finally, we look forward to the future of this emerging area and provide commentary on the unique opportunities available to researchers working within the field of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen heterocycle chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific Radical Bromination of &#946;&#8208;Aryl Alcohols with Thiourea Additives Through A Serendipitous Discovery of A 1,2&#8208;Aryl Migration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the bromination of diastereomeric &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols using the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;succinimide (NBS) and thiourea protocol provides a novel pathway to a direct fully stereoretentive bromination of &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols under very mild conditions.







Abstract
The development of new protocols for stereospecific and stereoselective halogenation transformations by mild reaction conditions is a highly desirable research target for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Following the straightforward methodology for directly transforming a wide scope of alcohols to alkyl bromides and chlorides using substoichiometric amounts of thioureas and N&#8208;halo succinimides (NXS) as a halogen source in a single step, we noticed that in apolar solvents bromination of chiral secondary alcohols did not produce the expected racemates. In this study, the stereochemical aspects of the bromination reaction were examined. Surprisingly, bromination of (&#177;)&#8208;threo&#8208; or (&#177;)&#8208;erythro&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanols revealed a single diastereomeric brominated product with retention of configuration. The scope of these reactions was expanded on several &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols. During these studies, an unexpected stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration of the phenyl group was shown to take place. The proposed mechanism of the 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration involves the formation of a spiro[2,5]octadienyl radical, which is then attacked by a bromide radical at any of the two cyclopropyl positions anti to the phenyl position, leading to products that retain the stereoisomeric configuration of the starting material.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Continuous Flow Synthesis of Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride (SF5Cl) Using a Custom&#8208;Made Stirring Packed&#8208;Bed Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein is reported the first continuous flow synthesis of pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF5Cl), the most widely used reagent for introducing the SF5 group onto aliphatic molecules. For this purpose, a custom&#8208;made stirring reactor was designed and allowed rapid, safe and highly efficient synthesis of SF5Cl. Moreover, the following radical addition of SF5Cl on alkynes in a telescoped manner was realized.







Abstract
The pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5&#8722;) group has been the subject of a surge of interest in the past decade, but there is still little practicality associated with its synthesis and installation. Herein is reported the first continuous flow synthesis of pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF5Cl), the most common reagent for the synthesis of SF5&#8208;substituted compounds. The synthesis is based on inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagents: sulfur powder (S8), trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) and potassium fluoride (KF). To this end, a custom&#8208;made stirring reactor was designed to allow for fast, safe, and highly efficient on&#8208;demand synthesis of SF5Cl. The resulting SF5Cl solution is showcased in the radical addition on alkynes in a telescoped fashion.

         <title>Substrate Specificity of Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 Nanozyme: Ascorbic Acid Oxidation and Selective Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 nanozyme, synthesized with Cu2+ as an active site and adenine as a linker in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline, specifically catalyzes ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), and concurrently produced ROS could efficiently triggers intratumor oxidative stress to induce tumor cell death.







Abstract
Though nanozymes are becoming promising alternatives to natural enzymes due to their superior properties, constructing nanozyme with high specificity is still a great challenge. Herein, with Cu2+ as an active site and adenine as a ligand, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 is synthesized in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. As an oxidase mimic, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 could selectively catalyze oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA) to dehydroascorbic acid, but not universal substrates (3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis (3&#8208;ethylbenzthiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol (2,4&#8208;DP)), small biomolecules (dopamine, glutathione, glucose, galactose), other vitamins (vitamin A acid, vitamin B1, vitamin K1) and even dithiothreitol (a common interference of AA). Such the specific AA catalytic oxidation is revealed that Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 selectively binds with AA through hydrogen bonds, accompanied with catalyzing AA oxidation, and concurrently O2 transferring to H2O2 via O2&#8901;&#8722;, further to H2O via &#8901;OH. Based on the produced reactive oxygen species, with AA as a pro&#8208;oxidant, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 nanozyme efficiently triggers severe intratumor oxidative stress to induce tumor cell death. This work opens a new avenue to design intrinsic nanozymes with high specificity, and also presents a promising application in the field of AA oxidation induced cancer therapy.

As an oxidase mimic, Adenine-Cu-PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; could selectively catalyze oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA) to dehydroascorbic acid, but not universal substrates (3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), 2,2&#8217;-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DP)), small biomolecules (dopamine, glutathione, glucose, galactose), other vitamins (vitamin A acid, vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, vitamin K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and even dithiothreitol (a common interference of AA). Such the specific AA catalytic oxidation is revealed that Adenine-Cu-PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectively binds with AA through hydrogen bonds, accompanied with catalyzing AA oxidation, and concurrently O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transferring to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, further to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O via &#8901;OH. Based on the produced reactive oxygen species, with AA as a pro-oxidant, Adenine-Cu-PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanozyme efficiently triggers severe intratumor oxidative stress to induce tumor cell death. This work opens a new avenue to design intrinsic nanozymes with high specificity, and also presents a promising application in the field of AA oxidation induced cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Long Chain Esters via Formate Hydroesterification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic olefin carbonyl methods commonly rely on fossil fuel sourced carbon monoxide feedstocks. Extension of carbon dioxide hydrogenation catalysis has produced a new, selective route to long chain esters from olefins using a tandem catalytic process. In either single or dual stage reactions, cooperative ruthenium and palladium catalysts reduce CO2 to formate esters then hydroesterify olefins to generate value added esters.







Abstract
CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification is an attractive route to produce value added ester compounds, which could replace widely used CO&#8208;based hydroesterification processes if sufficient catalytic technologies are developed. One path to CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification could proceed through an organoformate intermediate, which is then used in olefin hydroesterification to generate the desirable esters. This route opens the possibility of creating a net CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification process using tandem catalytic systems for CO2 hydrogenation to organoformate paired with formate&#8208;olefin hydroesterification. The tandem use of tripodal phosphine ruthenium(II) and 1,2&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphinomethyl)benzene palladium catalysts were found to successfully produce methyl nonanoate from CO2, H2, methanol and 1&#8208;octene in a single&#8208;stage batch process. The CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification catalysis efficiency was found to be largely limited by the productivity of organoformate generation and competitive 1&#8208;octene reduction. Catalytic yields of methyl nonanoate can be enhanced by adjustments in reaction procedures, including the use of a two&#8208;stage batch reaction process or delayed introduction of 1&#8208;octene, achieving a yield of up to 32&#8201;%. Under select conditions, control experiments indicate yields of methyl nonanoate can be improved to ca 75&#8201;%. Preliminary studies indicate significant interplay between the two ligands employed in the molecular tandem catalytic systems and establish the first catalytic protocol for the selective CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification of olefins via organoformates.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Polyferrocenylmethylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polyferrocenylmethylenes was prepared via ring&#8208;opening transmetalation polymerization (ROTP), starting from the corresponding carba[1]magnesocenophanes. Different substitution patterns have been investigated with regards to the polymers&#8217; properties and gave some insights into the underlying reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the polyferrocenylmethylenes were investigated as preceramic polymers.







Abstract
The synthesis of differently substituted polyferrocenylmethylenes (PFM) via ring&#8208;opening transmetalation polymerization (ROTP) is reported. A number of novel, symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted carba[1]magnesocenophanes have been prepared, which were used as precursors and allowed investigations of the influence of different substitution patterns on the PFM polymer properties. The novel carba[1]magnesocenophanes have been fully characterized by 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, and structurally authenticated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD). The corresponding PFMs were obtained with molecular weights in a range of Mw=1900&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 up to 15100&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and corresponding dispersities of &#272;=1.48 to 1.81. All PFMs have been fully characterized by 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, as well as by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (MALDI&#8208;ToF) mass spectrometry. Pyrolysis of spyrocyclic substituted PFM resulted in a ceramic yield above 50&#8201;%, while the obtained residue was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD).

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds via Cu/TEMPO/O2 Aerobic Catalytic System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu/TEMPO/O2 system that is suitable for converting alcohols, ketones, lactones, and lactams to their &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is reported. The Cu&#8208;catalyzed system performs high activity and selectivity, and H2O is the byproduct produced.







Abstract
An N,N,N&#8208;type Cu(II) complex&#8208;catalyzed desaturation method for converting alcohols, ketones, lactones, and lactams to their &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is reported. The dehydrogenation reaction can be conducted with a green terminal oxidant O2 without requiring strong acid/base or stoichiometric oxidants. The Cu(II) complex/TEMPO/O2 system uses a non&#8208;noble catalyst, and a green terminal oxidant as well as demonstrates high activity and functional group tolerance. Notably, H2O is the byproduct produced and overoxidation is not observed during the reaction process. The proposed mechanism was investigated via high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), in&#8197;situ FT&#8208;IR spectrometry, and GC analysis, and the formation of intermediates of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds from the aerobic dehydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;saturated counterparts was observed.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work firstly disclosed that indoline&#8208;derived azadienes could serve as 1&#8208;atom synthons, providing a straightforward protocol for indoline&#8208;spiro&#8208;hexahydropyrimidines via an innovative formal [1+5] cyclization between indoline&#8208;derived azadienes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes.







Abstract
An unprecedented formal [1+5] cyclization of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes with 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes has been realized, providing a facile access to biologically important indoline&#8208;spiro&#8208;hexahydropyrimidines with good to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield). Different from previous reports, this is the first study that indoline&#8208;derived azadienes could participate in cyclizations as one&#8208;atom synthons. This methodology is also distinguished by not involving any additive or catalyst, readily available starting materials, wide range of substrate applicability, operational simplicity and simultaneously reassembling two C&#8722;N and two C&#8722;C bonds in one&#8208;step reaction.

ZJNU&#8208;402 achieves a remarkable C3H8 adsorption capacity and selectivity values of 375 for C3H8/CH4 and 31 for C2H6/CH4. This innovation enables efficient one&#8208;step purification, particularly in separating C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixtures, yielding high&#8208;purity methane.







Abstract
The advancement of high&#8208;value CH4 purification technology within the natural gas industry is paramount for industrial processes. Herein, we constructed ZJNU&#8208;402, a new porous material characterized by permanent porosity, as an effective adsorbent for separating C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 mixtures. The findings reveal an outstanding C3H8 adsorption capacity of 68&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a moderate C2H6 adsorption rate of 42&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a notably lower CH4 adsorption rate of 11&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. Noteworthy is the exceptional selectivity of ZJNU&#8208;402 for C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4, standing at 375 and 31, respectively, surpassing many previously documented high&#8208;performance adsorbents and breaking the traditional trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation selectivity. Adsorption heat calculations show that compared with CH4 molecules, C3H8 and C2H6 molecules form stronger bonds with the skeleton, resulting in excellent separation performance. In addition, the breakthrough experiment of ZJNU&#8208;402 can also completely separate the ternary component C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixture to obtain 99.95&#8201;% high&#8208;purity methane. At the same time, ZJNU&#8208;402 also has excellent structural stability, excellent recyclability, and low isosteric adsorption heat. Consequently, ZJNU&#8208;402 exhibits substantial potential for augmenting the efficacy of natural gas enrichment processes.

         <title>Construction of MOF&#8208;Derived Vanadium Nitride Decorated Micro/Mesoporous Carbon Nanofibers for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
V&#8211;MOF was incorporated into the electrostatic spinning technique to prepare VN decorated N&#8208;doped micro/mesoporous carbon nanofibers (VN/N&#8208;MCNF) with abundant porous structure and high electronic conductivity as a stabilizing host structure for ZIBs. The capacity retention rate of the VN/N&#8208;MCNF electrode can reach more than 90&#8201;% after 200 cycles at a low current density of 0.3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Design and manufacture of cathode materials, with suitable pore structure and high electrical conductivity to matching zinc anode, solving the problem of dissolution and structural degradation of cathode materials for zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), is great significance to the development of ZIBs. Herein, Vanadium Nitride (VN) uniformly decorated N&#8208;doped micro/mesoporous carbon nanofibers (VN/N&#8208;MCNF) with appropriate porous and reactive sites for Zn2+ is prepared by using V&#8211;MOF, as important precursor via electrostatic spinning and pyrolysis technique. As a cathode electrode for ZIBs, the VN/N&#8208;MCNF is suitable for diffusion and adsorption of large&#8208;sized solvated structured [Zn(H2O)6]2+, for its abundant micro/mesoporous structure and good electrical conductivity. The VN/N&#8208;MCNF electrode has high specific capacity of 242&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and rate performance. Moreover, the VN/N&#8208;MCNF&#8208;based ZIBs can reach 92.5&#8201;% capacity retention after 200 cycles at a low current density of 0.3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and can reach 86.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. These findings highlight the importance of a rational design of cathode materials for high&#8208;performance metal batteries, which can also be extended to the design of other materials.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidation of Methane to Methanol on a Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane oxidation to methanol was efficiently catalyzed a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on cobalt vanadotungstate at a low temperature without co&#8208;reductants. The hydroxyl&#8208;based active species generated in the V and Co sites in the micropore of the catalyst, which selectively oxidized methane to form methanol.







Abstract
Direct oxidation of methane to methanol utilizing molecular oxygen under mild conditions is an important yet challenging process due to the difficulty in activating of methane under such conditions. In this research, we report on zeolitic octahedral metal oxides based on cobalt vanadotungstates, which act as the catalysts for the oxidation of methane using molecular oxygen as the oxidant without co&#8208;reductants at a low temperature of 90&#8201;&#176;C even as low as 60&#8201;&#176;C. This catalytic process results in the high&#8208;yield production of methanol as the primary product. The micropores within the catalyst are critical for achieving high activity in the reaction, in which molecular oxygen is activated. The active species in the reaction are found to be hydroxyl&#8208;based. Both VO5 with reduced V4+ and Co2+ are crucial for generating the active species for the reaction.
