         <title>Discotic Liquid Crystalline Phenazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 51, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the influence of molecular design, specifically the roles of chemical structure, conformation, and geometry on the self&#8208;assembly and functional properties of phenazine&#8208;based DLCs relevant to optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Phenazines, otherwise known as dibenzo&#8208;annulated pyrazines, are a unique class of tricyclic organic molecules. They are chemically stable and highly aromatic due to their extended conjugation. Along with their biomedicinal significance, phenazines often play a major role in manipulating the optical as well as electrical properties of organic semiconductors. The planar structure in the heterocyclic aromatic phenazines and their natural inclination to form stacked columns due to the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between two consecutive molecules have made them quite a suitable moiety for the formation as well as extension of the core part of discotic liquid crystals (DLCs). Their&#160;efficient charge&#8208;carrying ability makes them well&#8208;suited for organic electronic materials. Furthermore, their properties can be fine&#8208;tuned with simple chemical changes, rendering them appropriate for many advanced applications. This review focuses on the chemistry of phenazine&#8208;based DLCs and their significance in optoelectronic applications.

Is it a boron atom, or is it a carbon atom? Given that BO33&#8722; and CO32&#8722; have very similar geometries, one can easily be mistaken for the other. In this paper we detail the probable mischaracterization of a supposed BO33&#8722;&#8208;containing complex.








Abstract
The trinuclear copper complex originally formulated as {[Cu(bpy)2]3BO3}(ClO4)4.2O, purportedly containing a triply bridging BO33&#8722; ligand, appears to be the known complex {[Cu(bpy)2]3CO3}(ClO4)4.0.5H2O, containing a triply bridging carbonate ligand.

         <title>A Fluorinated Anodic Aluminum Oxide Nanopores Coating Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Self&#8208;healing Triboelectrification and Anti&#8208;corrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 51, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triboelectric nanogenerator with the surface of alumina nanostructures by anodic oxidation method was prepared. Compared to TENG with aluminum sheets, TENG with alumina nanopores has higher triboelectric output. Low surface energy compounds loaded in alumina nanopores can migrate to the surface to achieve a triboelectrification self&#8208;healing property. In addition to supplying energy such as lighting, the electrical energy collected with TENG can also be used to protect carbon steel against corrosion through self&#8208;powered cathodic protection.








Abstract
The triboelectric layer is a key component affecting the performance of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). Herein, a TENG with a triboelectric layer possessing a fluorinated&#8208;anodic&#8208;alumina&#8208;nanopores structure was prepared. The nanopores structure can increase the contact area and thus increase the triboelectric output. The fluorination treatment further increased the output. The current output of this TENG is 10.4&#160;&#181;A, while that of the TENG with a pristine&#8208;aluminum&#8208;based triboelectric layer is 3.7&#160;&#181;A. The ability of the low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy compounds loaded in the alumina nanopores to migrate to the surface leads to a triboelectrification self&#8208;healing property. In addition to supplying energy such as lighting, the electrical energy collected with TENG can also be used to protect carbon steel against corrosion through self&#8208;powered cathodic protection.

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS Through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 51, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the F&#8208;doped NiCoPS nanowires were synthesized&#160;as a high&#8208;performance catalyst for seawater oxygen evolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the strongly electronegative fluorine improves the surface electronic structure of NiCoPS, further enhancing the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates and electronic conductivity. This work provides an efficient strategy to design effective and durable oxygen evolution reaction(OER) electrocatalysts in alkaline seawater.








Abstract
Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine&#160;ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100)&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and the Tafel slope (44&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100&#160;hours. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient, and nonnoble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Peptoids with Two Different Binding Sites for Strong ATP Chelation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 51, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATP is key for activating enzymes associated with cancer. A potential therapeutic approach is strong binding of ATP, making it unavailable to enzymes. The water&#8208;soluble peptoid P1&#8208;TB incorporates two synergistic binding sites for ATP: terpyridine&#8208;Zn&#178;&#8314; and 4&#8208;CPBA that bind ATP's phosphate and diol groups, respectively, and exhibits an exceptional K&#7429;&#8208;ATP of 7.416&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;9&#160;M, representing a potential ATP chelator.








Abstract
Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) is the activator of many enzymes, including kinases, that play a significant role in various medical conditions such as cancer. Therefore, inhibiting ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes requires to disable its binding to enzymes, and this can be done by developing potent ATP chelators. Currently, there are two main types of chelators: one that binds ATP via zinc complexes of nitrogen&#8208;based ligands, such as 2,2&#8242;;6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (Terpy), which target&#160;the phosphate ligands, and another one containing phenylboronic acid (PBA) to bind the diols within the ribose. Herein, we report on a unique chelation approach that combines these two binding strategies in one scaffold; we use peptidomimetic oligomers called peptoids that incorporate both Zn(Terpy) and PBA as strong, water&#8208;soluble ATP binding inhibitors. These peptoids demonstrated high affinity to ATP, where the highest is KD&#8208;ATP&#160;=&#160;7.416&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;9&#160;M, four times higher than the binding affinity of peptoids targeting only phosphates or only diols, and at least two orders of magnitude higher than known ATP chelators. Structural studies indicated that positioning both Terpy and PBA side chains close together on the scaffold increased ATP binding affinity, compared to spacing them apart.

&lt;p&gt;ATP is key for activating enzymes associated with cancer. A potential therapeutic approach is strong binding of ATP, making it unavailable to enzymes. The water-soluble peptoid P1-TB incorporates two synergistic binding sites for ATP: terpyridine-Zn&#178;&#8314; and 4-CPBA that bind ATP's phosphate and diol groups, respectively, and exhibits an exceptional K&lt;i&gt;&#7429;&lt;/i&gt;-ATP of 7.416&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;9&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;M, representing a potential ATP chelator.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning of Physicochemical Properties of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Oxetanes Introducing Fluorine Atom(s) on the Building Blocks Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 51, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research has shown the impact of the fluorine atom on changing the physicochemical properties of oxetane&#8208;based building blocks compared to other close analogs and fluorine&#8208;free derivatives. This knowledge can be utilized by the chemical community for fine&#8208;tuning of the abovementioned properties.








Abstract
Fluorinated oxetane derivatives garner significant attention due to their unique physicochemical properties and diverse bioisosteric possibilities for potential applications in medicinal chemistry. We developed robust methodologies for the synthesis of 3&#8208;fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted oxetanes, leveraging nucleophilic substitution, deoxy&#8208; and deoxofluorination, as well as fluoroiodination as key steps of introduction of fluorine atoms directly to the oxetane core or adjacent alkyl groups. Optimized reaction sequences enabled the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of various small building blocks, i.e., amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, etc. Physicochemical studies revealed that fluorination significantly impacts acidity, with oxetane derivatives demonstrating the decrease of pKa values on up to three units in the case of replacement of gem&#8208;dimethyl, cyclopropyl&#8208; or cyclobutylidene moieties. These findings underscore the utility of fluorinated oxetanes as versatile building blocks for future applications in drug design and advanced materials.

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 51, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New examples of (3&#160;+&#160;2)&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation reactions of Donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) with 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;methylallenes in the presence of GaCl3 were demonstrated. The starting DACs act in these processes as the source of 1,3&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates. Substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, tetrahydrobenzo[c]fluorenylmalonates, and exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates were obtained with high diastereoselectivity and good yields.








Abstract
The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0 &#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3&#160;+&#160;2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.

In this study, we report the thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines using a ball mill with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120&#160;&#176;C within 2 h. The parameter screenings revealed an insight into the reactivity of the reaction. Furthermore, various metal centers and building blocks were utilized to emphasize the variability of this approach. Lastly, a crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine was synthesized with&#160;&gt;99% yield.








Abstract
We present a thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines with varying metal centers and building blocks. The reactions were performed using a Retsch Mixer Mill 400 equipped with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120&#160;&#176;C within 2 h. A systematic screening of reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, frequency, and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG), revealed that temperature and time significantly influence the reaction outcome, as well as the use of LAG compared to neat grinding, which further enhances the yield. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the obtained metal phthalocyanines confirmed the presence of different polymorphs, suggesting a correlation between reaction conditions and crystallinity. Furthermore, the crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine (CoPPc) was successfully synthesized with a yield of&#160;&gt;99%.

         <title>Fine Tuning of the Redox&#8208;Active Diguanidine Ligand in Cationic Cobalt Complexes for Electronic Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 51, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation in Co complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands is either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to paramagnetic high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with radical monocationic diguanidine ligands or low&#8208;spin CoIII redox isomers with neutral diguanidine ligands. Careful ligand design leads to the energetic harmonization of the two redox isomers and realization of one&#8208;electron oxidation processes that are both metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered.








Abstract
In this work we show that the redox chemistry of hexacoordinated cobalt complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands could be tuned by modifying the diguanidine and/or the co&#8208;ligands. In this way, one&#8208;electron oxidation could be directed to be either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with an oxidized, radical&#8208;monocationic diguanidine ligand (ligand&#8208;centered oxidation) or low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with a reduced, neutral diguanidine ligand. Further fine&#8208;tuning of the redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligand leads to a harmonization of the energies of both redox isomers. Consequently, ligand&#8208; as well as metal&#8208;centered one&#8208;electron oxidation is observed, resulting in a mixture of both redox isomers. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations confirm the energetic proximity of the two redox isomers in this bistable system. The results of this work contribute to the development of a directed approach toward the design of bistable cobalt&#8208;guanidine complexes and their possible applications in spin&#8208;switching devices.

     alt="Fine Tuning of the Redox-Active Diguanidine Ligand in Cationic Cobalt Complexes for Electronic Structure Control"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidation in Co complexes with redox-active diguanidine ligands is either ligand- or metal-centered, leading to paramagnetic high-spin Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with radical monocationic diguanidine ligands or low-spin Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; redox isomers with neutral diguanidine ligands. Careful ligand design leads to the energetic harmonization of the two redox isomers and realization of one-electron oxidation processes that are both metal- and ligand-centered.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work we show that the redox chemistry of hexacoordinated cobalt complexes with redox-active diguanidine ligands could be tuned by modifying the diguanidine and/or the co-ligands. In this way, one-electron oxidation could be directed to be either ligand- or metal-centered, leading to high-spin Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with an oxidized, radical-monocationic diguanidine ligand (ligand-centered oxidation) or low-spin Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with a reduced, neutral diguanidine ligand. Further fine-tuning of the redox-active diguanidine ligand leads to a harmonization of the energies of both redox isomers. Consequently, ligand- as well as metal-centered one-electron oxidation is observed, resulting in a mixture of both redox isomers. Quantum-chemical calculations confirm the energetic proximity of the two redox isomers in this bistable system. The results of this work contribute to the development of a directed approach toward the design of bistable cobalt-guanidine complexes and their possible applications in spin-switching devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent N6 versus Cvinyl Arylation of 8&#8208;Vinyl Adenine Nucleosides, Sequential Diarylation, Fluorescence Properties, and Computational Evaluations**</title>

Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination and Heck arylation reactions are complementary transformations, generally requiring a suitable catalyst combination and a base. With substrates containing both an amino group and a vinyl moiety, control of C&#9472;N versus C&#9472;C reactivity can lead to regiodivergent functionalizations. With this focus, reactions of silyl&#8208;protected 8&#8208;vinyl 2'&#8208;deoxyadenosine and adenosine with aryl bromides and iodides have been studied. Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, and preformed dichloro[1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;t&#8208;butylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium (II) (Pd&#8208;118) were evaluated as metal sources. Ligands tested were Xantphos, DPEphos, BIPHEP, and DPPF, with Cs2CO3 and K3PO4 as bases. In toluene as solvent, the Pd(OAc)2/Xantphos/Cs2CO3 combination was uniquely capable of predominant N6 arylation. Aryl bromides and iodides gave comparable product yields. Replacement of Cs2CO3 with K3PO4 redirected arylation from the nitrogen atom to the vinyl carbon atom, and all other catalyst, ligand, and base combinations gave Cvinyl arylation as well. Simply switching from Pd(OAc)2 to Pd2(dba)3 resulted in loss of the N6&#8208;selectivity and Cvinyl arylation was favored. Based upon these results, using two structurally similar catalytic systems sequential Cvinyl and N6 arylations of the nucleosides were accomplished. Some of the products were converted to other novel nucleoside analogues. Because some compounds were fluorescent, their photophysical properties were assessed experimentally and computationally.

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Conjugations in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 51, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here nitroreductase&#8208;responsive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligations have been demonstrated, enabled by nitrobenzyl caged dihydrotetrazines. By tagging a nitroreductase&#8208;activatable tetrazine precursor with an integrin&#8208;specific peptide c(RGDyK), a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation has been achieved in the presence of hypoxic cancer cells.








Abstract
Prodrugs in response to tumor&#8208;overexpressed enzymes offer a targeted approach for cancer therapy. However, this strategy faces several challenges, including poor water solubility, off&#8208;target effects, and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD&#8208;NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor&#8208;associated integrin &#945;v&#946;3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed Nitroreductase (NTR) among hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged payloads through &#8220;click&#8208;to&#8208;release&#8221; reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor&#8208;selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.

         <title>In Quest for Polyenic Macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 Identity: Stereoselective Synthesis of DP4+&#8208;Based Purported Structure and Biogenetically Inspired Positional Stereoisomers</title>

The DP4+&#8208;predicted (8R,10R,19R)&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150 stereoisomer and the C11&#8208;epimeric structures of iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150 with the hydroxyl groups located at the odd&#8208;numbered positions (C9 and C11) as biogenetically inspired by the collinearity principle of their modular sequence, namely (9S,11S,19R)&#8208;iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150&#8208;1 and (9S,11R,19R)&#8208;iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150&#8208;2, were stereoselectively synthesized, but the NMR data did not match those of the natural product, which keeps its structure undetermined.








Abstract
Total synthesis of polyenic macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 with all&#8208;trans geometries, hydroxyl substituents located at C8 and C10 and 8R,10R,19R absolute configuration, the most likely stereoisomer predicted by DP4+ calculations, was completed. The formal syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol was synthesized iteratively by enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective Krische's allylation reactions. The construction of the conjugated triene units was based on a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the corresponding alkenylboronates and alkenyliodides, and Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) condensation reactions. Macrolactam formation promoted by HATU and DIPEA was best carried out by amine protecting group exchange and release of both reactive functional groups under basic conditions. Given the lack of correspondence of the 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR data for the synthetic and purported JBIR&#8208;150, the hydroxyl groups of JBIR&#8208;150 were alternatively proposed to be located at the odd&#8208;numbered positions (C9, C11) based on the general biogenesis of the family of polyenic macrolactams and the collinearity principle of their modular sequence. The C11&#8208;diastereoisomers of the biogenetically inspired 9,11&#8208;dihydroxy positional isomers (termed iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150) with formal syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;diol configurations were completed. Much to our dismay, the NMR data of the synthetic diastereomeric polyenic macrolactams with 9S,11S,19R or 9S,11R,19R absolute configuration did not match those of the natural product, and the structural identity of JBIR&#8208;150 remains undetermined.

         <dc:description>
Here we report two novel Lanthanide Coordination Polymers, [Tb2(AATA)3(DMF)4] (1) and [Eu2(AATA)3(DMF)4] (2), with enhanced luminescence. These MOFs were then embedded in PDMS to create a bilayer configuration. We implemented a novel ratiometric approach to achieve highly accurate SO2 detection. 2 serves as an internal reference while 1 act as the SO2&#8208;sensitive component offering high sensitivity, specificity, and a pioneer application of a bilayer system.








Abstract
The development of responsive materials for monitoring atmospheric toxic emissions is a growing area of interest. Luminescent metal&#8208;organic framework (LMOF), particularly those based on lanthanides (LnMOFs), have emerged as promising candidates due to their sharp emission bands, long luminescence lifetimes, and structural versatility. Despite their potential, the integration of LnMOFs into robust solid&#8208;state sensing platforms remains limited. In this study, we report the synthesis of three isostructural LnMOFs &#8208;[Tb2(AATA)3(DMF)4], [Eu2(AATA)3(DMF)4], [Gd2(AATA)3(DMF)4]&#8208; based on the antenna&#8208;type ligand 2,5&#8208;bis(acetylamido)terephthalic acid, which promotes strong lanthanide emission and stable 2D frameworks. The MOFs were successfully embedded into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to produce composite films retaining their luminescent properties in the solid state. We further present a conceptual bilayer configuration with one film acting as a stable internal reference, and the other serving as the analyte&#8208;responsive layer. This bilayer design enables ratiometric luminescence detection, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the measurements. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that the bilayer films exhibit measurable luminescence changes in presence of two major atmospheric pollutants, NO2 and SO2. This result sets a foundational approach for developing more accurate and self&#8208;referencing luminescent materials.

         <title>Crown Ether Supported Alkali Metal Phosphides: Synthesis, Structures and Bonding</title>

Crowned! Herein we describe a complete series of crown ether coordinated alkali metal phosphides from lithium to cesium, including solid state structures, detailed investigations in solution and extensive quantum chemical investigation of the bonding situation.








Abstract
Herein we present the synthesis and full characterization of the previously unpresented lithium diphenyl phosphides Li(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)PPh2 (1Li) and Li(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)PPh2 (2Li) as well as the heavy homologues Rb(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PPh2 (1Rb) and Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PPh2 (1Cs). We thus complete the series of crown ether coordinated alkali metal diphenyl phosphides and reveal that the structural diversity increases upon descending the group. Including the previously reported Na and K derivatives, we performed a detailed study of the title compounds in solution that strongly indicated all of them are monomers with an alkali metal phosphide AM&#8211;P interaction. We further investigated the influence of the phosphorus&#8208;bound substituents on the bond between the Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) and the phosphide fragment. For this purpose, we synthesized and characterized two new cesium phosphides, alkyl&#8208;aryl Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PtBuPh (4Cs) and bis&#8208;alkyl Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PtBu2 (5Cs). We observed here that the heavy alkali metals Rb and Cs favor coordination via &#960;&#8208;arene interactions&#160;over the P donor dative interactions. Finally, we used state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical methods to analyze the bonding situation in the title series of compounds.

         <title>Injectable Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogel Integrated with Hybrid Nanovesicles for Synergistic Enhancement of Transdermal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile Hybrid&#8208;Gel platform combining CoQ10&#8208;loaded hybrid nanovesicles with an injectable, pH&#8208;responsive hydrogel network significantly enhances transdermal drug delivery efficiency, offering a robust strategy for localized therapy.








Abstract
Plant&#8208;derived nanovesicles offer promising potential for transdermal drug delivery due to their inherent biocompatibility and low immunogenicity, yet face limitations in drug loading, structural stability, and functional optimization. This study presents a versatile Hybrid&#8208;Gel platform that integrates CoQ10&#8208;loaded hybrid vesicles with an injectable, pH&#8208;responsive hydrogel to enhance localized drug delivery. High&#8208;purity nanovesicles are isolated using an optimized ultracentrifugation (UC) and size&#8208;exclusion chromatography (SEC) method, then hybridized with liposomes to improve encapsulation and skin penetration. To further optimize localized delivery performance, an injectable binary hydrogel system is then introduced. This hydrogel, formed via Schiff base crosslinking between hyperbranched polyethylene glycol and aldehyde&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (A&#8208;HA), exhibits mild gelation conditions, excellent injectability, and strong tissue adhesion. The hydrogel effectively encapsulates hybrid nanovesicles, ensuring enhanced stability, ease of administration, and controlled, pH&#8208;responsive release. As a proof of concept, an in vitro permeation test with porcine skin model demonstrates that the hydrogel significantly improves CoQ10 penetration, achieving a more than fourfold increase in transdermal efficiency compared to free CoQ10, suggesting superior bioavailability. This synergistic approach, combining hybrid nanovesicle&#8208;mediated drug transport with a dynamic hydrogel matrix, offers a robust and versatile platform for localized transdermal therapy, with potential applications in precision medicine, regenerative treatments, and chronic disease management.

         <title>Directing Effects of Silyl and Germyl Groups in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the maturity of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution, unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted electrophiles remain underexplored due to inherent regioselectivity challenges. This Concept highlights the strategic use of silyl and germyl groups to overcome this limitation, steering bond formation with high regiocontrol and serving as linchpins for further molecular diversification.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed allylic substitution is a well&#8208;established strategy for the formation of carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds. However, most methods remain incompatible with unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allylic electrophiles as regioselectivity becomes difficult to control when the substituents are electronically and sterically similar. Achieving simultaneous control over the enantio&#8208; and regioselectivity as well as the alkene geometry poses an even greater challenge. To address this, sterically and electronically influential main&#8208;group elements such as carbon's heavier homologues silicon and germanium have been strategically incorporated. These metalloids can steer the bond formation away from their proximity enabling the formation of a single regioisomer while also serving as versatile linchpins for further functionalization. This Concept summarizes the key advancements made in the field since the discovery of the allylic substitution with a particular focus on silyl&#8208; and germyl&#8208;directed strategies that have expanded the synthetic utility of this highly valuable transformation.

         <title>Molecule&#8208;Induced Radical Formation (MIRF) Reaction of Et2BOOEt with Et3B is Key to the Et3B/O2 Radical Initiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open to air Et3B is a common radical initiator. Contrary to previous suggestions, most initiating Et&#8226; radicals in this system are formed in a molecule&#8208;induced radical formation (MIRF) reaction of Et2BOOEt with Et3B, and not in Et3B autoxidation. This reaction of Et2BOOEt with Et3B could be used as a radical initiator in its own right, providing higher radical flux than Et3B/O2, as demonstrated in several model reactions.








Abstract
Open&#8208;to&#8208;air triethylborane (Et3B) is a well&#8208;known room&#8208;temperature initiator of free radical reactions. Current consensus is that the initiating species in this system are ethyl radicals formed in the triethylborane autoxidation cycle, although some early studies suggested that reactions of the oxidation products can also contribute to the initiation. We report a quantitative mechanistic study which demonstrates that most ethyl radicals in the triethylborane initiator system are not formed in the autoxidation cycle but instead are generated by a Molecule&#8208;Induced Radical Formation (MIRF) reaction between triethylborane and its main oxidation product, ethylperoxyborane Et2BOOEt (secondary initiation). A simplified kinetic model allowed us to predict optimal conditions for the initiation, and propose the MIRF reaction as an alternative, homogeneous initiator system.

     alt="Molecule-Induced Radical Formation (MIRF) Reaction of Et2BOOEt with Et3B is Key to the Et3B/O2 Radical Initiation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open to air Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B is a common radical initiator. Contrary to previous suggestions, most initiating Et&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&lt;/sup&gt; radicals in this system are formed in a molecule-induced radical formation (MIRF) reaction of Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BOOEt with Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B, and not in Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B autoxidation. This reaction of Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BOOEt with Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B could be used as a radical initiator in its own right, providing higher radical flux than Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as demonstrated in several model reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-to-air triethylborane (Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B) is a well-known room-temperature initiator of free radical reactions. Current consensus is that the initiating species in this system are ethyl radicals formed in the triethylborane autoxidation cycle, although some early studies suggested that reactions of the oxidation products can also contribute to the initiation. We report a quantitative mechanistic study which demonstrates that most ethyl radicals in the triethylborane initiator system are not formed in the autoxidation cycle but instead are generated by a Molecule-Induced Radical Formation (MIRF) reaction between triethylborane and its main oxidation product, ethylperoxyborane Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BOOEt (secondary initiation). A simplified kinetic model allowed us to predict optimal conditions for the initiation, and propose the MIRF reaction as an alternative, homogeneous initiator system. The high efficiency of this initiator has been demonstrated in several model radical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatially Resolved 2D Laser Writing on Graphene Using Diazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation of laser&#8208;induced covalent patterning, defunctionalization, and refunctionalization of single&#8208;layer graphene with aryl diazonium salts is reported. Scanning Raman microscopy verifies spatial control, while systematic variation of laser parameters and substituent effects highlights the versatility of the method. The demonstrated &#8220;write&#8208;erase&#8208;rewrite&#8221; capability establishes a robust platform for micrometer&#8208;scale fabrication of complex, functionalized graphene architectures.








Abstract
We present the first investigation of precise laser&#8208;guided patterning, functionalization, defunctionalization, and refunctionalization of single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) with three different aryl diazonium salts. Using scanning Raman microscopy (SRM) we confirmed the spatially resolved nature of the functionalization. We systematically investigated the influence of key laser parameters (power, irradiation time, and wavelength) and the electronic effects of the substituents on both the functionalization efficiency and integrity of graphene. Our solid&#8208;phase approach unequivocally demonstrates that laser&#8208;triggered covalent attachment can achieve high functionalization levels comparable to solution&#8208;based methods. We also unveil a novel laser&#8208;induced defunctionalization pathway at high laser powers and prolonged irradiation times, which allows for the precise, patterned functional group &#8220;erasure&#8221; &#8211; a significant advantage over nonselective thermal annealing. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate the successful readdressing and refunctionalization of these laser &#8220;erased&#8221; areas, enabling a complete &#8220;write&#8208;erase&#8208;rewrite&#8221; cycle. This work establishes a robust and highly adaptable platform for creating complex, mixed&#8208;functionalized graphene architectures with micrometer precision.

         <title>Photoswitchable Pseudorotaxanes with Dual Chromism and Tunable Fluorescence for Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photoswitchable pseudorotaxanes were constructed through supramolecular host&#8208;guest interactions, exhibiting distinct photochromic, vapochromic, and fluorescent properties in the solid state, which enables their application in multilevel information encryption systems.








Abstract
The design and construction of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) displaying distinct physical/chemical properties under different states is highly desirable due to their multifunctional applications. Herein, we report a photoswitchable pseudorotaxane system constructed through host&#160;&#8722;&#160;guest interactions between a vinyl&#8208;bipyridinium axle and cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7]) macrocycle. Upon light irradiation, the [3]pseudorotaxane E&#8208;G2+@Q[7]2 in aqueous solution undergoes E&#8594;Z photoisomerization, converting to the [2]pseudorotaxane Z&#8208;G2+@Q[7], where Q[7] selectively encircles the central Z&#8208;vinyl&#8208;bipyridinium unit. Notably, E&#8208;G2+@Q[7]2 displays dual photochromic and vapochromic (NH3) activity, whereas Z&#8208;G2+@Q[7] is optically and vapor&#8208;responsively inert. Additionally, both E&#8208;G2+@Q[7]2 and Z&#8208;G2+@Q[7] exhibit distinct solid&#8208;state fluorescence emissions due to macrocyclic confinement effects. By leveraging these stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, we developed a multilevel information encryption system with three decryption states controlled by wavelength&#8208;specific irradiation (365&#160;nm, 430&#160;nm, or xenon lamp), enabling programmable message display via fluorescence and color changes. This work provides a paradigm for designing smart materials with integrated photoswitching, chromic, and fluorescent functionalities for advanced security applications.

         <title>Green Carbon Fiber Modification for Structural Battery: the Effect of Treatment Parameters on Structural Battery Body Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops an eco&#8208;friendly method to enhance the mechanical properties of carbon fiber reinforced composites for structural batteries. Hydrogen peroxide&#8208;based oxidation is optimized by varying concentration, temperature, and time, achieving effective interfacial adhesion without damaging fibers. FTIR, XPS, and SEM confirm functionalization and uniform surface roughness, while tensile tests show &#8764;80% strength improvement under 30 wt% H2O2 at 60 &#176;C for 45 min. The approach reduces environmental impact and supports multifunctional, lightweight composites for electric vehicle and aerospace applications.








Abstract
Batteries and environmental processes are essential for the progress of contemporary technology from two distinct considering a sustainable future. Environmental processes aim for minimizing material and energy usage while regulating systems do not release dangerous gasses. The presented work demonstrates the modification of carbon fiber (CF) to enhance the strength of the outer case of structural batteries, a novel form of battery. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an eco&#8208;friendly compound, has been utilized for this purpose. The strength of the carbon fiber enhances with the formation of the interface. The experimental results indicate that carbon fibers treated in a 30&#160;wt.% H2O2 solution at 60 &#176;C for 45 minutes exhibited an 80% enhancement in strength than pristine CF and a 35% improvement relative to the desized CF.

         <title>Synthesis of a Functionalized Bicyclo[3.2.1]Octane: A Common Subunit to Kauranes, Grayananes, and Gibberellanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed account on the synthesis of a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane scaffold, common to the kaurane, grayanane, and gibberellane diterpenoid families, is reported. Our original strategy relying on a 1,4&#8208;sila&#8208;Prins cyclization proved unsuccessful. Learning from that, we designed an alternative strategy relying on ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM), which ultimately led to the desired compound in 8 steps.








Abstract
Kauranes, grayananes, and gibberellanes are three important diterpenoid families. These natural products all share a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane skeleton, with oxidation at very specific positions. In this manuscript, we describe the synthesis of a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane building block, which could serve as a potential intermediate for the synthesis of natural products from these three families. A first approach relying on a 1,4&#8208;sila&#8208;Prins cyclization was first explored, which required the selective functionalization of dihydrocarvone (via C&#9472;H activation and selective oxidation). This strategy resulted in a dead end when a 1,2&#8208;cyclization product was obtained. An alternative strategy relying on ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) allowed to successfully achieve the synthesis of the desired scaffold in 8 steps from cyclohexenone.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Doped Copper Oxide Nanorods for Efficient Biomass Electro&#8208;Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
In this work, we have demonstrated that Ni doping improved the activity of HMFOR by optimizing the electronic structure of Cu sites and enhancing the adsorption of HMF. The Ni&#8208;CuOx exhibits a large current density of 199.7 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.4 V, which is 2.8&#8208;fold higher than that of pure CuOx. Moreover, it achieves a high FDCA yield of 90.1% and a Faraday efficiency of 98.5%.








Abstract
Cu&#8208;based catalysts are regarded as promising materials for the electro&#8208;oxidation of biomass. However, developing effective strategies to improve the intrinsic activity of Cu&#8208;based catalysts is still challenging and rarely reported. Herein, we synthesized a nickel&#8208;doped copper oxide catalyst (Ni&#8208;CuOx) for 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) electro&#8208;oxidation to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The Ni&#8208;CuOx exhibited a large current density of 199.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.4&#160;V, which is 2.8&#8208;fold higher than that of pure CuOx, and exceeds most of the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts. Moreover, the Ni&#8208;CuOx also showed high FDCA yield (90.1%) and Faradaic efficiency (98.5%). Physical characterizations and electrochemical analyses demonstrated that Ni doping optimizes the electronic structure of Cu sites, and promoting the adsorption of HMF, contributing to enhanced electrocatalytic activity. This work provides insights into the rational design of copper&#8208;based catalysts for biomass electro&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Developing High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Zn&#8208;Doped V10O24&#183;12H2O Cathode</title>

Zinc doping into V10O24&#183;12H2O enhances its electronic conductivity and expands the interlayer spacing, thereby enabling superior rate capability and prolonged durability as a cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered attention as a cost&#8208;effective and safer alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, developing suitable cathode materials which can reversibly host Zn2&#160;+&#160;ions remains a challenge. Herein we explore the effect of zinc doping into hydrothermally synthesized V10O24.12H2O (ZVO) and demonstrate that such doping enhances electronic conductivity and structural stability, leading to improved rate capability and cycling performance of ZVO as a cathode material for AZIBs. The effect of zinc doping in the V10O24.12H2O as a ZIB cathode has not been previously explored. The ZVO materials had a bundled rod&#8208;like morphology with a zinc content of 1.3% and an average oxidation state of 4.86 for the vanadium. DFT calculations further validate that Zn doping to the pristine V10O24&#160;is thermodynamically favorable, which also improves the electronic conductivity of the ZVO. As a result, the Zn//ZVO cell exhibited superior specific capacity and improved rate performance over the pristine V10O24.12H2O (VO) electrode, with a high specific capacity of 359 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g and sustained 121 mAh/g at 5 A/g. The Zn//ZVO cell also showed commendable cycle stability with 90 mAh/g capacity retention over 1110 cycles, which was equivalent to the starting capacity of the pristine VO cathode.

         <title>Cage Amine Superbases: Synthesis and Studies of Nona(ethylene)Hexamine and Dodeka(ethylene)Octamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strongest known cage&#8208;amine bases, nona(ethylene)hexamine and dodeka(ethylene)octamine have been prepared and characterized using experimental and theoretical methods.








Abstract
The cage&#8208;amine molecules nona(ethylene)hexamine and dodeka(ethylene)octamine, have been prepared by coupling 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (tacn) or 1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen) to the corresponding &#945;&#8208;chloroacetamide derivatives of these macrocycles. The formed tri&#8208; or tetra&#8208;amide cryptands were then reduced to the corresponding hexamine and octamine with borane. In all cases, the amide and amine cryptands were isolated as protonated ammonium salts, with the proton oriented to the inside of the cage molecules (i.e., endohedral). Deprotonation studies on the hexamine and octamine showed the encapsulated protons are highly inert, with no evidence of deprotonation or deuterium exchange. Detailed theoretical studies predict very high proton affinity and basicity of 1118.7 and 1086.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, for dodeka(ethylene)octamine, and 1108.3 and 1083.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively, for nona(ethylene)hexamine, placing them among the strongest amine bases ever prepared and firmly within the realm of &#8220;superbases&#8221;.

         <title>Reactivity of a Substituted Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substituted aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state is not a strong electrophile like the analogous singlet aryloxenium cations. It undergoes only radical reactions that are remarkably fast for a delocalized &#960;&#8208;type biradical.








Abstract
Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively charged, monovalent oxygen atom. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents by the same cation. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide, and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for a substituted aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.

         <title>An Amino Acid&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Shrinking Supramolecular Bioactive Hydrogel &#8208; A Sustainable Platform for Wastewater Treatment and Water Purification</title>

Syneresis behavior of an amino acid (Fmoc&#8208;hPhe&#8208;OH, hF)&#8208;based bioactive hydrogel has been portrayed with the potential for purifying industrial wastewater through a sustainable and green platform.








Abstract
This study investigates the unique syneresis (self&#8208;shrinking) behavior of N&#8208;Terminally Fmoc&#8208;protected amino acid, Fmoc&#8208;hPhe&#8208;OH (Fmoc&#8208;homo&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine, abbreviated in this work as hF)&#8208;based hydrogel, and its potential in environmental remediation applications. Fmoc&#8208;hPhe&#8208;OH (hF) forms a hydrogel in 50&#160;mM phosphate buffer (PB) of pH 7.4. Interestingly, hF&#8208;based hydrogel shows syneresis behavior with controlled release of residual water from the hydrogel matrix. Moreover, this hydrogelator can form co&#8208;assembled hydrogels with various dyes, including Congo Red and Rhodamine B; natural water samples, including natural mud water and sea water; and heavy metal ions aqueous solutions, including CdII, PbII, and HgII separately in 50&#160;mM PB of pH 7.4. Interestingly, after 2 to 3 hours for shake gel and 5&#8211;6 hours for nonshake gel, the released waters have been tested and it has been found that these co&#8208;assembled hydrogels are capable of retaining almost all the contaminants within the shrink hydrogels matrix and releasing almost pure water along with the presence of hydrogel nanofibers. Syneresis is augmented to purify the contaminated water with dyes, mud, dissolved salts, and toxic heavy metal ions. These co&#8208;assembled hydrogels, leading to distinct structural and functional changes, which have been characterized by using Fourier&#8208;Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X&#8208;ray Diffraction (XRD), and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM), suggesting various supramolecular interactions including &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions are responsible for stable hydrogelations. The rheological study evaluates the hydrogel's mechanical and thixotropic properties and spectroscopic techniques, including UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy, to monitor structural transition. This novel class of amino acid&#8208;based hydrogel shows antibacterial activity against both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, likely through membrane&#8208;disruptive mechanisms, and also shows promising antioxidant properties. The native hF hydrogel is biocompatible and shows anticancer activity toward the pancreatic cancer cell line. The research finding bestows the biomedically relevant hydrogel's potential use in green and sustainable environmental remediation.

Interestingly, after 2 to 3 hours for shake gel and 5&#8211;6 hours for nonshake gel, the released waters have been tested and it has been found that these co-assembled hydrogels are capable of retaining almost all the contaminants within the shrink hydrogels matrix and releasing almost pure water along with the presence of hydrogel nanofibers. Syneresis is augmented to purify the contaminated water with dyes, mud, dissolved salts, and toxic heavy metal ions. These co-assembled hydrogels, leading to distinct structural and functional changes, which have been characterized by using Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), suggesting various supramolecular interactions including &#960;-&#960; stacking, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions are responsible for stable hydrogelations. The rheological study evaluates the hydrogel's mechanical and thixotropic properties and spectroscopic techniques, including UV-visible spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy, to monitor structural transition. This novel class of amino acid-based hydrogel shows antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, likely through membrane-disruptive mechanisms, and also shows promising antioxidant properties. The native &lt;b&gt;hF&lt;/b&gt; hydrogel is biocompatible and shows anticancer activity toward the pancreatic cancer cell line. The research finding bestows the biomedically relevant hydrogel's potential use in green and sustainable environmental remediation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Shear Conversion of Elemental Bismuth in Water Under Air to 2D Bismuth Oxycarbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Powdered elemental bismuth in water forms 2D bismuth oxycarbonate nanosheets under high shear in a rapidly rotating tube housed in a vortex fluidic device, without the need of surfactants or other excipients, with uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide.








Abstract
2D Bismuth oxycarbonate (2D BOC) nanosheets have a unique layered structure with many applications, including capture and reduction of carbon dioxide. Processing powdered elemental bismuth in water under ambient air conditions using a vortex fluidic device (VFD) results in the formation of 2D BOC without the need of surfactants or other excipients. The induced high shear mechanical energy in the form of micron/submicron topological typhoon like spinning top (ST) fluid flow drives the conversion, which we propose initially melts the metal particles which are spontaneously oxidised at the liquid&#8208;quartz tube interface to form 2D bismuth oxide (Bi2O3). Then it reacts with atmospheric CO2 to form 2D BOC. These sheets, &#8804; 15.7&#160;nm thick, are in the orthorhombic phase with a lattice spacing of 0.29&#160;nm, which is converted to Bi2O3 monoclinic phase as an exothermic process at 269 &#176;C.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aryl Iodides with Sulfinamide Reagents for the Construction of Sulfinamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sulfinamide reagent was developed that enables the one&#8208;step synthesis of sulfinamides through palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling with aryl iodides.








Abstract
A novel sulfinamide reagent was developed that enables the one&#8208;step installation of sulfinamides through palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling with aryl iodides. This method offers distinct advantages, including the use of readily available starting materials and broad substrate compatibility. Moreover, the strategy was successfully extended to the synthesis of complex functional molecules. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the key intermediate undergoes base&#8208;promoted retro&#8208;Michael addition to afford the target product.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Driven Orthogonal Ligand Pairings through Dual Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding/&#960;&#8208;&#960; Interaction Complementarity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bidentate ligands for square&#8208;planar Pd(II) complexes were developed, each with hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking domains that are complementary to only one other ligand. The bis&#8208;bidentate complexes form orthogonally to one another with high fidelity, but only when both interaction types are exploited in tandem.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;layered and orthogonal recognition is an excellent route to controlled molecular complexity. Here we report a series of heteroleptic complexes where two ligands pair together at a palladium(II) metal centre in complementary fashion and with orthogonality to others pairs. This complementarity is driven in part through hydrogen&#8208;bonding acceptor or donor sites proximal to the coordination domain (either DD:AA or AD:DA). These interactions alone are insufficient to control ligand pairing identity and/or orientation&#8212;secondary &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor aromatic groups in the recognition domain combine with the hydrogen bonding to give high levels of complementarity. Importantly, the different heteroleptic complexes can be combined without significant scrambling or mismatching.

         <title>Optimization of CEST MRI Reporter Protein Design Using Cation&#8208;Pi Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel engineering approach can produce reporter proteins for cell and viral therapy tracking with unique magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signatures, detectable with chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST). We discover how cation&#8208;&#960; interactions between amino acid groups can help us fine&#8208;tune magnetic resonance properties for noninvasive, sensitive, and specific detection of protein reporters.








Abstract
Nucleic acid&#8208;based therapeutics, such as oncolytic virotherapy or gene therapy, would benefit greatly from a reporter gene that induces endogenous production of a protein biomarker to noninvasively track the delivery, persistence, and spread with imaging. Several chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) reporter proteins detectable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been demonstrated to have high sensitivity. However, to date none can provide strong CEST contrast at a distinct resonance from that of endogenous proteins, limiting their specificity. We investigated proteins and peptides containing tyrosine (Tyr), tryptophan (Trp), and lysine (Lys) residues that demonstrate CEST contrast shifted far downfield (4&#8211;10&#160;ppm) from water. Although Tyr, Trp, and Lys exchangeable protons are typically not detectable under physiological conditions, those in our tested molecules are, having exchange rates of 400&#8211;2500 s&#8722;1. The large chemical shift dispersion and rapid exchange rates are attributed to unique hydrogen bonding and cation&#8208;&#960; network interactions. These discoveries set the stage for designing a stable reporter protein with high detection specificity and sensitivity that can facilitate the in vivo monitoring of viral and gene therapies using MRI.

         <title>LMCT&#8208;Driven Iron Photocatalysis: Mechanistic Insights and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
LMCT&#8208;driven iron photocatalysis: This review discusses recent developments in ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;driven iron photocatalysis, emphasizing mechanistic insights and diverse synthetic applications. By classifying Fe(III)&#8211;L bond homolysis pathways, it highlights iron's potential as a sustainable alternative to precious metals for radical&#8208;mediated reactions under mild conditions.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based photocatalysis has emerged as a sustainable and versatile platform for facilitating a wide range of chemical transformations, offering an appealing alternative to precious metal photocatalysts. Among the various activation modes, ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT)&#8208;driven homolysis of Fe(III)&#8211;L(ligand) bonds has garnered considerable attention due to its ability to generate reactive radical species under mild conditions, without requiring the matching of substrates&#8217; redox potentials. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of recent developments in LMCT&#8208;driven iron photocatalysis, with a particular focus on both mechanistic insights and synthetic applications published in the last five years. We classify Fe(III)&#8211;L homolysis into four major categories based on the nature of the coordinated ligand: halides, carboxylates, alkoxides, and azide. For a few cases, mechanistic understanding derived from spectroscopic studies, computational modeling, and kinetic investigations is discussed in more detail. We further highlight the expanding repertoire of synthetic transformations enabled by LMCT&#8208;driven iron photocatalysis, including C&#9472;H functionalization, alkene functionalization, cross&#8208;coupling, oxidation, and radical&#8208;mediated bond formation. Finally, we provide future perspectives on the continued development of LMCT&#8208;based iron photocatalysis as a broadly applicable platform for sustainable organic synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;LMCT-driven iron photocatalysis: This review discusses recent developments in ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT)-driven iron photocatalysis, emphasizing mechanistic insights and diverse synthetic applications. By classifying Fe(III)&#8211;L bond homolysis pathways, it highlights iron's potential as a sustainable alternative to precious metals for radical-mediated reactions under mild conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron-based photocatalysis has emerged as a sustainable and versatile platform for facilitating a wide range of chemical transformations, offering an appealing alternative to precious metal photocatalysts. Among the various activation modes, ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT)-driven homolysis of Fe(III)&#8211;L(ligand) bonds has garnered considerable attention due to its ability to generate reactive radical species under mild conditions, without requiring the matching of substrates&#8217; redox potentials. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of recent developments in LMCT-driven iron photocatalysis, with a particular focus on both mechanistic insights and synthetic applications published in the last five years. We classify Fe(III)&#8211;L homolysis into four major categories based on the nature of the coordinated ligand: halides, carboxylates, alkoxides, and azide. For a few cases, mechanistic understanding derived from spectroscopic studies, computational modeling, and kinetic investigations is discussed in more detail. We further highlight the expanding repertoire of synthetic transformations enabled by LMCT-driven iron photocatalysis, including C&#9472;H functionalization, alkene functionalization, cross-coupling, oxidation, and radical-mediated bond formation. Finally, we provide future perspectives on the continued development of LMCT-based iron photocatalysis as a broadly applicable platform for sustainable organic synthesis. This review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers interested in leveraging the full potential of LMCT-mediated iron photocatalysis in modern organic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This study reports the first Ru&#8208;catalyzed ATH of &#945;&#8208;iminophosphonates, enabling the efficient synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates. Both acyclic and cyclic substrates are converted in high yields (up to 97%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to&#160;&gt;99:1), offering a practical alternative to conventional AH for accessing phosphorus&#8208;containing chiral amines.








Abstract
A novel Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) strategy has been developed for the efficient synthesis of valuable chiral &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates from readily available &#945;&#8208;iminophosphonates. This method enables the conversion of both acyclic and cyclic substrates in high yields (up to 97%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to&#160;&gt;99:1), providing a practical entry to phosphorus&#8208;containing chiral amines. Notably, this is the first reported application of ATH to &#945;&#8208;iminophosphonates, offering a robust and operationally convenient alternative to conventional asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) approaches.

         <title>Advancement in Boron&#8208;Embedded Amino Acids: Enhancing Boron Neutron Capture Therapy for Improved Cancer Treatment Efficacy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

We discussed here the synthesis and developments for BNCT reagents i.e amino acids containing Boron. Furthermore, this review discusses the applications of boronated amino acids in treating different cancer cells.








Abstract
One of the most difficult issues facing humanity today is the treatment of cancer. A binary cancer treatment called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) works especially well for high&#8208;grade gliomas and metastatic brain malignancies. Due to their preferential absorption by developing tumor cells, boronated amino acids have drawn a lot of attention among the several boron&#8208;containing compounds utilized as BNCT agents. In the first section of this review, the fundamental ideas of BNCT are briefly presented. In the remaining sections, we present a thorough analysis and synthesis of several boronated amino acids using distinct techniques. This article summarizes the therapeutic prospects of boron delivery agents and offers a critical analysis of them from the perspectives of nuclear medicine doctors and medicinal chemists.

         <title>Cyclization Enhances Luminescence Efficiency of a Fluorescent Probe for Amyloid&#8208;&#946; in Alzheimer's Disease</title>

Molecular cyclization strategy for improving the luminescent performances of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; probes









Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) deposition, imposing significant social and economic burdens globally. Despite extensive efforts have been devoted to developing fluorescent probes for A&#946; imaging, further improving the luminescent efficiency of prevailing probes still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we investigated the inner mechanism of constructing high&#8211;efficient A&#946; probes via a structural cyclization strategy. Based on a typical donor&#8208;acceptor A&#946; probe (Pro1), three cyclized derivatives (Pro2&#8208;Pro4) are designed by incorporating dimethylene, trimethylene, and ethyleneoxy groups into the &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridge. It is found that all compounds exhibit high specificity at various binding sites within the A&#946; fibril, while Pro4 features preferable hydrogen bond interaction with the fibril. Notably, a significant enhanced fluorescence quantum efficiency is demonstrated in the ethyleneoxy&#8208;contained counterpart, primarily due to the decreased nonradiative decay arising from the reduced nonadiabatic electronic coupling, electron&#8208;vibration coupling, and vibrational modes mixing. Consequently, the newly designed compound Pro4 achieves both red&#8208;shifted emission and optimal luminescent efficiency, making it a promising candidate for A&#946; imaging. These findings highlight the feasibility of structural cyclization as an effective approach to improve luminescent efficiency in A&#946;&#8208;targeted probes, contributing to the development of fluorescent imaging techniques for early AD diagnosis.

         <title>Direct and Indirect Effects of Fe&#8208;Incorporation in Nickel(oxy)hydroxide Materials for the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction &#8208; Employing Constant pH/U Models for Deeper Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the effect of iron incorporation in nickel oxide electrocatalysts for water oxidation is analyzed using electronic structure methods with implicit solvation and constant pH/potential methods. The location and amount of iron influences not only the involved deprotonation and oxidation processes but also the mechanism and nature of species in the O&#8211;O coupling reaction.








Abstract
In this study, we seek to deepen the understanding of the Fe effect in Ni&#8208;oxyhydroxide&#8208;mediated oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis in alkaline conditions, where extremely small amounts of Fe can have a dramatic impact on catalytic performance. For this purpose, Density Functional Theory (DFT) electronic structure calculations with implicit solvation description is employed in a constant pH/potential simulation framework. Nanoparticle models are considered for the nickel&#8208;based oxyhydroxide material with different degrees of Fe incorporation, and the pH/U&#8208;dependent interface structure is studied. It can be seen that Fe incorporation influences the total extent of oxidation and deprotonation, stabilizing oxo species at early states of the reaction even at lower potentials.&#160;
From the resting state models, we derive reaction energy profiles and O&#8208;O coupling barriers for three different OER mechanisms: water nucleophilic attack (WNA), intramolecular coupling (IMC), and the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). Each species is derived taking into account explicit change in protonation state and charge as a function of pH and potential. The results suggest direct and indirect modifications in Ni&#8208;oxyhydroxide reactivity and in the preferred OER pathway, which changes with Ni/Fe ratio. The results we present imply that synergy between Ni and Fe acid&#8208;base and redox properties is essential for efficient water oxidation/deprotonation and O&#8208;O bond&#160;formation.

         <title>Glycosyl Radical&#8208;Based, 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;Selective Synthesis of C&#8208;Aryl Glycosides from Glycals Enabled by Photoredox PCET/Nickel&#8208;Dual Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a glycosyl radical&#8208;based, 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;selective synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;sugars (DASs) from glycals via photoredox PCET/Ni dual catalysis. Mechanistic studies indicate that glycosyl radical formation involves the generation of an N&#8208;radical through a PCET process, followed by its addition to the glycal. This protocol features: a) the use of an inexpensive organic photosensitizer and readily available glycals and aryl bromides; b) good functional group tolerance for both aryl bromides and glycal substrates; c) excellent diastereoselectivity, with exclusive formation of the 1,2&#8208;trans C&#8208;glycosides in all cases. Furthermore, the reaction could be conducted on gram&#8208;scale and is suitable for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecule.

&lt;p&gt;We report a glycosyl radical-based, 1,2-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-selective synthesis of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-aryl glycosides of 2-deoxy-2-amino-sugars (DASs) from glycals via photoredox PCET/Ni dual catalysis. Mechanistic studies indicate that glycosyl radical formation involves the generation of an N-radical through a PCET process, followed by its addition to the glycal. This protocol features: a) the use of an inexpensive organic photosensitizer and readily available glycals and aryl bromides; b) good functional group tolerance for both aryl bromides and glycal substrates; c) excellent diastereoselectivity, with exclusive formation of the 1,2-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; C-glycosides in all cases. Furthermore, the reaction could be conducted on gram-scale and is suitable for the late-stage modification of complex molecule.

Fe3+&#160;and H+&#160;triggered the ring opening of the spirolactam in Rhodamine moiety and &#8220;Turn&#8208;on&#8221; lysosomal&#8208;targeted fluorescence probe. It can be used for Fe3+&#160;detection, the response of the pH microenvironment in lysosomes, and monitoring intragastric acidity.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term visualization of intracellular Fe3+ dynamics and lysosomal activity is crucial for investigating the physiological roles and functions of lysosomes during the growth of organisms. The lysosome&#8208;targeted fluorescent probe (RBH&#8208;EdC), derived from rhodamine&#8208;nucleoside conjugates, demonstrates a sophisticated dual&#8208;activation design: one is Fe3&#8314; response, triggering spirolactam ring&#8208;opening to form xanthine structures, resulting in&#160;&#8805;&#160;1000&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with visible colorimetric transition (colorless&#8594;pink). Another is pH sensitivity, demonstrating protonation&#8208;dependent fluorescence amplification at the dC at site N3 (pKa&#160;=&#160;2.9), achieving a 30&#8208;fold intensity increase at pH 2.5 within the 1.0&#8211;5.0 range. Remarkably, the RBH&#8208;EdC/Fe3&#8314; complex showed a further significant 20&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at pH 3.0. This Fe3&#8314;/H&#8314; co&#8208;activated &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; system provides exceptional signal amplification for both in vitro and in vivo applications, enabling precise exploration of lysosome&#8208;related biological processes, including the response of the pH microenvironment, real&#8208;time monitoring of lysosomal pH dynamics, in situ measurement of gastric acidity levels, and potential application in gastric ulcer diagnostics.

         <title>Regioselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Asymmetric Cyclic Dimers for Polyester&#8208;Based Alternating Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights advances in regioselective ROP of asymmetric cyclic di(thio)esters and cyclic(ester&#8208;amide)s for synthesizing polyester&#8208;based alternating copolymers. It covers catalyst optimization, mechanistic insights, regioselectivity quantification, and structure&#8208;property relationships of alternating copolymers. The challenges and future directions toward chemical circularity are also discussed.








Abstract
Sequence&#8208;controlled polyester&#8208;based alternating copolymers have attracted significant interest due to their biocompatibility, biodegradability, closed&#8208;loop recyclability, and hydrolytic degradability, offering broad potential in biomedical and sustainable materials. Among the available strategies, regioselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of asymmetric cyclic di(thio)esters and cyclic(ester&#8208;amide)s has emerged as a promising approach for constructing alternating copolymers with precise sequence&#8208; and stereo&#8208;control, structural diversity, and tunable properties. This review classifies asymmetric cyclic monomers into two categories: (1) monomers with two aliphatic ester bonds, where regioselectivity is mainly dictated by steric differences and typically requires tailored metal catalysts; and (2) monomers with chemically distinct reactive sites (e.g., phenolic ester, thioester, or amide vs. aliphatic ester), which enable near&#8208;perfect regioselectivity using simple catalysts. Recent progress in the synthesis of alternating aliphatic copolyesters, poly(phenolic&#8208;alt&#8208;aliphatic ester)s, poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;thioester)s, and poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;amide)s is highlighted, emphasizing their enhanced degradability, recyclability, and mechanical performance. Key advances in catalyst optimization, mechanistic understanding, quantification of regioselectivity, and the structure&#8208;property relationships of alternating copolymers are summarized. Finally, future directions are discussed, including rational catalyst design, expansion to new monomer architectures, and the systematic evaluation of how regioselectivity governs alternating copolymer properties.

Abstract
The coordination chemistry of the planar, doubly &#960;&#8208;extended bipyridine analog, 6,6&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;biphenanthridine (p&#8208;biphe), is presented. The phenanthridine units in p&#8208;biphe are fused together at the 6&#8208; and 7&#8208; positions, and the resulting rigid ligand is compared with the more flexible parent &#8220;biphe&#8221; fused only at the 6&#8208;positions. p&#8208;Biphe is intensely fluorescent in solution with a much higher quantum yield, but, unlike biphe, at 77&#160;K the fluorescence is not accompanied by any significant phosphorescence. Two four&#8208;coordinate Cu(I) complexes and pseudo&#8208;octahedral Ru(II) and Ir(III) complexes are described: [Cu(p&#8208;biphe)2]+, [(P^P)Cu(p&#8208;biphe)]+, [Ru(bpy)2(p&#8208;biphe)]2+, and [Ir(ppy)2(p&#8208;biphe)]+, isolated as PF6 salts (P^P&#160; = &#160;4,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene; bpy&#160;=&#160;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; ppy&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;phenylpyridine). The complexes are strongly coloured due to intense low&#8208;energy absorption to charge&#8208;transfer excited states based on TDDFT calculations. The acceptor nature of the p&#8208;biphe ligand is clear from multiple reduction events observed electrochemically. The Ir(III) complex displays remarkably low&#8208;energy phosphorescence (&#955;max = 812&#160;nm) in solution at room temperature with a vibrational progression evident extending into the near IR, with no contamination from visible light emission. While the heteroleptic Cu(I) complex is phosphorescent at 77&#160;K, no emission is detectable from [Cu(p&#8208;biphe)2]+ or [Ru(bpy)2(p&#8208;biphe)]2+, likely due to competitive nonradiative decay.

         <title>Coronene Bisimide as a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coronene bisimide (CBI) with its efficient intersystem crossing&#160;was used as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing photosensitizer. Different reactions, including cycloadditions and oxidations, were demonstrated via triplet&#8208;energy transfer from CBI.








Abstract
Photosensitization has emerged as a versatile tool to facilitate access to excited states under mild conditions, allowing for efficient and selective photochemical transformations. Herein, we report a very simple molecule, coronene bisimide (CBI), as a potent visible&#8208;light photosensitizer featuring a high extinction coefficient with a broadband absorption spanning from ultraviolet to green region of the visible spectrum, along with a long&#8208;lived triplet state generated via efficient intersystem crossing (ISC). Utilizing the triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTEnT) strategy, CBI catalyzes diverse reactions under green light irradiation. Through this, we propose CBIs as a new class of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free visible&#8208;light sensitizers overcoming the limitations of conventional sensitizers, such as low extinction coefficient in the visible regime, short triplet&#8208;state lifetimes, and high toxicity, by relying on heavy atoms.

&lt;p&gt;Coronene bisimide (CBI) with its efficient intersystem crossing&#160;was used as a visible-light-absorbing photosensitizer. Different reactions, including cycloadditions and oxidations, were demonstrated via triplet-energy transfer from CBI.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photosensitization has emerged as a versatile tool to facilitate access to excited states under mild conditions, allowing for efficient and selective photochemical transformations. Herein, we report a very simple molecule, coronene bisimide (CBI), as a potent visible-light photosensitizer featuring a high extinction coefficient with a broadband absorption spanning from ultraviolet to green region of the visible spectrum, along with a long-lived triplet state generated via efficient intersystem crossing (ISC). Utilizing the triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTEnT) strategy, CBI catalyzes diverse reactions under green light irradiation. Through this, we propose CBIs as a new class of heavy-atom-free visible-light sensitizers overcoming the limitations of conventional sensitizers, such as low extinction coefficient in the visible regime, short triplet-state lifetimes, and high toxicity, by relying on heavy atoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Polyoxometalate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrative data&#8208;driven approach leveraging AI, computations, and robotic experimentation enables accelerated discovery of polyoxometalates, bridging synthetic unpredictability and paving the way for rational, predictive, and functional cluster chemistry.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are nanoscale, structurally versatile metal&#8211;oxo clusters with emerging applications in sustainability, energy, nanoelectronics, and life science technologies. Owing to their structural complexity, some all&#8208;inorganic POMs are often perceived as serendipitous outcomes from self&#8208;assembly processes, which poses challenges for scalable rational design. From this perspective, we therefore examine how the development of POM informatics and, more generally, data&#8208;driven POM exploration can pave the way for the molecular engineering of new POM&#8208;based materials targeting customized applications. In the process, we highlight recent successes in the digitalization of POM chemistry and outline which advanced technologies are necessary for progress in this promising area of&#160;research.

         <title>A Phosphorus(V)&#8208;Centered Porphyrin Having Redox&#8208; and Air&#8208;Stable Axial P&#8211;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus&#8208;centered porphyrins are important functional dyes. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a phosphorus(V) porphyrin complex with hydrogen atoms as axial ligands (1+&#183;PF6&#8211;). 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; is air&#8208;stable. Cyclic voltammetry of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; exhibits two reversible waves, which indicates sequential redox couples among cationic, neutral open&#8208;shell, and anionic species.








Abstract
Phosphorus(V)&#8208;centered porphyrins (P(V)&#8208;porphyrins) are an important class of functional dyes in many fields of research, and axial ligands on the phosphorus atom affect the electronic properties of P(V)&#8208;porphyrins and add functions. Herein, we report on the synthesis and characterization of a hitherto unknown P(V)&#8208;porphyrin having hydrogen atoms as axial ligands (1+&#183;PF6&#8211;, PF6&#8211; is a counter anion). Synthesis of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; was achieved by treatment of dichloro&#8208;derivative (2+&#183;Cl&#8211;) with LiAlH4 followed by AgPF6 via hydride reduction accompanied by one&#8208;electron reduction and one&#8208;electron oxidation. The porphyrin core of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; is nonplanar but considerably ruffled. The cyclic voltammogram of 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; exhibits two reversible waves, which indicates redox couples among 1+, neutral radical 1&#8226;, and 1&#8211;. Compound 1+&#183;PF6&#8211; is tolerant toward air despite its PH2 moiety due to the energetically low&#8208;lying HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and &#963;(P&#8211;H) orbitals.

         <title>Target&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Assembly of Peptides with Silver Nanoparticles for Electrochemical Biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have designed and fabricated an electrochemical biosensor based on target&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly of peptides with silver nanoparticles. The results demonstrate that the biosensor exhibits high stability and specificity, with a detection limit of 0.42 fM. Moreover, the biosensor design is readily adaptable for detecting other biomarkers by simply modifying the cleavage sequence of one peptide.








Abstract
Peptides have great potential in the design and fabrication of biosensors because of their high specificity, multifunctionality, and relatively low cost. In this paper, we report an electrochemical biosensor leveraging multifunctional peptides and silver nanoparticles for integrated target recognition, self&#8208;assembly, and signal output. As a proof of concept, we chose granzyme B (GrB) as a model target. Specifically, when the target is present, the recognition peptide is cleaved, and the assembly peptide then anchors, exposing a positively charged sequence that attracts silver nanoparticles, thereby generating an electrochemical signal. The biosensor exhibits favorable analytical performance, with a linear detection range of 1 to 10000 fM and a remarkably low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.42 fM. Moreover, the biosensor has been successfully applied to the analysis of clinical samples, confirming its potential for clinical detection and application.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Olefins from Internal Alkynes via Three&#8208;Component Reaction Using a Heterogeneous Organometallic Triptycene&#8208;Based Porous Palladium Catalyst</title>

Abstract
In this work, we report the design, synthesis, and application of a hyper&#8208;crosslinked heterogeneous organometallic porous organic polymer (Pd@TP&#8208;DPPF) catalyst for the efficient and sustainable dicarbofunctionalization of internal alkynes via a facile three&#8208;component reaction. This strategy enables the highly trans&#8208;selective syntheses of tetrasubstituted olefins in excellent yields. The catalyst is constructed by integrating triptycene (TP) and 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (DPPF) into a robust palladium&#8208;based porous framework, resulting in a unique heterogeneous system that efficiently mediates the coupling of internal alkynes with readily available iodoarenes and aryl/methyl boronic acids. This methodology also offers a versatile strategy for the syntheses of complex and valuable trans&#8208;selective alkenylsilanes under mild conditions, with high atom economy. Mechanistic studies support a trans&#8208;selective transformation pathway facilitated by the cooperative role of the polymer support and the palladium center. Importantly, the Pd@TP&#8208;DPPF catalyst exhibits excellent recyclability, air/moisture stability, and operational simplicity, making it highly suitable for large&#8208;scale and environmentally conscious synthetic applications. This work not only addresses a long&#8208;standing challenge in the synthesis of highly substituted olefins but also exemplifies the principles of green chemistry through catalyst reusability, waste minimization, and efficient multicomponent transformation.

HydroTherm&#8208;Flow Smart Window (HTF Window): A Pioneering Integration of Thermochromic Hydrogels and Fe&#8208;Cr Redox Flow Batteries for Sustainable Building Energy Management. This study presents the HTF Window, the first&#8208;ever integration of thermochromic hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogels with Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries. It delivers three key functions: dynamic dual&#8208;band solar modulation covering visible and near&#8208;infrared ranges, high&#8208;efficiency energy storage, and adaptive thermal regulation&#8212;addressing inefficiencies in traditional building windows and standalone energy storage systems. The HTF Window has a four&#8208;layer structure. The outermost layer is indium tin oxide coated glass that acts as a transparent heater. Next is a hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogel layer enabling ultrafast optical switching, with visible transmittance dropping from 30% to less than 2% in 5 seconds. The middle layer is a microfluidic electrolyte channel that handles energy storage and forms a thermal coupling system. The innermost layer is glass for sealing and mechanical support. This design cuts the spatial footprint of Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries by 66%. Performance tests show the HTF Window reaches 77% energy efficiency, 13% higher than conventional Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries. It also boosts ionic conductivity by 30% via hydrogel ion highways, lowers the solar heat gain coefficient by 40%, and reduces annual heating, ventilation, and air conditioning energy consumption by 25%. Molecular dynamics simulations uncover that chloride ion networks and encapsulation structures in the hydrogel&#8208;electrolyte interface enhance battery discharge capacity. Cost and environmental analysis reveals the HTF Window has 30% lower capital expenditure and reduces 20&#8208;year carbon emissions by 42% compared to conventional systems combining separate windows and standalone Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries. With a projected lifespan of over 20 years, it serves as a scalable solution for net&#8208;zero buildings, linking sustainable infrastructure to global decarbonization goals.








Abstract
This study introduces the HydroTherm&#8208;Flow Smart Window (HTF Window), the first groundbreaking integration of thermochromic windows and Fe&#8208;Cr redox flow batteries (Fe&#8208;Cr RFBs), achieving dual functionalities of dynamic solar modulation&#8212;via dual&#8208;band (visible&#160;+&#160;near&#8208;infrared, NIR) modulation&#8212;and high&#8208;efficiency energy storage in a single component. Leveraging tunable hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) hydrogels, it enables ultrafast optical switching and autonomous nighttime opacity, overcoming the slow response and privacy limitations of conventional thermochromic systems. By repurposing the window as a compact electrolyte reservoir, it reduces the RFB spatial footprint while enhancing ionic conductivity by 30% via hydrogel &#8220;ion highways,&#8221; achieving 77% energy efficiency with a 40% reduction in the solar heat gain coefficient. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal interactions between hydrogels and electrolytes, where chloride ion networks and encapsulation structures enhance battery discharge capacity. Addressing intermittent renewable energy grids and global carbon neutrality goals, the HTF Window stores surplus solar/wind energy to balance building&#8208;grid demand, reduces annual heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption by 25% across climates, and stabilizes electrolyte temperature via waste heat recovery to minimize thermal loads. With a projected 20&#160;+&#160;year lifespan, it offers a scalable, universal solution for net&#8208;zero buildings, bridging sustainable infrastructure and global decarbonization imperatives.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On Copper(II)&#8208;Probe for Nitric Oxide Detection: A Reductive Nitrosylation Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing a Cu(II)&#8208;probe for selective NO detection via a pH&#8208;responsive reductive nitrosylation approach showing fluorescence turn&#8208;on via displacement of nitrosylated ligand and reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), and a detection limit of 1&#160;nM.








Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the crucial biological signaling molecules, yet achieving its selective and spatiotemporal detection in in&#8208;situ/invitro or biological systems at specific pH remains a significant challenge. Hence, a probe capable of directly detecting NO would be immensely valuable in understanding its reactivity and biological functions. Here, to develop a Cu(II)&#8208;based probe for selective NO detection, we synthesized a Cu(II)&#8208;complex (1) using a N3&#8208;tridentate ligand having a pendant dansyl fluorophore (L1) and evaluated it's NO reactivity under varying pH conditions. The binding of Cu(II) ion with ligand L1 to prepare 1 showed&#160;&gt;&#160;96% fluorescence quenching (fluorescence turn&#8208;off) compared to highly fluorescent free L1 (&#934; = 59%). Complex 1 did not react with NO in neutral or acidic medium; however, in the presence of onefold base (pH&#160;&#8805;&#160;9), it showed the reductive nitrosylation reaction, which resulted in the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and ligand nitrosylation (L1&#8208;NO) with fluorescence turn&#8208;on. Studies performed using different reactive nitrogen /or oxygen species (RNS/ROS) suggest that probe 1 is highly selective toward NO with a detection limit of 1&#160;nM. For the first time, the base&#8208;catalyzed reductive nitrosylation of a Cu(II) complex resulted in the selective NO detection via fluorescence turn&#8208;on at pH&#160;&#8805;&#160;9 in methanol /or aqueous buffer medium. To understand the effect of secondary amine (&#9472;NH&#9472;) sites in the above reductive nitrosylation reaction, a Cu(II) complex (2) of the ligand (L2), having two different (&#9472;NH&#160;sites, was reacted with NO under various pH conditions. Surprisingly, 2 showed selective mono&#8208;N&#8208;nitrosylation of the amine site coordinated to Cu(II) ion with the reduction of Cu(II) in the presence of onefold OH&#8722;.

         <title>Ester&#8208;Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;Ketene Acetals with Solid&#8208;State Luminescence: AIEgens from Sequential Three&#8208;Component Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difference in nucleophilicity of alcohols and S,N&#8208;ketene acetals sets the stage for the desymmetrizing acylation of diaroyl chlorides in a consecutive one&#8208;pot fashion in good yields. The ester&#8208;functionalized aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals are solid&#8208;state emitters that emit in solution only upon aggregation. Upon encapsulation in polystyrene nanoparticles, the fluorescence quantum yield enhances significantly.








Abstract
Di(hetero)aroyl dichlorides are desymmetrized upon sequential reaction with alcohols and 2&#8208;methyl N&#8208;benzyl thiazolium salts within the course of a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction yielding ester&#8208;substituted aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals under mild conditions in good yields. A prerequisite for the concise one&#8208;pot process is the different nucleophilicity of the alcohols and in situ generated S,N&#8208;ketene acetals. The resulting compounds are merocyanines with dominant charge&#8208;transfer absorption bands which are fluorescent in the solid state, but not in solution. In water/ethanol solvent mixtures of increasing water content, the water&#8208;insoluble dyes display typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. The water fraction inducing AIE as well as the emission color, and fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;f) of the aggregated dyes can be controlled by the alcohol part of the ester moiety. Encapsulation into polystyrene nanoparticles can lead to a considerable increase of the fluorescence quantum yield &#934;f to 30% as shown for a representatively chosen dye revealing the highest &#934;f of 11% within the dye series in the water/ethanol mixtures and enabling the usage of these dyes as fluorescent reporters in aqueous environments.

4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NMI) as new fluorescence&#8208;responsive tool for HO&#8226; detection. Proof of concept illustrating that NMI selectively probes HO&#8226; produced by Cu&#8208;bound to A&#946;16 in presence of scavengers with an amplified response.








Abstract
Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in several diseases. Copper can be an efficient catalysts for ROS generation, as it was suggested for Cu bound to aberrant sites. Determination of rates and type of ROS production in more complex biological media is challenging and often only down&#8208;stream events can be monitored. Here, a selective detection of the hydroxyl radical (HO&#8226;), by a demethylation of 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide (NMI) fluorescence probe by HO&#8226; resulting in &#8764;25&#8208;fold increase in quantum yield is reported. To investigate potential applications, the NMI was coupled to the Cu&#8208;binding domain of amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;16). This allowed the in situ fluorescence detection of HO&#8226; produced by A&#946;16 bound Cu due to the Fenton&#8208;type reaction. In a more complex medium with scavengers present including in cell culture conditions, the HO&#8226; produced in the bulk was not detected, in line with the short life&#8208;time of HO&#8226; in the presence of other molecules. Thus, this is a proof of concept to show that NMI reaction&#8208;based HO&#8226; detection could be a useful and a versatile tool to investigate in situ the role of HO&#8226; in a defined location such as Cu bound to A&#946;16 in biologically relevant complex systems

Thus, this is a proof of concept to show that NMI reaction-based HO&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&lt;/sup&gt; detection could be a useful and a versatile tool to investigate in situ the role of HO&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&lt;/sup&gt; in a defined location such as Cu bound to A&#946;16 in biologically relevant complex systems&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of Cationic Silyl Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a family of selanyl&#8208;stabilized silyl cations is reported. Variations of the scaffold, the substituents at the silicon and the selenium atoms allow to adjust their Lewis acidity over a wide range. The Lewis acidity is quantified by the FBN method.








Abstract
The synthesis of a series of selanyl&#8208;stabilized cationic silyl Lewis acids with naphthalene or acenaphthalene scaffolds is described. The influence of scaffold modifications, substitution variations at the selanyl donor and at the silicon atom on the strengths of the silyl Lewis acid is evaluated using the p&#8208;fluorobenzonitrile (FBN) method. These simple variations of the principal structure allow to adjust the Lewis acidity of the cationic silyl Lewis acids from weak ones to examples that are significantly stronger than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (BCF). The solid&#8208;state structure of the cationic FBN complex [11(FBN)]+ with an acenaphthene backbone and a pentafluorophenylselanyl donor provides evidence for the penta&#8208;coordination of the silicon atom in this complex, in agreement with the results of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies in solution. Finally, this study suggests that the FBN method is well suited to assess even very subtle differences in the strength of Lewis acids.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrite at a Copper(II) Trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;ONO Complex via Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer and Oxygen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the synthesis of a copper(II) nitrite complex which possesses unusual trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O binding mode in trigonal bipyramidal geometry, and characterization through various physicochemical methods. The reduction of NO2&#8722; to release NO&#8226; was examined through PCET and OAT by using ferrocene and PPh3, respectively. DFT calculations revealed that the isomerization of trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O to &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is the key step for the OAT. The superiority of &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode in the OAT was further rationalized by molecular orbital analysis.








Abstract
Reduction of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) to nitric oxide (NO) serves important roles in NO&#8208;dependent signaling as well as in the broad nitrogen biogeochemical cycle. In biological system, copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductases (CuNiRs) are well known to bind a nitrite anion to mediate the nitrite reduction to release NO, of which the mechanism still requires further understanding. Herein, synthetic copper(II) nitrite complex with a rare binding mode, [CuII(iPr3&#8208;tren)(trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;ONO)]+ (2), is characterized physicochemically and examined in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to release NO. For the first time to gain mechanistic insights into the trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O binding copper(II) nitrite complex, detailed kinetic studies in company with theoretical calculations have been performed for oxidation of triphenylphosphine (PPh3), which shows that isomerization of trans&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;O to &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is necessary to exert electrophilic OAT. The better reactivity of &#954;1&#8208;N binding mode is attributed to a fine orbital mixing of Cu&#8208;dz2 with highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of NO2&#8722;, thereby imposing much larger electron density on NO2&#8722; moiety. Thus, it is suggested that the reactivity of the copper(II) nitrite complex is conjunctly related to the binding mode of nitrite.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Assisted Controlled Radical Polymerization of Acrylates by Strategically Designed RuII&#8208;FeII Heterobimetallic Conjugate</title>

Cooperativity wins: Judiciously designed heterobimetallic conjugates of Ru(II) and Fe(II) metal centers have shown remarkable redox cooperativity to achieve living and well&#8208;defined acrylate polymers.








Abstract
Employing heterobimetallic complexes (HBCs) offers an exciting and powerful strategy for various catalytic applications. Here, we present an unorthodox synthetic route to synthesize a novel RuII&#8208;FeII heterobimetallic complex by implementing the strategy of &#8220;metalation with functionalization.&#8221; This complex utilizes a redox&#8208;assisted concerted strategy to facilitate the controlled radical polymerization (CRP) of acrylate monomers with significantly low catalyst loading. To understand the efficiency of the bimetallic catalyst over the other corresponding monometallic complexes, controlled polymerization experiments on acrylate monomers have been carried out. The redox cooperativity for efficient living CRP is very much pronounced and established in the RuII&#8208;FeII heterobimetallic dyad as evidenced by multiple orthogonal experimental results and the interesting rearrangement in the frontier molecular orbitals during catalysis steps. A plausible mechanistic pathway is proposed based on insights from electroparamagnetic resonance spectroscopy, cyclic voltametry, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, rigid potential energy scans (PES), and the Fukui function. A modified atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) mechanism is offered by RuII&#8208;FeII conjugate, where redox&#8208;cooperativity and intramolecular electron transfer (IET) between the metal centers play a crucial role. This study investigates the potential of redox cooperativity in heterobimetallic systems, highlighting their efficacy as adaptable catalytic platforms.

         <title>Expanding Chemistry of Expanded Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advances in the chemistry of expanded helicenes, defined as helicenes containing linearly fused benzene rings, as novel aromatic compounds. This review begins with a summary of their structural classification, followed by the synthesis, structures, properties, and chiroptical performance of expanded helicenes of various shapes, such as hexagons, triangles, and rhombuses.








Abstract
Expanded helicenes are interesting compounds created by modifying the original helicene structure through the incorporation of linearly fused benzene rings, enlarging the helical diameter. Motivated by Tilley et&#160;al.&#8217;s report of a key expanded helicene structure in 2017, several research groups have synthesized such nonplanar aromatic compounds, aiming to explore their impressive structures, properties, and chiroptical performance. This review highlights recent advances in the expanded helicene chemistry through experimental and theoretical studies. The shape and length of helical structures depend on the number and combination of angularly and linearly fused benzene rings. Helical structures are classified using notations, and specific compounds corresponding to each structural form, namely, hexagonal, triangular, rhombic, or others, are introduced herein. As an extension of the molecular design, examples of nonhexagonal and heteroaromatic ring&#8208;embedded expanded helicenes are presented. Specifically, this review focuses on how the diameters, lengths, and turn numbers of helical structures depend on dynamic processes involving helical inversion and chiroptical properties (circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)). The characteristics and perspectives of this molecular design are also discussed.

BODIPY&#8208;functionalized host molecules are effective visible&#8208;light photosensitizers for the conversion of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to ascaridole in the presence of molecular oxygen, providing up to a 28&#8208;fold increase in the rate of conversion depending on the host employed.








Abstract
BODIPY&#8208;functionalized host molecules have been used as effective visible&#8208;light photosensitizers in the conversion of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to ascaridole in the presence of molecular oxygen. Host&#8208;guest interactions enhance the effective local concentration of the substrate and singlet oxygen generated by the photosensitizing host. This results in up to a 28&#8208;fold increase in the rate of conversion depending on the host employed. A tetramethyl BODIPY analogue, in which guest access to the host cavity is blocked, was also employed to confirm that the cavities do indeed enhance substrate turnover. Whilst the latter photocatalyst is more efficient due to the suppression of nonradiative relaxation pathways associated with rotation of the meso&#8208;phenyl substituent, the rate enhancement induced by host&#8208;guest binding is not present. Combined, this provides insight for the future design of enhanced systems.

         <title>An Unusual Activity of Conformationally Restricted Naphthalene Peri&#8208;Dichalcogenides in the Reduction of Nitro and Azide Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the unique ability of a conformationally restricted dichalcogenide to reduce nitro and azide groups to their corresponding amines under physiological conditions. The redox potential is strongly influenced by the nature of chalcogen atom substitution as well as the conformational rigidity of the dichalcogenide bond.








Abstract
Rigid and conformationally restricted dichalcogenides based on 1,8&#8208;naphthyl system have attracted significant interest as electron donors in charge transfer complexes and organic electrode materials. Recently, naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;peri&#8208;diselenides have been shown to mimic the function of two major selenoenzymes&#160;&#8722;&#160;iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) &#8722; mainly through two&#8208;electron redox processes involving deiodination of thyroid hormones and thiol&#8208;mediated reduction of hydrogen peroxide, respectively. Herein, we report that naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;peri&#8208;dichalcogenides can mediate a six&#8208;electron reduction of organic nitro compounds to produce the corresponding primary amines at physiologically relevant temperature (37 &#176;C) using water as the solvent. The stepwise reduction process is highly dependent on the nature of the chalcogen atom present at the peri&#8208;positions of the naphthyl ring. While no reduction was observed with the disulfide, the selenenyl sulfide mediated a four&#8208;electron reduction of the nitro group to the corresponding hydroxylamine. The diselenide and ditelluride reduced the nitro groups all the way to amines through six&#8208;electron transfer. The diselenides also mediated the reduction of various aromatic azides to the corresponding primary amines.

         <title>New ESIPT&#8208;Dyes of Record Capacity to Fluorescence Detection of H&#8208;Bond Donor and Acceptor Molecules, Including Local Water Concentration</title>

Multi&#8208;color fluorescent labels for detecting local water concentration at a selected cite of lipid&#8208;protein, protein&#8208;protein or protein&#8208;DNA complexes.








Abstract
5&#8208;Substituted 3&#8208;hydroxychromones (3&#8208;HCs) are challenging to synthesize but are of significant interest as fluorescent labels. This is primarily due to the pronounced modulation of their fluorescence by surrounding molecules, a consequence of the 5&#8208;substituent's proximity to the negative pole of the molecular dipole. The newly synthesized derivatives of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;chromene&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid exhibit unique fluorescence behaviors. Their color of emission is highly sensitive to the solvation environment and is strongly influenced by the nature of the functional group introduced at position 5. Notably, the fluorescence of acid demonstrates inhibition of ESIPT (excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer) in both neutral and H&#8208;bond donor solvents, a phenomenon not previously observed in 3&#8208;HCs. Furthermore, investigated dye stands out as the first 3&#8208;HC compound whose fluorescence responds to the H&#8208;bond acceptor capacity of the environment, particularly in mildly acidic conditions (below pH 6). In contrast, methyl ester and glycine amide of key acid are responsive to the H&#8208;bond donor properties of their surroundings&#8212;a feature especially relevant in biological systems, where local water concentration plays a critical role. Thus, the derivatives such as N&#8208;terminal or lysine&#8208;labeled peptides incorporating these dyes can serve as valuable tools for investigating peptide&#8208;DNA, peptide&#8208;lipid, and other biomolecular interactions for the selected location of peptide.

         <title>A Bichromophoric Triazatruxene Tetrad as a Highly Tunable Multicolor Emitter and Its Application in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on a TAT tetrad, whose propargylic linkers electronically decouple the central TAT unit from the peripheral ones. This results in dual fluorescence and, at 77&#160;K, dual phosphorescence emission. The emission color varies with excitation wavelength from blue to yellowish white or orange.








Abstract
We report on the new star&#8208;shaped triazatruxene (TAT) tetrad 1, where three peripheral TAT moieties connect to a central TAT through propargylic spacers. The insulating nature of the linkers results in separate, partially overlapping blue and yellow&#8208;orange emissions from the peripheral and central TATs. This renders 1 a multicolor emitter, whose emission color can be tuned by the choice of the excitation wavelength and the solvent. In frozen solution, dual fluorescence emission from the two different types of TATs is complemented by dual phosphorescence with radiative lifetimes in the range of seconds. Organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) constructed with 1 as the emissive layer achieved a peak irradiance of 5.87 &#181;W/nm/m2 at 580&#160;nm at an operation voltage of 6.7&#160;V. Remarkably, the emission color of the electroluminescence can be varied from yellow over different hues of orange to red or&#160;even to near infrared (NIR) emission, depending on the applied voltage. Tetrad 1 is also redox&#8208;active, indicating that 1 may simultaneously serve as a hole conductor and emitter. Its oxidized forms are panchromatic absorbers from the near UV to the NIR due to intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;TAT charge&#8208;transfer (CT) absorptions.

         <title>A Strategic Advance from Pincer Complexes to Hexadentate&#8208;Co(III) Catalyst for Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperative Activation of Primary Alcohols to Access Highly Functionalized Pyrimidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we have developed a first cobalt(III) catalyst [Co(III)BPMAP&#8208;O]ClO4 supported by a hexadentate ligand system with a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative approach for sustainable multicomponent reaction to access a library of highly substituted pyrimidines (150 examples) using dehydrogenation of aromatic as well as inactive aliphatic primary alcohols.








Abstract
In this report, we present a sustainable, eco&#8208;friendly, practical, and cost&#8208;effective one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction for the synthesis of a diverse library of highly substituted pyrimidines from amidines, primary alcohols, and aromatic ketones, catalyzed by a cobalt(III) complex. The well&#8208;defined cobalt(III) complex [Co(III)BPMAP&#8208;O]ClO4 is derived from a redox&#8208;active phosphine&#8208;free, pentadentate mono&#8208;carboxamide ligand (BPMAP&#8208;H), and is formed in situ from various cobalt(II) sources, including CoCl2&#183;6H2O, CoBr2, Co(NO3)2&#183;6H2O, Co(OAc)2&#183;4H2O via oxygen activation. Using aromatic ketones and benzyl alcohols, a wide range of 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyrimidines (TriPym) and 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted pyrimidines (TetraPym) were synthesized (119 examples) in isolated yields of up to 93%. The catalytic system is also applicable to aliphatic ketones and aliphatic primary alcohols, affording 31 additional examples with yields of up to 92%. Control experiments and DFT calculations support a plausible mechanism involving dehydrogenation of the alcohols through a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative pathway.

Control experiments and DFT calculations support a plausible mechanism involving dehydrogenation of the alcohols through a metal-ligand cooperative pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical and Photoelectrochemical Transformations of Thioamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes efficient EC and iPEC methods for the transformation of thioamides. The EC approach is inexpensive, mild, and metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free. On the other hand, the interfacial iPEC method, due to the lower applied potential, proved to be beneficial in terms of broadening the scope and limitations and energy efficiency.








Abstract
Pursuing innovative and environmentally friendly synthetic strategies is always a desirable goal in organic synthesis, and thus, we have developed green and sustainable electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (iPEC) transformations of thioamides into amides. The established EC protocol is inexpensive, mild, and metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free. iPEC cells are extensively studied for solar energy conversion, but their application in synthesizing high&#8208;value organic molecules has been limited. Here, we describe a strategy to use BiVO4, an abundant and robust photoanode, for the desulfurization of thioamides. Under light irradiation, the photogenerated holes in BiVO4 oxidize thioamides to radical cations, which further react with the oxygen radical anion to produce amides. The proposed iPEC strategy presents a high promise for green organic chemical transformations with the goal of maximizing not only the atom economy but also the energy efficiency.

         <title>Acidity Controlled Formal Nucleophilic Substitution of Hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;based Iodonium Salt with O&#8208;nucleophiles: Synthetic Application and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method using hypervalent iodonium species derived from hydrofluoroolefin gas enables fast, mild, and efficient synthesis of fluoroalkyl ethers from phenols. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies show that phenol acidity influences the reaction pathway.








Abstract
The development and mechanistic investigation of a novel O&#8208;fluoroalkylation of phenol derivatives using a hypervalent fluoroalkyliodonium salt, derived from hydrofluoroolefin gas (HFO&#8208;1234yf) as bulk fluorous feedstock, is reported. Optimization of the reaction conditions enabled versatile and efficient synthetic applications, and the synthetic study revealed phenol acidity&#8208;dependent selectivity of the O&#8208;fluoroalkylation process. The mechanistic behavior of phenols was supported by both experimental studies and DFT calculations. As a result, we showed that more acidic phenols (pKa &lt; 5) undergo direct O&#8208;alkylation, while reactions of the fluoroalkyliodonium salt involving less acidic phenol substrates proceed via a base&#8208;assisted chloride elimination and substitution pathway. Deuterium&#8208;labeling and halide competition experiments further validated the proposed mechanism. This practical and scalable method provides access to structurally diverse fluoroalkyl ethers and holds significant potential for applications in medicinal and materials chemistry.

         <title>The Important Role of the Polarization Effect in Cationic Hypervalent Chalcogen Bonds Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations demonstrate that increasing the central atom size (Se/Te) and incorporating stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (&#8208;CF3, &#8208;F, &#8208;NO2) in cationic hypervalent ChB catalysts amplify the &#963;&#8208;hole, thereby strengthening ChB interactions. This polarization effect significantly lowers the bromine transfer barrier in the NBS bromolactonization reaction, enabling efficient and tunable organocatalysis.








Abstract
Chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysts have recently garnered considerable attention in the field of organocatalysis owing to their advantages of nontoxicity, environmental sustainability, extensive applicability, affordability, and remarkable reactivity. In this work, the Se&#8208; and Te&#8208;based cationic hypervalent ChB catalysis on the bromolactonization reaction of N&#8208;Bromosuccinimide (NBS) with 4&#8208;pentenoic acid is investigated by high&#8208;level density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The ChB&#8208;catalyzed bromolactonization reaction has an intricate process involving bromine transfer, cyclization, and proton transfer. Moreover, the bromine transfer process is identified as the rate&#8208;determining step with the highest Gibbs free energy barrier. The increase in the size of the central atom in the ChB catalysts and the enhancement of electron&#8208;withdrawing capabilities with greater dipole moments of substitutions on the catalysts provide larger &#963;&#8208;holes with stronger polarization effects, resulting in stronger ChB interactions with the reactant, thus lowering the reaction barrier. From a kinetic perspective, different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the catalyst can be used to regulate the reaction rate, leading to better experimental outcomes. These findings demonstrate the important roles of polarization effects in cationic hypervalent chalcogen bonds catalysis and provide a theoretical foundation for the development of novel environmentally friendly and efficient hypervalent ChB catalysts.

         <title>Speciation and Luminescence of a Binuclear Lanthanide Complex Bearing an Aminophenolate Chromophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide complexes are used in patients and for bioimaging and assays. The solution structure and speciation are critical when evaluating function, and here we fully unravel the structure and photophysics of a binuclear lanthanide complex.








Abstract
Lanthanide(III) complexes show diverse speciation in solution. Here, the photophysical properties and speciation in solution of binuclear lanthanide complexes bearing an aminophenolate chromophore that reversibly bind to both metal centers were determined. The aminophenolate can reversibly bind to both lanthanide ions in a pH dependent manner. Above pH 3 the phenolate moiety remains deprotonated and the lanthanide complexes exhibit very high kinetic stability, however, protonation of the amino group modulates the luminescence intensity without changing the luminescence lifetime of the lanthanide. Below pH 3, protonation of the phenol results in a flexible, open structure, leading to reversible demetallation of the lanthanide complex as the system comes under thermodynamic control. This study highlights the importance of a detailed understanding of both the speciation and pH responsive behavior of highly luminescent binuclear lanthanide complexes for their development as responsive probes. These results confirm the promise of phenolate derived binuclear complexes as highly luminescent responsive probes, modulated by changes in pH.

         <title>Systematic Mapping of Homoserine Lactone and Cyclodextrin Binding Strengths &#8212; Effects of Structural Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding of homoserine lactone (HSL) signaling molecules used by Gram&#8208;negative bacteria with native and substituted cyclodextrin (CD) host molecules was mapped. Between differently substituted HSLs with different alkyl chain lengths, chain length governed binding affinity. Between &#945;&#8208;CD and &#946;&#8208;CDs, the wider &#946;&#8208;CD cavity was found to be more tolerant of substitutions in terms of binding constant.








Abstract
Directing the collective behavior of bacteria is important for various applications in chemical bioproduction, water treatment, and antibiofilm solutions. A potential approach to such control mechanisms lies in sequestering signal molecules (autoinducers) by macrocyclic host molecules that lower the effective concentration of the former, modulating bacterial signaling. Cyclodextrins (CD) &#8212; one of the best&#8208;established families of hosts &#8212; have been shown to bind homoserine lactones (HSL) acting as autoinducers, but with a focus limited to shorter (&#8804; 8 carbons) tailed molecules and &#946;&#8208;CD. Here, we have systematically mapped binding affinities for HSLs of three different tail lengths and with different 3&#8208;site substituents (used for signal differentiation), with native and substituted &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;CDs. The HSL alkyl chain length has the most influence on affinity, although the 3&#8208;substitution also slightly affects the binding constant. Little difference between native CDs was observed, but the binding ability of &#945;&#8208;CD was more susceptible to even minute substitutions. The wider &#946;&#8208;CD core could be substituted with greater modularity without impairing HSL binding ability. The results constitute an initial chemical toolbox to be applied in guiding host design for HSL sequestering in, for example, therapeutic applications, but also in constructing systems for the modulation of bacterial collective behavior.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclobutenoates From Photochemical Rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;Diazo Cyclopropanes and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ring expansion of &#945;&#8208;cyclopropyl diazoacetates into cyclobutenoates upon irradiation at 425&#160;nm was reported in moderate to excellent yields (17% to 75%) and moderate to good regioisomeric ratio (55:45 to 82:18). The formation of two regioisomers was explained using DFT calculations as well as the involvement of a singlet state carbene.








Abstract
The ring expansion of &#945;&#8208;cyclopropyl diazoacetates into cyclobutenoates upon irradiation at 425&#160;nm was reported. This method allowed an access to a large array of cyclobutenoates as a mixture of regioisomers. The products were isolated in moderate to excellent yields (17% to 75%) and moderate to good regioisomeric ratio (55:45 to 82:18). The synthetic utility of the products was showcased and the mechanism was studied. Thanks to DFT calculations, the formation of two regioisomers was explained as well as the involvement of a singlet state carbene.

         <title>Small Molecular Dibenzochalcogenophenes as Potent Organic Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review compiles recent achievements and applications of purely organic small luminescent DBC. We present frequently employed functionalities and design strategies, accomplishing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). In addition, we discuss the challenges for luminescent selenium and tellurium derivatives as well as the influence of commercial impurities on the photophysical properties of this compound class.








Abstract
Dibenzochalcogenophenes (DBC) have attracted huge attention ever since the discovery that they are able to act as potent (phosphorescent) emitters more than 60 years ago. From then on, they were extensively used as versatile emissive platforms for applications in materials science and optoelectronics. In this review, we focus on the main achievements of the past 20 years, highlighting especially monomolecular small purely organic compounds with less than 10 aromatic units and only one chalcogenophene moiety. Besides this, we wish to focus on their emission properties and to evaluate general design principles to fine&#8208;tune photophysical properties.

         <title>Reusable Br&#248;nsted Acidic Ionic Liquid Catalyzed Reductive Alkylation of Quinolines to Functionalized Tetrahydroquinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
A Br&#248;nsted acidic ionic liquid (BAIL)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem reduction of quinoline to tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) followed by reductive alkylation by the aldehyde has been demonstrated under mild reaction conditions with a shorter reaction time. This step&#8208;economical synthetic approach is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates a wide range of reducible&#8208;sensitive functional groups. The current reductive N&#8208;alkylation approach was also successfully utilized to synthesize novel tricyclic oxazino&#8208;fused&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline/benzoxazine compounds via tandem reductive cyclization of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;(8&#8208;quinolinyloxy) ethanones. Further reductive protocol has been applied for the synthesis of antiarrhythmic drug nicainoprol and tubulin polymerization inhibitor efficiently. Notably, BAIL was easily recovered and reused multiple times without a considerable loss in catalytic activity. The elucidation of the underlying mechanism was achieved through a combination of several control experiments, kinetic studies, and isotopic labelling experiments. This study offers a new reaction pathway for the reduction of quinoline, in which BAIL facilitates proton transfer through a distinctive hydrogen bonding ion&#8208;pair mechanism.

         <title>Synthetic Membranes for Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries (AORFBs): towards&#160;High Conductive and Selective Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have emerged as a leading electrochemical technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, using water&#8208;based electrolytes to deliver inherent safety and cost efficiency. High&#8208;performance ion exchange membranes&#160;promote the battery performance, including energy/power densities, operational durability, and Coulombic/energy efficiencies. This review examines recent advances in ion channel engineering for AORFB membranes, focusing on chemical synthesis strategies, structural optimization approaches, and ion channel architecture evolution. We analyze characterization methodologies for diverse membrane types, their corresponding cell performance, and design principles.&#160;We highlight conductivity&#8208;permeability relationships across membrane architectures, particularly microphase separation, microporous channels, and dual&#8208;ion configurations, establishing fundamental structure&#8208;property correlations.&#160;These insights provide a strategic roadmap for future ion channel design in membranes, advancing practical frameworks for high&#8208;performance AORFBs.








Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) have emerged as one of the most promising electrochemical technologies for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their use of water&#8208;based electrolytes, offering safety and cost advantages over organic solvent&#8208;based systems. AORFBs utilize organic molecules derived from earth&#8208;abundant elements, enabling tunable properties such as solubility, stability, and redox potential at the molecular level. These features enable improvements in energy and power densities, operational lifetimes, and efficiency metrics in the battery system. However, the lack of suitable ion exchange membranes limits the energy efficiency, power density, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Membrane design for AORFBs faces challenges in balancing conductivity and permeability, requiring precise control over ion transfer channel size, quantity, and interconnection. This review summarizes recent advances in AORFBs membrane design, focusing on ion channel engineering through chemical and microstructural adjustments. We highlight the impact of these designs on membrane conductivity, permeability, and overall cell performance, aiming to provide a practical framework for developing superior membranes for future grid&#8208;scale AORFBs applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;Disubstituted Isoquinoline&#8208;Containing Lipoxin A4 Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(1R)&#8208; and (1S)&#8208;Epimers of novel isoquinoline&#8208;derived SPMs were prepared, with a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction and a Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation as the key synthetic steps. Biological assessment demonstrated that several analogues significantly attenuate lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B activation and downstream pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretion, including IL&#8208;6, IL&#8208;1&#946;, and TNF.








Abstract
The resolution of inflammation is increasingly recognized as an active, highly regulated process essential for restoring tissue homeostasis following immune activation. Lipoxin&#8208;A4 (LXA4), an endogenous specialized pro&#8208;resolving mediator (SPM), plays a central role in this process through activation of the ALX/FPR2 receptor. However, its clinical application is limited by rapid metabolic degradation and poor in vivo stability. In this study, we report the design, asymmetric synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;disubstituted isoquinoline&#8208;based analogues of LXA4 (Isoq&#8208;sLXms), designed to enhance metabolic stability. The synthetic route employed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck cross&#8208;coupling and Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, affording diastereomerically pure compounds. Biological assessment in THP&#8208;1 LUCIA monocytes demonstrated that several analogues, particularly (1R)&#8208;8, significantly attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B activation and downstream pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretion, including IL&#8208;6, IL&#8208;1&#946;, and TNF. Functional assays using ALX/FPR2&#8208;transfected HEK&#8208;293 cells revealed that (1R)&#8208;8 acts as a partial agonist, supporting its role in engaging pro&#8208;resolving signaling mechanisms. Safety profiling confirmed low cytotoxicity across physiologically relevant concentrations. These findings demonstrate that isoquinoline&#8208;based LXA4 mimetics retain and enhance key pro&#8208;resolving bioactivities while offering improved stability and receptor selectivity. (1R)&#8208;8 emerges as a promising lead compound for the development of resolution&#8208;directed therapeutics in the context of chronic inflammation.

         <title>Electron Density&#8208;Dependent Mallory Photocyclization Constructs Rigid Saddle&#8208;Shaped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Enhanced Aromaticity</title>

Saddle&#8208;Shaped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons have been synthesized via highly efficient Mallory reaction, and exhibited extended aromatic skeleton with high quantum yields in solutions and aggregation casued quenching in solid states.








Abstract
This study reports the synthesis of three saddle&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)&#8212;bFT&#8208;C, bFP&#8208;C, and bFP2&#8208;C&#8212;via Mallory photocyclization of bisfluorenylidene&#8208;dihydroacene precursors. The reaction achieved high yields (77&#8211;88%) under UV irradiation, with structural characterization confirming enhanced aromaticity and rigid frameworks in the cyclized products. Kinetic studies revealed that anthracene&#8208;containing bFP2 exhibited the fastest reaction rate, which we attribute to its elevated electron density. Photophysical studies showed strong solution fluorescence (PLQY: 45&#8211;48%) but aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in solids due to enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Electrochemical analyses revealed reversible redox processes, while low&#8208;temperature spectroscopy identified deep&#8208;red phosphorescence (lifetimes: 72.6&#8211;270.0&#160;ms). This work demonstrates how precursor architecture governs reaction kinetics and photophysical properties, providing a design strategy for nonplanar PAHs with tailored luminescence characteristics.

         <title>Transformation of Silyl&#8208;Protected Tetrafluorinated Thia[6]helicene S&#8208;Oxide into a Difluorinated Coronene via Induced Desilylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimethylsilyl&#8208;protected tetrafluorinated thia[6]helicene S&#8208;oxide undergoes a more efficient transformation to difluorinated coronene than its unprotected S&#8208;oxide and S,S&#8208;dioxide counterparts. Si&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions and in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated sulfur monoxide facilitate selective desilylation, offering mechanistic insight into this cascade transformation.








Abstract
Sulfur oxidation of thiophene rings is an effective strategy for constructing substituted and polycyclic arenes via Diels&#8211;Alder reactions, wherein each thiophene ring is converted into a benzene ring. In the context of converting helicenes into planar coronenes, tetrafluorinated thia[6]helicene S,S&#8208;dioxide undergoes a smooth intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to afford the difluorinated coronene. However, the corresponding S&#8208;oxide counterpart is affected by competing side reactions that limit its utility. Herein, we demonstrate that introducing a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group onto the thiophene S&#8208;oxide ring suppresses self&#8208;condensation and enables more efficient coronene conversion than its S,S&#8208;dioxide counterpart. Unexpectedly, the TMS group is removed during the transformation, yielding both the TMS&#8208;protected and deprotected forms of the difluorinated coronene. Mechanistic investigations suggest that this desilylation arises from the combined effect of Si&#183;&#183;&#183;F interactions and in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated sulfur monoxide (SO). These findings provide insights into the reactivity control of thiophene S&#8208;oxides and demonstrate how silicon, fluorine, and SO can influence cascade transformations toward functionalized polycyclic aromatic systems.

         <title>Layered MnAl Complex Oxide Realizes the Efficient Aerobic Oxidative Transformations of 1,2&#8208;Diols and Alcohols Under Normal Pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and convenient catalyst based on MnAl layered double oxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDO) has been developed for the aerobic oxidative transformations of 1,2&#8208;diols and alcohols under normal pressure without any additives. The excellent electron transfer ability and strong surface basic sites of the catalyst realize the oxidation primarily via two&#8208;electron transfer (TET), and minorly via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes.








Abstract
An efficient and convenient MnAl layered double oxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDO) catalyst has been developed. Characterization results indicated that Mn2Al&#8208;LDO exhibits an improved ability of electron transfer and increased surface strong basic sites on its surface compared to the layered double hydroxide (Mn2Al&#8208;LDH) precursor and conventionally prepared Mn2AlOx. These characters endow the Mn2Al&#8208;LDO with excellent catalytic performance in the aerobic oxidative cleavage of 1,2&#8208;diols under normal pressure without additives. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that both the two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) and single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) processes are included in the catalytic reaction, with the former being more prominent. The Mn2Al&#8208;LDO catalytic system can tolerate a broad substrate scope, including monosubstituted 1,2&#8208;diols, internal 1,2&#8208;diols, primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, and various &#945;&#8208;functionalized alcohols. Additionally, the Mn2Al&#8208;LDO catalytic system also exhibits excellent catalytic stability and shows great potential for application in cascade transformations.

         <title>Inherently Chiral Calix[4]Arene Derivatives: Concept and Enantioselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The past decade has seen a significant rise in the enantioselective synthesis of calix[4]arene derivatives with inherent chirality, which arises from the twisted macrocyclic structures of the linked aryl groups. This development is crucial for applications in chiral catalyst design and the creation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Two main strategies have been extensively explored: the de novo synthesis of macrocycles and the desymmetrization of prochiral calix[4]arene derivatives. This review highlights the enantioselective synthetic approaches used to achieve inherently chiral calix[4]arene derivatives and offers a forward&#8208;looking perspective on future advancements in this field.








Abstract
Calix[4]arene derivatives possess chirality derived from macrocycles with twisted linked aryls and have numerous applications in chiral recognition, chiral sensors, circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, and enantioselective catalysis. Due to their unique structural scaffolds, calix[4]arene derivatives have seen increased attention in enantioselective synthesis in recent decades. Although many achievements have been made in this area based on desymmetrization or de novo macrocycle synthesis strategies, new calix[4]arene derivatives structures and efficient enantioselective synthesis methodologies are highly desirable. This review highlights recent enantioselective synthesis strategies and provides perspectives for future developments.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of the Mirror&#8208;Image Fast&#8208;PETase by the Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Solubilizing&#8208;Tag Strategy</title>

Abstract
Mirror&#8208;image poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic&#8208;degrading enzymes have emerged as promising biocatalytic platforms due to their exceptional enzymatic stability and low immunogenicity. Currently, the sole reported mirror&#8208;image plastic&#8208;degrading enzyme, the D&#8208;form of 231&#8208;residue PET hydrolase ICCG (engineered leaf&#8208;branch compost cutinase variant), suffers from thermophilic activity requirements, which limits its practical applications. Here, the first total chemical synthesis of a mirror&#8208;image 271&#8208;residue D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase was presented by using an enzyme&#8208;cleavable solubilizing tag strategy. Comparative kinetic analysis revealed that D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase showed a remarkable increase (&#8764;20&#8208;fold within 24&#160;hours) in PET degradation efficiency compared to D&#8208;ICCG at temperatures of 37 &#176;C, making it a promising candidate for prolonged PET decomposition in open environments and holding potential in addressing microplastic&#8208;related health issues within the biomedical field. This work not only expands the chemical biology toolbox for mirror&#8208;image enzyme synthesis but also establishes D&#8208;Fast&#8208;PETase as a candidate in combating the dual crises of global plastic pollution and microplastic&#8208;associated health risks.

&lt;p&gt;Mirror-image poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic-degrading enzymes have emerged as promising biocatalytic platforms due to their exceptional enzymatic stability and low immunogenicity. Currently, the sole reported mirror-image plastic-degrading enzyme, the D-form of 231-residue PET hydrolase ICCG (engineered leaf-branch compost cutinase variant), suffers from thermophilic activity requirements, which limits its practical applications. Here, the first total chemical synthesis of a mirror-image 271-residue D-Fast-PETase was presented by using an enzyme-cleavable solubilizing tag strategy. Comparative kinetic analysis revealed that D-Fast-PETase showed a remarkable increase (&#8764;20-fold within 24&#160;hours) in PET degradation efficiency compared to D-ICCG at temperatures of 37 &#176;C, making it a promising candidate for prolonged PET decomposition in open environments and holding potential in addressing microplastic-related health issues within the biomedical field. This work not only expands the chemical biology toolbox for mirror-image enzyme synthesis but also establishes D-Fast-PETase as a candidate in combating the dual crises of global plastic pollution and microplastic-associated health risks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
