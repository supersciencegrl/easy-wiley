         <title>Selective Nsp2&#8208; and Csp2&#8208; photografting of Au&#8208;Surface by aryldiazonium salts and arylazo sulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylazo sulfonates (Ar&#8208;N=N&#8208;SO3Na) were found to undergo photografting on gold surface through both Au&#8208;Nsp2&#8208; and Au&#8208;Csp2&#8208; bond formation. The functionalized materials have been fully characterized by Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), Raman, XPS, DFT calculations and UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy. These methods permit to evidence aromatic substituents (IRRAS), the Au&#8208;N=N signature (Raman and XPS spectroscopy) and the Bond Dissociation Energy values of the two linkages (DFT calculation). The grafting proceeds through two competitive paths, namely a stepwise reaction involving an aryl radical (for the formation of the Au&#8208;Ar bonds) and a concerted reaction on the surface of gold (for Au&#8208;N=N&#8208;Ar bond formation). The occurrence of an aryl radical upon irradiation has been fully evidenced via EPR spectroscopy. Finally, E/Z photoisomerisation of the N=N bonds present on prepared few layers films was observed by means of UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Indolocarbazole&#8208;Based Multiple&#8208;Resonance Molecules: an Emerging Class of Full&#8208;Color, Narrowband Emitters for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband emitters based on multiple resonance (MR) effect have shown great promises for applications in high&#8208;definition displays. Though most reported MR emitters adopt the boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208; doped triangulene&#8208;like skeleton following the design of the DABNA series, MR materials with the nitrogen&#8208;only indolocarbazole structures have recently emerged and demonstrated good color tunability from violet to deep red and impressive electroluminescence performances in terms of both efficiency and stability. Herein, we will summarize indolocarbazole&#8208;based MR materials in recent reports, with emphasis on their molecular design, synthesis, photophysical and electroluminescence properties as well as some future research directions to unlock the full potential of this fascinating class of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with collision induced dissociation of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters containing various uranyl bridging ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We utilized electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with collision&#8208;induced dissociation (ESI&#8208;MS/MS) to study the gas phase fragmentation of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters with hydroxo, peroxo, oxalate, and pyrophosphate bridging ligands. These nanoclusters fragment into uranium monomers and dimers with mass&#8208;to&#8208;charge (m/z) ratios in the 280&#8211;380 region. The gas phase fragmentation of each cluster studied yields a distinct UO6&#8211; anion attributed to the cleavage of a uranyl ion bound to 2 peroxide groups, along with other anions that can be attributed to the initial composition of the nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead&#8208;free Double Perovskite Semiconductor with Rigid Spacer&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Tc Dielectric Switch Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered hybrid perovskites possess exceptional semiconductor features and structural versality, making them viable candidates for developing multifunctional dielectric phase&#8208;transition materials (PTMS).However, most PTMs based on layered hybrid perovskites still suffer from Pb toxicity and low operating temperature.The recently developed hybrid double perovskites provide a new routine to designed PTMs with desired working performance and environment&#8208;friendly chemical compositions. Herein, using rigid aromatic cations as templates, we have successfully synthesized a novel double perovskite (benzylammonium)4AgBiBr8(1), which consists of corner&#8208;sharing AgBr6 and BiBr6 layers and benzylammonium cations. Notably, 1 exhibits a high&#8208;temperature first&#8208;order reversible solid&#8208;state phase transition at 383/387 K(cooling/heating) and switchable dielectric performance around the temperature. Compared with the soft organic chain version of the compound, the phase transition temperature of 1 shows a large enhancement of 99 K, validating the correctness of the designing strategy. In addition, 1 also exhibits semiconductor characteristics with a calculated bandgap of 2.34 eV and an optical bandgap of 2.29 eV. Remarkably, the single crystal photodetector of 1 shows a low dark current(2.12&#215;10&#8208;13&#160;A), a high on/off ratio(1.77&#215;103), and a fast response(&#964;rise=125 &#956;s and &#964;decay=419 &#956;s). Such a lead&#8208;free phase transition material combined with semiconductor properties provides a new strategy to develop environmentally friendly multifunctional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Energy Transfer and Light&#8208;Emitting Colors by Chiral Dye Exchange and Achiral&#8208;to&#8208;Chiral Dye Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New chiral and achiral dyes were synthesized by using clean, highly efficient Diels&#8208;Alder &#8216;click&#8217; reactions. We prepared pure endo&#8208; and exo&#8208; stereoisomers and blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting single crystal of an exo&#8208;isomer. 1H NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal the precise spatial configurations of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;dye stereoisomers. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction results reveal the dynamic nature of Diels&#8208;Alder covalent bonds. By reversible formation and cleavage of dynamic covalent bonds, an achiral dye was converted to a chiral dye, where achiral dansyl dye moiety was replaced by chiral moiety. Before achiral&#8208;to&#8208;chiral dye conversion, the dye system displayed dansyl acceptor green light&#8208;emitting color due to intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer, where the blue emission of pyrene donor fluorophore was not observed. After achiral&#8208;to&#8208;chiral dye conversion, light&#8208;emitting colors of dye system change from green to blue, where the pyrene&#8208;to&#8208;dansyl fluorophore energy transfer was suppressed, and pyrene fluorophore blue emission was restored. Chiral transfer occurs in a chiral dye solid from non&#8208;chromophore alky chirality to pyrene chromophore. Thus, the chiral dye solid displayed chiral optical behaviors, i.e. circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Etheno&#8208;bridged Azaacene Spiro Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the synthesis of two sets of spiro&#8208;connected azaacene dimers. Their geometry and electronic coupling are critically determined by a secondary linker, i.e. an etheno&#8208; and an ethano&#8208;bridge. The core fragment of the etheno&#8208;bridged dimer corresponds to a conformationally locked cis&#8208;stilbene. Optoelectronic properties, single crystal X&#8208;ray structures and stability with respect to oxidation of the conjugated and non&#8208;conjugated dimers are reported and compared. The conjugated dimers exhibit smaller optical gaps and bathochromically shifted absorption maxima, but are prone to unexpected oxygen addition, dearomatizing one of the azaacene substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>Trinuclear PdII Complexes Bearing a C3&#8208;Symmetric Triethynylbenzene&#8208;Based Tris&#8208;NHC Ligand: Catalytic Benefits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;imidazolium tribromide salt 3, featuring 1,3,5&#8208;substituted triethynylbenzene, was used for the preparation of a trinuclear PdII PEPPSI (pyridine&#8208;enhanced precatalyst preparation stabilization and initiation) type complex by triple C2 deprotonation followed by the addition of PdCl2. Trinuclear PdII complex possessing a combination of NHC and PPh3 ligands has also been synthesized. The corresponding mononuclear palladium(II) complexes have also been synthesized for the comparison purpose. All these complexes have been characterized by using NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry. The molecular structure of the trinuclear palladium(II) complex bearing mixed carbene and pyridine donor ligands has been established by using single crystal XRD. All the palladium(II) complexes have been used as pre&#8208;catalysts which gave good to excellent yields in intermolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole and Sonogashira coupling reaction. Catalytic studies indicate an enhanced activity of the trinuclear PdII complex in comparison to the corresponding mononuclear PdII complex for both catalytic transformations. The better performance of the trinuclear complex has also been further supported by preliminary electrochemical measurements. A negative mercury poison test was observed for both the aforementioned catalyses and therefore, it is likely that these organic transformations proceed homogeneously.</dc:description>

         <title>A Structural Perspective into the Interaction of an Oncogenesis&#8208;Relevant pre&#8208;miRNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligand Carrier with the Protein Nucleolin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural determinants of the interaction of the G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) motif found in precursor miRNA 149 (rG4) with the acridine orange derivative C8, a G4 ligand stabilizer possessing anticancer activity, and the protein nucleolin (overexpressed in cancer cells) were investigated by NMR spectroscopy. For the rG4/C8 complex, the results revealed a strong stabilizing interaction between the aromatic core and the iodinated ring of the C8 ligand with the rG4 structure. The NMR study revealed also different interaction patterns between nucleolin and rG4 and nucleolin and rG4/C8 complex. In the absence of the ligand, rG4 establishes interactions with polar residues of the protein while for the rG4/C8 complex, these contacts are mainly established with amino acids that have hydrophobic side chains. However, nucleolin chemical shift perturbation studies in the presence of rG4 or rG4/C8 reveal the same location between domains 1 and 2 of the protein, which suggests that the rG4 and rG4/C8 complex bind in this region. This puzzling structural study opens a new framework to study rG4/ligand/nucleolin complexes that might impact the biogenesis of miRNA 149.</dc:description>

         <title>&#963;,&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Bis(germylene) Adducts with NHC and CAACs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavier tetrylenes attract attention for their potential in synthesis, catalysis and small molecule activation. The coordination by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) results in substantial structural and electronic differences although typically only one of these yields stable derivatives for one and the same tetrylene. We now report both NHC&#8208; and CAAC&#8208;coordination to a bridged bis(germylene) motif. The NHC&#8208;coordinated bis(germylene) exhibits pyramidal germanium centers with lone pairs of electrons, while with CAAC an unprecedented stable bis(germene) with two Ge=C bonds is isolated. Spectroscopic and crystallographic evidence as well as DFT calculations confirm the effects of &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugation between the two germanium centers in both cases. The coordination of NHC is reversible as the reaction with BPh3 liberates the transient bis(germylene) and thus provides an alternative low&#8208;temperature route towards polymers with Ge=Ge bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Self&#8208;Assembly and Applications of Metal&#8208;Organic Molecular Containers with Flexible Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry has become an interdisciplinary discipline of chemistry, physics, and biology. As a huge subunit of supramolecular compounds, the functional metal&#8208;organic supramolecular systems with well&#8208;defined cavities which are able to accommodate size&#8208;suitable guests via benign host&#8208;guest behavior, have been known as &#8220;metal&#8208;organic molecular containers&#8221; (MOMCs) and attracted much attentions for their rich chemical properties and wide potential applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, bio&#8208;medical and other fields. In particular, the MOMCs with flexible backbones exhibit a unique feature both in the aspect of structural construction and applications, due to the free rotation and self&#8208;adaptively of the specific functional groups in the skeletons. In this paper, we review several selected examples of the coordination&#8208;driven metal&#8208;organic supramolecular systems from the aspects of self&#8208;assembly construction to the various applications. The self&#8208;assembly strategies, especially the different choice of organic ligands with flexible backbones during the construction, leading to quite diverse configurations compared to the rigid ligands, have been also discussed to show a different perspective of metal&#8208;organic system construction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Transparent, Healable&#160;and Recyclable Alicyclic Poly(ether&#8208;b&#8208;amide) Multiblock Copolymer&#160;with Ultrahigh Toughness</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;healing polyamide multiblock copolymer with robust mechanical properties is highly desired. Here, an alicyclic diamine monomer, isophoronediamine (IPDA), with asymmetric structure and substantial steric hindrance was incorporated into the backbone of poly(ether&#8208;b&#8208;amide) multiblock copolymer. Based on the phase&#8208;lock effect, the mechanical properties and segmental mobility of copolymers can be modulated on a large scale via adjusting the molecular weight of hard segments. An extraordinary tensile strength of 32.0 MPa and an excellent elongation at break of 1881% were simultaneously achieved, which leaded to a record&#8208;high toughness of 328.9 MJ m&#8208;3 for self&#8208;healable polyamide elastomers. The synergism between the dynamic H&#8208;bonding networks and the diffusion of polymer chains contributed to a balance between the mechanical performance and self&#8208;healing efficiency of copolymers. Due to the adjustable mechanical performance, rapid scratch self&#8208;healing ability and superior impact resistance, the resultant copolymers showed great potential in the fields of protective coatings and soft electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Cs2SnBr6/rGO Composite for Photocatalytic Selective Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Diformylfuran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Severe poisonousness and prolonged instability existing in organic&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;based perovskite are two matters seriously hindering its potential future application in photocatalysis. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore ecology&#8208;friendly, air&#8208;stable and highly active metal&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, a novel and stable lead&#8208;free perovskite Cs2SnBr6 decorated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), is synthesized and employed in the photocatalytic organic conversion. The as&#8208;prepared Cs2SnBr6&#173; is ultrastable, exhibiting no obvious changes after being placed in the air for six months. The Cs2SnBr6/rGO composite shows excellent photocatalytic activity in photo&#8208;driven&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to high value enclosed 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), achieving &gt; 99.5% conversion of HMF and 88% DFF selectivity in the presence of green oxidant O2. Comprehensive characterizations disclose a multistep reaction mechanism, demonstrating that the molecular oxygen, photogenerated carriers, &#8226;O2&#8208; and 1O2 altogether synergistically participate in the effective photo&#8208;driven conversion of HMF to DFF. This work expands the material gallery towards selective organic conversion and environmentally friendly perovskite options for photocatalytic application.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines via Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Oxidative Pictet&#8722;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, an efficient and green procedure for the synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines via dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with tryptamines is reported. The reaction was carried out under mild conditions in the presence of a catalytic amount of the  i PrPNP&#8208;Mn catalyst and a weak base (Na2CO3). This method tolerated a variety of benzylic and aliphatic alcohol substrates with different functional groups and afforded diverse products in good to excellent isolated yields using tryptamines. Using this strategy, we successfully synthesised pharmaceutical molecules harman, harmaline, and harmine in a concise manner.</dc:description>

         <title>(3+2)&#8208;Cyclization Reactions of Unsaturated Phosphonites with Aldehydes and Thioketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsaturated phosphonites are excellent substrates in new (3+2)&#8208;cyclization reactions with aldehydes or thioketones. The cyclisation reactions proceed smoothly at room temperature and lead to the fast formation of the previously inaccessible phosphorus heterocycles 1,3&#8208;oxa&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;thiaphosphole&#8208;3&#8208;oxides in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
By exploiting the unique reactivity of ethynyl&#8208;phosphonites we obtain novel P(V)&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered heterocycles via (3+2)&#8208;cyclization reactions with aldehydes or cycloaliphatic thioketones in satisfactory to excellent yields. Whereas reactions with thioketones to yield 1,3&#8208;thiaphospholes&#8208;3&#8208;oxides occur smoothly at room temperature with equimolar amounts of the starting materials in absence of any catalyst, the analogous conversions with aldehydes to generate 3&#8208;oxides of 1,3&#8208;oxaphospholes require addition of triethylamine as a base. We postulate a step&#8208;wise (3+2)&#8208;cyclization mechanism for the formation of the 1,3&#8208;thiaphosphole ring based on DFT quantum chemical calculations. With this study, we introduce new cyclization reactions originating from unsaturated phosphonites as central synthetic building blocks to yield previously inaccessible stable phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles with unexplored potential for the molecular sciences.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Proteins via Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis and Native Chemical Ligation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation of alpha&#8208;Synuclein, a protein associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, can be altered by mutations and by posttranslational modifications, but the precise effects of these alterations are still elusive. Here, we devised a strategy for the chemical synthesis of the protein combining solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and native chemical ligation. This enables the synthesis of custom&#8208;made protein variants to determine their aggregation behavior.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Synuclein) is a 140 amino acid protein implicated in neurodegenerative disorders known as synucleinopathies, where it accumulates in proteinaceous inclusions in the brain. The normal physiological function of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein remains obscure, as it exists in several non&#8208;neuronal cells in which its function has not been studied. Given the tremendous interest in studying &#945;&#8208;Synuclein, and the existing limitations in the production of modified forms of the protein, we developed a method for the chemical synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by combining peptide fragment synthesis via automated microwave&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and ligation strategies. Our synthetic pathway enables the synthesis of protein variants of interest, carrying either mutations or posttranslational modifications, for further investigations of the effects on the structure and aggregation behavior of the protein. Ultimately, our study forms the foundation for future syntheses and studies of other custom&#8208;made &#945;&#8208;Synuclein variants with a single or several modifications, as necessary.

         <title>Eletrocarboxylation Reactions Using CO2 Both as Promoter and Carboxylative Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocarboxylation reaction employs CO2 as a carboxylative reagent to prepare value&#8208;added carboxylic acid via organic electrosynthesis. In some cases, CO2 also acts as a promoter to facilitate the desired reaction. This Concept mainly highlights recent CO2&#8208;promoted electrocarboxylation reactions via CO2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate or transiently protective carboxylation of active intermediate with CO2.







Abstract
Electrocarboxylation reaction, which employs organic electrosynthesis to achieve the utilization of CO2 as a carboxylative reagent, provides a powerful and efficient tool for the preparation of organic carboxylic acid. In some electrocarboxylation reactions, CO2 also acts as a promoter to facilitate the desired reaction. This concept mainly highlights recent CO2&#8208;promoted electrocarboxylation reactions via CO2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate or transiently protective carboxylation of active intermediate with CO2.

         <title>Redox Convergent Synthesis and Reactivity of a Cobalt(III)&#8208;Pentasulfido Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Co(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound has been synthesized by a unique redox convergent reaction between two new cobalt(II)&#8208;thiolate compounds and elemental sulfur. Detailed reactivity of the Co(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound towards reducing agents, phosphines, and proton, and transfer of the coordinated pentasulfido chain to selected organic compounds for the generation of organopolysulfide compounds have been demonstrated.







Abstract
A new mononuclear cobalt(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound, [(L)Co(S5)] (3) has been synthesized by using a convergent redox reaction between elemental sulfur and two new cobalt(II)&#8208;thiolato compounds, [(L)Co(SR)] (R=Ph, 2&#8201;a; 2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;C6H4, 2&#8201;b), which in turn were synthesized from a dimeric cobalt(II) complex, [(L)2Co2]2+ (1). Compound 3 features a low&#8208;spin, diamagnetic, Co(III) center with a coordinated pentasulfido (S52&#8722;) chain and has no precedence in the literature. Compound 3 is highly stable towards reduction with a potential of &#8722;1.36&#8197;V (vs. Cp2Fe+/Cp2Fe) and gives back 1 upon chemical/electrochemical reduction. Reaction of 3 with phosphines yields back 1 and phosphine sulfides, while protonation of the coordinated S52&#8722; chain in 3 leads to the formation of 1, elemental sulfur and H2S. Finally, transfer of the coordinated S52&#8722; chain in 3 to selected organic compounds, such as MeI, PhCH2Br and PhCOCl, for the generation of organopolysulfido compounds has been demonstrated.

         <dc:description>
Understanding the nanoscale interactions: The determination of the secondary structure of supramolecular gels usually refers to the macroscopic material. It is shown that the secondary structure and non&#8208;covalent interactions driving the self&#8208;assembly vary at the nanoscale depending on the configuration of the fibrous network.







Abstract
The design of soft biomaterials requires a deep understanding of molecular self&#8208;assembly. Here a nanoscale infrared (IR) spectroscopy study of a two&#8208;component supramolecular gel is introduced to assess the system's heterogeneity and supramolecular assembly. In contrast to far&#8208;field IR spectroscopy, near&#8208;field IR spectroscopy revealed differences in the secondary structures of the gelator molecules and non&#8208;covalent interactions at three distinct nano&#8208;locations of the gel network. A &#946;&#8208;sheet arrangement is dominant in single and parallel fibres with a small proportion of an &#945;&#8208;helix present, while the molecular assembly derives from strong hydrogen bonding. However, at the crossing point of two fibres, only the &#946;&#8208;sheet motif is observed, with an intense &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking contribution. Near&#8208;field nanospectroscopy can become a powerful tool for the nanoscale distinction of non&#8208;covalent interactions, while it is expected to advance the existing spectroscopic assessments of supramolecular gels.

Regiopure 1,6/7 perylenediimide (PDI) precursors are prepared at the gram scale for the first time, offering the possibility to systematically study the regioisomerism&#8208;dependant optoelectronic properties of PDI&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
The use of perylenediimide (PDI) building blocks in materials for organic electronic is of considerable interest. This popular n&#8208;type organic semiconductor is tuned by introducing peripheral groups in their ortho and bay positions. Such modifications radically alter their optoelectronic properties. In this article, we describe an efficient method to afford regioisomerically pure 1,6/7&#8208;(NO2)2&#8208; and (NH2)2&#8208;PDIs employing two key steps: the selective crystallization of 1,6&#8208;(NO2)2&#8208;perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxy tetrabutylester and the nitration of regiopure 1,7&#8208;Br2&#8208;PDI with silver nitrite. The optoelectronic properties of the resulting regioisomerically pure dinitro, diamino&#8208;PDIs and bisazacoronenediimides (BACDs) are reported and demonstrate the need to separate both regioisomers of such n&#8208;type organic semiconductors for their inclusion in advanced optoelectronic devices. For the first time, the two regioisomers of the same PDI starting material are available on the multigram scale, which will stimulate the exploration of regioisomerism/properties relationship for this family of dyes.

         <title>Structural and Synthetic Insights on Oxidative Homocouplings of Alkynes Mediated by Alkali&#8208;Metal Manganates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali&#8208;metal manganates can efficiently promote homocoupling of terminal alkynes affording 1,3&#8208;diynes using dry air as terminal oxidant. Reactivity studies including the trapping of key organometallic intermediates have revealed that Na/Mn(II) is the most efficient bimetallic partnership to promote these reactions under stoichiometric regimes.







Abstract
Exploiting bimetallic cooperation alkali&#8208;metal manganate (II) complexes can efficiently promote oxidative homocoupling of terminal alkynes furnishing an array of conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes. The influence of the alkali&#8208;metal on these C&#8722;C bond forming processes has been studied by preparing and structurally characterizing the alkali&#8208;metal tetra(alkyl) manganates [(TMEDA)2Na2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4] and [(PMDETA)2K2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4]. Reactivity studies using phenylacetylene as a model substrate have revealed that for the homocoupling to take place initial metalation of the alkyne is required. In this regard, the lack of basicity of neutral Mn(CH2SiMe3)2 precludes the formation of the diyne. Contrastingly, the tetra(alkyl) alkali&#8208;metal manganates behave as polybasic reagents, being able to easily deprotonate phenylacetylene yielding [{(THF)4Na2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4}&#8734;] and [(THF)4Li2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4]. Controlled exposure of [{(THF)4Na2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4}&#8734;] and [(THF)4Li2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4] to dry air confirmed their intermediary in formation of 1,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiyne in excellent yields. While the Na/Mn(II) partnership proved to be the most efficient in stoichiometric transformations, under catalytic regimes, the combination of MC&#8801;CAr (M= Li, Na) and MnCl2 (6&#8197;mol&#8201;%) only works for lithium, most likely due to the degradation of alkynylsodiums under the aerobic reaction conditions.

         <title>Esterase Specific Fluorescent Probe: Mechanistic Understanding Using QM/MM Calculation and Cell States Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An esterase&#8208;specific ratiometric fluorescent probe, PM&#8208;OAc, can distinguish live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity. The action of the esterase enzyme and active site for binding with the probe is demonstrated by MD simulation and QM/MM calculations.







Abstract
Esterases enzymes regulate the body's homeostasis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of various esters. These are also involved in protein metabolism, detoxification, and signal transmission. Most importantly, esterase plays a significant role in cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. Hence, developing an efficient chemical probe is essential for monitoring the esterase activity. Several fluorescent probes for esterase have also been reported targeting cytosol and lysosomes. However, the ability to create efficient probes is constrained due to a lack of understanding of the esterase&#8216;s active site for hydrolyzing the substrate. In addition, the fluorescent turn&#8208;on may limit efficient monitoring. Herein, we have developed a unique fluorescent probe, PM&#8208;OAc, to monitor mitochondrial esterase enzyme activity ratiometrically. This probe exhibited a bathochromic wavelength shift with esterase enzyme in alkaline pH (pH&#8764;8.0) due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. The phenomenon is well supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculation. Moreover, the substrate (PM&#8208;OAc) binding at the active site of esterase and its catalytic mechanism to hydrolyze the ester bond are elucidated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and QM/MM (Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations, respectively. Fluorescent image&#8208;based analysis of the cellular environment reveals that our probe can distinguish between live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New molecular scaffolds of phenazine and pyrene are constructed by fusing them with oxanorbornene. The C&#8208;shaped molecules exhibit two interesting &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking modes of phenazine depending on the substituting groups as revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The C&#8208; and Z&#8208;shaped diastereomers exhibit almost the same charge transfer absorption and emission including positive solvatochromism, which are independent on the overall molecular geometry.







Abstract
New molecular scaffolds of C&#8208;, Z&#8208; and box&#8208;shaped configurations are constructed by fusing phenazine and pyrene units with oxanorbornene. As revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the C&#8208;shaped molecules exhibit two interesting &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking modes of phenazine depending on the substituting groups, and the box&#8208;shaped molecule accommodates two chloroform molecules in the cavity and forms H&#8208;bonds with another four molecules of chloroform. The C&#8208; and Z&#8208;shaped molecules as a pair of diastereomers exhibit almost the same charge transfer absorption and emission including positive solvatochromism, indicating that the intramolecular charge transfer between pyrene (&#960;&#8208;donor) and phenazine (&#960;&#8208;acceptor) is not dependent on the overall molecular geometry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New molecular scaffolds of C-, Z- and box-shaped configurations are constructed by fusing phenazine and pyrene units with oxanorbornene. As revealed by X-ray crystallography, the C-shaped molecules exhibit two interesting &#960;-&#960; stacking modes of phenazine depending on the substituting groups, and the box-shaped molecule accommodates two chloroform molecules in the cavity and forms H-bonds with another four molecules of chloroform. The C- and Z-shaped molecules as a pair of diastereomers exhibit almost the same charge transfer absorption and emission including positive solvatochromism, indicating that the intramolecular charge transfer between pyrene (&#960;-donor) and phenazine (&#960;-acceptor) is not dependent on the overall molecular geometry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Negative Homotropic Cooperativity in Guest Binding of a Trisporphyrin Double Cleft</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;layered trisporphyrin cleft has two cleft cavities, where electron&#8208;deficient guest molecules are accommodated with a strong negative cooperativity. The first guest binding affects the electronic structure of the rest of the cavity, reducing the electrostatic interaction in the successive guest binding. Thus, the degree of electron deficiencies of the guest molecules determines the extent of the cooperativity in the guest binding.







Abstract
The negative homotropic allostery of a triple&#8208;layered trisporphyrin cleft with two guest binding sites is confirmed. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8208;guest complexes showed that the trisporphyrin accommodated two guest molecules within the cleft through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. In solution, 1H&#8197;NMR and Job plots showed 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host&#8208;guest complexes. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and UV/vis absorption spectroscopy were employed to evaluate the binding constants and cooperativities. The guest binding of the trisporphyrin showed negative cooperativity and non&#8208;cooperativity depending on the structures of the guest molecules. The correlations between the interaction parameters (&#945;) and Hill constants were determined. ITC experiments showed that the host&#8208;guest complexation of trisporphyrin with electron&#8208;deficient guests incurred an enthalpy penalty in the successive guest binding process. DFT calculations revealed that binding of the first guest reduced the electron density of the central porphyrin plane, which led to an energetic penalty that weakened the successive binding process.

The impact of achiral substituents on the chiral supramolecular aggregation of diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;1H&#8208;triazole dyes is discussed here, giving special emphasis to ECD measurements.







Abstract
We have studied the impact of achiral substituents on the chiral supramolecular architectures of diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;1H&#8208;triazole (DPP) dyes. We decorated the same chiral DPP motif with substituent groups on the nitrogen atoms of the lactam moiety: the hydrophobic n&#8208;octyl alkyl chain, the hydrophilic tri(ethylene glycol) (TEG) chain and the thermo&#8208;cleavable tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (t&#8208;Boc) carbamate group. In spite of having identical conjugated chromophore and chiral appendages, in aggregated form the three dyes displayed profoundly different optical, chiroptical, electrochemical and thermal features. ECD measurements revealed differences in the aggregation modes, which would be inaccessible by most other techniques. We found strong chiroptical features, which would have major implications in the context of chiral organic opto&#8208;electronics and in the development of other highly innovative technological applications.

         <title>Linkage Chemistry of S(VI) Fluorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange: This review summarizes recent advances in the linkage chemistry of S(VI) fluorides since 2014, emphasizing the formation of S&#8722;O, S&#8722;N, and S&#8722;C bonds. The divergent SuFEx linkage is deployed in the assembly of S(VI)&#8208;containing compounds library.







Abstract
Sulfur(VI)&#8208;fluoride exchange linkage as a next generation of click chemistry was introduced by Sharpless and coworkers in 2014. Distinguished from CuAAC, the SuFEx reaction proceeds under metal&#8208;free conditions, and the reactive linkers are variable, enabling access to a diverse class of linkage compounds. Therein, a series of SuFEx linkers emerged has been widely prevalent in diverse fields. The SVI&#8722;F bond in comparison to SVI&#8722;Cl bond features excellent stability and chemoselectivity. The linkage chemistry primarily involves the formation of S&#8722;O and S&#8722;N bonds via commercially available phenols and amines, yet less study on C&#8208;SuFEx linkage. This review will focus on three types of linkage for SuFEx linkers comprising S&#8722;O, S&#8722;N, and S&#8722;C bonds, and we hope to provide a practical guidance for SuFEx linkage chemistry.

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators Assembled by Cobalt(II) Coordination Polymer Incorporated Composite Films and their Application for Self&#8208;Powered Anticorrosion</title>

         <dc:description>
A cobalt(II) coordination complex was synthesized and incorporated into organic polymers to form composite films, which were used as friction materials to improve the output performance of triboelectric nanogenerators for self&#8208;powered electrochemical cathodic protection.







Abstract
A friction layer with stability and durability is important to promote the practical application of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). In this work, a two&#8208;dimensional cobalt coordination polymer (Co&#8208;CP) was successfully synthesized using cobalt nitrate, 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tricarboxyltriphenylamine and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine. To clearly clarify the effect of the doping proportions of Co&#8208;CP and the types of composite polymers on the output performance of the TENG, Co&#8208;CP was combined with two organic polymers having different polarities (polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and ethyl cellulose (EC)) to form a series of composite films, which were used as the friction electrode materials to fabricate TENGs. Electrical characterizations indicated that a high output current and voltage were obtained from the TENG based on 15&#8197;wt.% Co&#8208;CP incorporated in PVDF (Co&#8208;CP@PVDF), which could be further improved by the Co&#8208;CP@EC composite film at the same doping ratio. Furthermore, the optimally fabricated TENG was demonstrated to prevent electrochemical corrosion of carbon steel.

         <title>Computational Screening of Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Efficient Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Two&#8208;dimensional M3(HADQ)2 metal&#8208;organic frameworks are identified as potential single&#8208;atom catalysts for ORR, and their catalytic activity can be effectively tuned by varying the central metal.







Abstract
The development of efficient and inexpensive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is crucial for renewable energy technologies. Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) methods and microkinetic simulations, we systematically investigated the ORR catalytic performance of a series of 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks M3(HADQ)2 (HADQ=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline). It shows that all 2D M3(HADQ)2 (M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh and Pd) monolayers are metallic, due to &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystal orbitals centered on the central metals and ligand N atoms. The catalytic activity of M3(HADQ)2 depends on the binding strength between ORR intermediates and metal species, and can be tuned via changing the central metals. Among these candidates, Rh3(HADQ)2 and Co3(HADQ)2 show superior ORR performance to Pt (111) with high half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.99 and 0.93&#8197;V, respectively. Moreover, the screened two catalysts have excellent intermediate&#8208;tolerance ability for dynamic coverage of oxygenated species on the active sites. Our work provides a new path towards developing efficient ORR electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two-dimensional M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HADQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; metal-organic frameworks&lt;/b&gt; are identified as potential single-atom catalysts for ORR, and their catalytic activity can be effectively tuned by varying the central metal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient and inexpensive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts is crucial for renewable energy technologies. Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) methods and microkinetic simulations, we systematically investigated the ORR catalytic performance of a series of 2D metal-organic frameworks M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HADQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HADQ=2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline). It shows that all 2D M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HADQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh and Pd) monolayers are metallic, due to &#960;-conjugated crystal orbitals centered on the central metals and ligand N atoms. The catalytic activity of M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HADQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the binding strength between ORR intermediates and metal species, and can be tuned via changing the central metals. Among these candidates, Rh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HADQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HADQ)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; show superior ORR performance to Pt (111) with high half-wave potentials of 0.99 and 0.93&#8197;V, respectively. Moreover, the screened two catalysts have excellent intermediate-tolerance ability for dynamic coverage of oxygenated species on the active sites. Our work provides a new path towards developing efficient ORR electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trading Symmetry for Stereoinduction in Tetradentate, non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric Fe(II)&#8208;Complexes for Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of C1&#8208;symmetric bench&#8208;stable stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;iron complexes comprising a linear, tetradentate ligand scaffold are introduced. The possibility of lowering the overall symmetry is scrutinized for an enantioselective ring&#8208;contraction of isoxazoles to furnish chiral 2H&#8208;azirines under open&#8208;flask conditions with the products serving as useful building blocks to access &#945;&#8208;disubstituted &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.







Abstract
A series of stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;metal iron complexes comprising a non&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetric chiral topology is introduced and applied to asymmetric 3d&#8208;transition metal catalysis. The chiral iron(II) complexes are built from chiral tetradentate N4&#8208;ligands containing a proline&#8208;derived amino pyrrolidinyl backbone which controls the relative (cis&#8208;&#945; coordination) and absolute metal&#8208;centered configuration (&#923; vs. &#916;). Two chloride ligands complement the octahedral coordination sphere. The modular composition of the tetradentate ligands facilitates the straightforward incorporation of different terminal coordinating heteroaromatic groups into the scaffold. The influence of various combinations was evaluated in an asymmetric ring contraction of isoxazoles to 2H&#8208;azirines revealing that a decrease of symmetry is beneficial for the stereoinduction to obtain chiral products in up to 99&#8201;% yield and with up to 92&#8201;%&#8201;ee. Conveniently, iron catalysis is feasible under open flask conditions with the bench&#8208;stable dichloro complexes exhibiting high robustness towards oxidative or hydrolytic decomposition. The versatility of non&#8208;racemic 2H&#8208;azirines was subsequently showcased with the conversion into a variety of quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acid derivatives.

Late&#8208;stage derivatization of a shape&#8208;persistent alkyne&#8208;containing cycloparaphenylene via copper&#8208;free [3+2]azide&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions is studied. Systematic variation of the readily available azides from electron&#8208;rich to &#8208;deficient unveil how peripheral substitution affect the properties of the resulting adducts including molecular shape, the oxidation potential, excited state features, and affinities towards different fullerenes.







Abstract
Deriving diverse compound libraries from a single substrate in high yields remains to be a challenge in cycloparaphenylene chemistry. In here, a strategy for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of shape&#8208;persistent alkyne&#8208;containing cycloparaphenylene has been explored using readily available azides. The copper&#8208;free [3+2]azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition provided high yields (&gt;90&#8201;%) in a single reaction step. Systematic variation of the azides from electron&#8208;rich to &#8208;deficient shines light on how peripheral substitution influences the characteristics of the resulting adducts. We find that among the most affected properties are the molecular shape, the oxidation potential, excited&#8208;state features, and affinities towards different fullerenes. Joint experimental and theoretical results are presented including calculations with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, artificial intelligence&#8208;enhanced quantum mechanical method 1 (AIQM1).

         <title>Structural Complexity in the Apparently Simple Crystal Structure of Be2Ru</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation of the crystal structure of Be2Ru through single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, yields a picture which is more complex than the ideal Be2Ru structure (Fe2P&#8208;type structure). Indeed, minor inclusions of orthorhombic fragments into the extended hexagonal Fe2P&#8208;type matrix are observed. Charge transfer contributes strongly to the stabilization of such atomic arrangement.







Abstract
The structural features of the hexagonal layered crystal structure of Be2Ru (a=5.7508(3)&#8197;&#197;, c=3.0044(2)&#8197;&#197;, space group P
2m) were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The residual electron density and high&#8208;resolution TEM images show that the real structure can be described as an intergrowth of the main hexagonal matrix of the Fe2P type with minor orthorhombic inclusions of its stacking variants. Such atomic arrangement is stabilized by the charge transfer from Be to Ru and by a system of polar three&#8208; and four&#8208;atomic bonds involving both components. The calculated electronic density of states (DOS) of Be2Ru revealed, contrarily to typical intermetallic compounds, a pseudo gap (dip) in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of Be2Ru shows metal behaviour in agreement with the non&#8208;zero DOS at the Fermi level.

         <dc:description>
Unconventional periodic mesoporous organosilica: The structures and properties of four leading yet underdeveloped families of periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) nanomaterials including chiral PMOs, plugged PMOs, Janus PMOs, and PMO&#8208;based nanovehicles with unconventional characteristics are reviewed. These materials have excellent potential for further developments and applications in the fields of chemistry, biology, and material science.







Abstract
Periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) are high surface area organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid nanomaterials that have found broad applications in various fields of research such as in (bio)chemistry or material science. By choosing suitable organic groups in the framework of these materials, their surface properties such as polarity, optical/electrical characteristics and adsorption capacity can be tuned. This critical review provides an overview of the current state of the art in the developments and applications of some PMO nanomaterials in diverse fields of research. This is placed in the context of four leading areas of PMO nanomaterials, including chiral PMOs, plugged PMO nanomaterials, Janus PMOs and PMO&#8208;based nanomotors. The review briefly discusses the recent and key findings on these PMO nanomaterials as well as their potential applications for future developments.

Actinides/lanthanides separation: This concept mainly outlines the organophosphorus extractants that have been used in actinides/lanthanides separation and provides some new strategies to design the highly efficient extractants for building advanced separation processes for actinides.







Abstract
The separation of actinides from lanthanides in spent nuclear fuel reprocessing is a vital step of nuclear fuel cycle process. As one class of mature industrial extractants, the organophosphorus extractants have been widely used for the extraction and separation of actinides and lanthanides in spent fuel reprocessing due to their strong extraction ability and low&#8208;cost acquisition. In this concept, the application scope of tributyl phosphate (TBP), bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (HDEHP), octyl(phenyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;diisobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide (CMPO), trialkyl phosphine oxide (TRPO), and purified Cyanex 301 (bis(2,4,4&#8208;trimethylpentyl) dithiophosphinic acid, HA301) are introduced, and their extraction mechanism, as well as structure&#8208;function relationships for separation of actinides over lanthanides are also discussed. Furthermore, the design criteria, extraction properties and mechanism of several typical newly developed organophosphorus extractants (CMPO&#8208;modified calixarene/pillarene, phenanthroline&#8208;derived organophosphorus extractants, and phosphate&#8208;modified carborane) based on pre&#8208;organized skeletons are briefly reviewed. Finally, the important role played by those organophosphorus extractants is emphasized and potential applications in separation of actinides over lanthanides in future advanced nuclear fuel cycle are identified.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Nickel Cobalt Phosphide Nanocrosses with Well&#8208;Defined Axial Arms for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

Highly branched NiCoP concave nanocrosses with well&#8208;defined six axial arms and high&#8208;density atomic steps, ledges and kinks are highly efficient as electro&#8208;catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Concave nanostructure with highly branched architecture and abundant step atoms is one kind of desirable materials for energy conversion devices. However, current synthetic strategies for non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based NiCoP concave nanostructure still remain challenging. Herein, we demonstrate a site&#8208;selective chemical etching and subsequent phosphorating strategy to fabricate highly branched NiCoP concave nanocrosses (HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs). The HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs are consisted of six axial arms in three&#8208;dimensional space and each protruding arm is equipped with high&#8208;density atomic steps, ledges and kinks. As an electrocatalyst towards oxygen evolution reaction, the HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs exhibit remarkably enhanced activity and stability, with small overpotential of 289&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, surpassing the NiCoP nanocages and commercial RuO2. The superior OER performance of HB&#8208;NiCoP CNCs is originated from the highly branched concave structure, the synergistic effect between bimetal Ni and Co atoms, as well as the electronic structure modulation from P.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid Based Chiral Trisubstituted Benzimidazole Supramolecules: Synthesis and Self&#8208;Assembling Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper deals with the synthesis and mechanistic aspects of supramolecular formation of trisubstituted amino&#8208;acid based chiral benzimidazoles, which show strong circular dichroism, gelation and fluorescence in CHCl3.







Abstract
Trisubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;tri(benzimidazolyl)benzene derivatives were synthesized from l&#8208;alanine, l&#8208;valine, d&#8208;valine and glycine, and their self&#8208;assembling behavior and stimuli&#8208;response in solution and gel states were evaluated. Circular dichroism/UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopic and dynamic light scattering measurements revealed that the compounds formed H&#8208;aggregates via intramolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions in nonpolar solvents such as CHCl3, whereas collapse of the aggregates was confirmed by MeOH addition. Quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations also supported aggregation in CHCl3. Rheological analysis and morphology observation revealed the formation of a fibril like structure by further assembling of aggregates at a high concentration in CHCl3.

         <title>Understanding the Reactivity of Diazaborinines towards the Activation of &#963;&#8208;Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Reactivity trends: The factors controlling the activation of the E&#8722;H &#963;&#8208;bonds promoted by diazaborinines have been computationally explored in detail. The crucial roles of aromaticity and the main orbital interactions on the reactivity of these main&#8208;group species are quantitatively revealed.







Abstract
The poorly understood factors governing the small molecule activation reactions mediated by diazaborinines have been computationally explored in detail using quantum chemical tools. To this end, the activation of E&#8722;H &#963;&#8208;bonds (E = H, C, Si, N, P, O, S) has been investigated. These reactions, which proceed in a concerted manner, are exergonic and, in general, associated with relatively low activation barriers. In addition, the barrier becomes lower for the E&#8722;H bonds involving the heavier element in the same group (&#916;G&#8800;: C&gt;Si; N&gt;P; O&gt;S). This reactivity trend together with the mode of action of the diazaborinine system are quantitatively analyzed by means of the activation strain model of reactivity in combination with the energy decomposition analysis method.

Catch&#8208;store&#8208;release: The industrially crucial, but thermally unstable, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) can be stabilized in the solid state by the formation of imidazolium&#8722;amidate linkages, and restored quantitatively by the application of CuI salts.







Abstract
4,4&#8242;&#8208;Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is an industrially crucial compound, being one of the most utilized linkers in the polyurethane industry. However, its long&#8208;term stability is limited due to dimerization to form insoluble uretdione. Herein we demonstrate an organometallic &#8220;catch&#8208;store&#8208;release&#8221; concept aiming at improving the long&#8208;term chemical stability of MDI. Treatment of MDI with two equivalents of selected N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) forms stable MDI&#8722;NHC adducts. Treatment of the adducts with CuCl forms metastable di&#8208;CuI complexes that undergo decomposition to re&#8208;form MDI (up to 85&#8201;%), along with Cu&#8722;NHC complexes. The yield of re&#8208;formed MDI can be improved (up to 95&#8201;%) by the release of the NHC ligands in the form of thiourea; this prevents subsequent MDI dimerization/polymerization by the carbenes. Furthermore, the need to separate MDI from the reaction mixture can be eliminated by the direct reaction of MDI&#8722;NHC complexes with alcohols (as models for diols), that form dicarbamate (as a model for polyurethane) quantitatively.

The selectivity of a donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA) formation towards epinephrine and an activated furfural moiety was exploited to generate a single&#8208;molecule colorimetric probe for the neurotransmitter epinephrine. An error&#8208;free detection of epinephrine among nine neurotransmitters was demonstrated. Quantitative prediction of epinephrine with high precision was carried out by using images and its analysis with machine&#8208;learning techniques.







Abstract
Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a neurotransmitter/hormone that is an important target in diagnostics. Development of an effective method for detecting it in the presence of other neurotransmitters is a challenging task. The electrochemical and fluorescent techniques commonly used have low selectivity in distinguishing among catecholamines. Herein, a small&#8208;molecule organic probe with an activated furfural moiety is reported to exploit the nucleophilicity of epinephrine to generate a bright&#8208;colored donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adduct. Among nine common neurotransmitters or their analogues, only epinephrine was found to generate a unique colour change discernible with the naked eye, whereas the other ones remain unaffected. Under various in&#8208;field detection conditions, including solution, droplet, and paper strip&#8208;based detection, the colour change were also noticeable. The low detection limit of 1.37&#8197;nM and a limit of quantitation of 4.37&#8197;nM were achieved with simple UV/Vis methods in addition to the sub&#8208;ppm level sensing under visual conditions with naked eyes. The probe could be used for practical colorimetric measurements as a point&#8208;of&#8208;care tool without any complex and expensive machinery, making this approach accessible to all. In addition, using a simple smartphone, the determination of epinephrine concentrations is possible by using machine&#8208;learning techniques.

         <title>Mechanisms of the Reaction of Elemental Sulfur and Polysulfides with Cyanide and Phosphines
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive mechanistic picture of the mechanisms of elemental sulfur and polysulfide decomposition is provided through Density Functional Theory calculations. Using cyanide and phosphines as prototypical nucleophiles, it is demonstrated that unimolecular decomposition and nucleophilic attack are the lowest&#8208;energy pathways involved in polysulfide reactivity.







Abstract
The reactions of elemental sulfur (S8) and polysulfides with nucleophiles are relevant to organic synthesis, materials science and biochemistry, but the mechanisms by which they operate are still unknown due to the inherent thermodynamic and kinetic instability of polysulfide intermediates. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the &#969;B97X&#8208;D/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pV(T+d)Z/SMD(MeCN) // &#969;B97X&#8208;D/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ/SMD(MeCN) level of theory, we studied the mechanisms behind the reaction of elemental sulfur and polysulfides with cyanide and phosphines, which quantitatively generate the monosulfide products thiocyanate and phosphine sulfides, respectively. All plausible pathways including nucleophilic decomposition, unimolecular decomposition, scrambling reactions, and attack on thiosulfoxides, have been considered to provide the first comprehensive mechanistic picture for this class of reactions. Overall, intramolecular cyclization is identified as the most favorable decomposition pathway for long polysulfides. For short polysulfides, a mixture of unimolecular decomposition, nucleophilic attack, and scrambling pathways can be expected.

         <title>Sidechain&#8208;Backbone Tetrel Bonding Interactions Provide a General Mechanism for trans&#8208;Peptoid Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sidechain&#8208;backbone nN&#8594;&#963;*C&#945;&#8722;N tetrel bonding interaction in azapeptoids wherein their sidechain &#945;&#8208;nitrogen lone pair (nN) is delocalized into the &#963;* orbital of the backbone C&#945;&#8722;N bond is shown. Such sidechain&#8208;backbone interactions can provide a general mechanism of trans&#8208;amide stabilization in peptoids having &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms and N&#8208;aryl groups in the sidechain.







Abstract
Cis&#8208;trans isomerization of amide bonds impedes de novo design of folded peptoids (poly&#8208;N&#8208;substituted glycines) with precise secondary structures and affects peptoid&#8208;biomolecule binding affinity. Herein, from X&#8208;ray, NMR and DFT studies of azapeptoids, we have discovered a tetrel bonding interaction that stabilizes trans&#8208;peptoids. We show that peptoids having &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms and N&#8208;aryl groups in the sidechain adopt trans&#8208;amide geometries due to the presence of a nX/&#960;Ar&#8594;&#963;*C&#945;&#8722;N tetrel bonding interaction between the sidechain &#945;&#8208;heteroatom lone pair (nX) or &#960;&#8208;electrons (&#960;Ar) and the &#963;* orbital of the backbone C&#945;&#8722;N bond. Further, CD spectroscopic studies of oligo&#8208;proline host&#8211;guest model peptides showed that azapeptoid residues stabilize polyproline II helical conformation. These data indicate that the sidechain&#8208;backbone tetrel bonding could be leveraged to design peptoids with precise secondary structures for a wide range of biological and material applications.

         <title>A pH&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Actuated Molecular Shuttle in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The grafting of small hydrophobic groups on a rigid, linear and pH&#8208;responsive guest molecule for CB[7] resulted in significant changes of binding modes. Modulation of pH or addition of Ag+ cations enabled (i) ring translocation, (ii) ring shuttling and (iii) control over host:guest stoichiometry.







Abstract
The structure of the Viologen&#8208;Phenylene&#8208;Imidazole (VPI) guest, previously shown to be bound by cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) with binding modes depending on pH and silver ions, has been extended by adding hydrophobic groups on the two extremities of VPI before investigations of CB[7] binding by NMR, ITC, X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectroscopies. With an imidazole station extended by a naphthalene group (VPI&#8208;N), binding modes of CB[7] are similar to those previously observed. However, with the viologen extended by a tolyl group (T&#8208;VPI), CB[7] preferentially sits on station T, shuttling between the T and P stations at acid pH or after Ag+ addition. The CB[7]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;T&#8208;VPI complex thus behaves as a metal&#8208;actuated thermodynamic stop&#8208;and&#8208;go molecular shuttle featured by fast and autonomous ring translocation between two stations and a continuum for fractional station occupancy solely and easily controlled by Ag+ concentration.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Detector of Two&#8208;Dimensional Multilayer Hybrid Perovskite Crystals Showing High Polarization Ratio to Weak Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compound (FPEA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 synthesized in this work possesses high polarization ratio (Imax/Imin=1.35) under weak light (330&#8197;nW/cm2). This work enriches the prospect of hybrid perovskite materials in weak light polarization sensitive detection.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskite materials have been widely used for polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection due to their fascinating optical and physical attributes. However, studies on those materials that enable strong polarized&#8208;light activities under a weak&#8208;light condition remain quite scarce. Here, by tailoring aromatic cation into 3D prototype, we have successfully obtained a new 2D hybrid perovskite, (FPEA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 (1, where FPEA is 4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium and MA is methylammonium). The alternative alignment of inorganic and organic structural components results in significant anisotropy, including optical absorption and electric conductivity. The coupling effect of these anisotropic properties in 1 gives rise to strong dichroic activities toward detecting polarized light. Especially, under weak light intensity (&#8764;330&#8197;nW/cm2), it can still generate a large polarization ratio up to 1.35, which is even higher than those of some typical 2D materials (i.&#8201;e., GeSe &#8764;1.09). Besides, single crystal&#8208;based photodetector of 1 displays fascinating detecting performances, including large photocurrent on/off ratio (&#8764;104), fast response time (&#8764;154/182&#8197;&#956;s) and excellent antifatigued stability. These findings disclose the potentials of 1 as a robust candidate for detecting weak polarized light, which has practical applications in the field of polarized optoelectronics.

Especially, under weak light intensity (&#8764;330&#8197;nW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), it can still generate a large polarization ratio up to 1.35, which is even higher than those of some typical 2D materials (&lt;i&gt;i.&#8201;e&lt;/i&gt;., GeSe &#8764;1.09). Besides, single crystal-based photodetector of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; displays fascinating detecting performances, including large photocurrent on/off ratio (&#8764;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), fast response time (&#8764;154/182&#8197;&#956;s) and excellent antifatigued stability. These findings disclose the potentials of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; as a robust candidate for detecting weak polarized light, which has practical applications in the field of polarized optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Stabilized Thiyl Radicals Design Inspired by Elemental Periodic Extension Notion for Ligand&#8208;Based Alkene Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical studies predict that osmium and technetium&#8208;stabilized thiyl radicals, [OsL3]+ and [TcL3]+/2+ (L = diphenylphosphinobenzenethiolate), having significant radical characters show ligand&#8208;centered reactivity toward alkene like their respective valence isoelectronic [RuL3]+ and [ReL3]+/2+, while neutral [TcL3], featuring little thiyl radical character, displays no reactivity like its valence isoelectronic [ReL3].







Abstract
Inspired by alkene addition to the Ru and Re tris(thiolate) complexes via carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation/cleavage reactions along with a periodic extension catalysis notion, a comparative study of the electronic structures, mechanisms, and reactivities for ethylene addition to the Os and Tc tris(thiolate) complexes was performed by DFT and high&#8208;level ab initio quantum calculations. The oxidized Os and Tc complexes were revealed to exhibit sufficient radical characters on the ligands to support their reaction with ethylene, whereas neutral Tc tris(thiolate) complex featuring little thiyl radical character renders no reactivity toward ethylene. Differential reactivities of these tris(thiolate) complexes was deemed to derive from the synergy of the thiyl radical character, the electronegativity, the row, and the charge. Extending from Ru and Re tris(thiolate) complexes to their Os and Tc counterparts can help us to get insightful rationales that would promote further research on alkene addition to metal&#8208;stabilized thiyl radicals.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction of Diynamides with Allylic Alcohols: A Versatile Platform to Allenamide, 2&#8208;Aminofuran and Bridged [2.2.2]Octadiene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of conjugated diynamides with allylic alcohols was described, which features divergent preparation of 2&#8208;aminofurans, allenamides and bridged [2.2.2]octadienes in high efficiency, complete atom economy. Given the fact that multi&#8208;bonds were constructed via single operation, this reaction represents a good example on the synthsis of value&#8208;added molecules by using readily available chemicals as starting materials.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed divergent synthesis through alternation of the catalyst is appealing, as it provides an operationally simple way to access different valuable products, while using the same reactants as starting materials. Herein, a gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of conjugated diynamides with allylic alcohols is described. By variation of the catalysts, substituted allenes and furans could be obtained selectively. Mechanistic studies indicate that, after the addition of allylic alcohol to gold&#8208;activated diynamide, a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement would take place and lead to the formation of a common reactive intermediate, which would further convert to the final products selectively. Further variation of the structure of diynamides has unveiled an additional reaction sequence involving intramolecular Himbert arene/allene Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition to afford a series of dearomatized products bearing bicyclo[2,2,2]octadiene core.

         <title>Oxidized Bridged Carbenoids as Viable Intermediates in a Fe(III) Catalyzed C&#8722;H Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using DFT calculations, we propose an Fe(III) bridged carbenoid species to be a key intermediate and not a dead&#8208;end in an Fe catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H insertion reaction. This study will provide the impetus to develop the underutilized Fe(III) complexes in carbene insertion reactions catalyzed by small molecules and enzymes.







Abstract
Fe catalyzed carbene insertion reactions present an efficient route for direct C&#8722;H functionalization. The use of Fe(III) in place of the widely used Fe(II) presents several benefits. However, the mechanistic understanding of Fe(III) severely lags behind Fe(II) complexes. One of the major unsolved issues relates to the formation of bridged versus terminal metallocarbenes. Even though the oxidized bridged carbenoid complexes have been isolated and found to be thermodynamically more stable, they are generally considered a dead end for the catalytic cycle. In the current report, the formation and the subsequent reactions of the bridged carbenoid complexes for an Fe(TPP)Cl catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H insertion are investigated. Using DFT calculations, it is observed that both mono and bis oxidized bridged carbenoid complexes can participate in the catalytic cycle. Importantly, for the first time, a mechanistic pathway showing that these bridged species are not a dead end in Fe catalysis is presented. Their existence in other reactions might be more prevalent than what is currently believed. The current study will have important implications in utilizing Fe(III) complexes for other insertion reactions, especially for heme containing enzymes which necessarily need to be carried out under anaerobic/reducing conditions.

         <title>Access to Benzo&#8208; and Naphtho&#8208;Azaphospholes via C&#8722;H Bond Activation of Aryl&#8208;Substituted Isonitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From activation to migration. Activation of a C&#8722;H bond of phenyl&#8208; and naphthyl&#8208;substituted isonitriles with heterocyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diylene represents a new method that allows the formation of benzo&#8208; and naphtho&#8208;azaphospholes. For this method, the absence of substituents in ortho&#8208;position of phenyl isonitriles is obligatory, but various substituents in other positions are tolerated. This aromatic substitution reaction can be strongly influenced by light and stoichiometry of the isonitrile used.







Abstract
Differently substituted phenyl isonitriles (with C&#8722;H bonds in ortho&#8208;position) and naphthyl isonitriles were reacted with the cyclic biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;N&#8208;Ter)2P&#8901;] (1). Insertion of the isonitrile formed a cyclic five&#8208;membered biradical [&#8901;P(NTer)2C(R)P&#8901;] (2R, R=phenyl, naphthyl) in the first step, followed by C&#8722;H activation at the aryl substituent, resulting in novel azaphospholes (5R), which could be isolated and fully characterized. The formation of the azaphospholes can be prevented by the addition of a second equivalent of isonitrile, which causes the blocking of the radical centers in 2R by adduct formation (3R). Quantum mechanical calculations showed that a significant increase in the aromaticity of the benzo&#8208; and naphtho&#8208;azaphospholes is one of the driving forces for the activation process leading to the formation of thermodynamically favored azaphospholes. Targeted activation of C&#8722;H bonds using biradical systems represents a new synthetic approach to generate benzo&#8208; and naphtho&#8208;azaphospholes.

         <title>Controlling Morphologies of Redox&#8208;Responsive Polymeric Nanocarriers for a Smart Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;responsive polymeric nanocarriers can transform their morphologies in redox&#8208;active cancerous environments. Here, the differences in the morphologies of polymeric nanocarriers according to their hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio, locations of redox&#8208;responsive functional groups, and redox states (level of oxidants/reductants) under different exposure conditions are reviewed. Moreover, encapsulated photosensitizers can generate excess oxidants, inducing spatiotemporally controlled nanocarrier morphology changes.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;responsive nanocarriers using disulfides or thiols have received considerable attention owing to the higher levels of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells than those in extracellular fluids. Nevertheless, the normal&#8208;to&#8208;cancer&#8208;cell selectivity of these nanocarriers has not yet been clarified. Nanocarriers exhibit different cytotoxicities depending on the morphologies they adopt under the redox&#8208;active conditions typically existing in cancerous cells. Therefore, not only GSH levels but also reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and other complex cancerous cell conditions must be considered for the development of smart drug delivery systems. In this article, we review the structural design of redox&#8208;responsive polymers that exhibit different morphological changes in environments akin to cancerous cells (e.&#8201;g., GSH&#8208; and ROS&#8208;abundant conditions). In addition, we propose a molecular design for the spatiotemporal control of nanocarrier morphology depending on the levels of both GSH and ROS upon photoirradiation to increase the cytotoxicity difference between normal and cancer cells.

         <title>An Intelligent Laser&#8208;Free Photodynamic Therapy Based on Endogenous miRNA&#8208;Amplified CRET Nanoplatform
</title>

         <dc:description>
Tumor biomarker&#8208;responsive theranostic holds great promise for precise medicine. Herein, a miRNA&#8208;amplified chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) nanoplatform was constructed for tumor&#8208;specific laser&#8208;free photodynamic therapy. It exhibited prominent on&#8208;demand in&#8197;vivo tumor inhibition effects, indicating an intelligent medicine.







Abstract
Laser&#8208;free photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising noninvasive therapeutic modality for deep&#8208;seated tumor, yet is constrained by low efficiency due to the limited stimulation strategies. Herein, a novel miRNA&#8208;responsive laser&#8208;free PDT was developed through metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;mediated chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) nanoplatform. The photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6)&#8208;loaded MOFs were functionalized with hairpin nucleic acids for sensitive responsiveness of tumor biomarker miRNA through catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA), which enabled the amplified assembly of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;mimicking hemin/G&#8208;quadruplex DNAzyme on MOFs. Simultaneously, the on&#8208;MOF assembled DNAzymes efficiently catalyzed chemiluminescence reaction to stimulate adjacent Ce6 in the presence of luminol and H2O2, thus allowing the CRET&#8208;mediated Ce6 luminescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for self&#8208;illuminating PDT. The CRET nanoplatform achieved significant malignant cell apoptosis and tumor inhibition effects without external laser irradiation. It is envisioned that the miRNA&#8208;amplified CRET nanoplatform might be a selective and highly efficient antitumor nanomedicine for precise theranostic.

         <title>Can NbO Keep nbo Topology under Electrons? &#8211;Unveiling Novel Aspects of Niobium Monoxide at the Atomic Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NbO was observed suffering a structural transition induced by e&#8208;beam irradiation. The structures of pristine, during transition and fully transformed NbO were studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy and density functional theory approaches. The results revealed a transition process from pristine Pm&#8208;3&#8197;m, through a structure of various occupancy formed by atoms migration, to a final stage, a Fm&#8208;3&#8197;m NaCl&#8208;type structure with 75&#8201;% occupancy.







Abstract
A precise investigation of NbO has been carried out by advanced electron microscopy combined with powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). The structure of pristine NbO has been determined as Pm&#8208;3&#8197;m space group (SG) with a = 4.211&#8197;&#197; and the positions of Nb and O at the 3c and 3d Wyckoff positions, respectively, which is consistent with previous report based on powder XRD data. Electron beams induced a structural transition, which was investigated and explained by combining electron diffraction and atomic&#8208;resolution imaging. The results revealed that the electron beam stimulated both Nb and O atom&#8208;migrations within each fcc sublattice, and that the final structure was SG Fm&#8208;3&#8197;m with a = 4.29&#8197;&#197;, Nb and O at the 4a and 4b with 75&#8201;% occupancy and same chemical composition. Antiphase planar defects were discovered in the pristine NbO and related to the structural transformation. Theoretical calculations performed by density functional theory (DFT) supported the experimental conclusions.

         <title>A Polymeric Unimolecular CO Dehydrogenase Mimic with both Inner and Outer Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), mimicking its inner and outer spheres is a promising strategy in CO2 reduction catalyst design. However, artificial&#160;CODH&#8208;like catalysts are generally limited to the inner sphere effect and only applicable in organic solvents or for electrocatalysis. Herein, we report an aqueous CODH mimic with both inner and outer spheres for photocatalysis. In this polymeric unimolecular catalyst, the inner sphere is composed of cobalt porphyrin with four appended amido groups and the outer sphere consists of four poly(2(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) arms. Upon visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 420 nm), the as&#8208;prepared photocatalyst exhibits a high turnover number (TONCO = 1731.2) in the reduction of CO2 into CO, which is superior to most reported molecular photocatalysts in aqueous solution. The mechanism studies indicate that, in this water&#8208;dispersible and structurally well&#8208;defined CODH mimic, the cobalt porphyrin core serves as the catalysis center, amido groups function as hydrogen&#8208;bonding pillars helping to stabilize the CO2 adduct intermediate, while PDMAEMA shell renders both the water solubility and a CO2 reservoir through reversibly capturing of CO2. The present work has clarified the significance of inner and outer coordination sphere effects for improving the aqueous photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of CODH mimics.</dc:description>

         <title>Antitumor Activity and Reductive Stress by Platinum(II) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes based on Guanosine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum(II) complexes bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes based guanosine and caffeine have been synthesized by unassisted C&#8208;H oxidative addition, leading to the corresponding trans&#8208;hydride complexes. Platinum guanosine derivatives bearing triflate as counterion or bromide instead of hydride as co&#8208;ligand were also synthesized to facilitate correlation between structure and activity. The hydride compounds show high antiproliferative activity against all cell lines (TC&#8208;71, MV&#8208;4&#8208;11, U&#8208;937 and A&#8208;172). Methyl Guanosine complex 3, bearing a hydride ligand, is up to 30 times more active than compound 4, with a bromide in the same position. Changing the counterion has no significant effect in antiproliferative activity. Increasing bulkiness at N7, with an isopropyl group (compound 6), allows to maintain the antiproliferative activity while decreasing toxicity for non&#8208;cancer cells. Compound 6 leads to an increase in endoplasmic reticulum and autophagy markers on TC71 and MV&#8208;4&#8208;11 cancer cells, induces reductive stress and increases glutathione levels in cancer cells but not in non&#8208;cancer cell line HEK&#8208;293.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear iron(II) triple helicates exhibiting room temperature spin transition behaviour in solid and solution phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, three dinuclear iron (II) helicates (complexes 1&#8208;3 ) have been synthesized using imidazole and pyridine&#8208;imine&#8208;based ligands having fluorene moiety in the backbone.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, three dinuclear iron (II) helicates (complexes 1-3 ) have been synthesized using imidazole and pyridine-imine-based ligands having fluorene moiety in the backbone.

         <title>18F&#8208;Labeling Chemistry in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>18F&#8208;Labeled molecular tracers and subsequent positron emission tomography are indispensable molecular imaging tools in medical diagnosis and research. In the preparation of 18F&#8208;labeled molecular tracers, the 18F&#8208;labeling reaction, attendant working&#8208;up and 18F&#8208;product purification are critical steps that are governed by 18F&#8208;labeling chemistry. Since direct incorporation of 18F in aqueous media exhibits many advantages in practice, this review summarizes the existing 18F&#8208;labeling methods in aqueous media, which are sorted by atoms forming chemical covalent bonds with F. We focused on the respective reaction mechanism, the water effect and the applications of these methods for the development of 18F&#8208;radiopharmaceuticals. The research progress on aqueous nucleophilic labeling methods using [18F]F&#8211; as the 18F source has been mainly discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Ultrahigh Surface Area of Covalently&#8208;linked Organic Framework for Boosted CO2 Capture: An Air Liquid Interfacial Plasma as Post&#8208;furnishing Protocol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cognitive intent of a highly ordered and robust adsorbent is extremely sensible and, in this context, Covalent Organic Framework (COF) materials have significantly burgeoned their scope in diverse applications. Herein, we present a simple time&#8208;competent hydrothermal procedure to construct a covalent framework with an ultrahigh surface area of 1428 m2/g that shows active adsorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) at variable temperature ranges. Moreover, we substantiate a facile scalably controlled post&#8208;synthetic air&#8208;liquid interfacial plasma (ALIP) induced protocol that explicitly amplifies the surface area of the pristine framework even to a higher value of 2051 m2/g. The post&#8208;synthetic plasma approach presented here led to the rapid enhancement of the surface area of the pristine COF by 43%, which concurrently advances the CO2 uptake up to 67%. Hence, the current study may open up a new frontier in the design as well as fine&#8208;tune the properties of the covalent framework that unfolds the advanced outlook in addressing the challenges of CO2 capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu2P7&#8208;CoP Heterostructure Nanosheets Enable High&#8208;Performance of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylicacid (FDCA) has been regarded as a promising sustainable approach to achieve value&#8208;added chemicals. However, it is still impeded by the unsatisfactory performance of electrocatalysts. Here, Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were reported to enable powerful HMF electrooxidation. The Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were fabricated by microwave&#8208;assisted deep eutectic solvent (DES) approach, along with subsequent phosphiding. The Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets enabled a superb 100% HMF conversion at 1.43 V (vs. RHE) with 98.8% FDCA yield and 98% Faradaic efficiency (FE), demonstrating its promising application in HMF electrooxidation. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, open&#8208;circuit potential (OCP) approach and density functional theory (DFT) calculation uncovered that the electron transfer and redistribution between Cu2P7 and CoP improved the adsorption capacity of HMF and modulated the catalytic performance. This study not only offered a powerful electrocatalyst for HMF electrooxidation, but also provided a conceptually new strategy for the heterostructure catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indigo, one of the most ancient and abundant dyes in human history, has recently emerged as a potential functional motif due to its intriguing photochemical properties. This review aims to provide insights into both the preparation of these molecules and their utilization in molecular systems. First, the synthesis of the indigo core as well as available methods to derivatize indigo are described to outline synthetic strategies to build the desired molecular structures. Then, the photochemical behavior of indigos is discussed, with particular focus on E&#8208;Z photoisomerization and photoinduced electron transfer. Connections between the molecular structures and their photochemical properties are highlighted and serve as guiding principles for designing indigos to be applied as photoresponsive tools.</dc:description>

Abstract
Skeletal editing via single&#8208;atom insertion reactions involving nitrogen heterocycles have been reported by two innovative and complementary methods for the conversion of pyrroles and indoles to pyridines, quinolines and quinazolines. The use of electrophilic carbonyl cation equivalents and in&#8197;situ generated nitrenes enables molecular editing to transform heterocycles forming the foundation of best&#8208;selling pharmaceuticals. Considering the importance of heterocycles in medicinal chemistry, biology and natural products, these methods offer innovative approach to complex molecular structures by heterocycle diversification and peripheral editing.

         <title>Organocatalytic Desymmetric Conjugate Addition to Cyclobutanone: An Enantio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of [6,5,4]&#8208;Fused Carbocycles</title>

The first organocatalytic desymmetrisation of 3&#8208;substituted cyclobutanone through intramolecular cyclisation. This study allowed us to access the architecturally fascinating [6,5,4]&#8208;fused carbocyclic skeleton with excellent selectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 96&#8201;% ee) and yields. Finally, high&#8208;value products like &#947;&#8208;lactone and indan&#8208;2&#8208;ol derivatives have been synthesised.







Abstract
The first organocatalytic, non&#8208;destructive desymmetrisation of 3&#8208;substituted cyclobutanone followed by intramolecular cyclisation is described. Owing to the slow activation of the pronucleophile by the weak Br&#248;nsted base, the &#945;&#8208;functionalization of ketones with tertiary&#8208;amine&#8208;derived Br&#248;nsted base catalysis has been chemically challenging in asymmetric transformations. Herein, we demonstrate that the cinchona&#8208;derived squaramide catalyst works effectively for the intramolecular Michael addition of cyclobutanone to enones and affords the architecturally fascinating [6,5,4]&#8208;fused carbocyclic skeleton in good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 96&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, as a synthetic application, this method provides an alternative pathway to enantioenriched high&#8208;value products like &#947;&#8208;lactones and indan&#8208;2&#8208;ol derivatives.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first organocatalytic, non-destructive desymmetrisation of 3-substituted cyclobutanone followed by intramolecular cyclisation is described. Owing to the slow activation of the pronucleophile by the weak Br&#248;nsted base, the &#945;-functionalization of ketones with tertiary-amine-derived Br&#248;nsted base catalysis has been chemically challenging in asymmetric transformations. Herein, we demonstrate that the cinchona-derived squaramide catalyst works effectively for the intramolecular Michael addition of cyclobutanone to enones and affords the architecturally fascinating [6,5,4]-fused carbocyclic skeleton in good yields and excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities (up to &amp;gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 &lt;i&gt;dr&lt;/i&gt; and 96&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;). Furthermore, as a synthetic application, this method provides an alternative pathway to enantioenriched high-value products like &#947;-lactones and indan-2-ol derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ligand Modulation of the Structures and Magnetic Relaxation in Triangular Dy3 Complexes Based on a Tricompartmental Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new tritopic hydrazone ligand provides a set of Dy3 complexes with similar overall topology but distinctly different binding modes of exogenous co&#8208;ligands, translating into very different magnetic properties. An energy barrier of &#8764;340&#8197;K and magnetic hysteresis up to 3.5&#8197;K are reached in the best case, and magnetostructural correlations are rationalised by ab initio calculations.







Abstract
Using a novel tricompartmental hydrazone ligand, a set of trinuclear Dy3 complexes has been isolated and structurally characterized. Complexes Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cl, Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Br, and Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClO4 feature a similar overall topology but different anions (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, or ClO4&#8722;) in combination with exogenous OH&#8722; and solvent co&#8208;ligands, which is found to translate into very different magnetic properties. Complex Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cl shows a double relaxation process with fast quantum tunneling of the magnetization, probably related to the structural disorder of &#956;2&#8208;OH&#8722; and &#956;2&#8208;Cl&#8722; co&#8208;ligands. Relaxation of the magnetization is slowed down for Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Br and Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClO4, which do not show any structural disorder. In particular, fast quantum tunneling is suppressed in case of Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClO4, resulting in an energy barrier of 341&#8197;K and magnetic hysteresis up to 3.5&#8197;K; this makes Dy3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ClO4 one of the most robust air&#8208;stable trinuclear SMMs. Magneto&#8208;structural relationships of the three complexes are analyzed and rationalized with the help of CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO calculations.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Sulfoxidation Catalyzed by a Photoswitchable Iron Salen Phosphate Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral iron(III) salen complex with a chiral photo&#8208;switchable phosphate counterion is reported for the sulfoxidation of alkenes in a stereoselective manner. Irradiation with light allows access to either enantiomer of the sulfoxide.







Abstract
Here we describe a photoswitchable iron(III) salen phosphate catalyst, which is able to catalyze the enantiodivergent oxidation of prochiral aryl alkyl sulfides to chiral aryl alkyl sulfoxides. The stable (S)&#8208;axial isomer of the catalyst produced enantioenriched sulfoxides with the (R)&#8208;configuration in up to 75&#8201;% e.e., whereas the photoisomerized metastable (R)&#8208;axial isomer of the catalyst favored the formation of (S)&#8208;sulfoxides in up to 43&#8201;% e.e. The maximum &#916;e.e. value obtained in the enantiodivergent sulfoxidation was 118&#8201;%, which is identical to the maximum &#916;e.e. value that was measured in the enantiodivergent epoxidation of alkenes by a related recently described Mn1 catalyst. This iron&#8208;based catalyst broadens the scope of photoswitchable enantiodivergent catalysts and may be used in the future to develop a photoswitchable catalytic system that can write digital information on a polymer chain in the form chiral sulfoxide functions.

         <title>Columnar Liquid Crystalline Glasses by Combining Configurational Flexibility with Moderate Deviation from Planarity: Extended Triaryltriazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three curved aryl arms attached by rotation&#8208;allowing single bonds to a triazine core, together with only short alkyl chains, lead to a glass transition that yields a solid alignable hexagonal columnar mesophase at room temperature.







Abstract
Triply phenanthryl&#8208; and tetrahelicenyl&#8208;substituted triazine&#8208;hexaalkyl esters with short alkyl chains show glass transitions conveniently above room temperature within the hexagonal columnar liquid crystalline state, resulting in a solid columnar order at room temperature. As the hexagonal columnar mesophase is easily aligned with the director perpendicular to a solid substrate, such glassy columnar liquid matrices are aimed at for the orientation of guest emitters, to obtain anisotropic emission. A condition for face&#8208;on alignment on substrates are attainable melting and clearing temperatures, which is achieved with the moderately nonplanar tetrahelicenyl derivatives in spite of their short alkyl periphery. An unusual phase transition between two columnar mesophases of same hexagonal symmetry, but very different long&#8208;distance regularity of the column lattice, is found in one phenanthryl homolog.

         <title>Conjugating Coumarin with Tetraphenylethylene to Achieve Dual&#8208;State Emission for Reversible Mechanofluorochromism and Live Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin&#8208;tetraphenylethylene&#8208;derived dual&#8208;state luminogens (DSEgens) with bright emission in both dilute solutions and the solid state have been synthesized by finely tuning electronic structures and molecular conformations. Experimental results suggest that a favorable electron transfer within the highly twisting molecules is essential for the DSE properties. The DSEgens were demonstrated applicable as dual&#8208;state probes for reversible mechanofluorochromism and live cell imaging.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;state emission luminogens (DSEgens) are receiving research interest in the construction of multifunctional materials due to their inherent advantage of high emission efficiency in both the molecularly dispersed solution state and the solid state. However, it remains challenging in synthesizing DSEgens via a delicate manipulation of the molecular structures. This work presents an example of bright DSEgen synthesis by tuning the molecular electronic structures and conformations. Three coumarin&#8208;tetraphenylethylene (TPE) molecules with a donor&#8208;acceptor electronic structure and highly twisting conformations have been synthesized. While compound resulting from direct conjugation of coumarin with a TPE unit shows aggregation&#8208;induced emission, compound with an N,N&#8208;diaminoethyl modification on the 7&#8208;position of coumarin and compound with a further phenyl linker between coumarin and TPE units feature strong dual&#8208;state emission. Benefiting from their strong solid emission and twisting conformations, these fluorophores display reversible mechanofluorochromism. Finally, applications for rewritable information storage in the solid state and live&#8208;cell imaging in the solution state were demonstrated.

         <title>Cumulative Effect of pH and Redox Triggers on Highly Adaptive Transient Coacervates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodal transience. A highly adaptive coacervate is reported that can be formed transiently under the influence of two different triggers, pH and redox. The cumulative effect of both triggers results in the coacervation and the transient cycles can be operated sequentially for multiple cycles.







Abstract
An intricate synergism between multiple biochemical processes and physical conditions determines the formation and function of various biological self&#8208;assemblies. Thus, a complex set of variables dictate the far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium nature of these biological assemblies. Mimicking such systems synthetically is a challenging task. We report multi&#8208;stimuli responsive transient coacervation of an aldehyde&#8208;appended polymer and a short peptide. The coacervates are formed by the disulphide linkages between the peptide molecules and the imine bond between the polymer and the peptide. Imines are susceptible to pH changes and the disulphide bonds can be tuned by oxidation/reduction processes. Thus, the coacervation is operational only under the combined effect of appropriate pH and oxidative conditions. Taking advantage of these facts, the coacervates are transiently formed under a pH cycle (urea&#8208;urease/gluconolactone) and a non&#8208;equilibrium redox cycle (TCEP/H2O2). Importantly, the system showed high adaptability toward environmental changes. The transient existence of the coacervates can be generated without any apparent change in size and shape within the same system through the sequential application of the above&#8208;mentioned nonequilibrium reaction cycles. Additionally, the coacervation allows for efficient encapsulation/stabilisation of proteins. Thus, the system has the potential to be used for protein/drug delivery purposes in the future.

         <title>An Atropisomerism Study of Large Cycloarylenes: [n]Cyclo&#8208;4,10&#8208;Pyrenylenes&#8217; Case</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclo&#8208;4,10&#8208;pyrenylenes of various ring sizes were obtained by coupling reactions at the 5,9&#8208;diiodo&#8208;pyrene. Since systematic studies of macrocyclic atropisomerization dependent on their ring&#8208;size remain challenging, these large cycloarylenes from 6mer to 8mer were investigated as illustrative examples according to simple assumptions.







Abstract
An atropisomerism of large cycloarylenes was studied using [n]cyclo&#8208;4,10&#8208;pyrenylenes (n=6&#8211;21) as an illustrative example with two simple assumptions: (1) alternating configurations (R,S,R,S,&#8230;) are thermodynamically most stable, and (2) three consecutive identical configurations (R,R,R or S,S,S) are prevented. Ni&#8208;mediated coupling of a 5,9&#8208;diiodopyrene gave a series of directly&#8208;linked cyclic pyrene oligomers in one&#8208;pot reaction. As&#8208;synthesized cyclic hexamer was assigned as an (R,S,S,R,R,S) structure, converted into an (R,S,R,S,R,S)&#8208;form upon heating. Cyclic heptamer consists of two types of C2 symmetric structures predicted from assumption (2), one of which was convergent to one another by heating. Three atropisomers of cyclic octamer were analyzed from the possible five candidates by means of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the conversion process to (R,S,R,S,R,S,R,S) configurations upon heating was investigated. In total, according to two simple rules, the analysis of atropisomerism could be performed smoothly.

         <title>Thiophosphinoyl&#8208;Tethered Ylide&#8208;Substituted Heavier Carbenes: Synthesis, Structures and Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and structure analysis of a series of mono and diylide&#8208;substituted tetrylenes of type YEX and Y2E (E=Ge, Sn, Pb; X=Cl or Br) with a thiophosphosphinoyl&#8208;tethered ylide is reported. Their relative stabilities were determined by ylide transfer reactions and the first unsymmetrical heavier diylidylcarbenes accessed from chloro(ylidyl)tetrylenes.







Abstract
The synthesis and structure analysis of a series of mono and diylide&#8208;substituted tetrylenes of type YEX and Y2E (E=Ge, Sn, Pb; X=Cl or Br) using a thiophosphinoyl&#8208;tethered metallated ylide (Y=Ph2P(S)&#8722;C&#8722;P(pip)Ph2 with pip=piperidyl) is reported, amongst the first ylide&#8208;substituted plumbylenes. The tetrylenes feature distinct trends in the spectroscopic and structural properties of the ylide ligand with increasing atomic number of the tetrel element. For instance, an increasingly high&#8208;field shifted signal for the thiophosphinoyl group is observed in the 31P{1H}&#8197;NMR spectrum as a consequence of the increasing polarity of the element&#8208;carbon bond, which likewise results in a shortening of the ylidic C&#8722;P bond in the solid&#8208;state structure. The diylidyltetrylenes are unstable towards transylidation forming the mono(ylide)tetrylenes when treated with the tetrel dihalides according to the stability trend: Y2Pb&lt;Y2Sn&lt;Y2Ge&lt;YPbBr&lt;YSnCl&lt;YGeCl. Starting from the monoylide&#8208;substituted chlorotertrylenes the first unsymmetrical diylidyltetrylenes of type YEY&#8217; can be accessed, whose solid&#8208;state structures revealed that not the C&#8722;E but the S&#8722;E bond to the thiophosphinoyl group is most affected by the second ylide substituent.

Nanopalladium on cellulose catalyzes hydroborations: A highly efficient and stereoselective heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of enallenes was developed. Nanopalladium immobilized on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was successfully employed as an efficient catalyst for the enallene hydroboration reaction. The cellulose&#8208;supported palladium catalyst exhibits high stability and recyclability, providing vinyl boron products in good to high isolated yields (up to 90&#8201;%).







Abstract
A highly efficient regio&#8208; and stereoselective heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of enallenes was developed. Nanopalladium immobilized on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was successfully employed as an efficient catalyst for the enallene hydroboration reaction. The nanopalladium particles were shown by HAADF&#8208;STEM to have an average size of 2.4&#8197;nm. The cellulose&#8208;supported palladium catalyst exhibits high stability and provides vinyl boron products in good to high isolated yields (up to 90&#8201;%). The nanopalladium catalyst can be efficiently recycled and it was demonstrated that the catalyst can be used in 7 runs with a maintained high yield (&gt;80&#8201;%). The vinylboron compounds prepared from enallenes are important synthetic intermediates that can be used in various organic synthetic transformations.

         <title>Computational Evidence of the Incipient Oxocarbenium Ion as a &#8220;Hidden Intermediate&#8221; During the Cyclization of Hydroxyenol Ether into Spiroketal Under Mild Acidic Condition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclization reaction of the hydroxyl enol ether to spiroketals is a &#8220;one step, two stage&#8221; reaction involving hidden oxocarbenium ion intermediate.







Abstract
The synthesis of spiroketals has gained attention because of their importance in chemical and biological reactions. Yet, the mechanistic investigation of mild acid&#8208;catalyzed spiroketalization remains elusive and less explored in the literature and speculated that such transformations may proceed through the oxocarbenium ion intermediate; however, the existence of such species in mild acid&#8208;catalyzed spiroketalization is not documented. The computational study has been performed at M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;31+G(d) level to examine the kinetically controlled product formation for such reactions and the intrinsic reaction coordinates of 1&#8201;d suggest that the reaction proceeds via a &#8220;one&#8208;step, two&#8208;stage&#8221; mechanism with the formation of transient oxocarbenium as a &#8220;hidden intermediate&#8221; in the reaction. This study reveals that stereoelectronic interactions devoid the formation of stable oxocarbenium ion intermediate after the proton transfer transition state in the mild acid catalyzed spiroketalization process.

         <title>Insights into the Conformational Plasticity of the Protein Kinase Akt1 by Multi&#8208;Lateral Dipolar Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformational flexibility between the pleckstrin homology (PH) and kinase domain of the kinase Akt1 was investigated using multilateration of double electron resonance spectroscopy (DEER) distance restraints. Detailed structural data of wild&#8208;type Akt1 and the cancer&#8208;associated E17K mutation in the apo and ligand&#8208;bound states are presented, yielding deep insights into the conformational plasticity of Akt1.







Abstract
The serine/threonine kinase Akt1 is part of the PI3&#8197;K/Akt pathway and plays a key role in the regulation of various cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Here, we analyzed the elasticity between the two domains of the kinase Akt1, connected by a flexible linker, recording a wide variety of distance restraints by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We studied full length Akt1 and the influence of the cancer&#8208;associated mutation E17K. The conformational landscape in the presence of different modulators, like different types of inhibitors and membranes was presented, revealing a tuned flexibility between the two domains, dependent on the bound molecule.

         <title>Evaluation by Experimentation and Simulation of a FRET Pair Comprising Fluorescent Nucleobase Analogs in Nucleosomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>

Minimal modification and orientation dependency: Nucleobase FRET pair was incorporated into nucleosome and its ability was examined by experimentation and simulation. Experimental and theoretical FRET efficiencies showed similar trends suggesting orientation dependency of the FRET pair.







Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is an attractive tool for understanding biomolecular dynamics. FRET&#8208;based analysis of nucleosomes has the potential to fill the knowledge gaps between static structures and dynamic cellular behaviors. Compared with typical FRET pairs using bulky fluorophores introduced by flexible linkers, fluorescent nucleoside&#8208;based FRET pair has great potential since it can be fitted within the helical structures of nucleic acids. Herein we report on the construction of nucleosomes containing a nucleobase FRET pair and the investigation of experimental and theoretical FRET efficiencies through steady&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy and calculation based on molecular dynamics simulations, respectively. Distinguishable experimental FRET efficiencies were observed depending on the positions of FRET pairs in nucleosomal DNA. The tendency could be supported by theoretical study. This work suggests the possibility of our approach to analyze structural changes of nucleosomes by epigenetic modifications or internucleosomal interactions.

         <title>Electrophotochemical Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Decarboxylative Cyanation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and efficient electrophotochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol is developed for the direct conversion of readily available aliphatic carboxylic acids into chiral alkyl nitriles. Electrophotochemical Ce catalysis enables mild reaction conditions for radical decarboxylation to produce alkyl radicals, which could be effectively intercepted by asymmetric electrochemical Cu catalysis for the construction of C&#8722;CN bonds in a highly stereoselective manner.







Abstract
In contrast to the rapid growth of electrophotocatalysis in recent years, enantioselective catalytic reactions powered by this unique methodology remain rare. In this work, we report an electrophotochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol for direct asymmetric decarboxylative cyanation of aliphatic carboxylic acids. The synergistic merging of electrophotochemical cerium catalysis and asymmetric electrochemical copper catalysis permits mild reaction conditions for the formation and utilization of the key carbon centered radicals by combining the power of light and electrical energy. Electrophotochemical cerium catalysis enables radical decarboxylation to produce alkyl radicals, which could be effectively intercepted by asymmetric electrochemical copper catalysis for the construction of C&#8722;CN bonds in a highly stereoselective fashion. This environmentally benign method smoothly converts a diverse array of arylacetic acids into the corresponding alkyl nitriles in good yields and enantioselectivities without using chemical oxidants or pre&#8208;functionalization of the acid substrates and can be readily scaled up.

         <title>The Full Cytosine&#8208;Cytosine Base Paring: Self&#8208;Assembly and Crystal Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual multiple cytosine&#8208;cytosine base paring pattern (named full C&#8201;:&#8201;C base pairing) and i&#8208;motif structure in self assembly complexes induced by the regulation of solvent condition and pH values.







Abstract
The synthesis of self&#8208;assembly systems that can mimic partial biological behaviours require ingenious and delicate design. For decades, scientists are committed to exploring new base pairing patterns using hydrogen bonds directed self&#8208;assembly of nucleotides. A fundamental question is the adaptive circumstance of the recognition between base pairs, namely, how solvent conditions affect the domain of base pairs. Towards this question, three nucleotide complexes based on 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (dCMP) and cytidine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (CMP) were synthesized in different solvents and pH values, and an unusual cytosine&#8208;cytosine base paring pattern (named full C&#8201;:&#8201;C base pairing) has been successfully obtained. Systematic single crystal analysis and 1H NMR titration spectra have been performed to explore factors influencing the formation of base paring patterns. Moreover, supramolecular chirality of three complexes were studied using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in solution and solid&#8208;state combined with crystal structure analysis.

         <title>Double Addition vs. Ring Closure: Systematic Reactivity Study of CO(NCO)2 and CO(NCS)2 towards Hydrogen Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>

Carbonyl diisocyanate, CO(NCO)2, and carbonyl diisothiocyanate, CO(NCS)2, react differently with hydrogen halides HF, HCl, HBr and HI: Whereas carbonyl diisocyanate adds two equivalents thus forming carbonyl bis(carbamoylhalides), carbonyl diisothiocyanate only adds one equivalent and undergoes intramolecular ring closure, resulting in the formation of substituted thiadiazines.







Abstract
The reactivity of carbonyl diisocyanate, CO(NCO)2, and carbonyl diisothiocyanate, CO(NCS)2 with nucleophiles shows different patterns: Whereas carbonyl diisocyanate adds two equivalents of nucleophile forming carbonyl bis(carbamoylhalides), carbonyl diisothiocyanate only adds one equivalent and undergoes intramolecular ring closure, resulting in the formation of substituted thiadiazines. In this study we have reacted both carbonyl diisocyanate and carbonyl diisothiocyanate with the full series of hydrogen halides HF to HI, isolating carbonyl bis(carbamoylfluoride) (1), &#8208;chloride (2), &#8208;bromide (3), and &#8208;iodide (4) as well as (6&#8208;chloro&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;thioxo&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one (5), and 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;thioxo&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one (6). The compounds were analysed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, IR and Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Quantum mechanical calculations show thermodynamic reasons for the differences in reactivity.

         <title>Bringing Machine&#8208;Learning Enhanced Quantum Chemistry and Microwave Spectroscopy to Conformational Landscape Exploration: the Paradigmatic Case of 4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Threonine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>

Fluorinated &#945;&#8208;amino acids have been attracting increasing attention, but their structure in the gas&#8208;phase has not been investigated yet. Fluorination has a negligible impact on steric properties, but has a dramatic effect on the electronic properties. 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;threonine has been efficiently synthesized in large amount and its conformational landscape has been disentangled through a combination of experiment and theory beyond the state of the art.







Abstract
A combined experimental and theoretical study has been carried out on 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;threonine, the only naturally occurring fluorinated amino acid. Fluorination of the methyl group significantly increases the conformational complexity with respect to the parent amino acid threonine. The conformational landscape has been characterized in great detail, with special attention given to the inter&#8208;conversion pathways between different conformers. This led to the identification of 13 stable low&#8208;energy minima. The equilibrium population of so many conformers produces a very complicated and congested rotational spectrum that could be assigned through a strategy that combines several levels of quantum chemical calculations with the principles of machine learning. Twelve conformers out of 13 could be experimentally characterized. The results obtained from the analysis of the intra&#8208;molecular interactions can be exploited to accurately model fluorine&#8208;substitution effects in biomolecules.

         <title>Broad&#8208;scope Syntheses of [11C/18F]Trifluoromethylarenes from Aryl(mesityl)iodonium Salts</title>

Treatment of aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts with 11C or 18F&#8208;labeled copper CF3 gives broad scope rapid and high yield access to radiolabled aryl trifluoromethyl arenes for PET imaging applications







Abstract
Efficient methods for labeling aryl trifluoromethyl groups to provide novel radiotracers for use in biomedical research with positron emission tomography (PET) are keenly sought. We report a broad&#8208;scope method for labeling trifluoromethylarenes with either carbon&#8208;11 (t1/2=20.4&#8197;min) or fluorine&#8208;18 (t1/2=109.8&#8197;min) from readily accessible aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts. In this method, the aryl(mesityl)iodonium salt is treated rapidly with no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [11C]CuCF3 or [18F]CuCF3. The mesityl group acts as a spectator allowing radiolabeled trifluoromethylarenes to be obtained with very high chemoselectivity. Radiochemical yields from aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts bearing either electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at meta&#8208; or para&#8208; position are good to excellent (67&#8211;96&#8201;%). Ortho&#8208;substituted and otherwise sterically hindered trifluoromethylarenes still give good yields (15&#8211;34&#8201;%). Substituted heteroaryl(mesityl)iodonium salts are also viable substrates. The broad scope of this method was further exemplified by labeling a previously inaccessible target, [11C]p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl boronic acid, as a potentially useful labeling synthon. In addition, fluoxetine, leflunomide, and 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;4&#8208;aminopyridine, as examples of small drug&#8208;like molecules and candidate PET radioligands, were successfully labeled in high yields (69&#8211;81&#8201;%).

         <title>Effective SrWO4/TiO2 Heterojunction with Enhanced Carriers Separation and Transfer for Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly effective SrWO4/TiO2 heterojunction photocatalysts were fabricated for photocatalytic methane oxidation into oxygenates with O2 under mild conditions. The high&#8208;speed transfer channel between SrWO4 and TiO2 on SrWO4/TiO2 photocatalysts promoted separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, which enhanced the generation of oxygenates with high selectivity.







Abstract
Photocatalytic methane oxidation to oxygenates with promising performance remains as a grand challenge due to the low productivity and severe overoxidation. Herein, SrWO4/TiO2 heterojunction was developed for photocatalytic methane oxidation with O2 to liquid oxygenates ( Please replace &#8220;oxygenates&#8221; with &#8220;oxygenated&#8221;)products under mild reaction conditions. The optimized SrWO4/TiO2 catalyst exhibited high productivity of 13365&#8197;&#956;mol/g with high selectivity of 98.7&#8197;% for oxygenates. Benefited from the intimate heterojunction interface of SrWO4/TiO2, the constructed I&#8208;type heterostructure improved the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, and a high&#8208;speed transfer channel for photogenerated carriers was fabricated. Simultaneously, the special band structure can increase the amount of photogenerated electrons and holes on the TiO2 surface, which promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species to enhance liquid oxygenates productivity.

         <title>Defects&#8208;Abundant Ga2O3 Nanobricks Enabled Multifunctional Solid Polymer Electrolyte for Superior Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Defects&#8208;abundant Ga2O3 nanobricks were applied as multifunctional fillers to construct a PEO&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. Due to the multifunctional feature of Ga2O3 filler, this composite electrolyte not only broadens the electrochemical stability window but also improved the ionic conductivity and thereby attaining a superior rate capability.







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes with good flexibility and viscoelasticity, low interfacial resistance, and fabricating cost have caught worldwide attention, but their practical application is still hampered by the instability at high voltages and the low ionic conductivity (10&#8722;8 to 10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). Herein, we rationally designed defects&#8208;abundant Ga2O3 nanobricks as multifunctional fillers and constructed a PEO&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. Due to the abundant O&#8208;defects feature of Ga2O3 filler, this PEO&#8208;based composite electrolyte not only broadens electrochemical stability window (over 5.3&#8197;V versus Li/Li+) but also in&#8197;situ forms a Li&#8211;Ga alloy and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film during the cycling process causing a rapid diffusion of Li+ ions. The as&#8208;prepared electrolyte has good interface compatibility with Li metal (without short&#8208;circuiting over 500&#8197;h at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and possesses superior high ionic conductivity. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4//Li cells attained an excellent cycling performance of 146&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. The XPS analysis reveals that Ga2O3 nanobricks can form in&#8197;situ a Li&#8722;Ga alloy layer at the polymer/anode interface. This work shed a light on designing high ionic conductivity lithium alloys in the composite electrolyte, which can improve the electrochemical properties of PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolytes.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution of CrOx/Rh Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>

Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Rh nanoparticles (RhNP) was investigated as a model cocatalyst system for photocatalytic water splitting. A 2&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ultrathin CrOx layer on RhNP (CrOx/RhNP) significantly improves HER activity. DC and AC electrochemical measurements revealed that a CrOx/RhNP facilitates the electron transfer process on HER, and H+ reaches the RhNP surface via the H+&#8208;hopping process inside the CrOx layer.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of Rh nanoparticles (RhNP) coated with an ultrathin layer of Cr&#8208;oxides (CrOx) was investigated as a model electrode for the Cr2O3/Rh&#8208;metal core&#8208;shell&#8208;type cocatalyst system for photocatalytic water splitting. The CrOx layer was electrodeposited over RhNP on a transparent conductive fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. The CrOx layer on RhNP facilitates the electron transfer process at the CrOx/RhNP interface, leading to the increased current density for the HER. Impedance spectroscopic analysis revealed that the CrOx layer transferred protons via the hopping mechanism to the RhNP surface for HER. In addition, CrOx restricted electron transfer from the FTO to the electrolyte and/or RhNP and suppressed the backward reaction by limiting oxygen migration. This study clarifies the crucial role of the ultrathin CrOx layer on nanoparticulate cocatalysts and provides a cocatalyst design strategy for realizing efficient photocatalytic water splitting.

         <title>Secondary Orbital Effect Involving Fluorine is Responsible for Substrate&#8208;Controlled Diastereodivergence in the Catalyzed syn&#8208;aza&#8208;Henry Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Fluoronitroalkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evidence for a secondary orbital interaction between fluorine and a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;activated azomethine (C=N) is found to be a driving force for fluorine&#8208;induced diastereodivergence observed in a rare syn&#8208;selective aza&#8208;Henry reaction. This study examines BAM catalysis in detail, but the phenomenon is expected to be more general given similar observations in enantioselective phase transfer catalysis.







Abstract
The fluorine atom is a powerful, yet enigmatic influence on chemical reactions. True to form, fluorine was recently discovered to effect diastereodivergence in an enantioselective aza&#8208;Henry reaction, resulting in a very rare case of syn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino nitroalkane products. More bewildering was the observation of an apparent hierarchy of substituents within this substrate&#8208;controlled behavior: Ph&gt;F&gt;alkyl. These cases have now been examined comprehensively by computational methods, including both non&#8208;fluorinated and &#945;&#8208;fluoro nitronate additions to aldimines catalyzed by a chiral bis(amidine) [BAM] proton complex. This study revealed the network of non&#8208;covalent interactions that dictate anti&#8208; (&#945;&#8208;aryl) versus syn&#8208;selectivity (&#945;&#8208;alkyl) using &#945;&#8208;fluoronitronate nucleophiles, and an underlying secondary orbital interaction between fluorine and the activated azomethine.

Local interactions: Study of dioxygen binding and 2OG coordination by using two model 2OG enzymes &#8211; a class&#8197;7 histone demethylase (PHF8) and the ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE) &#8211; showing the role played by the protein environment in dioxygen transport and how the binding mode of dioxygen in the iron center is affected by SCS interactions.







Abstract
This study investigates dioxygen binding and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) coordination by two model non&#8208;heme FeII/2OG enzymes: a class&#8197;7 histone demethylase (PHF8) that catalyzes the hydroxylation of its H3K9me2 histone substrate leading to demethylation reactivity and the ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE), which catalyzes two competing reactions of ethylene generation and substrate l&#8208;Arg hydroxylation. Although both enzymes initially bind 2OG by using an off&#8208;line 2OG coordination mode, in PHF8, the substrate oxidation requires a transition to an in&#8208;line mode, whereas EFE is catalytically productive for ethylene production from 2OG in the off&#8208;line mode. We used classical molecular dynamics (MD), quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) MD and QM/MM metadynamics (QM/MM&#8208;MetD) simulations to reveal that it is the dioxygen binding process and, ultimately, the protein environment that control the formation of the in&#8208;line FeIII&#8208;OO&#8901;&#8722; intermediate in PHF8 and the off&#8208;line FeIII&#8208;OO&#8901;&#8722; intermediate in EFE.

BODIPY&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor dyads are widely used as sensors and probes in life science. Their biophysical properties have been well investigated in solutions, in which the photochemical and photophysical properties of these BODIPY dyads vary significantly in different environments. However, their photophysical properties in cellulo are generally understood less. To address this issue, the photoinduced dynamics of BODIPY derivatives were elucidated in live human cancer cells using sub&#8208;ns time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
BODIPY&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor dyads are widely used as sensors and probes in life science. Thus, their biophysical properties are well established in solution, while their photophysical properties in cellulo, i.&#8201;e., in the environment, in which the dyes are designed to function, are generally understood less. To address this issue, we present a sub&#8208;ns time&#8208;resolved transient absorption study of the excited&#8208;state dynamics of a BODIPY&#8208;perylene dyad designed as a twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) probe of the local viscosity in live cells.

BODIPY heterochromophores, unsymmetrically substituted with perylene and/or iodine at the 2 and 6 positions are prepared and investigated as sensitizers for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation up conversion (TTA&#8208;UC).







Abstract
BODIPY heterochromophores, asymmetrically substituted with perylene and/or iodine at the 2 and 6 positions were prepared and investigated as sensitizers for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation up conversion (TTA&#8208;UC). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses show that the torsion angle between BODIPY and perylene units lie between 73.54 and 74.51, though they are not orthogonal. Both compounds show intense, charge transfer absorption and emission profiles, confirmed by resonance Raman spectroscopy and consistent with DFT calculations. The emission quantum yield was solvent dependent but the emission profile remained characteristic of CT transition across all solvents explored. Both BODIPY derivatives were found to be effective sensitizers of TTA&#8208;UC with perylene annihilator in dioxane and DMSO. Intense anti&#8208;Stokes emission was observed, and visible by eye from these solvents. Conversely, no TTA&#8208;UC was observed from the other solvents explored, including from non&#8208;polar solvents such as toluene and hexane that yielded brightest fluorescence from the BODIPY derivatives. In dioxane, the power density plots obtained were strongly consistent with TTA&#8208;UC and the power density threshold, the Ith value (the photon flux at which 50&#8201;% of &#934;TTAUC is achieved), for B2PI was observed to be 2.5x lower than of B2P under optimal conditions, an effect ascribed to the combined influence of spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) and heavy metal on the triplet state formation for B2PI.

         <title>Mesoporous CuFe2O4 Photoanodes for Solar Water Oxidation: Impact of Surface Morphology on the Photoelectrochemical Properties
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic comparison of distinct surface morphologies of sol&#8208;gel&#8208;derived CuFe2O4 for solar water splitting shows that high&#8208;surface&#8208;area photoelectrodes are preferred for driving thermodynamically favorable reactions, such as sulfite oxidation, while lower surface area photoabsorbers are beneficial for driving thermodynamically uphill processes like the water oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Metal oxide&#8208;based photoelectrodes for solar water splitting often utilize nanostructures to increase the solid&#8208;liquid interface area. This reduces charge transport distances and increases the photocurrent for materials with short minority charge carrier diffusion lengths. While the merits of nanostructuring are well established, the effect of surface order on the photocurrent and carrier recombination has not yet received much attention in the literature. To evaluate the impact of pore ordering on the photoelectrochemical properties, mesoporous CuFe2O4 (CFO) thin film photoanodes were prepared by dip&#8208;coating and soft&#8208;templating. Here, the pore order and geometry can be controlled by addition of copolymer surfactants poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(propylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) (Pluronic&#174; F&#8208;127), polyisobutylene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) (PIB&#8208;PEO) and poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butylene)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) (Kraton liquid&#8482;&#8208;PEO, KLE). The non&#8208;ordered CFO showed the highest photocurrent density of 0.2&#8197;mA/cm2 at 1.3&#8197;V vs. RHE for sulfite oxidation, but the least photocurrent density for water oxidation. Conversely, the ordered CFO presented the best photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance. These differences can be understood on the basis of the high surface area, which promotes hole transfer to sulfite (a fast hole acceptor), but retards oxidation of water (a slow hole acceptor) due to electron&#8208;hole recombination at the defective surface. This interpretation is confirmed by intensity&#8208;modulated photocurrent (IMPS) and vibrating Kelvin probe surface photovoltage spectroscopy (VKP&#8208;SPS). The lowest surface recombination rate was observed for the ordered KLE&#8208;based mesoporous CFO, which retains spherical pore shapes at the surface resulting in fewer surface defects. Overall, this work shows that the photoelectrochemical energy conversion efficiency of copper ferrite thin films is not just controlled by the surface area, but also by surface order.

         <title>Photoluminescent Properties and Mechanism of Novel Cyanine&#8208;Borondifluoride Curcuminoid Hybrids as Red&#8208;to&#8208;Near Infrared and Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeting Dyes</title>

Seeing red: A series of cyanine&#8208;borondifluoride curcuminoid hybrids called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes have been obtained as novel red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores with ER self&#8208;targeting capability. Their photoluminescent properties and mechanism have been revealed.







Abstract
Synthesis&#8208;oriented design led us to the discovery of a series of novel cyanine&#8208;borondifluoride curcuminoid hybrids called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes that overcome the intrinsic low synthetic yields of symmetrical cyanine&#8208;difluoroboronate (BF2)&#8208;hybridized NIR dyes. The hybridization endows NCR dyes with high molar extinction coefficients, efficient red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emission, and enlarged Stokes shifts. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the asymmetrical layout of the three key electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating fragments results in a special pattern of partial charge separation and inconsistent degrees of charge delocalization on their &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones. While the nature of the hemicyanine fragment exerts significant influence on the excitation modes of NCR dyes, the borondifluoride hemicurcuminoid fragment is the major contributor to the enlarged Stokes shifts. Cell imaging experiments illustrated that a subtle change in the N&#8208;heterocycle of the hemicyanine fragment has a remarkable effect on the subcellular localization of NCR dyes. Unlike other previously reported cyanine&#8208;BF2 hybridized dyes, which mainly target mitochondria, the benzothiazole and indole&#8208;based NCR dyes accumulate in both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets of HeLa cells, whereas the benzoxazole and quinoline&#8208;based NCR dyes stain the ER specifically.

Three times the fun! The synthesis and characterisation of NHC&#8208;stabilised parent tripentelyltrielanes IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;E(PnH2)3 (E=Al, Ga; Pn=P, As) and triphosphanylindiumane IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;In(PH2)3 are presented (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), which were obtained by triple salt metathesis from IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ECl3 and alkali metal pnictogenides. Coordination towards (HgC6F4)3 gave evidence of a first coordination compound.







Abstract
A missing family of the extremely air sensitive tripentelyltrielanes was discovered. Their stabilisation was achieved by using the bulky NHC IDipp (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). The tripentelylgallanes and tripentelylalanes IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Ga(PH2)3 (1&#8201;a), IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Ga(AsH2)3 (1&#8201;b), IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Al(PH2)3 (2&#8201;a) and IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Al(AsH2)3 (2&#8201;b) were synthesised by salt metathesis of IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ECl3 (E=Al, Ga, In) with alkali metal pnictogenides such as NaPH2/LiPH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DME and KAsH2, respectively. Moreover, the detection of the first NHC&#8208;stabilised tripentelylindiumane IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;In(PH2)3 (3) was possible by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. Initial investigations of the coordination ability of these compounds resulted in the successful isolation of the coordination compound [IDipp&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Ga(PH2)2(&#956;3&#8208;PH2{HgC6F4}3)] (4) by reaction of 1&#8201;a with (HgC6F4)3. The compounds were characterised by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Supporting computational studies highlight the electronic features of the products.

         <dc:description>
The cover shows the oxygen diffusion channel in class&#8197;7 histone demethylase (PHF8) and ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE). PHF8 catalyzes the hydroxylation of its H3&#8197;K9me2 histone substrate, and EFE catalyzes two competing reactions of ethylene generation and substrate l&#8208;Arg hydroxylation. Although both enzymes initially have an off&#8208;line 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) conformation, upon oxygen binding, PHF8 forms an in&#8208;line superoxo complex, whereas EFE uses the off&#8208;line superoxo complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;Z. Christov and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300138).

Reactions between carbonyl diisocyanate or isothiocyanate and hydrogen halide gases as stereotypical nucleophiles show two different reaction pathways. The diisocyanate adds nucleophiles to form carbamoyl halides, whereas the isothiocyanate undergoes ring closure forming thiadiazines. These reactions indicate the significant influence of the chalcogen atom on the reaction products as well as their stability and characteristics. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Tambornino and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203983). Artwork by Janina Ill.

Novel red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes have been constructed by rational structural hybridization of cyanine and borondifluoride curcuminoid. The peculiar asymmetrical layout of the three key fragments endows these long&#8208;wavelength dyes with ideal photophysical properties and ER self&#8208;targeting capability. The photoluminescent mechanism, revealed by quantum chemical calculations, will greatly facilitate future exploration of cyanine&#8208;BF2 hybridized NIR dyes. More information can be found in the Research Article by B.&#8197;R. Peterson, F. Feng, Q. Sun, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300315).

This review aims to offer a full&#8208;scale lens to discuss recent developments including fundamental process, design principles, and performance for pollutants removal from three perspectives like photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and chemical activation. Furthermore, the review try to analyze the challenges, and further envision the prospects of the H2O2 generation for pollutants removal in the future.







Abstract
Catalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation from oxygen and water enables a sustainable environment to operate in an effective and green energy&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion way, which has attracted increasing interest in the fields of energy production and environment treatment. In light of this, tremendous progresses and developments have been made during the past decades in catalytic H2O2 production for pollutant removal from three perspectives including photocatalysis, electrocatalysis or chemical activation. Herein, we critically review the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments over various procedures of H2O2 generation and its further application, with the existence of photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, and catalysts, respectively. Benefiting from extensively experimental and theoretical investigations, the performance and stability of H2O2 generation and its utilization can be maneuvered by devising catalytic platform based on numerous catalysts with predominant electronic, chemical and physical properties, which endow the catalysts with efficient electrons transportation, abundant active sites, and sufficient oxygen adsorption for H2O2 generation. Furthermore, this review also discusses the formation mechanism of H2O2 by 2e&#8208;ORR and 2e&#8208;WOR, as well as its functional process of activating and removing pollutants, and summarizes the design principles of various catalysts by focusing on the formation of H2O2. We finally highlight the specific challenges and prospects related to the utilization of catalysts and envision the possible future development trends in the fields of pollutant removal.

         <title>Theoretical Calculations on Metal Catalysts Toward Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction: a Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 24, April 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in theoretical calculations (structural characteristics, reaction mechanisms and chemical kinetics) of metal catalysts toward water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction are summarized and highlighted in this review with special emphasis on the properties of crystal&#8208;face effect, alloying strategy and metal&#8208;support interaction.







Abstract
Water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction offers a dominating path to hydrogen generation from fossil fuel, in which heterogeneous metal catalysts play a crucial part in this course. This review highlights and summarizes recent developments on theoretical calculations of metal catalysts developed to date, including surface structure (e.&#8201;g., monometallic and polymetallic systems) and interface structure (e.&#8201;g., supported catalysts and metal oxide composites), with special emphasis on the characteristics of crystal&#8208;face effect, alloying strategy, and metal&#8208;support interaction. A systematic summarization on reaction mechanism was performed, including redox mechanism, associative mechanism as well as hybrid mechanism; the development on chemical kinetics (e.&#8201;g., molecular dynamics, kinetic Monte Carlo and microkinetic simulation) was then introduced. At the end, challenges associated with theoretical calculations on metal catalysts toward WGS reaction are discussed and some perspectives on the future advance of this field are provided.

&#8220;This study tests the hypothesis that local interactions in the non&#8208;heme FeII centers of PHF8 and EFE control the differences in dioxygen and 2OG binding modes to generate off&#8208;line or in&#8208;line FeIII&#8722;OO&#8901;&#8722; intermediates.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202300138).

A novel palladacyclic 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)acenaphthoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (AnIPr) precatalyst possessing a chiral oxazoline was designed. It enables a general protocol towards bulky tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls, ternaphthalenes and diarylanthracenes via the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction (SMR) employing equimolar organoborons and aryl bromides.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings (SMRs) are utilized as the most practical method to construct C&#8722;C bond, especial for biaryls. However, a major disadvantage of current protocols is the requirement of excess organoboron coupling partner (1.5&#8211;3.0&#8197;equiv.). Herein, a novel palladacyclic 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)acenaphthoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (AnIPr) precatalyst possessing a chiral oxazoline was designed, which enabled a general protocol towards bulky tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls, ternaphthalenes and diarylanthracenes via the Pd&#8208;catalyzed SMR employing equimolar organoborons and aryl bromides. A remarkable scope of substrates with various functional groups and heterocycles were well compatible with an adaptability to synthesize useful ligands.

         <title>Synthesis of C&#8208;Aryl Glycosides by C&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8208;aryl glycosides synthesis through C&#8722;H functionalization does not require pre&#8208;functionalization of the substrate, and has high step economy and atomic economy. Therefore, from the perspective of C&#8722;H arylation of glycosides and C&#8722;H glycosylation of arenes, this Concept article systematically summarizes the synthesis strategies of C&#8208;aryl glycosides with different positional selectivity.







Abstract
In recent years, the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides hrough C&#8722;H functionalization has attracted extensive attention of organic synthesis chemists due to its steps and atomic economy. In this concept, we systematically summarizes the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides with diverse regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity from the perspective of C&#8722;H arylation of glycosides and C&#8722;H glycosylation of arenes. It can be found that a series of recently developed C&#8722;H glycosylation reactions have higher site&#8208;selectivity and diastereomeric selectivity than Friedel&#8211;Crafts glycosylation reaction. The reaction conditions are milder, which can be compatible with acid&#8208;sensitive protective groups, such as acetals or ketals, and the deprotection is more convenient. It can be seen that there are few reports on remote C&#8722;H glycosylation of aromatic hydrocarbons, which is a new field and needs further research. In addition, C&#8722;H glycosylation has a lot of shortcomings, which need to be further explored: a)&#8197;the precise regulation of stereoselectivity in the reaction process also needs further optimization; b)&#8197;the research on the reaction mechanism is almost limited to DFT calculation, and there is no exact experimental evidence. For key parts, such as the specific reaction mechanism between cyclo&#8208;metal intermediates and glycosyl donors in ortho&#8208;CAr&#8722;H glycosylation is still unclear; c)&#8197;due to the fact that aryl glycoside compounds contain bare hydroxyl groups in practical applications, it is an urgent problem to realize the compatibility of glycoside substrates containing naked hydroxyl groups or to remove the protective groups on hydroxyl groups by a mild and efficient method after the reaction; d) In this rapidly developing field, we need to study a greener, more economical and more practical C&#8722;H glycosylation of arenes in the future, which will be conducive to the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides with more biological application significance.

         <title>Modifications of Acyl Carrier Protein&#8208;Bound Glycosylated Polyketides in Pactamycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of post&#8208;glycosylation modifications is observed on a glycosylated polyketide while it is still attached to the carrier protein. These unprecedented biotransformations represent some of the hallmarks of the highly unusual biosynthetic pathway to the potent antitumor antibiotic pactamycin. The enzymes, which show substrate promiscuity, may be developed as tools for sugar modifications on glycoproteins or other biomolecules.







Abstract
The potent antitumor antibiotic pactamycin is an aminocyclopentitol&#8208;containing natural product produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces pactum. Recent studies showed that the aminocyclopentitol unit is derived from N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine, which is attached to an acyl carrier protein (ACP)&#8208;bound polyketide by a glycosyltransferase enzyme, PtmJ. Here, we report a series of post&#8208;glycosylation modifications of the sugar moiety of the glycosylated polyketide while it is still attached to the carrier protein. In vitro reconstitution of PtmS (an AMP&#8208;ligase), PtmI (an ACP), PtmJ, PtmN (an oxidoreductase), PtmA (an aminotransferase), and PtmB (a putative carbamoyltransferase) showed that the N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine moiety of the glycosylated polyketide is first oxidized by PtmN and then transaminated by PtmA to give ACP&#8208;bound 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosaminyl polyketide. The amino group is then coupled with carbamoyl phosphate by PtmB to give a urea functionality. We also show that PtmG is a deacetylase that hydrolyses the C&#8208;2&#8197;N&#8208;acetyl group to give a free amine.

         <title>Exploring the Lewis Acidity and Reactivity of Neutral Pentacoordinate Dithienophospholes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The square pyramidal geometry in neutral pentavalent dithienophosphole&#8208;based Lewis acids is perturbed to distorted trigonal bipyramidal by implementing bulky substituents. With improved accessibility to the P center, these compounds are capable of mediating hydroboration of the catechol proceeding through umpolung of a hydride to a protonic species.







Abstract
A series of luminescent, neutral pentacoordinate dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]phosphole compounds was synthesized by [4+1] cycloaddition of o&#8208;quinones with the corresponding trivalent phospholes. The electronic and geometrical modification of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffold implemented here impacts the aggregation behavior of the species in solution. It proved successful in generating species with improved Lewis acidity of the phosphorus center that was then leveraged for small&#8208;molecule activation. Hydride abstraction from an external substrate involving the hypervalent species is followed by an intriguing P&#8208;mediated umpolung from the hydride to a proton and supports the catalytic potential of this class of main&#8208;group Lewis acids for organic chemistry. This study is a comprehensive investigation into various methods, including electronic, chemical, geometric modifications (and sometimes combinations of these approaches) to systematically improve the Lewis acidity of neutral and stable main&#8208;group Lewis acids with practical value for a range of chemical transformations.

         <title>Trumpet&#8208;Like ZnS@C Composite for High&#8208;Performance Potassium Ion Battery Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite was synthesized by template method using sodium citrate as carbon source followed by vulcanization process. As potassium ion batteries (PIBs) anode, the trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite exhibits excellent rate property and cyclic performance. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the ZnS@C composite is ascribed to its unique structure, which can mitigate the volume expansion of ZnS in the charge/discharge process, expand the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, and improve the conductivity of electrode materials by the introduction of carbon layer.







Abstract
ZnS has acquired increasing attention for high&#8208;performance PIBs anode because of its remarkable theoretical capacity, and redox reversibility for conversion reaction. However, the larger volume variation and delayed reaction kinetics for the ZnS in the discharge/charge processes lead to pulverization and severe capacity degradation. Herein, the trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite was synthesized by template method by using sodium citrate as carbon source followed by vulcanization process. As potassium ion batteries (PIB) anode, ZnS@C composite exhibits good rate performance and long life (stable reversible capacity of 107.8&#8197;mAh/g over 2000&#8197;charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 5&#8197;A/g and high reversible capacity of 310&#8197;mAh/g at 0.1&#8197;A/g). The outstanding electrochemical performance of the ZnS@C composite is ascribed to its unique structure, which can mitigate the volume expansion of ZnS in the charge discharge process, expand the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, and improve the conductivity of electrode materials by the introduction of carbon layer. This method of synthesizing trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite provides an important strategy for obtaining potassium ion batteries anode with long cycle.

         <title>Highly Efficient Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence Film Constructed by Responsive Chiral Aggregation&#8208;induced Emission Luminophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The free&#8208;standing film constructed by responsive chiral AIE luminophore not only showed highly efficient CPL (glum&#8764;+0.75), but also exhibited a wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL from blue to yellow (503&#8197;nm to 548&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Key Lab of Environment&#8208;friendly Chemistry and Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials with multitudinous inherent advantages shows extensive application. In this work, we prepare a kind of highly efficient wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL free&#8208;standing films by responsive chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission mesogen. Firstly, the pyridine&#8208;functionalized tetraphenylethene monomer (MPy) is designed and synthesized. Then, the different ration of the monomer MPy mixed with the liquid crystal (LC) reactive monomer (LC242) to fabricate a free&#8208;standing film by photopolymerization. The obtained film presents efficient CPL with a constant luminescence asymmetry factor (glum) of +0.75, as well as sensitive wavelength tunability. Finally, this wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL film with both fluorescence and CPL modes is successfully applied in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The free-standing film&lt;/b&gt; constructed by responsive chiral AIE luminophore not only showed highly efficient CPL (g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;&#8764;+0.75), but also exhibited a wavelength-tunable CPL from blue to yellow (503&#8197;nm to 548&#8197;nm).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Lab of Environment-friendly Chemistry and Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials with multitudinous inherent advantages shows extensive application. In this work, we prepare a kind of highly efficient wavelength-tunable CPL free-standing films by responsive chiral aggregation-induced emission mesogen. Firstly, the pyridine-functionalized tetraphenylethene monomer (MPy) is designed and synthesized. Then, the different ration of the monomer MPy mixed with the liquid crystal (LC) reactive monomer (LC242) to fabricate a free-standing film by photopolymerization. The obtained film presents efficient CPL with a constant luminescence asymmetry factor (g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) of +0.75, as well as sensitive wavelength tunability. Finally, this wavelength-tunable CPL film with both fluorescence and CPL modes is successfully applied in anti-counterfeiting and information encryption. This work provides a simple way to construct CPL apparatus with adjustable luminescence wavelength and high g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Based [2]Rotaxane Molecular Shuttles Stimulated by Neutral Lewis Base and Anion Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of dynamic Zn(II), Ni(II) and free base porphyrin&#8208;containing rotaxanes are reported. Co&#8208;ordination to the Zn(II) axle porphyrin centre by a macrocycle&#8208;contained pyridyl Lewis base affords significant co&#8208;conformational bias. Displacement of the macrocycle by a competing neutral Lewis base or anion elucidates an optical response in the porphyrin absorption spectra, enabling a novel optical signal transduction mechanism for dynamic mechanical bond shuttling and anion detection.







Abstract
A series of dynamic metalloporphyrin [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles comprising of bis&#8208;functionalised Zn(II) porphyrin axle and pyridyl functionalised macrocycle components are prepared in high yield via active metal template synthetic methodology. Extensive variable temperature 1H&#8197;NMR and quantitative UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic titration studies demonstrate dynamic macrocycle translocation is governed by an inter&#8208;component co&#8208;ordination interaction between the macrocycle pyridyl and axle Zn(II) metalloporphyrin, which serves to bias a &#8216;resting state&#8217; co&#8208;conformation. The dynamic shuttling behaviour of the interlocked structures is dramatically inhibited by the addition of a neutral Lewis base such as pyridine, but can also be tuned via post&#8208;synthetic rotaxane demetallation of the porphyrin axle core to give free&#8208;base, or upon subsequent metallation, Ni(II) [2]rotaxane analogues. Importantly, the Lewis acidic Zn(II) porphyrin axle component is also capable of coordinating anions which induces mechanical bond shuttling behaviour resulting in a novel optical sensing response.

         <title>Toughening Hydrogels by forming Robust Hydrazide&#8208;transition Metal Coordination Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy dissipation based on dynamic fracture of metal ligands is one of effective means to toughen hydrogel materials for specific applications in biomedical and engineering fields. Exploration of new kinds of metal&#8208;ligand coordinates with robust bonding strength is crucial for the facile synthesis of tough gels. Reported here is a hydrogel toughening strategy based on the formation of robust coordination complexes between the hydrazide ligands and zinc ions. The resultant hydrogels exhibit high strength and toughness at room temperature. Their mechanical properties show temperature dependence due to the dynamic nature of coordination bonds. In addition, the amine group of hydrazides in the gel matrix provides reactive site for Schiff&#8217;s base reaction, enabling surface modification without influence on overall mechanical performances of the gel. The hydrazide ligands are easy&#8208;synthesis and can form robust coordination with several transition metals. Such metal&#8208;ligand coordinates should be suitable to other systems to develop tough soft materials with versatile applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Hiyama Coupling: Synthesis of 1,8,13&#8208;Trisubstituted Chiral Triptycenes with Three Different Substituents by Intramolecular Substituent Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe Hiyama coupling via intramolecular substituent transfer from silicon on one blade of triptycenes to another to yield 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes. This reaction is attributed to the proximity effect of substituents on triptycene, which plays an important role in not only the formation of the oxy&#8208;palladacycle but also the activation of the silyl group to facilitate s&#8208;bond metathesis. After bromination and nucleophilic ring opening, the second intramolecular Hiyama coupling provided various 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes. The optical resolution of 1,8,13&#8208;triptycene afforded an optically active form for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Clusterization&#8208;triggered Room Temperature Phosphorescence Supramolecular Assembly with Extraordinary Stimulus&#8208;responsive Features from Nonaromatic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving stimulus&#8208;responsive performance in room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials especially systems without classic conjugated groups is attractive and important but remains a great challenge. Herein we propose a universal approach to construct colors&#8208;tunable RTP supramolecular co&#8208;assemblies (AC@amino acid) with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties through co&#8208;assembly of functional aminoclay (AC) and nonconjugated amino acid using environmentally friendly strategy. Experimental and theoretical results successfully disclose that the RTP feature is attributable to space conjugation through effective space electronic communications among different &#960; and n (lone pair) electrons of amino acid molecules and the effective stabilization of their triplet state by AC. Meanwhile, their colors&#8208;tunable performances are mainly owing to the co&#8208;existence of clusters with different aggregates degree through recrystallization of amino acid taking AC as a template. Importantly, AC@amino acid exhibit sensitive stimulus response features towards water, yet their RTP performance can be maintained in other solvents, such as ethanol (EtOH). By virtue of this unique feature, multilevel information encryption application were demonstrated. This work provides a unique insight and more deep understanding on designing novel RTP systems without classic conjugated groups. Importantly, their extraordinary stimulus&#8208;responsive performances endow these RTP systems with a highly promising potential for intelligent information encryption applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbonylmetallates as Versatile 2&#8208;, 4&#8208; or 6&#8208;Electron Donor Metalloligands in Transition&#8208;Metal Complexes and Clusters: A Global Approach</title>

         <dc:description>
The structure of various heterometallic carbonyl clusters containing metals that do not follow typical electron&#8208;counting rules can be readily explained by considering their constitutive 18e metal carbonyl fragment [m]&#8722; as a pseudo&#8208;halide, also similar to phosphido or allyl ligands.







Abstract
Carbonylmetallates [m]&#8722;, such as [MoCp(CO)3]&#8722;, [Mn(CO)5]&#8722;, [Co(CO)4]&#8722;, have long been successfully used in the preparation of hundreds of metal&#8208;metal bonded carbonyl complexes and clusters, in particular of the heterometallic type. We focus here on situations where [m]&#8722; can be viewed as a terminal, doubly or even triply bridging metalloligand, developing metal&#8208;metal interactions with one, two or three metal centers M, respectively. With metals M from the Groups&#8197;10&#8211;12, it is not straightforward or even impossible to rationalize the structure of the resulting clusters by applying the well&#8208;known Wade&#8208;Mingos rules. A very simple but global approach is presented to rationalize structures not obeying usual electron&#8208;counting rules by considering the anionic building blocks [m]&#8722; as metalloligands behaving formally as potential 2&#8208;, 4&#8208; or 6&#8208;electron donors, similarly to what is typically encountered with for example halido ligands. Qualitative and theoretical arguments by using DFT calculations highlight similarities between seemingly unrelated metal complexes and clusters and also entail a predicting power with high synthetic potential.

         <title>Persistent and Predominantly Localized Boron Radical from the Reduction of a Three&#8208;dimensional Analogue of NHC&#8208;Stabilized Borafluorenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we reported the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) analogues of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium 3 and 9&#8208;borafluorene radical 4. The radical was fully characterized by NMR, cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV&#8208;Vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The distinct boron&#8208;centered radical character of 4 was corroborated by DFT calculations and EPR analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Protonation as a Switch of the Twisted Excited States with &#960;&#960;* or n&#960;* Character and Correlation with the &#960;&#8208;electrons Characteristic of Rotatable Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;protonation for numerous fluorophores is widely known as an efficient switch for the fluorescence turn&#8208;on/off in acidic conditions, which has been applied in various scenarios that involve pH monitoring. Yet the universal mechanism for fluorescence regulation through N&#8208;protonation is still elusive. Herein, we systematically investigated the excited state deactivation processes for a series of nitrogen&#8208;containing fluorescent probes through theoretical approaches. We concluded two types of mechanisms for the complex fluorescent phenomena by N&#8208;protonation: one is through the regulation for the transition to a &#960;&#960;* twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state; the other one applies for the case when nonradiative decay pathway is predominant by a dark n&#960;* state, which is also accompanied by an evident structural twisting and can be regarded as another kind of TICT state. More generally, we found that the formation of the TICT state is closely related to the conjugated &#960;&#8208;electrons on the single bond that links the acceptor and donor part of fluorophores, which provides a simple strategy for evaluating the occurrence of the TICT process. We anticipate that the current contributions can bring novel insights for the rational design of functional fluorophores that involve TICT process in the excited states.</dc:description>

         <title>Caffeine Biodegradation by Cytochrome P450 1A2. What Determines the Product Distributions?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations on large P450 enzyme models reproduce experimental product distributions excellently and highlight the second coordination sphere interactions in the protein.







Abstract
Caffeine is a natural compound found in plant seeds that after consumption by humans effects the central nervous system as well as the cardiovascular system. In general, the cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver are involved in the biodegradation of caffeine, which gives paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline products. There has been debate for many years why multiple products are obtained and how their distributions are determined. To this end we performed a high&#8208;level computational study using a combination of molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical approaches. A series of quantum chemical cluster models on the mechanism of caffeine activation by P450 model complexes give hydrogen atom abstraction barriers that predicts the correct ordering and statistical distribution of products. Our studies highlight that second&#8208;coordination sphere effects and thermochemical properties of the substrate determine the product distributions.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding (ChB) as a Robust Supramolecular Recognition Motif of Benzisothiazolinone Antibacterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BenzIsothiazolinones are commonly used antibacterial and antifungal agents. In these heterocycles, the propensity of sulfur to form N&#8722;S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bonds is robust enough to allow for the interaction to act as a general and reliable recognition motif in chemical environments suggesting that this may be the case also in biological environment.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;benzisothiazol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one derivatives are highly active against a broad spectrum of fungi as well as Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. For this reason they are extensively used, for example, as additives in detergents, leather products, paper coatings, and antifouling paintings. In this paper experimental findings are reported proving that the sulfur atom of benzisothiazolinones have a remarkable tendency to form short and directional chalcogen bondings on the extension of the covalent N&#8722;S bond and, to a lesser extent, of the C&#8722;S bond. Analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database confirm the interaction as a primary recognition motif of these systems. The electrophilicity of sulfur is crucial in the chemical reactions initiating the cascade of events resulting in the biopharmacological activities of benzisothiazolinones. The reported results suggest that the electrophility of sulfur may play a role also at earlier stages than the reactive ones, namely it may pin the compounds at the active site of target enzymes via chalcogen bondings that preorganize the system in the conformation required for the bonds formation/cleavage determining the biopharmacological activity

         <title>Dynamic Approach to Synthetic Lectin for Glucose with Boosted Binding Affinity through C&#8722;H Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic receptor for glucose has been developed by using dynamic imine chemistry followed by imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide oxidation. The design of the receptor features two parallel durene panels forming a hydrophobic pocket. The incorporation of two pyridinium residues enhances water solubility and improves substrate binding by establishing more hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A biomimetic receptor for glucose has been developed with high affinity and selectivity. The receptor was efficiently synthesized in three steps through dynamic imine chemistry followed by imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide oxidation. The receptor features two parallel durene panels, forming a hydrophobic pocket for [CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;] interactions, and two pyridinium residues directing four amide bonds towards the pocket. These pyridinium residues not only improve solubility but also provide polarized C&#8722;H bonds for hydrogen bonding. Experimental data and DFT calculations show that these polarized C&#8722;H bonds significantly enhance substrate binding. These findings demonstrate the power of dynamic covalent chemistry for creating molecular receptors and using polarized C&#8722;H bonds for boosted carbohydrate recognition in water, providing a foundation for developing glucose&#8208;responsive materials and sensors.

Ilmenite&#8208;type oxides MTiO3 (M=Co, Fe) with layered structures perpendicular to the c axis of the trigonal structure were mildly deoxidized by CaH2 in molten LiCl at 600&#8201;&#176;C to obtain intermetallic compounds TiM with layered structures after the deoxidation time of 15&#8211;120&#8197;min. During 1&#8211;5&#8197;min, Li2TiO3&#8208;like compounds were observed as an intermediate to maintain the MTiO3&#8208;originated layered structure.







Abstract
CsCl&#8208;type intermetallic compounds TiM (M=Co, Fe) were obtained by deoxidizing trigonal ilmenite&#8208;type MTiO3 with a reducing agent CaH2 in molten LiCl at 600&#8201;&#176;C. X&#8208;ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed the formation of nanoscale layered structures, which enhanced specific surface areas (approximately 20&#8197;m2/g) in the intermetallic compounds. In the initial deoxidation stage, Li2TiO3&#8208;like compounds were observed as an intermediate, suggesting the substitution of M in MTiO3 by Li from the molten LiCl. Compound MTiO3 has a layered structure perpendicular to the c axis of the trigonal structure, suggesting that the layered structures may originate from the crystal structure of the precursors. Formation of the Li2TiO3&#8208;like intermediate may help maintain the original layered structure during deoxidation and the subsequent alloying at temperatures as low as 600&#8201;&#176;C.

Putting the contortion back into the truxene fragments. Substitution of the methylene fragments by strongly electron accepting phosphaalkene or arsaalkenes provides new tuning opportunities for twisted PAHs.







Abstract
We report the functionalization and deplanarization of truxenes using pnictaalkene fragments. Selective introduction of one, two, or three Mes*&#8208;Pn fragments provides up to three fully reversible reductions based on the Pn=C fragments. The incorporation of the unsaturated heteroelement fragment as well as the contortion of the truxene core result in significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra and interesting opto&#8208;electronic properties which are studied by electrochemistry and spectro&#8208;electrochemistry. Incorporation of arsaalkene (As=C) motifs gives significantly milder reduction potentials and red&#8208;shifted absorption, while phosphaalkene decorated truxene P3 can be functionalized using Au(I)Cl coordination. Furthermore, solubility is markedly increased upon incorporation of the Pn&#8208;Mes* fragments which renders these materials suitable for solution processing.

         <title>Porous Metal&#8208;Organic Cages Based on Rigid Bicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;7&#8208;ene Type Ligands: Synthesis, Structure, and Gas Uptake Properties</title>

Ligands derived from bicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetracarboxydiimide units are found to provide a suitably rigid backbone for the synthesis of porous metal&#8208;organic cages. Crystallographic studies show that the cages display a degree of flexibility in the solid state, while the activation protocols followed are a determining factor in the gas uptake capacity of the cages.







Abstract
Three new ligands containing a bicyclo[2.2.2]oct&#8208;7&#8208;ene&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetracarboxydiimide unit have been used to assemble lantern&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic cages with the general formula [Cu4L4]. Functionalisation of the backbone of the ligands leads to distinct crystal packing motifs between the three cages, as observed with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The three cages vary in their gas sorption behaviour, and the capacity of the materials for CO2 is found to depend on the activation conditions: softer activation conditions lead to superior uptake, and one of the cages displays the highest BET surface area found for lantern&#8208;type cages so far.

         <title>Helical Anatase Titanium Nanotubes through a Protected Crystallization Strategy for Enhanced Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical structure in catalysts has attached attention and been recently investigated for various catalytic reactions. However, helical transition metal oxides suffer from uncontrollable crystallization processes at high temperatures when being transformed from an amorphous phase into the crystalline structure. Herein, we report a helical anatase TiO2 nanotube for the first time, which has been prepared using a protected crystallization strategy in the confined space of silica. &#160;A single chirality of helical TiO2 has been used to track the ordering of the twisted structure. The twisted structure in helical anatase TiO2 nanotube is maintained after a vigorous crystallization process. Helical anatase TiO2 nanotube possesses more accessible active sites and abundant defects of oxygen vacancy and Ti3+ species owing to the twisted structure.&#160;The obtained helical anatase TiO2 nanotube exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production without adding any co&#8208;catalysts. This work provides new insights into the role of helical structure in transition metal&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles exhibiting enzymatic functions have garnered considerable attention due to their structural robustness and the profusion of active sites that can be introduced to a single nanosized particle. Here we report that nanosized mix&#8208;metal zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) show a superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like catalytic activity. We chose a ZIF composed of copper and zinc ions and 2&#8208;methylimidazole, CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8, in which the Cu and Zn ions are bridged by an imidazolato ligand. This coordination geometry closely mimics the active site of CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD). The CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles exhibit potent SOD&#8208;like activity, attributed to their porous nature and numerous copper active sites, and also possess exceptional recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>New Hypothesis Insight of Structural Properties on Four Tau Peptide Fragments in Alzheimer's Disease: Origin from the Histidine Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During protein folding and misfolding, structural properties and aggregation tendency can be significantly influenced by histidine behaviors (tautomeric behaviors and protonation behaviors). The original reasons were derived from the net charge changes and the various N/N&#8208;H orientation on imidazole rings. In the current study, total 18 independent REMD simulations were performed to investigate the histidine behaviors on four Tau peptide fragments (MBD, including R1, R2, R3, and R4 fragments). We found that, compared to R1, R2, R3 except (&#949;&#948;), and R4 systems with flexible structural features, only R3(&#949;&#948;) has dominating conformational structure (possibility of 81.3%) with three &#946;&#8208;strand structures in parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structures at I4&#8208;K6&#160;and I24&#8208;H26, as well as antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at G19&#8208;L21. Importantly, the H25 and H26 residues (in R3(&#949;&#948;) system) are directly involved in the sheet structure formations and strong H&#8208;bonded interactions (possibility range of 31.3%&#8208;44.7%). Furthermore, the donors and acceptors analysis confirmed that only R3(&#949;&#948;) shows faraway amino acids interaction features in both H25 and H26 residues, and such cooperation effects of two histidine residues contribute to current structural features. The current study will be helpful to further enrichment of the histidine behavior hypothesis, it provides new insight for understanding protein folding and misfolding.</dc:description>

Furthermore, the donors and acceptors analysis confirmed that only R3(&#949;&#948;) shows faraway amino acids interaction features in both H25 and H26 residues, and such cooperation effects of two histidine residues contribute to current structural features. The current study will be helpful to further enrichment of the histidine behavior hypothesis, it provides new insight for understanding protein folding and misfolding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dormant Reagent Reaction&#8208;Diffusion Method for the Generation of Co&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogue Periodic Precipitate Particle Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liesegang patterns that develop&#160;as a result of reaction&#8208;diffusion can simultaneously form products with slightly different sizes spatially separated in a single medium. We show here a reaction&#8208;diffusion method using a dormant reagent (citrate) for developing Liesegang patterns of cobalt hexacyanoferrate Prussian Blue analog (PBA) particle libraries. This method slows the precipitation reaction and produces different&#8208;sized particles in a gel medium at different locations. The gel&#8208;embedded particles are still catalytically active. The applicability of the new method to other PBAs and 2D systems is presented. The method proves promising for obtaining similar inorganic framework libraries with catalytic abilities.</dc:description>

         <title>A Blue Light and Two&#8208;Photon Activatable Rhodamine Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactivatable fluorophores (PAFs) are powerful tools for biological imaging applications because they provide spatiotemporal control of fluorescence distribution. Many of the existing PAFs can only be activated by UV irradiation. In our study, we present a blue light (1P) and NIR light (2P) activatable rhodamine fluorophore. Next to the description of the synthesis and the investigation of the photoreaction, we demonstrate the use of our PAF in the context of laser scanning microscopy. By immobilization of our PAF in a hydrogel, we were able to write and read spatially resolved illumination patterns with excellent contrast after both one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitation.</dc:description>

         <title>Wettability&#8208;Regulated Synthesis of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Array with Subnanochannels Enables Efficient Separation of Mono&#8208;/Multi&#8208;valent Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient separation of mono&#8208;/multi&#8208;valent metal ions is essential in various fields but is still a great challenge. In this work, we present a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) array with subnanochannels for sieving of mono&#8208;/multi&#8208;valent metal ion with high selectivity and ion permeability. The MOF (i.e., HKUST&#8208;1) array inside the micrometer through&#8208;pores of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane was synthesized by confined interfacial reaction at room temperature, through which the location of the oil/water interface was adjusted by regulating the surface wettability of the PET membrane. By taking advantage of size sieving effect of the subnanochannels of HKUST&#8208;1 crystals, mono&#8208;valent metal ions can be effectively separated from multi&#8208;valent metal ions with selectivity up to 3930 (e.g., Li+/Zr4+). The fluxes of Li+ ions can be up to 1.97 mol h&#8208;1 m&#8208;2. The MOF array&#8208;based membrane with subnanochannels developed in this work has promising applications in wastewater treatment, lithium extraction from salt&#8208;lake brines, and other related aspects.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Fluorescent Carbon Dots (CDs) for the Selective detection of Metal&#8208;Containing Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots are widely applied for fluorescent&#8208;based sensors. The interplay between dynamic and static quenching is essential to design specific sensors.







Abstract
The pollution caused by heavy metals (HMs) may occur through both natural processes and anthropogenic activities and is found in complex media. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;art of fluorescent CDs and the sensing applications in a systematic manner. This review intends to provide clues on the origin on the observed selectivity in chemiluminiscence sensors, which was until now a stated but unaddressed question, and still remains open for debate. Indeed, it is tempting to think that CDs possessing functional groups with soft bases at the surface are able to detect soft metal acids, while the opposite is to be suspected for hard acid&#8208;base pairs. However, the literature shows several examples where this trend does not hold. We found that such observation is explained by the involvement of dynamic quenching, which does not involve the formation of a non&#8208;fluorescent complex, as in the case of static quenching. We have provided an interpretation of published data that was not provided by the original authors and offer guidelines to enable the design of CDs to target ions in solution.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Responsive Benzothiazolines as Potential Cleavable Fluorogenic Linkers for Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzothiazolines in aqueous solutions are cleaved under irradiation with &#947;&#8208;rays in a dose&#8208;dependent manner, leading to the formation of fluorescent products. The study paves the way for the future use of benzothiazolines as radiation sensors or as prodrugs in the context of radiotherapy.







Abstract
Radiosensitive compounds can be useful for the detection of radiations and also as prodrugs that can be activated during a radiotherapy. Herein we describe the use of benzothiazolines, which upon treatment with 137Cs produced &#947;&#8208;irradiation in water give rise to fluorescent benzothiazoles and concomitant release of amines or carboxylic acids. In a proof of concept study, we showed that benzothiazolines may be used as new cleavable linkers that can be triggered upon irradiation.

         <title>Ruthenium Complexes of Polyfluorocarbon Substituted Terpyridine and Mesoionic Carbene Ligands: An Interplay in CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium(II) complexes of PFC substituted terpyridines and MIC ligands are presented as molecular electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. The MIC ligand is used to tune the kinetics of CO2 electrocatalysis and the terpyridine ligands are used for controlling the overpotential.







Abstract
In recent years terpyridines (tpy) and mesoionic carbenes (MIC) have been widely used in metal complexes. With the right combination with a metal center, both of these ligands are individually known to generate excellent catalysts for CO2 reduction. In this study, we combine the potentials of PFC (PFC=polyfluorocarbon) substituted tpy and MIC ligands within the same platform to obtain a new class of complexes, which we investigated with respect to their structural, electrochemical and UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemical properties. We further show that the resulting metal complexes are potent electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction in which CO is exclusively formed with a faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;%. A preliminary mechanistic study, including the isolation and characterization of a key intermediate is also reported.

         <title>Peracid Oxidation of Unactivated sp3 C&#8722;H Bonds: An Important Solvent Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The solvent effect: The peracid oxidation of unactivated alkanes in fluorinated alcohol solvents leads to the corresponding alcohol in high yield and with excellent levels of selectivity.







Abstract
The peracid oxidation of hydrocarbons in chlorinated solvents is a low yielding and poorly selective process. Through a combination of DFT calculations, spectroscopic studies, and kinetic measurement it is shown that the origin of this is electronic in nature and can be influenced through the addition of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). Performing the reaction of a cycloalkane with mCPBA in a fluorinated alcohol solvent such as nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butanol (NFTB) or hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), which act as strong HBD and poor HBA, leads to significantly higher yields and selectivities being observed for the alcohol product. Application of the optimised reaction conditions allows for the selective oxidation of both cyclic and linear alkane substrates delivering the corresponding alcohol in up to 86&#8201;% yield. The transformation shows selectivity for tertiary centres over secondary centres and the oxidation of secondary centres is strongly influenced by stereoelectronic effects. Primary centres are not oxidised by this method. A simple computational model developed to understand this transformation provides a powerful tool to reliably predict the influence of substitution and functionality on reaction outcome.

         <title>Graphene Oxide&#8208;BODIPY Conjugates as Highly Fluorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shine bright: Graphene oxide chemically functionalized with BODIPY via a dynamic covalent bond evidences an equilibrium between GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY and free PBA&#8208;BODIPY. While for GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY an ultrafast energy transfer from BODIPY toward GO occurs, free BODIPY simply emits light.







Abstract
Covalent functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) with boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) was achieved through a facile synthesis, affording two different GO&#8208;BODIPY conjugates where the main difference lies in the nature of the spacer and the type of bonds between the two components. The use of a long but flexible spacer afforded strong electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. This drastically altered the light absorption of the BODIPY structure and impeded its selective excitation. In contrast, the utilisation of a short, but rigid spacer based on boronic esters resulted in a perpendicular geometry of the phenyl boronic acid BODIPY (PBA&#8208;BODIPY) with respect to the GO plane, which enables only minor electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. In this case, selective excitation of PBA&#8208;BODIPY was easily achieved, allowing to investigate the excited state interactions. A quantitative ultrafast energy transfer from PBA&#8208;BODIPY to GO was observed. Furthermore, due to the reversible dynamic nature of the covalent GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY linkage, some PBA&#8208;BODIPY is free in solution and, hence, not quenched from GO. This resulted in a weak, but detectable fluorescence from the PBA&#8208;BODIPY that will allow to exploit GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY for slow release and imaging purposes.

         <title>Transformation of the cyclo&#8208;P5 Middle Deck in [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;4&#8208;P5)] upon Functionalization &#8211; A Comprehensive Study of Reactivity</title>

         <dc:description>
Various transformations of the initial cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand in the triple&#8208;decker complex [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;P5)] show that the reaction with main group nucleophiles yields different products depending on the steric demand of the nucleophile used. Subsequent oxidation/electrophilic quenching provides a plethora of P5R2 and P6R3 organophosphorus ligand complexes in unique 1,3 or 1,4 substitution pattern as opposed to the parent complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)].







Abstract
The heterobimetallic triple&#8208;decker complex [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(&#956;,&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;P5)] (1) was functionalized by main group nucleophiles and subsequently electrophilically quenched or oxidized. Reacting 1 with group&#8197;14 nucleophiles revealed different organo&#8208;substituted P5R middle&#8208;decks depending on the steric and electronic effects of the used alkali metal organyls (2: R=tBu; 3: R=Me). Further, with group&#8197;15 nucleophiles, the first structural characterized monosubstituted complexes with phosphanides could be obtained as P5 ligands containing exocyclic {PR2} units (4: R=Cy, H; 5: R=Ph). These monoanionic complexes 2&#8211;5 were isolated and subsequent electrophilic quenching revealed novel types of neutral functionalized polyphosphorus complexes. These complexes bear formal chains of P5R'R&#8217;&#8217; (6: R&#8217;=tBu, R&#8217;=Me) in a 1,3&#8208;disubstitution pattern or P6R'R&#8217;&#8217;R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; units (7: R&#8217;=Cy, R&#8217;&#8217;=H, R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=Me; 8: R&#8217;=Me, R&#8217;&#8217;=Ph, R&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=Me) in a 1,1,3&#8208;substitution as middle&#8208;decks stabilized by one {Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co} and one {Cp*Fe} fragment. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 2, 3 or 5 by AgBF4 gave access to paramagnetic triple&#8208;decker complexes bearing P5R middle&#8208;decks in various coordination fashions (R=tBu (10), R=PPh2 (12)). Interestingly, for R=Me (11), a dimerization is observed revealing a diamagnetic tetranuclear cluster containing a unique dihydrofulvalene&#8208;type P10R2 ligand. All complexes were characterized by crystallographic and spectroscopic methods (EPR, multinuclear NMR and mass spectrometry) and their electronic structures were elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed deoxynitrogenation strategy to convert carboxylic acids into nitriles is reported. This method utilizes a cyanamide as the recyclable nitrogen donor and deoxygenating reagent and features an easy&#8208;to&#8208;setup without inert gas protection. The synthetic value of this method is highlighted by the broad substrate scope and application in late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and scaleup reactions and derivatizations.







Abstract
Efficient strategies to access nitriles from common organic functionalities are highly important, given their significance in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Although the direct transformation of carboxylic acids to nitriles have been explored for decades, there is few general and practical protocol to access nitriles from carboxylic acid precursors. Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed deoxynitrogenaton strategy to convert carboxylic acids into nitriles is described. This method utilizes a cyanamide as the recyclable nitrogen donor and deoxygenating reagent, operates broadly across aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl carboxylic acids, and features an easy setup without inert gas protection. The synthetic value of this method is demonstrated by application in late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules, synthesis of a pharmaceutical structure, and scaleup reactions and downstream derivatizations.

         <title>Pd&#8722;Bi Bimetallic Nanochains for Electroreduction of CO2 to Syngas in Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdxBi bimetallic nanochains can electrochemically reduce CO2 to syngas with adjustable CO/H2 ratios from 1/7 to 9/1. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains could be ascribed to the incorporation of moderate Bi into Pd lattice, which brought about strong adsorption capacity of CO2, abundant active sites, and fast electron transfer rate.







Abstract
The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a sustainable method for generating valuable chemicals; however, avoiding unwanted hydrogen (H2) production during the electrolysis is a major challenge. Coproduction of carbon monoxide (CO) and H2 to produce syngas is an effective strategy for solving this problem, and syngas with a desired CO/H2 ratio can be employed to produce methanol or other valuable chemicals. Herein, a series of palladium&#8208;bismuth (Pd&#8722;Bi) bimetallic nanochains with different Pd/Bi atomic ratios were prepared and used in the electroreduction of CO2 to syngas in ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes. The ratio of CO/H2 in syngas was regulated in a wide range from 1&#8201;:&#8201;7 to 9&#8201;:&#8201;1 by controlling the applied potentials, Pd/Bi atomic ratios and composition of the electrolytes. In particular, the current density reached 19.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 on Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains at an applied potential of &#8722;2.3&#8197;V versus Ag/Ag+ when the CO/H2 ratio was approximately 1&#8201;:&#8201;1. Moreover, the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency was 87.7&#8201;% for these electrocatalysts at an applied potential of &#8722;2.0&#8197;V versus Ag/Ag+. The synergistic effect of Pd and Bi in the ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolyte was the primary reason for the distinct electrocatalytic efficiency of the Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains. The incorporation of moderate amounts of Bi into the Pd lattice resulted in a stronger CO2 adsorption capacity, more active sites and faster electron transfer rate, which are conducive to improving the electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Quantitative Electromerism of a Well&#8208;defined Mononuclear Copper Complex Through Reversible Intramolecular Metal&#8208;Ligand Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electromerism in coordination chemistry allows to control the electron distribution and thereby the physical properties and reactivity. Here the first example for quantitative temperature&#8208;dependent electromerism of a mononuclear copper complex is reported, and the factors responsible for this behaviour are analysed.







Abstract
Copper amine oxidases are enzymes that exhibit in their active site a mononuclear copper complex and a 2,4,5&#8208;trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) cofactor; in the oxidative half of the catalytic cycle, the enzymes regulate their activity by a temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer equilibrium between the CuII complex with the reduced, aminoquinol form of the cofactor and the reactive CuI complex with the corresponding oxidized, semiquinone form of the cofactor. Here, we report the first mononuclear copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands showing quantitative, reversible electromerism between a CuII eletromer with reduced, neutral ligand and a CuI electromer with an oxidized, radical monocationic ligand. The CuII form, being exclusively present at low temperature, exhibits a lower enthalpy (like the enzymes), but the CuI complex exhibits a higher entropy and is exclusively present at room temperature in CH2Cl2 solution. Further analysis, based on six different copper complexes, discloses a large solvent effect on electromerism.

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of Organic Molecular&#8208;Doped Fluorescent Guanine Crystals with Pearlescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent guanine microplatelets exposing the high refractive index (1&#8201;0&#8201;0) face are synthesized by incorporating Nile red (NR) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecule in guanine crystals in the presence of P(VP&#8208;co&#8208;VA). The synthesized NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals show red and green fluorescence. Aqueous suspensions with NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals exhibit distinct pearlescence.







Abstract
Biomimetic synthesis of guanine crystals has been focused on in the last years. However, multi&#8208;functional guanine crystals occluded with fluorescent molecules have not been realized in the laboratory. Here, the controllable synthesis of guanine crystal microplatelets with fluorescence and pearlescence was achieved for the first time by incorporating Nile red (NR) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules into guanine crystals. The synthesized fluorescent guanine crystals are pure &#946;&#8208;phase anhydrous guanine single crystals. Aqueous suspensions with NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals exhibit distinct pearlescence. The fluorescence intensities of NR and FITC were greatly enhanced after being doped into guanine crystals due to the inhibition of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Moreover, films composed of fluorescent guanine microplatelets exhibit high diffuse reflection intensity (70&#8201;%). This work provides a strategy to synthesize multifunctional materials composed of organic crystals occluded with dyes.

         <title>Stereochemical Control of Secondary Benzamide&#8208;based BODIPY Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The benzamide group adopts the trans geometry in the fluorescent target compounds, thereby reducing conformational heterogeneity and opening the way to develop sophisticated nanophotonic materials. The main translational motion with these secondary benzamides concerns inversion of the aryl ring, evidenced by NMR spectroscopy and quantified by quantum chemical calculation.







Abstract
Aromatic amides can be used to construct light&#8208;harvesting materials with valuable optical properties. The amide bond is formed using well&#8208;known coupling agents in near quantitative yield, as illustrated here through the synthesis of two boron dipyrromethene derivatives bearing an amide linkage. The primary concern with acyl amides is rotation around the C&#8722;N bond, leading to cis and trans isomers. Using NMR spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations and critical comparison to simpler benzamides, the stereochemistry of the target compounds has been addressed. The N&#8208;cyclohexyl derivative gave diffraction quality crystals that established a trans geometry for the amide bond. Quantum chemical calculations support the trans geometry as being the lowest&#8208;energy structure in solution but indicate that inversion of the aryl ring is an important structural feature. Indeed, rotation around the C(sp2)&#8722;C(aryl) bond has a strong influence on the solution&#8208;phase NMR spectra. The amide connection has minimal effect on the photophysical properties.

         <title>Exploring Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Smart Electrochromic Sensors by Coordination&#8208;Driven Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coordination&#8208;driven surface engineering, an electrochromic Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating a viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;deficient moiety achieved modulated interface electron transfer, thus providing a favorable paradigm for visual analysis such as phosphoprotein detection and aptamer&#8208;directed target recognition.







Abstract
As emerging stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, electrochromic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are still not utilized in sensing applications due to difficulties in water stability, facile synthesis and functionalization, and efficient translation of specific recognition events. Here, we firstly find that a Zr&#8208;based MOF furnished with postsynthetically created viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;deficient moiety was electrochromic active. With a coordination&#8208;driven surface engineering strategy where phosphate&#8208;containing biomolecules are tethered to Zr nodes of the MOF, fine tuning the interface electron transfer was readily achieved, thus benefitting for constructing smart electrochromic sensors through the combination of the sensitivity of electrochemistry with the visuality of colorimetry. Particularly, MOF&#8208;coated conductive films enabled label&#8208;free detection of phosphoproteins, and aptamer&#8208;functionalized ones responded specifically to the target. In two cases distinct color changes allow for visual quantification. This study represents the first example of MOF&#8208;based electrochromic sensors developed by an efficient strategy, indicating the generality to electrochromic counterparts for various sensing applications.

         <title>Structural Interconversion Based on Intramolecular Boroxine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation is developed. A macrocyclic triboronic acid consisting of three phenylboronic acid units linked via covalent linkers preferentially underwent intramolecular boroxine formation rather than intermolecular boroxine formation, resulting in a quantitative formation of tricyclic boroxine. This structural transformation was accompanied with changes in the polarity, flexibility, and size of the molecule. Dynamic interconversion between the macrocyclic triboronic acid and the tricyclic boroxine was achieved via simple heating/cooling, while no boroxine formation occurred upon heating when three boronic acid units were not connected via linkers. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the entropic advantage of the intramolecular boroxine formation process resulted in these unique features. The entropically stabilized tricyclic boroxine also shows high stability with respect to hydrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Racemic Benzenesulfonohydrazide Enantioconvergent Tertiary C(sp3)&#8211;H Amination Catalyzed by Copper and Chiral Phosphoric Acid: Mechanistic Insights and Computational Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Density functional theory computations reveal mechanistic insights into Cu and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioconvergent amination of racemic benzenesulfonohydrazide. The O&#8211;O bond homolysis of tert&#8208;butyl 4&#8208;phenylbutaneperoxoate was found to be the turnover&#8208;limiting step with a total free energy barrier of 19.1 kcal/mol. The enantioconvergent amination is realized to obtain the same intermediate through prochiral carbon atom. The order and mode of hydrogen atom transferred by CPA and tert&#8208;butyloxy have a significant influence on the enantioselectivity and energy barriers. The olefinic side product generated by &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is 9.9 kcal/mol thermodynamically less favourable. A series of phosphoric acids are predicted as promising co&#8208;catalysts with lower barriers for O&#8211;O bond homolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Protocell self&#8208;assembly driven by sodium trimetaphosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The co&#8208;evolution of peptide formation and membrane self&#8208;assembly is considered an essential step in the origin of life. In this study, we systematically investigated the sodium trimetaphosphate (P3m)&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction of Phe in an alkaline decanoic acid&#8208;decanol vesicle system. The experimental results showed that the peptide formation could competitively occur with N&#8208;acyl amino acid (NAA) formation. NAA formation did not follow the traditional P3m&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction involving the intermediate cyclic acylphosphoramidate (CAPA), but a phosphoric acid&#8208; decanoic acid mixed anhydride intermediate. NAA can form vesicles independently and reduce the critical vesicle concentration of the fatty&#8208;acid vesicles. 11 other representative amino acids, namely Ala, Asp, Glu, Gly, Ile, Leu, Pro, Ser, Thr, Val, and Arg, were selected for investigation. All of them reacted with decanoic acid to form NAA via the activation effect of P3m. Our experimental results indicate that the P3m activation effect can provide diversified raw membrane materials to form and stabilize protocell membranes; moreover, the small peptides, such as Phe&#8208;Leu, formed in the same reaction system can induce the amplification of primitive cells. This implies that synergistic symbiosis between membrane and peptide can be realized via the P3m activation effect.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vitro Selection and Characterization of a DNAzyme Probe for Diverse Pathogenic Strains of Clostridium difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clostridium difficile frequently causes an infectious disease known as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and there are urgent needs for the development of more effective rapid diagnostic tests for CDI. Previously we have developed an RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme (RFD) probe named RFD&#8208;CD1, which is capable of detecting a specific strain of C. difficile but is too specific to recognize other pathogenic C. difficile strains. To overcome this issue, herein we report RFD&#8208;CD2, another RFD that is not only highly specific to C. difficile but also capable of recognizing diverse pathogenic C. difficile strains. Extensive sequence and structure characterization establishes a pseudoknot structure and a significantly minimized sequence for RFD&#8208;CD2. As a fluorescence sensor, RFD&#8208;CD2 can detect C. difficile at a concentration as low as 100 CFU/mL, making this DNAzyme an attractive molecular probe for rapid diagnosis of CDI caused by diverse strains of C. difficile.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Assembly and Gelating Behavior of (L)&#8208;Alanine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we designed and synthesized a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight organogelator derived&#160;from (l)&#8208;amino acids. We performed gelation assays using (l)&#8208;amino acid derivatives to confirm the gelation ability, which was found to be high in several compounds. The (l)&#8208;alanine derivatives were determined to be excellent gelators, forming good gels even when smaller amounts were added. These results led to a library of amino acid&#8208;derived organogelators. In addition, the thermal properties of the (l)&#8208;alanine&#160;derivatives with high gelation performance were measured. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the thermal stability of the gels could be controlled by changing the gelator concentration. The surface states of the obtained gels were observed by field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements, which confirmed the structure of the self&#8208;molecular aggregates. Self&#8208;molecular aggregates were observed to be helical or sheet&#8208;like, and the gels were constructed by forming aggregates via self&#8208;molecular recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Clickable Acylated Glycerol Probes as Chemical Tools for Tracking Glycerolipid Metabolism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the use of clickable monoacylglycerol (MAG) analogs as probes for the general labeling of glycerolipids during lipid metabolism. Incorporation of azide tags onto the glycerol region was pursued to develop probes that would generally label glycerolipids, in which the click tag would not be removed through processes including acyl chain and headgroup remodeling. Analysis of clickable MAG probes containing acyl chains of different length resulted in widely variable cell imaging and cytotoxicity profiles.&#160; Based on these results, we focused on a probe bearing a short acyl chain (C4&#8208;MAG&#8208;N3) that was found to infiltrate natural lipid biosynthetic pathways to produce click&#8208;tagged versions of both neutral and phospholipid products. Alternatively, strategic blocking of the glycerol sn&#8208;3 position in probe C4&#8208;MEG&#8208;N3 served to deactivate phospholipid tagging and focus labeling on neutral lipids. This work shows that lipid metabolic labeling profiles can be tuned based on probe structures and provides valuable tools for evaluating alterations to general lipid metabolism in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Entangled, Hofmeister effect&#8208;enhanced macromolecular adhesives for effective bonding in dynamic seawater</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deployment of adhesives in natural seawater to in situ bond is urgently needed in engineering fields. However, stable adhesion in natural seawater remains a challenge due to the dynamic environment and high ion concentration. Herein, we reported an entangled, Hofmeister effect&#8208;enhanced macromolecular underwater adhesive (EHUA) for practical application in dynamic seawater. EHUA was synthesized via a facile one&#8208;step copolymerization. After transferred into seawater, the solvent of EHUA was exchanged to seawater, and thereby hydrogen bonds inside the adhesive were activated and enhanced by Hofmeister effect. We demonstrated EHUA can adhere on the surface in dynamic seawater, and the adhesive strength could reach 1.691 MPa. In addition, the adhesives also exhibited long&#8208;term storage stability and convenient recyclability. These fascinating properties enable adhesives to seal leaky pipelines, repair damaged ship and construct buildings in dynamic seawater. This work may open an avenue for the design of adhesives for natural seawater environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Disulphide Cross&#8208;Linked Ultrashort Peptide Hydrogelator for Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A single amino acid in a peptide sequence can play an important role to tune the self&#8208;assembly and hydrogelation behaviour. Here, a C&#8208;terminal cysteine&#8208;containing ultrashort peptide hydrogelator forms hydrogel through non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions. Interestingly, the hydrogel is insoluble in water and buffer solutions at different pH values (1&#8208;13) and is thixotropic and injectable. In recent years, removing dyes from contaminated water has become a significant concern because of the shortage of freshwater resources. Therefore, the adsorption of dyes through a reliable, straightforward, nontoxic, cheap, and environmentally friendly adsorbent has become a popular topic. Hence, the hydrogelator was exploited to remove organic dyes from wastewater, harnessing its applicability in the gel phase and solid supports (filter paper and cotton).</dc:description>

         <title>Effects of Central Elements on the Properties of Group 13 Dialdiminate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The series of luminescent complexes with the dialdimine ligand were prepared by changing the central atom in the group 13 elements. In the solution states, their absorption wavelengths and responses to Lewis bases apparently depended on the central atom. The aluminum complexes exhibited the blue&#8208;shift of the absorption maxima compared to the gallium and indium congeners. It is probably because the aluminum complex has lower&#8208;lying highest&#8208;occupied molecular orbital than other complexes. Additionally, the emission intensity was clearly changed in response to a Lewis base, especially in the case of the aluminum complex. Quantum chemical calculations suggested that these element&#8208;dependent optical properties could be originated from the difference in the electric charges on the central elements. Interestingly, the ligand exchange reactions were observed in the indium complexes together with the changes in the optical properties and controlled by the addition of InCl3 and InMe3. Furthermore, all the complexes showed the aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) properties. These results lead to proposing a practical strategy for manipulating the optoelectronic properties coupled with the reactivities of complexes by choosing the central elements in the same group.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli responsive features of organic RTP materials: an intriguing carbazole&#8208;cyclic triimidazole derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli responsive luminescent materials possessing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are extremely desirable for various applications. The here investigated derivative of cyclic triimidazole (TT) functionalized with carbazole (Cz), namely TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz, belongs to this class. TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz possesses high conformational freedom resulting in rigidochromic and multi&#8208;stimuli responsive emissive behavior. It has been isolated as MeOH&#8208;solvated and de&#8208;solvated forms characterized by distinctive emissive features. In particular, the solvated form, in which hydrogen bonds with MeOH inhibit competitive non&#8208;radiative deactivation channels, possesses a higher quantum yield associated with a strong phosphorescence contribution which is preserved in DMSO/water solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Transition between Discrete and 1D Infinite Architectures: a Temperature&#8208;Responsive Cu(I) Complex with a Flexible Disilane&#8208;bridged Bis(pyridine) Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermoresponsive molecular structure based on a disilane&#8208;bridged bis(pyridine) ligand and CuI is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that there are two polymorphs in the Cu(I) complex: octanuclear copper(I) complex at 20 &#176;C and 1D staircase copper(I) polymer complex at &#8722;196 &#176;C. The formation of these polymorphs is due to the flexibility of ligand. Cu&#8210;I bond formation is observed upon cooling the sample from &#8210;10 &#176;C to &#8210;170 &#176;C. The temperature&#8208;induced phase transition progression was clarified by DSC, VT&#8208;PXRD, and VT&#8208;photoluminescence measurements and indicated a reversible temperature&#8208;controlled crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition. Observation on a VT&#8208;stage using a high&#8208;speed camera showed crystal cracking during single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transitions between these polymorphic forms.</dc:description>

These reactions lead, depending on the reaction stoichiometry and choice of linker, to the selective formation of dimeric or tetrameric supramolecular coordination complexes as well as 1D and 2D coordination polymers (CPs). The presented compounds are unique examples of supramolecular complexes incorporating both organometallic Sb&#8208;donor and organic N&#8208;donor molecules as ligands to stabilize metal ions. Moreover, one of the formed compounds, the CP [Ag4(&#951;2:1&#8208;C)4(L4)4]n[TEF]4n, represents an exceptional 1D polymer incorporating both N&#8208; and Sb&#8208;donor ligands as connectors for metal ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Interaction Modes between SF4 and Ketones; Study of Intermediates in Deoxofluorination Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interactions between ketones and SF4 are studied for the simplest ketone, acetone, and the bulky polycyclic 2&#8208;adamantanone. Acetone forms the 1:2 adduct SF4&#183;[O=C(CH&#173;3)2]2, as well as the dimeric 1:1 adducts [SF4&#183;O=C(CH&#173;3)2]2 as identified by low&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and, for the latter, X&#8208;ray crystallography. In both adducts, SF4 acts as a double chalcogen&#8208;bond donor to two keto groups. In contrast 2&#8208;adamantanone does not form an isolable solid adduct with SF4; in the presence of HF, however, it forms SF4&#183;O=C10H14O&#183;HF, which comprises chains with weak S&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O and S&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;FH chalcogen bonds in the crystal structure. Sulfur tetrafluoride in this compound is readily lost at &#8211;85 &#176;C, leading to the isolation of C10H14O&#183;HF at low temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations aid in vibrational assignments and serve to describe the interactions of the keto group with SF4 and HF, as well as interactions between SF4 with HF. It is found that separate and combined CO&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;HF and CO&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;SF4 chalcogen bonds do not polarize the C=O group to any significant degree.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of ternary bismuth&#8208;based heterojunction using (BiO)2CO3 as electron bridge for highly efficient degradation of phenol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by nature, it has been considered an effective approach to design artificial photosynthetic system by fabricating Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst to eliminate environmental issues and alleviate the global energy crisis. However, the development of low cost, environment&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;efficient photocatalysts by utilizing solar energy still confronts huge challenge. Herein, we constructed Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6ternary heterojunction via a facile solvothermal method and calcination approach and used it as a photocatalyst for the degradation of phenol. The optimized Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction delivers a considerable activity for phenol photodegradation with an impressive removal efficiency of 98.8% and about total organic carbon (TOC) of 68% within 180 min under visible light irradiation. The excellent photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the formation of a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction, more importantly, the presence of (BiO)2CO3 as an electron bridge greatly shortens the migration distance of photogenerated electron from ECB of Bi2O3 to EVB of Bi2MoO6, thus prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated electrons, which is verified by trapping experiments, electron spin&#8208;resonance spectroscopy (ESR) results, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a potential strategy to fabricate highly efficient Bi&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts with wide application prospects in solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion and environmental protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of UFM1&#8208;Derived Probes through Highly Optimized Total Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ufmylation is involved in various cellular processes and associated with many human diseases. The understanding of this modification relies on the use of customized UFM1&#8208;derived probes for activity&#8208;based profiling of its related enzymes. Herein we present a highly optimized total chemical synthesis for the generation of diverse UFM1&#8208;derived probes including UFM1&#8208;PA, Biotin&#8208;UFM1&#8208;PA and UFM1&#8208;AMC, in which a UFM1 C&#8208;terminal valine hydrazide was readily prepared by hydrazide&#8208;based ligation and used as a versatile handle for the installation of enzyme&#8208;sensitive warheads and fluorescent reporters. The resulting probes display high reactivity and selectivity for UFM1&#8208;specific enzymes in cell lysates. This strategy facilitates the generation and diversity of the UFM1&#8208;derived toolkit that can be employed to profile UFM1&#8208;specific enzymes, thereby shining insights into the dynamics of ufmylation.</dc:description>

         <title>A N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Supported Zinc Catalyst for the 1,2&#8208;Regioselective Hydroboration of N&#8208;heteroarenes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fluorenyl&#8208;tethered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene LH (LH = [(Flu)H&#8208;(CH2)2&#8208;NHCDipp]) and its monoanionic version L&#8208; are explored in complexation with zinc towards the hydroboration of N&#8208;heteroarenes, carbonyl, ester, amide, and nitrile under ambient condition. The N&#8208;heteroarenes exhibit high 1,2&#8208;regioselectivity which is justified by computational analyses. The relative hydroboration rates of differently p&#8208;substituted (electron donating vs. withdrawing) pyridines are also addressed. The monodentate LH offers a better catalytic activity than the chelating L&#8208; for steric reasons despite both giving three&#8208;coordinate zinc complexes. The mechanism involves a Zn&#8208;H species at the heart of these catalytic processes which is trapped by Ph2CO. Computational studies suggest that the barrier to form the hydride complex is comparable to the barrier required for the following hydride transfer to pyridine.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A new class of organomanganese hydrogenation catalysts was recently rediscovered. These are simple dinuclear Mn(I) carbonyl compounds with phosphido (PR2&#8211;) and hydrido (H&#8211;) bridges. This class of compounds has been known since the 1960&#8217;s, and they have rich coordination chemistry and reactivity. Given their recently discovered potential for catalytic applications, a fresh look at this class of compounds was necessary. Hence, this review comprehensively covers the synthesis, reactivity, and catalysis of this interesting class of molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet carbenes are extensively studied compounds capable of electrophilic, nucleophilic or ambiphillic behaviour. The ambiphilic reactivity of singlet carbenes have been conventionally observed in orthogonal planes. Here, we report a detailed bonding and reactivity study of a homobimetallic carbon complex [(MCp*)2(&#956;&#8208;NPh)(&#956;&#8208;C)] (1M, M = Fe, Ru, Os) that shows ambiphilicity in the same direction. The structure of this complex can be considered as two fused three&#8208;membered M&#8208;C&#8208;M and M&#8208;N&#8208;M rings. The bonding analysis suggests that these 17VE homobimetallic complexes have one formal M&#8208;M bond with a bridging carbene centre featuring a high lying spn&#8208;hybridised lone pair. Accordingly, the carbene centre shows high proton affinity and act as a good 2e&#8208; donor to Lewis acids and transition metal fragment. Apart from the transition metal non&#8208;bonding electrons, the &#960;&#8208;framework of M&#8208;C&#8208;M and M&#8208;N&#8208;M arms can be best described as 3c&#8208;2e&#8208; bonds. The two transition metals in the four&#8208;membered skeleton generate many low&#8208;lying, virtual orbitals. These low&#8208;lying virtual orbitals induces electron excitation from the spn&#8208;hybrid orbital in presence of H&#8208; and other 2e&#8208; donor ligands such as PMe3, NHC and CO. Hence, the spn&#8208;hybrid lone pair orbital shows &#963;&#8208;hole reactivity in presence of Lewis bases.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Rhenanaphthalene Isomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Exploration of organometallic metallacycles has led to the development of various polycyclic compouds with fascinating structures, which could be used as functional materials. In this work, a new rhenanaphthalene isomer was isolated from the reaction of ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 with o&#8208;ethynylphenyl alkyne in the presence of excess HCl. Its structure was then identified using the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. DFT studies suggest that its formation involves two protonation reactions and two migration reactions. This new rhenanaphthalene isomer enriches the family of metallacycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Small molecular fluorescent probes for Alzheimer's disease associated active species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and is the main cause of dementia worldwide. As the pathogenesis of AD is quite complicated, there is continuous attention to AD&#8208;associated active species, such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, metal ions, reactive oxygen/nitrogen/sulphurspecies, cholinesterase, viscosity, formaldehyde and so on. To this end, a series of small molecular fluorescent probes for these active species have been explored for early diagnosis and even remedy of AD. Herein, we systematacially summarize the versatile fluorescent probes mainly in recent three years, including the relationship between the structure and properties as well as the targeted diagnosis and imaging application of all these fluorescent probes. Moreover, the challenges and perspectives of the AD&#8208;related fluorescent probes are briefly explicated. We firmly expect this review may provide guidance for constructing new AD&#8208;relevant fluorescent probes and promote the clinical study of AD.</dc:description>

         <title>From Proton to Boron: The Lewis Analogs of Protonated Br&#248;nsted Super Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolation and characterization of highly reactive intermediates are crucial to understand the nature of chemical reactivity. Accordingly, the reactivity of weakly coordinating anions (WCA), usually used to stabilized cationic super electrophiles are of fundamental interest. When a variety of WCA are known to form stable &#963;&#8208;complexes with a proton, inducing Br&#248;nsted super acidity, bis&#8208;coordinated weak&#8208;coordinated anions are much more elusive and considered as long&#8208;sought reactive species. In this work, the chemistry of borylated sulfate, triflimidate and triflate anions where scouted in details with the aim of synthetizing the unique analogs of protonated Br&#248;nsted superacids. Those complexes were formed by successive borylation with a 9&#8208;boratriptycene derived Lewis super acid paired with a weak coordinated anion, characterized in solution and in the solid state and exhibit unique structures and reactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>The Origin of Catalysis and Regioselectivity of Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions with Tropone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the uncatalyzed and Lewis acid (LA)&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction between tropone and 1,1&#8208;dimethoxyethene using dispersion&#8208;corrected relativistic density functional theory (DFT). The LA catalysts BF3, B(C6H5)3, and B(C6F5)3 efficiently accelerate both the competing [4+2] and [8+2] cycloaddition reactions by lowering the activation barrier up to 12 kcal mol&#8211;1 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Our study reveals that the LA catalyst promotes both cycloaddition reaction pathways by LUMO&#8208;lowering catalysis and demonstrates that Pauli&#8208;lowering catalysis is not always the operative catalytic mechanism in cycloaddition reactions. Judicious choice of the LA catalyst can effectively impart regiocontrol of the cycloaddition: B(C6H5)3 furnishes the [8+2] adduct while B(C6F5)3 yields the [4+2] adduct. We discovered that the regioselectivity shift finds its origin in the ability of the LA to absorb distortion by adopting a trigonal pyramidal geometry around the boron atom.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Stereochemistry of the NH Bond Activation of Ammonia or Amines by Disilenes: Predictability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereochemistry of the addition of NH3 to the stereoisomers of 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl)disilene (Z&#8208;5 or E&#8208;5) is 100 % stereospecific giving two isomeric disilylamines 6 and 7, respectively, derived from syn&#8208;addition to the stereoisomeric disilenes. Variable Time Normalization Analysis studies of the reaction of tetramesityldisilene (3) with isopropylamine (iPrNH2) revealed that the order in both amine and disilene is 1. The kinetic isotope effect for the addition of iPrNH2/iPrND2 to tetramesityldisilene was determined to be 3.04 &#177; 0.06 at 298 K, a primary KIE, indicating that the proton is transferred in the rate determining step. Competition studies between the addition of PrNH2 and iPrNH2 to tetramesityldisilene resulted in the exclusive formation of the PrNH2 adduct consistent with a nucleophilic addition. Computational studies of the mechanism of the addition of ammonia to E&#8208;5 revealed the lowest energy pathway involves the formation of the donor adduct derived from syn&#8208;addition, followed by intramolecular syn&#8208;transfer of the proton. The results of this study&#160;allow for a refinement of our understanding of the mechanism of this important fundamental reaction in disilene chemistry, and allow us to understand our ability to reliably predict the stereochemical outcomes of future NH &#963;&#8208;bond activation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>De Novo Design of pre&#8208;miR&#8208;21 Maturation Inhibitors: Synthesis and Activity Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting RNA with small molecules is a major challenge of current medicinal chemistry, and the identification and design of original scaffolds able to selectively interact with an RNA target remains difficult. Various approaches have been developed based on classical medicinal chemistry strategies (fragment&#8208;based drug design, dynamic combinatorial chemistry, HTS or DNA&#8208;encoded libraries) as well as on advanced structural biology and biochemistry methodologies (such as X&#8208;ray, cryo&#8208;EM, NMR, or SHAPE). Here, we report the de novo design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of RNA ligands using a straightforward and sustainable chemistry combined with molecular docking and biochemical and biophysical studies that allowed us to identify a novel pharmacophore for RNA binding. Specifically, we focused on the targeting of biogenesis of microRNA&#8208;21, the re&#8208;known oncogene. This led us not only to promising inhibitors but also to a better understanding of the interactions formed between the small molecule compounds and the RNA target paving the way for the rational design of efficient inhibitors with potential anticancer activity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Massively Parallel Double&#8208;Selection Workflow for the Evolution of Molecular Switches Based on Surface&#8208;Display in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial surface display of proteins is a versatile method for a wide range of biotechnological applications. Here, we present the use of a surface display system in E. coli for the evolution of a riboswitch from an RNA aptamer. To this end a streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide (SBP) is displayed at the bacterial surface, which can be used for massively parallel selection using a magnetic separation system. Coupling gene expression from a riboswitch library to the display of SBP hence allows selection of library members that express strongly in the presence of a ligand. As excessive SBP expression leads to bacterial growth inhibition, it can be used to negatively select against leaky riboswitches expressing in the absence of ligand. Based on this principle, we devise a double selection workflow that enables quick selection of functional riboswitches with a comparatively low screening workload. We demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol by re&#8208;discovering a previously isolated theophylline riboswitch from a library as well as a novel riboswitch that is similar in performance, but slightly more responsive at low theophylline concentrations. Our workflow is massively parallel and can be applied to the screening or pre&#8208;screening of large molecular libraries.</dc:description>

Our workflow is massively parallel and can be applied to the screening or pre-screening of large molecular libraries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Matched Ligands for Small, Stable Colloidal Nanoparticles of Copper, Cuprous Oxide and Cuprous Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work applies organometallic routes to copper(0/I) nanoparticles and describes how to match ligand chemistries with different material compositions. The syntheses involve reacting an organo&#8208;copper precursor, copper(I)mesityl [CuMes]z (z = 4, 5), at low temperatures and in organic solvents, with hydrogen, air or hydrogen sulfide to deliver Cu, Cu2O or Cu2S nanoparticles. Use of sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities of protonated ligand (pro&#8208;ligand; 0.1&#8208;0.2 equivalents vs. [CuMes]z) allows saturation of surface coordination sites but avoids excess pro&#8208;ligand contaminating the nanoparticle solutions. The pro&#8208;ligands are nonanoic acid (HO2CR1), 2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (HO2CR2) or di(thio)nonanoic acid, (HS2CR1), and are matched to the metallic, oxide or sulfide nanoparticles. Ligand exchange reactions reveal that copper(0) nanoparticles may be coordinated by carboxylate or di(thio)carboxylate ligands, but Cu2O is preferentially coordinated by carboxylate ligands and Cu2S by di(thio)carboxylate ligands. This work highlights the opportunities for organometallic routes to well&#8208;defined nanoparticles and the need for appropriate ligand selection.</dc:description>

The pro-ligands are nonanoic acid (HO2CR1), 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (HO2CR2) or di(thio)nonanoic acid, (HS2CR1), and are matched to the metallic, oxide or sulfide nanoparticles.

         <title>Deoxygenative Radical Boration of Inert Amides via a Combination of Relay and Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the most challenging tasks in organic synthesis is to develop novel methodologies for rapid construction of complex molecules starting from easily available yet inert raw materials. In this context, multi&#8208;catalysis strategies have attracted great attention in the discovery of new reactivity profiles that may allow access to many difficult or unattainable transformations. So far the deoxygenative functionalization of ubiquitous amides is usually achieved by nucleophilic attack on the imine or iminium ion intermediate formed via activation of the C=O bond, these functionalization reagents were often confined to C&#8208;based nucleophiles, which largely limited the diversity of the resultant amines. Herein, we disclose a combined strategy of relay and cooperative catalysis with a triple iridium&#8208;photoredox&#8208;organocatalysis system to achieve an unprecedented reductive boration of amides, affording valuable &#945;&#8208;amino boron products which are viable building blocks. In this transformation, the Ir&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;reduction of amides is successfully incorporated with photo&#8208;organic catalyzed nucleophilic boryl radical addition, thus delivering the corresponding &#945;&#8208;boryl amines in high efficiency.</dc:description>
