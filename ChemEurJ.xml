         <title>Marriage of Heterobuckybowls with Triptycene: Molecular Waterwheels for Separating C60 and C70</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles, particularly those have &#960;&#8208;frameworks spread over the three&#8208;dimensional space, is essential in materials science and synthetic chemistry as these chemical entities possess featured optoelectronic properties and supramolecular assembly. Herein, the bowlshaped trichalcogenasumanenes are fused onto three branches of triptycene through pyrazine units, affording waterwheel&#8208;like three&#8208;dimensional polycycles 4a/4b  . Because the three branches on 4a/4b  are chemically equal, the molecular orbitals of 4a/4b  show degenerate feature that results in the strong UV&#8208;Vis absorbance at steady state. The 4a/4b  exhibit photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;separation and subsequent charge&#8208;redistribution at transient state, leading to excited state absorption in NIR&#8208;II window (1165&#8211;1400 nm). The 4a/4b  are excellent fullerene receptors, and they form the 1 : 1 host&#8208;guest complexes with C 60  /C 70  as proved by spectroscopic titrations and single crystal structure analysis. Moreover, the 4a/4b  show much stronger affinity toward C 70  than C 60  . Consequently, the 4a/4b  are able to separate C 60  and C 70  from their mixture, giving the purity of C 60  up to 99.5%.</dc:description>

Binaphthyl&#8208;based xanthene derivatives were prepared through the oxidation of BINOLs promoted by the hypervalent iodine reagent iodosylbenzene (PhIO). Nine&#8208;membered lactones were obtained through a similar oxidative reaction when iodylbenzene (PhIO  2  ) was used. Additionally, one&#8208;pot reactions of BINOLs, PhIO and nucleophiles such as alcohols and amines were also investigated to provide alkoxylated products and amides in good to excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Chiral N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands in Enantioselective Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical&#8208;NHC ligands were for the first time used as chiral ligands in enantioselective gold(I) catalysis. The introduction of the chirality was realized in a key post&#8208;functionalization step and led to the generation of a chiral NHC laterally substituted by a new configurationally stable [5]&#8208;helicoidal moiety. This structural design allowed good activities and high ee values in the gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of N&#8208;tethered enynes.







Abstract
The first chiral helicene&#8208;NHC gold(I) complexes efficient in enantioselective catalysis were prepared. The L&#8208;shaped chiral ligand is composed of an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene (IPy) scaffold laterally substituted by a configurationally stable [5]&#8208;helicenoid unit. The chiral information was introduced in a key post&#8208;functionalization step of a NHC&#8208;gold(I) complex bearing a symmetrical anionic fluoreno[5]helicene substituent, leading to a racemic mixture of complexes featuring three correlated elements of chirality, namely central, axial and helical chirality. After HPLC enantiomeric resolution, X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations enabled structural and stereochemical characterization of these configurationally stable NHC&#8208;gold(I) complexes. The high potential in asymmetric catalysis is demonstrated in the benchmark cycloisomerization of N&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes with up to 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 er.

         <title>Transition Metal Catalyst Free Synthesis of Olefins from Organoboron Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many boron based olefinations proceed via intermediates with leaving groups &#946;&#8208;positon. These can undergo stereospecific syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;elimination and are useful for the synthesis of complex olefins. Three main strategies emerged differing in the preparation of the pivotal intermediate: (i) Diastereospecific methods like the addition of a boron&#8208;stabilized anion (d1) to an aldehyde or ketone (a1), (ii) Diastereospecific 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangements of boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes with appropriate heterocycles and (iii) addition of chiral carbenoids (d1) to boronates with a suitable group in &#945;&#8208;position (a1).







Abstract
Stereoselective preparation of highly substituted olefins is still a severe challenge that requires well defined elimination precursors. Organoboron chemistry is particularly suited for the preparation of molecules with adjacent stereocenters. As organo boron substrates with leaving groups in &#946;&#8208;position can undergo stereospecific syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;elimination, this chemistry harbors great potential for the synthesis of complex olefins. In recent years three main strategies emerged, which differ in their approach to the &#946;&#8208;functionalized organoboron elimination precursor. (i) Stereoselective preparation of such elimination precursor can be achieved by addition of a boron&#8208;stabilized anion (d1) to an aldehyde or ketone (a1) or diastereoselective 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of suitable boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes. Stereospecific methods rely either on (ii) diastereospecific 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement of boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes that involve opening of appropriate heterocycles or (iii) addition of chiral carbenoids (d1*) to chiral boronates (a1*) with a leaving group in &#945;&#8208;position.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stereoselective preparation of highly substituted olefins is still a severe challenge that requires well defined elimination precursors. Organoboron chemistry is particularly suited for the preparation of molecules with adjacent stereocenters. As organo boron substrates with leaving groups in &#946;-position can undergo stereospecific &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-elimination, this chemistry harbors great potential for the synthesis of complex olefins. In recent years three main strategies emerged, which differ in their approach to the &#946;-functionalized organoboron elimination precursor. (i) Stereoselective preparation of such elimination precursor can be achieved by addition of a boron-stabilized anion (d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) to an aldehyde or ketone (a&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) or diastereoselective 1,3-rearrangement of suitable boron-ate-complexes. Stereospecific methods rely either on (ii) diastereospecific 1,2-metalate rearrangement of boron-ate-complexes that involve opening of appropriate heterocycles or (iii) addition of chiral carbenoids (d&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;*) to chiral boronates (a&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;*) with a leaving group in &#945;-position.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
&#8220;N&#8208;hancing&#8221; the electron&#8208;acceptor strength by isosteric [CH&#8594;N] replacement in the peropyrene polycyclic aromatic core. The synthesis of an octaazaperopyrene (OAPP) dye is described along with its electrochemical and photophysical properties and placed in the general context of N&#8208;heteroatom derivatives of such polycyclic functional dyes. Their strong electron&#8208;acceptor properties render OAPPs borderline cases of molecular stability under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Ortho substituted octaazaperopyrenes (OAPPs) are a new class of functional dyes characterized by their strong electron&#8208;accepting behavior. Herein, the synthesis, as well as the electrochemical and photo physical properties of an OAPP dye, is reported. The OAPP target was prepared via selective nucleophilic substitution at the peri position of a bay chlorinated tetraazaperylene by introduction of four amino&#8208;substituents. The resulting tetraminoperylene was reacted with different acyl chlorides and anhydrides to give the twisted bay chlorinated OAPP derivatives which were isolated in their reduced dihydro&#8208;form. The OAPP target could be obtained via a palladium catalyzed dehalogenation and a subsequent oxidation. The eightfold isosteric [CH&#8594;N] replacement within the peropyrene core structure results in a large decrease of the frontier orbital energies, rendering the target compound a potent oxidant while preserving the planarity of the aromatic core. The radical anion was obtained by reduction of the OAPP with KC8 and characterized by EPR spectroscopy. A general discussion of the number and location of [CH&#8594;N] replacements in peropyrene structures and their frontier orbital energies is provided.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Promoted Radical Ring&#8208;Opening/Pyridylation of Cyclobutanols with N&#8208;Methoxypyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient silver&#8208;catalyzed radical ring&#8208;opening/pyridylation of tertiary cyclobutanol with N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts has been achieved for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;ketopyridines. The overall process is thought to occur by &#946;&#8208;scission of the corresponding cyclobutoxy radical to generate an alkyl radical, that adds to the pyridinium salt. A wide range of tertiary cyclobutanols and N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts are compatible with these reaction conditions.







Abstract
The silver&#8208;promoted reaction of tertiary cyclobutanols with N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts enables the efficient synthesis of a range of C2&#8208;substituted pyridines. The overall process likely occurs by ring&#8208;opening (via &#946;&#8208;scission) of the cyclobutoxy radical to generate the corresponding &#947;&#8208;keto alkyl radical that itself adds to the pyridinium salt. A wide range of tertiary cyclobutanols and N&#8208;methoxypyridinium salts are compatible with the reaction conditions.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Conjugate Addition Reaction of Aldehydes to C&#8208;Substituted Maleimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Challenging transformation A peptide catalyst facilitated access to succinimides and downstream heterocycles with three contiguous stereogenic centers via stereo&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and regioselective conjugate addition reaction between aldehydes and C&#8208;substituted maleimides.







Abstract
Catalytic stereoselective additions with maleimides are useful one&#8208;step reactions to yield chiral succinimides, molecules that are widespread among therapeutically active compounds but challenging to prepare when the maleimide is C&#8208;substituted. We present the tripeptide H&#8208;Pro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Asp&#8208;NHC12H25 as a catalyst for conjugate addition reactions between aldehydes and C&#8208;substituted maleimides to form succinimides with three contiguous stereogenic centers in high yields and stereoselectivities. The peptidic catalyst is so chemoselective that no protecting group is needed at the imide nitrogen of the maleimides. Derivatization of the succinimides was straightforward and provided access to chiral pyrrolidines, lactones, and lactams. Kinetic studies, including a Hammett plot, provided detailed insight into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) Morphology Control by Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodology for the controlled production of MOF morphologies through additive design is applied to synthesize new morphologies for a series of crystallographically cubic Zn4O&#8208;based MOFs. This approach broadly provides a model for the design and synthesis of morphologies with desired crystal facets that can be accessed based on an understanding and use of connections between additives and metal cluster across a pore window.







Abstract
Exerting morphological control over metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical for determining their catalytic performance and to optimize their packing behavior in areas from separations to fuel gas storage. A mechanism&#8208;based approach to tailor the morphology of MOFs is introduced and experimentally demonstrated for five cubic Zn4O&#8208;based MOFs. This methodology provides three key features: 1) computational screening for selection of appropriate additives to change crystal morphology based on knowledge of the crystal structure alone; 2) use of additive to metal cluster geometric relationships to achieve morphologies expressing desired crystallographic facets; 3) potential for suppression of interpenetration for certain phases.

         <dc:description>Bifunctional fluorescent molecular oxoanion probes based on the benzoxadiazole (BD) chromophore are described which integrate a thiourea binding motif and a polymerizable 2&#8208;aminoethyl methacrylate unit in the 4,7&#8208;positions of the BD core. Concerted charge transfer in this electron donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor architecture endows the dyes with strongly Stokes shifted (up to &gt;250 nm) absorption and fluorescence. Binding of electron&#8208;rich carboxylate guests at the thiourea receptor leads to further analyte&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifts of the emission, shifting the fluorescence maximum of the complexes to &#8805;700 nm. Association constants for acetate are ranging from 1&#8211;5 &#215; 10  5  M  &#8211;1  in acetonitrile. Integration of one of the fluorescent probes via its polymerizable moiety into molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) grafted from the surface of submicron silica cores yielded fluorescent MIP&#8208;coated particle probes for the selective detection of antibiotics containing aliphatic carboxylate groups such as enoxacin (ENOX) at micromolar concentrations in highly polar solvents like acetonitrile.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical fibrous honeycomb ceramics with high load capability and low light&#8208;off temperature for the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel and stringent automotive exhaust gas emissions standards are urgently needed to counter the problems posed by the worsening global climate and environment. However, the traditional cordierite&#8208;based honeycomb ceramics substrates with ultimate pore density have seriously restricted the establishment of new emission standards. Herein, we introduce a novel robust substrate with tailored volume&#8208;specific surface area and low heat capacity. This substrate employs the synergy of high&#8208;strength ceramic fibers and ultrathin TiO  2  nanosheets. The micro&#8208;sized fibers provide support to ensure structural strength during the catalytic reaction, while the nanosheets play the dual role of connecting the fibers and providing a high surface area for catalyst immobilization. The new three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microarchitecture exhibits a high volume&#8208;specific surface area of 3.59 &#215; 10  4  cm  2  /cm  3  , a compressive strength of 2.01 MPa, and remarkable stability after high&#8208;speed air erosion at 800&#176;C. The honeycomb&#8208;like structure exhibit low resistance to gas flow. Furthermore, after loading with Pt and Pd nanoparticles, the composite 3D microarchitecture delivered an excellent catalytic performance and prominent structural stability, with a super low light&#8208;off temperature of 150&#176;C. The outstanding mechanical and thermal stability and the high surface area and light&#8208;off temperature of the new substrate indicate its potential for use as a highly efficient catalytic carrier to meet the next&#8208;generation auto emissions standards.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron/Hole Transporting Materials for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonfullerene acceptor based organic solar cells (NF&#8208;OSCs) have witnessed rapid progress over the past few years owing to the intensive research efforts on novel electron donor and nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) materials, interfacial engineering, and device processing techniques. Interfacial layers including electron transporting layers (ETL) and hole transporting layers (HTLs) are crucially important in the OSCs for facilitating electron and hole extractions from the photoactive blend to the respective electrodes. In this review, the progress in both ETLs and HTLs for the currently prevailing NF&#8208;OSCs are discussed, in which the ETLs are summarized from the categories of metal oxides, metal chelates, non&#8208;conjugated electrolytes and conjugated electrolytes, and the HTLs are summarized from the categories of inorganic and organic materials. Some facile methods to develop efficient ETL/HTL materials for high&#8208;performance NF&#8208;OSCs are also highlighted. Finally, the futural prospects of ETL/HTL materials for NF&#8208;OSCs are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative assessment of ligand substituent effects on &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;contributions to Fe&#8208;N bonds in spin crossover FeII complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effect of para&#8208;substituent X on the electronic structure of 16 tridentate 4&#8208;X&#8208;(2,6&#8208;di(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl))&#8208;pyridine (bppX) ligands and the corresponding solution spin crossover [FeII(bppX)2]2+ complexes is analysed further, to supply quantitative insights into the effect of X on the &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor character of the Fe&#8208;NA(pyridine) bonds. EDA&#8208;NOCV on the 16 LS complexes revealed that neither &#916;Eorb,&#963;+&#960; (R2=0.48) nor &#916;Eorb,&#960; (R2=0.31) correlated with the experimental solution T1/2 values (which are expected to reflect the ligand field imposed on the iron centre), but that &#916;Eorb,&#963; correlates well (R2=0.82) and implies that as X changes from EDG&#224;EWG (Electron Donating to Withdrawing Group), the ligand becomes a better &#963;&#8208;donor. This counter&#8208;intuitive result was further probed by Mulliken analysis of the NA atomic orbitals: NA(px) involved in the Fe&#8208;N &#963;&#8208;bond vs. the perpendicular NA(pz) employed in the ligand aromatic &#960;&#8208;system. &#160;As X changes EDG&#224;EWG, the electron population on NA(pz) decreases, making it a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor, whilst that in NA(px) increases, making it a better &#963;&#8208;bond donor; both increase ligand field, and T1/2 as observed. In 2016, Halcrow, Deeth and co&#8208;workers proposed an intuitively reasonable explanation of the effect of the para&#8208;X substituents on the T1/2 values in this family of complexes, consistent with the calculated MO energy levels, that M&#224;L &#960;&#8208;backdonation dominates in these M&#8208;L bonds. Here the quantitative EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis of the M&#8208;L bond contributions provides a more complete, coherent and detailed picture of the relative impact of M&#8208;L &#963;&#8208; versus &#960;&#8208;bonding in determining the observed T1/2, refining the earlier interpretation and revealing the importance of the &#963;&#8208;bonding. Furthermore, our results are in perfect agreement with the &#916;E(HS&#8208;LS) vs &#963;p+(X) correlation reported in their work</dc:description>

         <title>H/F Substitution Induced Large Increase of Tc in a 3D Hybrid Rare&#8208;Earth Double Perovskite Multifunctional Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two A2BIBIII(NO3)6&#8208;type hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskites, (HQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (HQ=quinuclidium) and (4FHQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (4FHQ=4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;quinuclidium), exhibit excellent high&#8208;temperature ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and high&#8208;efficiency photoluminescence response. The properties of the latter have been changed compared with the former through H/F substitution. The results reveal that H/F substitution provides an effective method for achieving novel properties, and more hybrid perovskites can be prepared. More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8208;P.&#8197;Miao, C.&#8197;Shi, Y.&#8197;Zhang et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103913).

         <title>Investigating a Boronate&#8208;Affinity&#8208;Guided Acylation Reaction for Labelling Native Antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boronic acid based biorthogonal probe in combination with an acyl donor has been introduced that enables site&#8208;specific incorporation of azide group at the Ser and Tyr residues of nonengineered full&#8208;length antibody. Further derivatization of this functional site was accomplished through click reaction, yielding well&#8208;defined immunoconjugates. The generality of this boronate&#8208;affinity method has been demonstrated on a number of monoclonal antibodies, all with different binding specificities. More information can be found in the Research Article by W.&#8208;S. Wayne&#8197;Chang, C.&#8208;C. Lin et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104178).

         <title>Dye Sensitization Offers a Brighter Afterglow Nanoparticle Future for In Vivo Recharged Luminescent Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While concerns about improving recharged afterglow intensity  in vivo  still motivate further exploration, afterglow nanoparticles (AGNP) offer unique optical merit for autofluorescence&#8208;free biological imaging. Apart from efforts enhancing the afterglow emission properties of AGNP, improving afterglow excitation response to visible or near infrared light is important but has lacked success. Dye sensitization has been used to improve the optical response of photovoltaic nanomaterials and to enhance upconversion luminescence efficiency. This concept has recently been expanded and applied to AGNPs. As a new multifunctional nanoprobe, such dye&#8208;sensitized AGNP takes advantage of both high spatial resolution fluorescence imaging and sensitive afterglow imaging. This perspective introduces the background, the concept, mechanism, and related imaging application, as well as existing challenges and proposes future developmental directions for the dye&#8208;sensitized AGNPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Dissolution Behavior and Varied Mesoporosity of Zeolites by NH4F Etching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the particularities of zeolites dissolution topology, hidden mosaic structures and zeolite microporosity are identified as interlocking factors in shaping the final dissolution behavior of zeolites and the resultant mesoporosity pattern. The size, shape, concentration, and spatial distribution of the mosaic structures predefine the size and morphology of the void space left by dissolution. The dimensions and topology of the micropores determine the dissolution preference towards single framework atoms, interior mosaic blocks, or exterior features of zeolite crystals.







Abstract
The mesopores formation in zeolite crystals has long been considered to occur through the stochastic hydrolysis and removal of framework atoms. Here, we investigate the NH4F etching of representative small, medium, and large pore zeolites and show that the zeolite dissolution behavior, therefore the mesopore formation probability, is dominated by zeolite architecture at both nano&#8208; and sub&#8208;nano scales. At the nano&#8208;scale, the hidden mosaics of zeolite structure predetermine the spatio&#8208;temporal dissolution of the framework, hence the size, shape, location, and orientation of the mesopores. At the sub&#8208;nano scale, the intrinsic micropore size and connectivity jointly determine the diffusivity of reactant and dissolved products. As a result, the dissolution propensity varies from removing small framework fragments to consuming nanodomains and up to full digestion of the outmost part of zeolite crystals. The new knowledge will lead to new understanding of zeolite dissolution behavior and new adapted strategies for tailoring hierarchical zeolites.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Novel Carbazole&#8208;Derived Photocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gone in a flash: Two novel photocages, NCARB, and its more water&#8208;soluble analog, NCARB&#8208;DA, have been developed. Both exhibit photophysical properties superior to other o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;derived photocages and may be used to cage carboxylic acid and phenolic functional groups as exemplified by the use of NCARB&#8208;DA to cage a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and a protected tyrosine residue.







Abstract
We report the design, synthesis and evaluation of two novel photocages, NCARB and isoNCARB, belonging to the o&#8208;nitrobenzyl chemotype and based on the carbazole ring system. The synthesis of each of these isomeric caging molecules was achieved in five steps and in 29&#8201;% overall yield, and their photochemical properties were evaluated using benzoic acid as a model for caging. In the event, upon irradiation at 400&#8197;nm for 60&#8197;min, 82&#8201;% and 42&#8201;% of benzoic acid was freed from the NCARB and isoNCARB photocages, respectively, whereas only 22&#8201;% was released from the nitrodibenzofuran (NDBF) cage. Moreover, the photochemical decaging efficiencies, &#1013;&#934;, of the benzoates photocaged with NCARB and isoNCARB are about 150&#8208; and 20&#8208;fold better, respectively, at 400&#8197;nm than the corresponding caged benzoate derived from NDBF. The water solubility of molecules caged with nitrocarbazole analogs was improved by N&#8208;alkylation of NCARB, the better of the two new photocages, with an aminodicarboxylate group. This modified cage, NCARB&#8208;DA, was exploited in the design of a caged fluoroquinolone antibiotic, the efficacy of which was illustrated in a bacterial growth inhibition assay, and a phenol&#8208;caged tyrosine derivative.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gone in a flash&lt;/b&gt;: Two novel photocages, NCARB, and its more water-soluble analog, NCARB-DA, have been developed. Both exhibit photophysical properties superior to other &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzyl-derived photocages and may be used to cage carboxylic acid and phenolic functional groups as exemplified by the use of NCARB-DA to cage a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and a protected tyrosine residue.

A unique DNA aptamer, denoted MSA52, displays universally high affinity for the spike proteins of the wild&#8208;type SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as well as its Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa, Delta and Omicron variants. This aptamer also recognizes pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing eight different spike proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with very high affinity, exhibiting dissociation constants (Kd) of 20&#8211;50&#8197;pM for these viruses.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Ring Expansion Reactions of Calix[3]pyrrole&#8208;Related Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Growing rings: Calix[n]furan[3&#8208;n]pyrroles (n=0&#8764;3) were synthesized from cyclicoligoketone precursors to investigate strain&#8208;induced macrocyclic ring expansion reactions. As the number of inner NH sites increases, the macrocyclic ring strain increased. Detailed mechanism analysis revealed that calix[6]pyrrole type larger macrocycles were formed through regioselective cleavage and subsequent cyclodimerization of linear intermediates.







Abstract
The recent discovery of calix[3]pyrrole, a porphyrinogen&#8208;like tripyrrolic macrocycle, has provided an unprecedented strain&#8208;induced ring expansion reaction into calix[6]pyrrole. Here, we synthesized calix[n]furan[3&#8208;n]pyrrole (n=1&#8764;3) macrocycles to investigate the reaction scope and mechanism of the ring expansion. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that macrocyclic ring strain increases as the number of inner NH sites increases. While calix[1]furan[2]pyrrole exhibited almost quantitative conversion into calix[2]furan[4]pyrrole within 5&#8197;minutes, less&#8208;strained calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole and calix[3]furan were inert. However, N&#8208;methylation of calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole induced a ring&#8208;expansion reaction that enabled the isolation of a linear reaction intermediate. The mechanism analysis revealed that the ring expansion consists of regioselective ring cleavage and subsequent cyclodimerization. This reaction was further utilized for synthesis of calix[6]&#8208;type macrocycles.

         <title>The Apparently Unreactive Substrate Facilitates the Electron Transfer for Dioxygen Activation in Rieske Dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantum chemical study of model complexes finds that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the Fe center of naphthalene dioxygenase through water reorientation and dioxygen binding are insensitive to the presence of naphthalene. The role of the substrate only becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation for the 6&#8208;coordinate Fe active site where an additional electron is likely to be first transfered to the naphthalene substrate. These results imply allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity.







Abstract
Rieske dioxygenases belong to the non&#8208;heme iron family of oxygenases and catalyze important cis&#8208;dihydroxylation as well as O&#8208;/N&#8208;dealkylation and oxidative cyclization reactions for a wide range of substrates. The lack of substrate coordination at the non&#8208;heme ferrous iron center, however, makes it particularly challenging to delineate the role of the substrate for productive 
 activation. Here, we studied the role of the substrate in the key elementary reaction leading to 
 activation from a theoretical perspective by systematically considering (i) the 6&#8208;coordinate to 5&#8208;coordinate conversion of the non&#8208;heme FeII upon abstraction of a water ligand, (ii) binding of 
, and (iii) transfer of an electron from the Rieske cluster. We systematically evaluated the spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent reaction energies and structural effects at the active site for all combinations of the three elementary processes in the presence and absence of substrate using naphthalene dioxygenase as a prototypical Rieske dioxygenase. We find that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the non&#8208;heme Fe
 center through thermoneutral H2O reorientation and exothermic 
 binding prior to Rieske cluster oxidation are largely insensitive to the presence of naphthalene and do not lead to formation of any of the known reactive Fe&#8208;oxygen species. By contrast, the role of the substrate becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation and exclusively for the 6&#8208;coordinate non&#8208;heme Fe
 sites in that the additional electron is found at the substrate instead of at the iron and oxygen atoms. Our results imply an allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity to happen prior to changes at the non&#8208;heme Fe
 in agreement with a strategy that avoids unproductive 
 activation.

         <title>Topologically&#8208;Interlocked Minicircles as Probes of DNA Topology and DNA&#8208;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA minicircles exist in biological contexts, such as kinetoplast DNA, and are promising components for creating functional nanodevices. They have been used to mimic the topological features of nucleosomal DNA and to probe DNA&#8208;protein interactions such as HIV&#8208;1 and PFV integrases, and DNA gyrase. Here, we synthesized the topologically&#8208;interlocked minicircle rotaxane and catenane inside a frame&#8208;shaped DNA origami. These minicircles are 183 bp in length, constitute six individual single&#8208;stranded DNAs that are ligated to realize duplex interlocking, and adopt temporary base pairing of single strands for interlocking. To probe the DNA&#8208;protein interactions, restriction reactions were carried out on DNAs with different topologies such as free linear duplex or duplex constrained inside origami and free or topologically&#8208;interlocked minicircles. Except the free linear duplex, all tested structures were resistant to restriction digestion, indicating that the topological features of DNA, such as flexibility, curvature, and groove orientation, play a major role in DNA&#8208;protein interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Tautomerization in Pyridine&#8208;Fused Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inclusion of a second nitrogen atom in the aromatic core of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen (PN) heterocycles results in unexpected tautomerization to a nonaromatic form. This tautomerization, initially observed in the solid&#8208;state through X&#8208;ray crystallography, is also explained by computational analysis. We prepared an electron deficient analogue (  2e  ) with a fluorine on the pyridine ring and showed that the weakly basic pyridine resisted tautomerization, providing key insights to why the transformation occurs. To study the difference in solution vs. solid&#8208;state heterocycles, alkylated analogues that lock in the quinoidal tautomer were synthesized and their different  1  H NMR and UV&#8208;Vis spectra studied. Ultimately, we determined that all heterocycles are the aromatic tautomer in solution and all but  2e  switch to the quinoidal tautomer in the solid state. Better understanding of this transformation and under what circumstances it occurs suggest future use in a switchable on/off hydrogen&#8208;bond directed receptor that can be tuned for complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif .</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions in a CuI8PdII1 discrete assembly: conformers&#8217; geometries and stimuli&#8208;sensitive luminescence properties.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new highly solid&#8208;state luminescent phase of a previously reported weakly luminescent Cu  I  8  Pd  II  1  dicationic assembly is reported revealing the high geometrical versatility of this moiety that importantly alters its luminescent properties. This very minor new species  B  c  is based on a different conformer scaffold than the one encountered in the previously reported  B  o  form and, essentially differs from  B  o  by displaying shorter Cu  I  &#8208;Cu  I  intermetallic distances. DFT calculations allow concluding that the predominance in the solid&#8208;state of the weakly luminescent and less stable  B  o  phase is due to the extra stability induced by a larger number of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8208;CH interactions in its crystalline packing and not by the intrinsic stability of the Cu  I  8  Pd  II  1  dicationic moiety. Calculations also revealed that a more stable conformation  B  calc  is expected in vacuum, which bears a different distribution of Cu  I  &#8208;Cu  I  intermetallic distances than the dications in  B  o  and  B  c  phases. Taking into account that the geometrical alterations are associated to drastic changes of luminescence properties, this confer to the Cu  I  8  Pd  II  1  assembly high potentiality as stimuli&#8208;sensitive luminescent materials. Indeed, by applying mechanical or thermal stress to samples of  B  o  phase, new phases  B  g  and  B  m  , respectively, were obtained. Alterations of the solid&#8208;state photophysical properties of these new species compared to those recorded for  B  o  are reported together with a combined experimental and computed study of the structures/properties relationships observed in these phases.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected acid&#8208;triggered formation of reversibly photoswitchable Stenhouse salts from Donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) are reversibly photoswitchable dyes able to interconvert between a red/NIR absorbing triene&#8208;like state and a colorless cyclic state. Although optically attractive for multiple applications, their low solubility and lack of photoswitching in water impede their use in aqueous environments. We developed water&#8208;soluble DASAs based on indoline as donor and methyl, or trifluoromethyl, pyrazolone&#8208;based acceptors. In acetonitrile, photophysical analysis and photochemical studies accounted with a three&#8208;state kinetic model confirmed the reversible photoswitching mechanism previously proposed. In water, the colorless cyclic state is a thermodynamic sink at neutral pHs. In contrast, in acidic conditions, we observed a fast scrambling of DASAs'&#160;end&#8208;group resulting into the in&#8208;situ&#160;formation of Stenhouse salts (StS) which are in turn, capable of reversible photoswitching. We believe that this unexpected result is of interest not only for the future design of DASAs with improved stability, but also for further development and applications of StS as photoswitchable probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrogen donor protection for atomically precise metal nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface organic ligands are critical in dictating the structures and properties of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. In contrast to the conventionally used thiolate, phosphine and alkynyl ligands, nitrogen donor ligands have not been used in the protection for well&#8208;defined metal nanoclusters until recently. This minireview focuses on recent developments in atomically precise metal nanoclusters stabilized by different types of nitrogen donor ligands, in which the synthesis, total structure determination and various properties are covered. We hope that this review will provide insights into the rational design of N donor&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters in terms of structural and functional modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavelength Orthogonal Photodynamic Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of light to remotely control the properties of soft matter materials in a dynamic fashion has fascinated material scientists and photochemists for decades. However, only recently has our ability to map photochemical reactivity in a finely wavelength resolved fashion allowed for different colors of light to independently control the material properties of polymer networks with high precision, driven by monochromatic irradiation enabling orthogonal reaction control. The current concept article highlights the progress in visible light&#8208;enabled photochemistry and explores how it has enabled the design of polymer networks with dynamically adjustable properties. We will explore current applications ranging from dynamic hydrogel design to the light driven adaptation of 3D printed structures on the macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale. While the alternation of mechanical properties via remote control is largely reality for soft matter materials, we herein propose the next frontiers for adaptive properties, including remote switching between conductive and non&#8208;conductive properties, hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces, fluorescent or non&#8208;fluorescent, and cell adhesive vs cell repellent properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenylene&#8208;Bridged Perylene Monoimides as Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells &#8211; A Study on the Structure&#8208;Properties Relationship</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors based on perylene monoimides coupled in the peri position through phenylene linkers were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;coupling reactions. Various substitution patterns were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations in combination with experimental data to elucidate the geometry and their optical and electrochemical properties. Further investigations of the bulk properties with grazing incidence wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) gave insight into the stacking behavior of the acceptor thin films. Electrochemical and morphological properties correlate with the photovoltaic performance of devices with the polymeric donor PBDB&#8208;T and a maximum efficiency of 3.17% was reached. The study gives detailed information about structure&#8208;properties relationships of perylene&#8208;linker&#8208;perylene compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Intramolecular P/Al&#8208;based FLPs via Aluminium&#8208;Tin&#8208;Exchange and their Reactivity toward CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) composed of acidic alane and basic phosphane functions, separated by a xanthene linker, can be prepared through the corresponding Me  3  Sn derivative and methyl aluminum compounds with elimination of Me  4  Sn. This way MeClAl&#8208;, Cl  2  Al&#8208; and (C  6  F  5  )  2  Al&#8208; moieties could be introduced and the resulting FLPs are stabilized by a further equivalent of the alane precursors. In contact with the FLPs CO  2  is bound via the C atom at the phosphane functions and the two O atoms at the Al centers. The residues at the latter determine the binding strength. Hence, in case of MeClAl CO  2  capture occurs at higher pressure and under ambient conditions CO  2  is released again, while for MeClAl and (C  6  F  5  )  2  Al CO  2  binding becomes irreversible. The results of DFT calculations rationalize these findings by the high thermodynamic stabilization in case of more electronegative residues, which concomitantly lead to higher barriers, and in case of (C  6  F  5  )  2  Al further stabilization is achieved through a low reorganization energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses of Anthracene&#8208;centered Large PAH Diimides and Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structures with suitable electron&#8208;withdrawing groups are useful building blocks for developing optical and electron&#8208;transporting materials. Here, we report the application of double benzannulation processes to synthesize PAH diimides with enlarged &#960;&#8208;frameworks featuring a central anthracene moiety. The processes are realized by copper&#8208;catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition of ethynyl&#8208;substituted aromatic dicarobximide to 2,5&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)terephthalaldehyde, followed by intramolecular photocyclization or direct arylation via Heck cross coupling. Specifically, A central symmetric benzo[1,2&#8208;  k  :4,5&#8208;  k  ']&#8208;bis(fluoranthene)&#8208;3,4,12,13&#8208;tetracarboxyl diimide (BFDI) is acquired, with a single crystal revealing its completely planar polycyclic skeleton. Such a shape&#8208;persistent PAH expectedly exhibits a tendency to stack face&#8208;to&#8208;face and forms J&#8208;aggregates. Moreover, BFDI can be expediently difunctionalized site&#8208;selectively in reactive 9 and 10 positions of the anthracene unit and applied to prepare conjugated polymers. When coupled with 1,4&#8208;diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;  c  ]&#8208;pyrrole (DPP) via thiophene and dithiophene linkers, two significantly broadened absorption bands extended to the near&#8208;infrared regime appear, evidencing the effective &#960;&#8208;conjugative extension ability of BFDI unit.</dc:description>

         <title>Dielectric and Magnetic Relaxations Exhibited in a 2D Parallel Interpenetrating Frustrated Star Net</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using organic ammonium HDMPDA (DMPDA=N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanediamine) with a positive charge, a complex [HDMPDA][Fe6(&#956;3&#8208;O)2(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)15] (1) with a 2D parallel interpenetrating &#8220;star&#8221; net was successfully obtained. The complex exhibits properties as a frustrated material with TN=4.2&#8197;K, and also presents new functions with dielectric and slow magnetic relaxations.







Abstract
Constructing multiple functional geometric frustration magnets is a hot topic in solid state chemistry and material science. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) parallel interpenetrating &#8220;star&#8221; net complex [HDMPDA][Fe6(&#956;3&#8208;O)2(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)15] (1) was obtained successfully with HDMPDA (DMPDA=N, N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanediamine) as charge balancer. The dipole reorientation of the rotator [HDMPDA]+ in the complex brings a structure transition which leads dielectric relaxation close to room temperature. Despite strong antiferromagnetic coupling existing between ions in the net, long&#8208;range order temperature TN of the complex is suppressed to 4.2&#8197;K by geometric frustration. Interestingly, below TN, a canted antiferromagnetic state, accompanied with slow magnetic relaxation, is detected due to the lack of enough magnetic coupling between 2D layers. Thus, 1 is a particular multifunctional magnetic frustration material containing two different types of relaxations.

Interestingly, below T&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, a canted antiferromagnetic state, accompanied with slow magnetic relaxation, is detected due to the lack of enough magnetic coupling between 2D layers. Thus, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is a particular multifunctional magnetic frustration material containing two different types of relaxations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Parasitic Light Absorption, Rate Laws and Heterojunctions in the Photocatalytic Oxidation of Arsenic(III) Using Composite TiO2/Fe2O3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanisms that control the kinetics of arsenic(III) photocatalytic oxidation when meso&#8208;TiO2 is coupled with an Fe2O3 adsorbent phase are investigated herein. Parasitic light absorption is the primary factor, followed by changes in rate law (from disguised zero&#8208;order to first order). Charge transfer across the heterojunction in our material is negligible.







Abstract
Composite photocatalyst&#8208;adsorbents such as TiO2/Fe2O3 are promising materials for the one&#8208;step treatment of arsenite contaminated water. However, no previous study has investigated how coupling TiO2 with Fe2O3 influences the photocatalytic oxidation of arsenic(III). Herein, we develop new hybrid experiment/modelling approaches to study light absorption, charge carrier behaviour and changes in the rate law of the TiO2/Fe2O3 system, using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), and kinetic analysis. Whilst coupling TiO2 with Fe2O3 improves total arsenic removal by adsorption, oxidation rates significantly decrease (up to a factor of 60), primarily due to the parasitic absorption of light by Fe2O3 (88&#8201;% of photons at 368&#8197;nm) and secondly due to changes in the rate law from disguised zero&#8208;order kinetics to first&#8208;order kinetics. Charge transfer across this TiO2&#8208;Fe2O3 heterojunction is not observed. Our study demonstrates the first application of a multi&#8208;adsorbate surface complexation model (SCM) towards describing As(III) oxidation kinetics which, unlike Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood kinetics, includes the competitive adsorption of As(V). We further highlight the importance of parasitic light absorption and catalyst fouling when designing heterogeneous photocatalysts for As(III) remediation.

         <title>Lights and Shadows of DMSO as Solvent for Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 12, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dead&#8208;end for DMSO? The crystallization of tin halide perovskites into thin&#8208;films is uncontrolled. The strongly&#8208;binding solvent DMSO and its tolerance to additives helped here. However, device performance stagnates around 10&#8211;15&#8201;%. The oxidation of tin by DMSO could explain this. Efforts to substitute it are promising, but still lag behind. Addressing solution properties from a fundamental perspective will allow developing DMSO&#8208;free systems.







Abstract
In 2020 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the ever&#8208;present solvent for tin halide perovskites, was identified as an oxidant for SnII. Nonetheless, alternatives are lacking and few efforts have been devoted to replacing it. To understand this trend it is indispensable to learn the importance of DMSO on the development of tin halide perovskites. Its unique properties have allowed processing compact thin&#8208;films to be integrated into tin perovskite solar cells. Creative approaches for controlling the perovskite crystallization or increasing its stability to oxidation have been developed relying on DMSO&#8208;based inks. However, increasingly sophisticated strategies appear to lead the field to a plateau of power conversion efficiency in the range of 10&#8211;15&#8201;%. And, while DMSO&#8208;based formulations have performed in encouraging means so far, we should also start considering their potential limitations. In this concept article, we discuss the benefits and limitations of DMSO&#8208;based tin perovskite processing.

         <title>Structure&#8208; and Interaction&#8208;Based Design of Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Aptamers</title>

         <dc:description>
Applying computational methods together with experimental procedures can speed up aptamer design. By using a new iterative design procedure, structure and interaction&#8208;based drug design (SIBDD), a highly specific aptamer to the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, was designed and validated. The approach combines molecular dynamics with quantum chemistry to estimate binding affinity in silico with in&#8197;vitro verification.







Abstract
Aptamer selection against novel infections is a complicated and time&#8208;consuming approach. Synergy can be achieved by using computational methods together with experimental procedures. This study aims to develop a reliable methodology for a rational aptamer in silico et vitro design. The new approach combines multiple steps: (1) Molecular design, based on screening in a DNA aptamer library and directed mutagenesis to fit the protein tertiary structure; (2) 3D molecular modeling of the target; (3) Molecular docking of an aptamer with the protein; (4) Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the complexes; (5) Quantum&#8208;mechanical (QM) evaluation of the interactions between aptamer and target with further analysis; (6) Experimental verification at each cycle for structure and binding affinity by using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, cytometry, and fluorescence polarization. By using a new iterative design procedure, structure&#8208; and interaction&#8208;based drug design (SIBDD), a highly specific aptamer to the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, was developed and validated. The SIBDD approach enhances speed of the high&#8208;affinity aptamers development from scratch, using a target protein structure. The method could be used to improve existing aptamers for stronger binding. This approach brings to an advanced level the development of novel affinity probes, functional nucleic acids. It offers a blueprint for the straightforward design of targeting molecules for new pathogen agents and emerging variants.

         <title>An Incremental System To Predict the Effect of Different London Dispersion Donors in All&#8208;meta&#8208;Substituted Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 12, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An incremental system for London dispersion has been developed that allows an easy back&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;envelope estimation when systematically altering the London dispersion donors. A simple equation is proposed that nicely reproduces the experimental results within error.







Abstract
Predictive models based on incremental systems exist for many chemical phenomena, thus allowing easy estimates. Despite their low magnitude in isolated systems London dispersion interactions are ubiquitous in manifold situations ranging from solvation to catalysis or in biological systems. Based on our azobenzene system, we systematically determined the London dispersion donor strength of the alkyl substituents Me, Et, iPr up to tBu. Based on this data, we were able to implement an incremental system for London dispersion for the azobenzene scheme. We propose an equation that allows the prediction of the effect of change of substituents on London dispersion interactions in azobenzenes, which has to be validated in similar molecular arrangements in the future.

The triptycene scaffold has been ring&#8208;opened in a retro&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type reaction under acidic conditions to give its corresponding anthrone product. 9&#8208;Hydroxytriptycenes and unsubstituted triptycene undergo ring&#8208;opening reaction under strongly acidic conditions, such as with TfOH. An investigation of the substitution effect has revealed that the electron&#8208;donating group on the arene moiety allows the reaction to proceed in the presence of a weaker acid, such as TFA. In addition, the reaction has been successfully applied toward the synthesis of tetracene.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Methylation and Alkylation Reactions by Carbene&#8208;Transfer Reactions</title>

C&#8722;H Functionalization: Computational studies on the reaction of 2&#8208;phenyl pyridine with diazoalkanes were used for pre&#8208;evaluation of metal catalysts and diazoalkanes, and suggest rhodium catalysts to be well&#8208;suited for such C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. These findings allowed the rapid identification of suitable reaction conditions for the C&#8722;H functionalization of 2&#8208;phenyl pyridine with TMS diazomethane and donor/acceptor diazoalkanes. Applications in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol allow efficient methylation reactions with TMS diazomethane through a C&#8722;H functionalization/desilylation reaction cascade.







Abstract
In this combined computational and experimental study, the C&#8722;H functionalization of 2&#8208;phenyl pyridine with diazoalkanes was investigated. Initial evaluation by computational methods allowed the evaluation of different metal catalysts and diazoalkanes and their compatibility in this C&#8722;H functionalization reaction. With these findings, suitable reaction conditions for the C&#8722;H methylation reactions were quickly identified by using highly reactive TMS diazomethane and C&#8722;H alkylation reactions with donor/acceptor diazoalkanes, which is applied to a broad scope on alkylation reactions of 2&#8208;aryl pyridines with TMS diazomethane and donor/acceptor diazoalkane (51 examples, up to 98&#8201;% yield).

Silylium against borenium&#8230;who wins when tugging on opposite &#8220;ends&#8221; of hydride? A cationic system based on a naphtalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl platform has been designed for probing the competition for hydride between silicon and boron. The hydroborane&#8208;stabilized silylium ion with a delocalized three&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron B&#8722;H&#8722;Si bond and more silylium than borenium ion character is the winner (see Scheme; [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; omitted for clarity).







Abstract
Potent main&#8208;group Lewis acids are capable of activating element&#8208;hydrogen bonds. To probe the rivalry for hydride between silylium&#8208; and borenium&#8208;ion centers, a neutral precursor with the hydrosilane and hydroborane units in close proximity on a naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;diyl platform was designed. Abstraction of one hydride leads to a hydroborane&#8208;stabilized silylium ion rather than a hydrosilane&#8208;coordinated borenium ion paired with [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; or [HCB11Cl11]&#8722; as counteranions. Characterization by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction supported by DFT calculations reveals a cationic, unsymmetrical open three&#8208;center, two&#8208;electron (3c2e) Si&#8722;H&#8722;B linkage.

Novel Alder&#8208;ene reaction: Thermally induced intramolecular Alder&#8208;ene reactions of 1,6&#8208;allenynes gives &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a mechanism distinct from previous [2+2] cycloisomerization manifolds of related skeletons. The mechanism involves an unusual transfer of the allene&#8208;hydrogen and is supported by computational and deuterium labelling studies. The reaction is favoured by the electron&#8208;deficient nature of the propiolamide moiety and the absence of substituents on the termini of both the allene &#8220;ene&#8221; moiety and the alkyne of the 1,6&#8208;allenyne.

         <title>Inverse&#8208;Tunable Red Luminescence and Electronic Properties of Nitridoberylloaluminates Sr2&#8722;xBax[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ (x=0&#8211;2)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 12, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitridoberylloaluminate Sr2&#8722;xBax[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ (x=0&#8211;2) were synthesized in a HIP under 50&#8197;MPa N2 atmosphere at 1200&#8211;1400&#8201;&#176;C. In contrast to the usual trend, the emission maximum in the prepared samples is inversely shifted to higher wavelengths by the incorporation of the larger cation Ba2+.







Abstract
The nitridoberylloaluminate Ba2[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ and solid solutions Sr2&#8722;xBax[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ (x=0.5, 1.0, 1.5) were synthesized in a hot isostatic press (HIP) under 50&#8197;MPa N2 atmosphere at 1200&#8201;&#176;C. Ba2[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ crystallizes in triclinic space group 
 (no. 2) (Z=2, a=6.1869(10), b=7.1736(13), c=8.0391(14)&#8197;&#197;, &#945;=102.754(8), &#946;=112.032(6), &#947;=104.765(7)&#176;), which was determined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The lattice parameters of the solid solution series have been obtained from Rietveld refinements and show a nearly linear dependence on the atomic ratio Sr&#8201;:&#8201;Ba. The electronic properties and the band gaps of M2[BeAl3N5] (M=Sr, Ba) have been investigated by a combination of soft X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon irradiation with blue light (440&#8211;450&#8197;nm), the nitridoberylloaluminates exhibit intense orange to red luminescence, which can be tuned between 610 and 656&#8197;nm (fwhm=1922&#8211;2025&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (72&#8211;87&#8197;nm)). In contrast to the usual trend, the substitution of the smaller Sr2+ by larger Ba2+ leads to an inverse&#8208;tunable luminescence to higher wavelengths.

Upon irradiation with blue light (440&#8211;450&#8197;nm), the nitridoberylloaluminates exhibit intense orange to red luminescence, which can be tuned between 610 and 656&#8197;nm (fwhm=1922&#8211;2025&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (72&#8211;87&#8197;nm)). In contrast to the usual trend, the substitution of the smaller Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by larger Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; leads to an inverse-tunable luminescence to higher wavelengths. Low-temperature luminescence measurements have been performed to exclude anomalous emission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Solid Support&#8208;Based Synthetic Strategy for the Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Peptides with Organometallic Half&#8208;Sandwich Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 12, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;selective functionalization of peptides with metal moieties has been achieved with a carbene ligand on solid support which facilitated the isolation and purification of metal&#8208;peptide conjugates. The developed methodology allows the metalation of Lys side chain functional groups and the N&#8208;terminus in presence of competing metal&#8208;binding amino acids.







Abstract
The number of donor atoms available on peptides that can competitively coordinate to metal centers renders the site&#8208;selective generation of advanced metal&#8208;peptide conjugates in high purity a challenging venture. Herein, we present a transmetalation&#8208;based synthetic approach on solid support in which an imidazolium pro&#8208;ligand can be used to selectively anchor a range of transition metal half&#8208;sandwich complexes onto peptides in the presence of multiple coordinative motifs. Amenable to solid support, a range of N&#8208;terminus and/or lysine conjugated metal&#8208;peptide conjugates were obtained in high purity after cleavage from the resin. The metalated peptides were evaluated for their anticancer properties against human cancer cell lines. While no cytotoxic activity was observed, this platform has the potential to i) provide a pathway to site&#8208;selective peptide labelling, ii) be explored as a biorthogonal handle and/or iii) generate a new strategy for ligand design in transition metal catalysts.

         <title>Cyclopentannulated Dihydrotetraazapentacenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The alkyne units of bissilylethynylated N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydrotetraazapentacene are transferred into a dihydrotetraazapentacene core by a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction to form a new type of cyclopentannulated tetraazapentacene. Depending on the applied catalyst systems, either silyl group retention or migration takes place, which gives rise to constitutional isomers that show comparable optoelectronic properties but completely different packing motifs in the solid states.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of bissilylethynylated N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydrotetraazapentacene (TIPS&#8208;TAP&#8208;H2) into bissilylated cyclopenta[fg,qr]pentacenes is reported. Depending on the catalyst either none, one or two silyl groups migrate and change their positions in the formed five&#8208;membered rings. The optoelectronic properties are quite similar, whereas the packing motifs differ dramatically. Control experiments and quantum chemical calculations were performed to investigate the mechanism of the reaction and the selectivity of the silyl shift.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Properties of Boranes Containing Boron&#8208;Chalcogen Multiple Bonds and Stabilized by Amido Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine Ligands</title>

Electronic effects in the boron&#8208;chalcogen multiple bonds through ligand variation of a series of new chalcogenboranes stabilized by N,N&#8217;&#8208;chelating amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine ligands were studied by DFT approach. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents and electron delocalization yield the shortest B=X bond lengths and the highest B=X bond orders.







Abstract
The stabilization of elusive monomeric species containing multiple boron&#8208;chalcogen bonds has motivated the investigation of sophisticated ligand systems in the past few years. Recently, a series of neutral, Lewis acid&#8208;free chalcogenboranes were prepared by incorporation of an amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine as the supporting ligand (Frank et&#8197;al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 4633), resulting in well&#8208;defined molecular entities with pronounced multiple bond character, B=X (X=O, S, Se, Te). In view of the potential use of N&#8208;heterocyclic boranes (NHB=X) as ligands in catalysis and fine chemistry, we evaluated in this work the bonding properties of the new B=X compounds based on a &#960;&#8208;backdonation model. The electronic properties of systems in question were modulated via systematic modifications of the NHB ring with respect to ligand variation, saturation, size, and heteroatom substitutions. Investigations into the B=X bond length and order, calculated by means of density functional theory methods, reveal enhanced B=X bonding properties for NHB rings with high electron delocalization in the NHB ring and bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents; a fact that was also confirmed by computational assessment of electron interactions of the B=X species with a dicarbonyl manganese complex. We expect that the analysis will contribute to the rational optimization of existing ligands as well as the development of new moieties, which would further allow for exploration of new boron chemistry.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active Microporous Organosiloxane Containing a Stable Neutral Radical, Trioxotriangulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 12, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new silyl&#8208;substituted trioxotriangulene (TOT) neutral radical was synthesized and exhibited a peculiarly high stability and a self&#8208;assembling ability to form a &#960;&#8208;dimer stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO&#8208;SOMO interaction. The polycondensation of the silyl&#8208;substituted TOT yielded a microporous organosiloxane with a large surface area and a micropore of &#8764;1&#8197;nm diameter. The TOT unit incorporated in the organosiloxane&#8208;wall exhibited a reversible multi&#8208;stage redox ability in the chemical and electrochemical methods.







Abstract
A new silyl&#8208;substituted trioxotriangulene (TOT) neutral radical and corresponding porous organosiloxanes (POSs) were synthesized. The neutral radical exhibited a peculiarly high stability and formed a diamagnetic &#960;&#8208;dimer characteristic to TOT neutral radicals stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO&#8208;SOMO interaction in both solution and solid states. POSs including TOT units within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall were prepared by polycondensation of the silyl groups and formed microporous structures with &#8764;1&#8197;nm&#8208;size diameters. Redox ability of TOT units in the POS was demonstrated by the treatment of oxidant/reductant in heterogeneous suspension condition, where the TOT units were reversibly converted between reduced and neutral radical species. Furthermore, the solid&#8208;state electrochemical measurements of the POS revealed the reversible multi&#8208;stage redox ability of TOT units involving polyanionic species within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall.

     alt="A Redox-Active Microporous Organosiloxane Containing a Stable Neutral Radical, Trioxotriangulene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new silyl-substituted trioxotriangulene&lt;/b&gt; (TOT) neutral radical was synthesized and exhibited a peculiarly high stability and a self-assembling ability to form a &#960;-dimer stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO-SOMO interaction. The polycondensation of the silyl-substituted TOT yielded a microporous organosiloxane with a large surface area and a micropore of &#8764;1&#8197;nm diameter. The TOT unit incorporated in the organosiloxane-wall exhibited a reversible multi-stage redox ability in the chemical and electrochemical methods.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new silyl-substituted trioxotriangulene (&lt;b&gt;TOT&lt;/b&gt;) neutral radical and corresponding porous organosiloxanes (POSs) were synthesized. The neutral radical exhibited a peculiarly high stability and formed a diamagnetic &#960;-dimer characteristic to &lt;b&gt;TOT&lt;/b&gt; neutral radicals stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO-SOMO interaction in both solution and solid states. POSs including &lt;b&gt;TOT&lt;/b&gt; units within the organosiloxane-wall were prepared by polycondensation of the silyl groups and formed microporous structures with &#8764;1&#8197;nm-size diameters. Redox ability of &lt;b&gt;TOT&lt;/b&gt; units in the POS was demonstrated by the treatment of oxidant/reductant in heterogeneous suspension condition, where the &lt;b&gt;TOT&lt;/b&gt; units were reversibly converted between reduced and neutral radical species. Furthermore, the solid-state electrochemical measurements of the POS revealed the reversible multi-stage redox ability of &lt;b&gt;TOT&lt;/b&gt; units involving polyanionic species within the organosiloxane-wall.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox Replacement of Silver on MOF&#8208;Derived Cu/C Nanoparticles on Gas Diffusion Electrodes for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 12, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
From CO2 to C2+: A novel Cu/C&#8722;Ag nanostructured catalyst has been synthesized by electroless redox replacement directly on gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. An optimum Cu/Ag composition with similar&#8208;sized nanoparticles showed the highest conversion of CO2 to C2+ products compared to only Cu&#8208;modified gas diffusion electrodes. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and gas chromatography measurements suggest two parallel CO2 reduction mechanisms to produce HCO2H and C2+ products on the bimetallic Cu/Ag surface.







Abstract
Bimetallic tandem catalysts have emerged as a promising strategy to locally increase the CO flux during electrochemical CO2 reduction, so as to maximize the rate of conversion to C&#8722;C&#8208;coupled products. Considering this, a novel Cu/C&#8722;Ag nanostructured catalyst has been prepared by a redox replacement process, in which the ratio of the two metals can be tuned by the replacement time. An optimum Cu/Ag composition with similarly sized particles showed the highest CO2 conversion to C2+ products compared to non&#8208;Ag&#8208;modified gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. Gas chromatography and in&#8208;situ Raman measurements in a CO2 gas diffusion cell suggest the formation of top&#8208;bound linear adsorbed *CO followed by consumption of CO in the successive cascade steps, as evidenced by the increasing&#957;C&#8722;H bands. These findings suggest that two mechanisms operate simultaneously towards the production of HCO2H and C&#8722;C&#8208;coupled products on the Cu/Ag bimetallic surface.

         <title>Nonaqueous Emulsion Polycondensation Enabled by a Self&#8208;Assembled Cage&#8208;like Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 12, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic self&#8208;assembled coordination cage was decorated with cholesterol groups attached via ethoxy chains, giving it a pronounced amphiphilic character. The nanosized cage acts as a surfactant for a variety of nonaqueous emulsions. These were employed in mini&#8208;emulsion polymerization reactions to produce polyurethane and polyurea materials with different particle sizes and morphologies.







Abstract
Nonaqueous emulsions are crucial for a range of applications based on water&#8208;sensitive systems such as controlled polymerizations requiring anhydrous reaction conditions and the stabilization of readily hydrolyzable reagents or pharmacologically active components. However, defined molecular surfactants to stabilize such nonaqueous emulsions are scarce. We introduce a self&#8208;assembled coordination cage, decorated with cholesterol functionalities, to serve as a molecular surfactant for various oil&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions of immiscible organic solvents. While the positively charged cage forms the amphiphile's polar moiety, the non&#8208;polar cholesterol appendices can bend in a common direction to stabilize the emulsion. Templated by the droplets, polycondensation reactions were carried out to produce microstructured polyurethane and polyurea materials of different particle sizes and morphologies. Further, the amphiphilic cage can encapsulate a guest molecule and the resulting host&#8208;guest assembly was also examined as a surfactant. In addition, the aggregation behavior of the amphiphilic cage in an aqueous medium was examined.

Boron&#8208;, sulfur&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emitters are designed and synthesized to combine high photoluminescent quantum efficiency and rapid reverse intersystem crossing in one multiple resonance system for efficient narrow&#8208;band blue emission with full width at half maximum of 29&#8197;nm, which provides an avenue to expand the structure library for PAH skeletons with multiple resonance effect and narrow&#8208;band emission.







Abstract
Two boron&#8208;, sulfur&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters with high photoluminescent quantum efficiency (88&#8201;%) and rapid reverse intersystem crossing (kRISC= 1.0&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1) are designed and synthesized, enabling efficient narrow&#8208;band blue electroluminescence at 473&#8197;nm with full width at half maximum of 29&#8197;nm and maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.0&#8201;%, which provides an avenue to expand the structure library for multiple resonance emitters and an approach to regulate their emission properties.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Degradable Protein&#8208;Polymer Hybrid Shells for Caging Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 12, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy towards the remote control of cell functions is reported. Photo&#8208;degradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells for protecting the whole cell surface were developed by the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of polymers and polymer micelles through protein&#8208;ligand binding. These shells can be used to photo&#8208;regulate cellular functions by steric hinderance against the interaction between cell surfaces and substrates.







Abstract
There is growing demand for the precise remote control of cellular functions in various fields. Herein, a method for caging mammalian cells by coating with photodegradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells to photo&#8208;control their functions without genetic engineering is reported. A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of photocleavable synthetic materials through biotin&#8208;streptavidin (SA) binding was employed for cell coating. The cell surfaces were first biotinylated with photocleavable biotinylated poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)&#8208;lipid and then coated by repeatedly layering SA and micelles of the PEG&#8208;lipid and photocleavable biotinylated four&#8208;arm PEG. The cell extension and adhesion were suppressed with the shells and then triggered with the degradation of the shells by light exposure. Macrophage phagocytosis was also stopped by caging with the shells and restarted by light&#8208;guided uncaging. This study provides the first proof of principle that cellular functions can be remotely controlled by steric hinderance of cell surfaces with photodegradable materials.

         <title>A Mechanism for Nitrogenase Including Loss of a Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 12, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lost property: The possible loss of a sulfide mechanism for the Mo&#8208;nitrogenase has been investigated by hybrid DFT using a cluster model. The calculations show that, after four reductions, a sulfide can be released as a H2S group. After another four reductions, the central carbon is protonated with one proton in E4, from where the loss of H2 and binding of N2 is reversible.







Abstract
Nitrogenase is the only enzyme in nature that can fix N2 from the air. The active cofactor of the leading form of this enzyme contains seven irons and one molybdenum connected by sulfide bridges. In several recent experimental studies, it has been suggested that the cofactor is very flexible, and might lose one of its sulfides during catalysis. In this study, the possible loss of a sulfide has been investigated by model calculations. In previous studies, we have shown that there should be four activation steps before catalysis starts, and this study is based on that finding. It was found here that, after the four reductions in the activation steps, a sulfide will become very loosely bound and can be released in a quite exergonic step with a low barrier. The binding of N2 has no part in that release. In our previous studies, we suggested that the central carbide should be protonated three times after the four activation steps. With the new finding, there will instead be a loss of a sulfide, as the barrier for the loss is much lower than the ones for protonating the carbide. Still, it is suggested here that the carbide will be protonated anyway, but only with one proton, in the E3 to E4 step. A very complicated transition state for H2 formation involving a large structural change was obtained. The combined step, with a loss of H2 and binding of N2, is calculated to be endergonic by +2.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1; this is in excellent agreement with experiments in which an easily reversible step has been found.

         <title>Functionalized Graphene Quantum Dots Modified Dioxin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Superior Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 12, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized graphene quantum dots (GQDs) modified dioxin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COF) are fabricated and applied as anode material of lithium&#8208;ion battery for the first time. The modification of carboxyl GQDs leads to more active sites, fast lithium&#8208;ion transportation kinetics, and enhanced electronic conductivity, resulting in enhanced lithium&#8208;storage properties for the graphene quantum dots modified covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8208;GQDs) electrode







Abstract
Covalent organic framework, as an emerging porous nano&#8208;frame structure with pre&#8208;designed structure and custom properties, has been demonstrated as a prospective electrode for rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries. For improving the reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycle stability of COF materials, we propose a GQDs modified COF material (COF&#8208;GQDs) and apply it as the anode for LIBs for the first time. This COF&#8208;GQDs electrode delivers enhanced long&#8208;term cycling performance with a large capacity of &#8764;820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an improved rate performance. The enhanced lithium&#8208;storage performance, in terms of obvious&#8208;shortened activation process and high reversible capacities, can be attributed to the modification of carboxyl GQDs, which would activate more active sites (activated C=C groups from benzene rings) for lithium&#8208;storage, and provide fast lithium&#8208;ion transportation kinetic. Besides, the decreased interphase resistance, enhanced electronic conductivity, and prevented aggregation of needle&#8208;flake COF structure, originated from the addition of GQDs, which lead to the enhanced improved cycling stability of the COF&#8208;GQDs electrode. This manuscript can promote the further exploration on the design of COF&#8208;related materials with modification of functionalized carbonaceous materials to achieve enhanced lithium&#8208;storage properties for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Characterizing Enzyme Cooperativity with Imaging SAMDI&#8208;MS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 12, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free method is established for to characterize the degree of cooperativity and K0.5 of a cooperative metal&#8208;enzyme binding interaction using microfluidics and imaging self&#8208;assembled monolayers for matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (iSAMDI). Numerical calculations were used to build a finite element model to describe the spatiotemporal pattern of reaction yields for each channel within the microfluidic device.







Abstract
This paper describes a method that combines a microfluidic device and self&#8208;assembled monolayers for matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SAMDI) mass spectrometry to calculate the cooperativity in binding of calcium ions to peptidylarginine deiminase type 2 (PAD2). This example uses only 120&#8197;&#956;L of enzyme solution and three fluidic inputs. This microfluidic device incorporates a self&#8208;assembled monolayer that is functionalized with a peptide substrate for PAD2. The enzyme and different concentrations of calcium ions are flowed through each of eight channels, where the position along the channel corresponds to reaction time and position across the channel corresponds to the concentration of Ca2+. Imaging SAMDI (iSAMDI) is then used to determine the yield for the enzyme reaction at each 200&#8197;&#956;m pixel on the monolayer, providing a time course for the reactions. Analysis of the peptide conversion as a function of position and time gives the degree of cooperativity (n) and the concentration of ligand required for half maximal activity (K0.5) for the Ca2+ &#8211; dependent activation of PAD2. This work establishes a high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free method for studying enzyme&#8208;ligand binding interactions and widens the applicability of microfluidics and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry.

Digital drug design reveals DNA aptamers binding SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2: A hybrid in silico et vitro approach, structure and interaction&#8208;based drug design, has been developed to create highly specific DNA aptamers for the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. The structure and binding affinity of the aptamers were validated by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, flow cytometry, and fluorescence polarization. This approach offers a blueprint for the straightforward design of targeting molecules for new pathogens and emerging variants. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.

         <title>Front Cover: Retro&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;Type Acidic Ring&#8208;Opening of Triptycenes: A New Synthetic Approach to Acenes (Chem. Eur. J. 12/2022)</title>

The triptycene scaffold has been ring&#8208;opened by using an acidic retro&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type reaction to give its corresponding anthrone product. 9&#8208;Hydroxytriptycenes and unsubstituted triptycene were ring&#8208;opened by treatment with TfOH. The electron&#8208;donating group on the arene moiety allows the reaction to proceed in the presence of weaker acids. Additionally, the reaction has been applied toward the synthesis of tetracene. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Iwata, M. Shindo et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104160).

         <dc:description>
orange red TADF emitters consist of rigid donor and acceptor moieties exhibit excellent device efficiencies. However, achieving high color purity in orange red region is hindered due to strong charge&#8208;transfer characteristics of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type emitters. To overcome such issues, multi&#8208;resonance type emitters are proposed, and it shows high color purity along with good efficiencies in orange red organic light emitting diodes. As an alternative to the conventional system, hyper&#8208;fluorescence organic light emitting diodes show great attention towards future pure red TADF development.

         <title>Frontispiece: Lights and Shadows of DMSO as Solvent for Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 12, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current protocols for solution&#8208;processed tin halide perovskite thin films rely on the use of DMSO. However, this solvent was recently found to oxidise tin species. This source of defects in the films may be the reason for the bottlenecks in device performance and reproducibility. DMSO&#8208;free processes may avoid this problem, but lack a controlled crystallization so far. Understanding the chemistry of tin perovskites in new solvent systems would allow fabricating thin films of the highest quality.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 12, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this comprehensive review, orange red thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters are discussed in detail based on various molecular designs. The heteroaromatic&#8208;type emitters possessing high rigid core reveal better efficiency enhancement compared to low rigid cores. Moreover, this review focuses on how to achieve high color purity in orange red emitters while maintaining good OLED device performances.







Abstract
Pure organic molecules based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been successfully developed in recent years for their propitious application in highly efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). In the case of orange red emitters, the non&#8208;radiative process is known to be a serious issue due to its lower lying singlet energy level. However, recent studies indicate that there are tremendous efforts put to develop efficient orange red TADF emitters. In addition, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of heteroaromatic based orange red TADF OLEDs surpassed 30&#8201;%. Such heteroaromatic type emitters showed wide emission spectra; therefore, more attention is being paid to develop highly efficient orange red TADF emitters along with good color purity. Herein, the recent progress of orange red TADF emitters based on molecular structures, such as cyanobenzene, heteroaromatic, naphthalimide, and boron&#8208;based acceptors, are reviewed. Further, our insight on these acceptors has been provided by their photophysical studies and device performances. Future perspectives of orange red TADF emitters for real practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Dye&#8208;Conjugated Spinach RNA by Genetic Alphabet Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light emission by dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNA transcripts can be generated by genetic alphabet expansion. Dye&#8208;conjugated unnatural base substrates are site&#8208;specifically incorporated into Spinach RNA opposite to its unnatural base pairing partner in DNA templates by T7 transcription. The dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNAs or shorter versions robustly emit fluorescence.







Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting systems using an RNA aptamer&#8208;dye pair, such as Spinach RNA, are an attractive method for imaging and tracing RNA expression in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. We present an alternative Spinach method by genetic alphabet expansion using an unnatural base pair system, in which a dye&#8208;conjugated unnatural base substrate is site&#8208;specifically incorporated at a specific position in Spinach RNA by transcription involving the third base pair. The incorporation position was predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. This dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNA increased the thermal stability of the fluorescence, the robustness against ion sensitivity, and the resistance against photobleaching. Furthermore, we applied our method to Baby Spinach, a shorter version of Spinach, for dye conjugation toward the visible detection of transcripts. This is the first demonstration of an alternative RNA imaging method for a detection system using genetic alphabet expansion.

         <title>Disordered Low Molecular Weight Spiropyran Exhibiting Photoregulated Adhesion Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive adhesives are attractive functional materials. Differentiating from the reported azobenzene&#8208;containing adhesives with photoswitched adhesion&#8208;on or off property, a low molecular weight spiropyran that could exhibit photoregulated adhesion ability in multiple levels is disclosed in this work. In disordered solid state, the reported spiropyran could also gain photochromism with five different color states, which show one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence to the adhesion ability. This work provides a new strategy for developing functional materials by employing low molecular weight compounds.







Abstract
The functions of the materials composed of small molecules are highly dependent on their ordered molecular arrangements in both natural and artificial systems. Without ordered structure, small molecules hardly gain complicated functions, due to the absence of intermolecular covalent bond connection or strong network. Here, a low molecular weight spiropyran that could exhibit attractive photochromism and powerful adhesion property in disordered solid state is demonstrated. With maximum up to &#8764;8&#8197;MPa, the adhesion strength could be photoregulated in multiple levels, which also shows one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence to the specific color state. The working mechanism analysis on the photoregulated adhesion reveals that the isomer ratio of merocyanine form and the molecular packing density of spiropyran are the determining factors for the adhesion ability. The discovery of photoregulated adhesion from pure spiropyran provides a new strategy for developing functional materials by employing low molecular weight compounds.

         <title>Direct Crystallization of Diamine Radical Cations: Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Bond Formation from the Reaction of Triphenylamine with TiCl4, TiBr4, or SnCl4 versus Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Formation with SbCl5**

         <dc:description>
The direct synthesis of diamine radical cations in crystalline form produced through oxidation of triphenylamine followed by the formation of either a C&#8722;N or a C&#8208;C bond is reported. Although the oxidative coupling of triphenylamine is well studied, diamine products are rarely captured in their radical cation state. The neutral diamine most frequently obtained from this reaction pathway is N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine. Herein, the capture of radical cations of diamines in crystalline form in one step starting with neutral triphenylamine was demonstrated, and the formation of two products (the radical cations of N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediamine or N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine) depending on the oxidizing agent used was observed.

         <title>Prelithiation Reagents and Strategies on High Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of prelithiation is an effective pathway to supply Li source for compensating the lithium loss in the first cycle, thus promoting the energy density of batteries. This review outlines the chemical and electrochemical prelithiation methods for anodes and cathodes, with particularly discussion on the complexity of different prelithiation reagents/strategies and corresponding lithiation degree reached.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely employed in energy&#8208;storage applications owing to the relatively higher energy density and longer cycling life. However, they still need further improvement especially on the energy density to satisfy the increasing demands on the market. In this respect, the irreversible capacity loss (ICL) in the initial cycle is a critical challenge due to the lithium loss during the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the anode surface. The strategy of prelithiation was then proposed to compensate for the ICL in the anode and recover the energy density. Here, various methods of the prelithiation are summarized and classified according to the basic working mechanism. Further, considering the critical importance and promising progress of prelithiation in both fundamental research and real applications, this Review article is intended to discuss the considerations involved in the selection of prelithiation reagents/strategies and the electrochemical performance in full&#8208;cells. Moreover, insights are provided regarding the practical application prospects and the challenges that still need to be addressed.

         <title>Tuning Diradical Properties of Boron&#8208;Containing &#960;&#8208;Systems by Structural Isomerism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon was synthesized via the precise borylation of the &#946;&#8208;carbons of indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene. Because of the efficient conjugation between the boron atoms and &#960;&#8208;skeleton, this molecule exhibits downshifted energy levels, blue&#8208;shifted light absorption, smaller diradical character and weak paramagnetic resonance in comparison to its isomeric molecule, thus demonstrating the significant electronic effects of structural isomerism on diradical properties.







Abstract
Tuning diradical character is an important topic for organic diradicaloids. Herein, we report the precise borylation enabling structural isomerism as an effective strategy to modulate diradical character and thereby properties of organic diradicaloids. We synthesized a new B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon that has the indeno[1,2&#8208;b]fluorene &#960;&#8208;skeleton with the &#946;&#8208;carbons bonding to two boron atoms. Detailed theoretical and experimental results show that this bonding pattern leads to its distinctive electronic structures and properties in comparison to that of its isomeric molecule. This molecule has the efficient conjugation between boron atoms and &#960;&#8208;skeleton, resulting in downshifted LUMO and HOMO levels. Moreover, it exhibits smaller diradical character and thereby inhibited diradical properties, such as significantly blue&#8208;shifted light absorption, larger energy bandgap and weak para&#8208;magnetic resonance. Notably, this B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon possesses much stronger Lewis acidity and its Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts display enhanced diradical character, demonstrating the positive effects of Lewis coordination on modulating diradical performance.

         <title>Role of Anionic Backbone in NHC&#8208;Stabilized Coinage Metal Complexes: New Precursors for Atomic Layer Deposition
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes were synthesized, analyzed, and evaluated for their potential usage in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of coinage metal thin films. Employing the same set of diketonate&#8208;type ligands for both metals did result in thermally stable Cu(I) complexes suitable for ALD, while the Ag(I) complexes exhibit an inherently unstable nature and different bonding features. More information can be found in the Research Article by Anjana Devi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103798).

         <title>From light to structure:&#160;Photo initiators in two&#8208;photon polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) represents a powerful technique for the fabrication of precise three&#8208;dimensional structures on a micro&#8208; and nanometer scale for various applications. While many review articles are focusing on the used polymeric materials and their application in 2PP, to this date no review has discussed the class of two&#8208;photon photo initiators (2PI) in detail. Because the demand for highly efficient 2PI has increased in the last decades, different approaches in designing new efficient 2PIs occurred. This review summarizes the 2PIs known in literature and discusses their absorption behavior under one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) conditions, their two&#8208;photon cross sections&#160;as well as their efficiency under 2PP conditions. Here, the photo initiators are grouped depending on their chromophore system.&#160;In addition, the upcoming class of water&#8208;soluble photo initiators for tissue engineering will be discussed in detail. Their polymerization efficiencies are evaluated by fabrication windows (FW) depending on different laser intensities and writing speeds.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanded Mercaptocalixarenes: A New Kind of Macrocyclic Ligands for Stabilization of Polynuclear Thiolate Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The syntheses and properties of expanded 4&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;mercapto&#8208;calix[4]arenes, in which the methylene linkers are replaced by &#8208;CH  2  NRCH  2  &#8208; or &#8208;CH  2  NRCH  2  &#8208; and CH  2  NRCH  2  CH  2  CH  2  NRCH  2  &#8208; units, are described. The new macrocycles were obtained in a step&#8208;wise manner, utilizing fully protected, i.e. S&#8208;alkylated, derivatives of the oxidation&#8208;sensitive thiophenols in the cyclisation steps. Reductive cleavage of the macrobicyclic or macrotricyclic intermediates (  6  ,  7  ,  11  ) afforded the free thiophenols (H  4  8  , H  4  9  , and H  4  12  ) in preparative yields as their hydrochloride salts. The protected proligands can exist in two conformations, resembling the &#8220;cone&#8221; and &#8220;1,3&#8208;alternate&#8221; conformations found for the parent calix[4]arenes. The free macro&#8208;cycles do not show conformational isomerism, but are readily oxidized forming intramolecular disulfide linkages. Preliminary complexation experiments show that these expanded mercaptocalixarenes can serve as supporting ligands for tetranuclear thiolato clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Encapsulation of trimethine cyanine in cucurbit[8]uril: solution versus solid&#8208;state inclusion behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inclusion of polymethine cyanine dyes in the cavity of macrocyclic receptors is an effective strategy to alter their absorption and emission behavior in aqueous solution. In this paper, the effect of the host&#8208;guest interaction between cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and a model trimethine indocyanine (Cy3) on dye spectral properties and aggregation in water is investigated. Solution studies, performed by a combination of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques, indicate that the addition of CB[8] disrupts Cy3 aggregates leading to the formation of a 1:1 host&#8208;guest complex with an association constant of 1.5 &#215; 10  6  M  &#8722;1  . At concentrations suitable for NMR experiments, the slow formation of a supramolecular polymer was observed, followed by precipitation. Single crystals X&#8208;ray structure elucidation confirmed the formation of a polymer with 1:1 stoichiometry in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure engineering of BiSbSx nanocrystals embedded within sulfurized polyacrylonitrile fibers for high performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are regarded as promising candidates in next&#8208;generation energy storage technology; however, the electrode materials in PIBs are usually restricted by the shortcomings of large volume expansion and poor cycling stability stemming from a high resistance towards diffusion and insertion of large&#8208;sized K ions. In this study, BiSbSx  nanocrystals are rationally integrated with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) fibres&#160;through electrospinning technology with an annealing process. Such a unique structure, in which BiSbSx  nanocrystals are embedded inside the SPAN fibre, affords multiple binding sites and a short diffusion length for K+  to realize fast kinetics. In addition, the molecular structure of SPAN features robust chemical interactions for stationary diffluent discharge products. Thus, the electrode demonstrates a superior potassium storage performance with an&#160;excellent reversible capacity of 790 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;(at 0.1 A g&#8208;1  after 50 cycles) and&#160;and 472 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;(at 1 A g&#8208;1  after 2000 cycles).&#160;It's one of the best performances for metal dichalcogenides anodes for PIBs to date. The unusual performance of the BiSbSx@SPAN composite is attributed to the synergistic effects of the judicious nanostructure engineering of BiSbSx&#160;nanocrystals as well as the chemical interaction and confinement of SPAN fibres.</dc:description>

The unusual performance of the BiSbSx@SPAN composite is attributed to the synergistic effects of the judicious nanostructure engineering of BiSbSx&#160;nanocrystals as well as the chemical interaction and confinement of SPAN fibres.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and photophysical properties of 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobutadienes derived from ynamides bearing fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,1,4,4&#8208;Tetracyanobutadienes (TCBDs) bearing a large diversity of fluorophores were prepared following a multi&#8208;step synthesis. In a crucial last step, all compounds were obtained from the corresponding ynamides, which were particularly suitable for the formation of the TCBDs in the presence of tetracyanoethylene via a [2+2] cycloaddition/retroelectrocyclization step (CA&#8208;RE). Several fluorenyl derivatives in addition to phenanthrenyl and terphenyl ones provided ynamide&#8208;based TCBDs affording remarkable emission properties covering a large range of wavelengths. Those compounds emit both in solid state and in solution from the visible region to the NIR range, depending on the molecular structures. Quantum yields in cyclohexane reached unforeseen values for such derivatives, up to 7.8%. A huge sensitivity to the environment of the TCBDs has also been unraveled for most of the compounds since we observed a dramatic fall of the quantum yields when changing the solvent from cyclohexane to toluene, while they are almost non&#8208;emissive in dichloromethane.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Terminal Selective C&#8722;H Azidation of Proline&#8208;Containing Peptides: a Platform for Late&#8208;Stage Diversification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selective C&#8722;H azidation of up to 6 amino acids long proline&#8208;containing peptides is reported. In each example, the N&#8208;terminal residue was selectively functionalized even in presence of amino acids bearing tertiary aliphatic, benzylic and &#945; to heteroatoms C&#8722;H bonds. The azidated products were used in cycloaddition reactions and as masked imines for new C&#8722;C bond formations, allowing an easy access to diversified peptide scaffolds.







Abstract
A methodology for the C&#8722;H azidation of N&#8208;terminal proline&#8208;containing peptides was developed employing only commercially available reagents. Peptides bearing a broad range of functionalities and containing up to 6 amino acids were selectively azidated at the carbamate&#8208;protected N&#8208;terminal residue in presence of the numerous other functional groups present on the molecules. Post&#8208;functionalizations of the obtained aminal compounds were achieved: cycloaddition reactions or C&#8722;C bond formations via a sequence of imine formation/nucleophilic addition were performed, offering an easy access to diversified peptides.

         <title>Cellular Detection of a Mitochondria Targeted Brominated Vinyl Triphenylamine Optical Probe (TP&#8722;Br) by X&#8208;Ray Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized a new bimodal vinyltriphenylamine probe. TP&#8722;Br is an off&#8208;on fluorescent probe that targets mitochondria thanks to its lipophilic cationic structure. The probe was imaged by two modalities in cells: by one&#8208;photon or two&#8208;photon excitation fluorescence microscopy and by Scanning Synchrotron Radiation X&#8208;ray Fluorescence.







Abstract
Triphenylamine (TP) derivatives such as two&#8208;branch cationic vinylbenzimidazolium triphenylamine TP&#8722;2Bzim are promising turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes suitable for two&#8208;photon imaging, labelling mitochondria in live cells. Here, we designed two TP&#8722;2Bzim derivatives as bimodal probes suitable for X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging. The conjugation of the TP core with a rhenium tricarbonyl moiety in the TP&#8722;RePyta probe altered the localisation in live cells from mitochondria to lysosomes. The introduction of bromine on the TP core generated the TP&#8722;Br probe retaining good photophysical properties and mitochondria labelling in live cells. The influence of calcium channels in the uptake of TP&#8722;Br was studied. Synchrotron Radiation X&#8208;ray Fluorescence (SXRF) imaging of bromine enabled the detection of TP&#8722;Br and suggested a negligible presence of the probe in an unbound state in the incubated cells, a crucial point in the development of these probes. This study paves the way towards the development of TP probes as specific organelle stainers suitable for SXRF imaging.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Carbonyl Alkylative Amination Enabled by Titanium&#8208;Dioxide&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient nano TiO2&#8208;mediated carbonyl alkylative amination that proceeds by heterogeneous photoredox catalysis is reported. The use of nano titanium dioxide as photocatalyst allows efficient synthesis of diverse amines in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies reveal a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism involving the photoexcitation of TiO2 to generate alkyl radicals from carboxylic acids decarboxylation.







Abstract
Herein, a heterogeneous carbonyl alkylative amination reaction that proceeds by photoredox catalysis has been developed. The use of nano titanium dioxide (TiO2, 25&#8197;nm) as photocatalyst allows efficient synthesis of diverse amines in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies reveal a single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer mechanism involving the photoexcitation of TiO2 to generate alkyl radicals from carboxylic acids decarboxylation. This protocol highlights the utility of using heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysts to promote a practical and general synthesis of complex amines from readily available feedstocks.

         <title>Induced Near&#8208;Infrared Emission and Controlled Photooxidation based on Sulfonated Crown Ether in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble sulfonated crown ether makes very strong host&#8208;guest encapsulation with a set of push&#8208;pull&#8208;type dyes, which can greatly enhance the fluorescence emission from visible to near&#8208;infrared regions and significantly suppress the 1O2 generation and concomitant photooxidation ability of photosensitizers in aqueous media.







Abstract
Regulation of physio&#8208;chemical properties and reaction activities via noncovalent methodology has become one of increasingly significant topics in supramolecular chemistry and showed inventive applications in miscellaneous fields. Herein, we demonstrate that sulfonated crown ether can form very stable host&#8208;guest complexes with a series of push&#8208;pull&#8208;type photosensitizers, eventually leading to the dramatic fluorescence enhancement in visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Meanwhile, severe suppression in singlet oxygen (1O2) production is found, mainly due to the higher energy barriers between the excited single and triple states upon host&#8208;guest complexation. Moreover, such complexation&#8208;induced tuneable 1O2 generation systems has been utilized in adjusting the photochemical oxidation reactions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (anthracene) and sulfides ((methylthio)benzene) in water. This supramolecularly controlled photooxidation based on the selective molecular binding of crown ether with photosensitizers may provide a feasible and applicable strategy for monitoring and modulating many photocatalysis processes in aqueous phase.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Intermolecular Sulfonyl/Fluoromethyl Heteroarylation of Vinyl Ethers via Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component sulfonyl&#8208;heteroarylation of vinyl ethers with sulfinates and five&#8208;membered heteroaryl chlorides is reported. This protocol proceeds via a photoinduced electron transfer process of electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex between sulfinates and heteroaryl chlorides, enabling facile excess to &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl and &#946;&#8208;fluoromethyl &#945;&#8208;oxy alkyl heteroaromatics under mild and catalyst&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
We report a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component sulfonyl&#8208;heteroarylation of vinyl ethers with sulfinates and five&#8208;membered heteroaryl chlorides. This protocol proceeds via electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes between sulfinates and heteroaryl chlorides, giving &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl alkyl five&#8208;membered heteroarenes with high efficiency and excellent regioselectivity under mild and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Utilization of CF3SO2Na or CF2HSO2Na as coupling partners further achieves three&#8208;component fluoromethyl&#8208;arylation of vinyl ethers, furnishing a series of valuable CF3/CF2H&#8208;incorporated alkyl heterocycles under mild conditions.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Heterocyclic Chloroamines and Aziridines by Enantioselective Protonation of Catalytically Generated Enamines**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis enables the synthesis of chiral vicinal chloroamines via asymmetric protonation of catalytically generated prochiral chloroenamines. The process is highly enantioselective, with the origin of asymmetry and catalyst substituent effects elucidated by DFT calculations. The method allows access to rare heterocycle&#8208;substituted vicinal chloroamines, aziridines, and vicinal diamines.







Abstract
We report a method for the synthesis of chiral vicinal chloroamines via asymmetric protonation of catalytically generated prochiral chloroenamines using chiral Br&#248;nsted acids. The process is highly enantioselective, with the origin of asymmetry and catalyst substituent effects elucidated by DFT calculations. We show the utility of the method as an approach to the synthesis of a broad range of heterocycle&#8208;substituted aziridines by treatment of the chloroamines with base in a one&#8208;pot process, as well as the utility of the process to allow access to vicinal diamines.

         <title>Sequential Visible Light&#8208;Induced Reactions Using Different Photocatalysts: Transformation of Furans into 2&#8208;Pyridones via &#947;&#8208;Lactams Using a New Ring Expansion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic ring expansion reaction that transforms &#947;&#8208;lactams into 2&#8208;pyridones has been developed. This expansion was incorporated into a multi&#8208;photocatalyst one pot process that starts from readily accessible furans and uses two metal&#8208;free photocatalysts (methylene blue and eosin). The photocatalytic cleavage of C&#8722;I bonds activated by an electron donor at the neighbouring carbon is achieved, using eosin as photocatalyst.







Abstract
A new photocatalytic ring expansion reaction that transforms &#947;&#8208;lactams into 2&#8208;pyridones is described. The reaction is radical&#8208;triggered and was inspired by a late&#8208;stage oxidation commonly observed in fungal metabolism. The reaction is particularly powerful because it can be included in a one pot process which converts readily accessible furans directly into 2&#8208;pyridones through sequential photo&#8208;induced reactions (energy transfer and electron transfer). The study also unveiled unprecedented reactivity for the mild and metal&#8208;free photocatalyst eosin, wherein it is used to cleave a C&#8722;I bond activated only by an electron donor on the neighbouring carbon.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A total synthesis of the cyclic lipodepsipeptide natural product orfamide A was achieved. By developing a synthesis format using an aminoacid ester building block and SPPS protocol adaptation, a focused library of target compounds was obtained, in high yield and purity. Spectral and LC&#8208;HRMS data of all library members with the isolated natural product identified the  5  Leu residue to be  d  &#8208; and the 3&#8217;&#8208;OH group to be  R  &#8208;configured. The structural correction of orfamide A by chemical synthesis and analysis was confirmed by biological activity comparison in  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  , which indicated compound configuration to be important for bioactivity. Acute toxicity was also found against  Trypanosoma brucei  , the parasite causing African sleeping sickness.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic molecule (DCN&#8722;4CQA) with the absorbance region at 300&#8211;800&#8197;nm and photothermal conversion efficiency of 18.2&#8201;% under one sun was employed for fabricating flexible photothermal evaporators for solar steam and thermoelectric power generation.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial vaporization by localizing solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion to the air&#8722;water interface has attracted tremendous attention. In the process of converting solar energy into heat energy, photothermal materials play an essential role. Herein, a flexible solar&#8208;thermal material di&#8208;cyan substituted 5,12&#8208;dibutylquinacridone (DCN&#8722;4CQA)@Paper was developed by coating photothermal quinacridone derivatives on the cellulose paper. The DCN&#8722;4CQA@Paper combines desired chemical and physical properties, broadband light&#8208;absorbing, and shape&#8208;conforming abilities that render efficient photothermic vaporization. Notably, synergetic coupling of solar&#8208;steam and solar&#8208;electricity technologies by integrating DCN&#8722;4CQA@Paper and the thermoelectric devices is realized without trade&#8208;offs, highlighting the practical consideration toward more impactful solar heat exploitation. Such solar distillation and low&#8208;grade heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity generation functions can provide potential opportunities for fresh water and electricity supply in off&#8208;grid or remote areas.

         <title>Stereochemical Behavior of Pairs of P&#8208;stereogenic Phosphanyl Groups at the Dimethylxanthene Backbone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pair of vinyl phosphanyl substituents at the dimethylxanthene backbone undergoes a rather rapid epimerization reaction with a DFT calculated meso to rac isomerization barrier of ca. 22&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The low inversion barrier at phosphorus is likely due to a &#960;&#8208;conjugative effect. The addition of the strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 to the P&#8208;stereogenic phosphane probably proceeds through a reactive phospha&#8208;iminium intermediate with loss of the stereochemical information.







Abstract
The P&#8208;stereogenic bis(phosphanes) 7 and 9, featuring pairs of P(Mes)&#8208;ethynyl or vinyl substituents at the dimethyl xanthene backbone show rather low barriers of stereochemical inversion at phosphorus. &#960;&#8208;Conjugative effects are probably causing these low inversion barriers. Compound 7 reacted with B(C6F5)3 to form the nine&#8208;membered heterocyclic product 10, featuring a [P]&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;B(C6F5)3 substituent. Compound 7 was converted to the bis[P(Mes)vinyl] xanthene derivative 9, which gave the zwitterionic P(H)(Mes)&#8722;CH=CH&#8722;B(C6F5)3 containing product 16 upon treatment with B(C6F5)3. Thermally induced epimerization barriers at phosphorus of ca. 20 to 27&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 were calculated by DFT for the alkenyl&#8208; and alkynyl&#8208;P derived systems 6 to 9, 15 and 16 and experimentally determined for the examples 7 and 16.

         <title>Cyanide&#8208;Free Cyanation of sp2 and sp&#8208;Carbon Atoms by an Oxazole&#8208;Based Masked CN Source Using Flow Microreactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8722;CN behind the mask: Continuous&#8208;flow methodology for versatile cyanide&#8208;free cyanation of C(sp2) and C(sp) carbons has been developed by in&#8197;situ generating a novel oxazole based (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyloxazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) boronic acid [OxBA] reagent as a non&#8208;toxic carbon&#8208;bound masked &#8722;CN source. The four&#8208;step flow sequence consisting of lithiation/borylation, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and [4+2]/retro&#8208;[4+2] produced medicinally important benzonitrile analogues with good to excellent yields.







Abstract
This work reports a cyanide&#8208;free continuous&#8208;flow process for cyanation of sp2 and sp carbons to synthesize aryl, vinyl and acetylenic nitriles from (5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyloxazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl) boronic acid [OxBA] reagent as a sole source of carbon&#8208;bound masked &#8722;CN source. Non&#8208;toxic and stable OxBA reagent is generated by lithiation&#8208;borylation of bromo&#8208;oxazole, and the consecutive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling with aryl, vinyl, or acetylenic halides and demasking [4+2]/retro&#8208;[4+2] sequence were successfully accomplished to give the desired cyano compounds with reasonably good yields in a four&#8208;step flow manner. A unique feature of this cyanation protocol in flow enables to cyanate a variety of sp2 and sp carbons to produce a broad spectrum of aryl acetonitrile. It is envisaged that the OxBA based cyanation would replace existing unstable and toxic approaches as well as non&#8208;toxic cyanation using two different sources of &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;N&#8221; to incorporate the &#8722;CN group.

         <title>Unfolding the Role of Building Units of MOFs with Mechanistic Insight Towards Selective Metal Ions Detection in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potential emergence of fluorescence&#8208;based techniques has propelled research towards developing probes that can sense trace metal ions specifically. Although luminescent metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) are well suited for this application, the role of building blocks towards detection is not fully understood. In this work, a systematic screening by varying number of Lewis basic (pyridyl&#8208;N atoms) sites is carried out in a series of isostructural, robust UiO&#8208;67 MOFs, and targeting a model metal ion &#8211; Fe  3+  . All the three fluorescent MOFs are seen to present quenching response towards Fe  3+  ions in water. However, UiO&#8208;67@N exhibits highly selective and sensitive response, whereas emission of both UiO&#8208;67 and UiO67@NN is quenched by several metal ions. Detailed experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigation is carried out in addition to demonstration of UiO&#8208;67@N being able to sense trace amount of Fe  3+  ions in synthetic biological water sample. Further, UiO&#8208;67@N based mixed&#8208;matrix membrane (MMM) has been prepared and employed to mimic the real time Fe  3+  ions detection in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Potential of Hitherto Unexplored Base&#8208;Stabilized Borylenes in Dinitrogen Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Computational investigations were carried out to probe the potential of several dicoordinate, singly base&#8208;stabilized borylenes of the form [L&#8594;BR] (L = neutral Lewis base) in dinitrogen binding. The calculated reaction free energies and activation barriers associated with the formation of mono&#8208; and diborylene&#8208;N  2  adducts suggest the presence of thermally surmountable kinetic barriers towards their possible isolation. Our results show that the exergonicity of dinitrogen activation and fixation is linearly dependent on the natural charge at the boron center, which can be tuned to design novel boron&#8208;based compounds with potential applications to small&#8208;molecule activation. EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis reveals strong binding of dinitrogen to these base&#8208;stabilized borylenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;talk Between (Hydrogen)Sulfite and Metalloproteins: Impact on Human Health</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic effect of sulfite and metalloproteins is a significant correlation with human health. The role and fate of sulfite is discussed in different perspectives &#8208; as a toxic substance, its biochemical transformation by two key enzymes, sulfite oxidase (sulfite&#8208;to&#8208;sulfate) and sulfite reductase (sulfite&#8208;to&#8208;sulfide), formation of sulfite radical by heme proteins (peroxidases) and neutralization of toxic sulfite radicals by globins.







Abstract
Sulfite is a potent toxic substance causing harm to multi&#8208;organ in human. Despite toxicity, it is widely used as preservative, anti&#8208;browning and anti&#8208;oxidant in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, which cause easy admission of sulfite in human. Sulfite is also produced endogenously during the catabolism of cysteine and methionine. In vivo, the serum sulfite level at physiological range is strictly maintained by a molybdenum dependent sulfite oxidase (SO), which catalyzes sulfite to sulfate oxidation via a two&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. The loss of SO activity causes high serum sulfite level that fosters several diseases, including asthma, neurological dysfunction, birth defects, and heart diseases. The cytotoxicity of (bi)sulfite is implicated as sulfite radicals, which are generated by mainly heme&#8208;peroxidases via a one&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. On the other hand, the toxic sulfite radicals are neutralized to sulfite by heme&#8208;globins. The enzymatic reduction of sulfite to sulfide is catalyzed by sulfite reductase, which contains an unusual metal cofactor, siroheme&#8208;[4Fe4S]&#8208;cluster. Overall, the interaction of sulfite with various metalloproteins in&#8197;vivo is a close relation with human health. Therefore, this review describes the metabolic conversion of (bi)sulfite to sulfate, sulfite radical or sulfide via oxidation or reduction pathways by various metalloproteins (specially SOs, peroxidases, heme&#8208;globins, and sulfite reductases), and the potential applications of sulfite in biosensors/biofuel cells, anti&#8208;browning, and advance oxidation process.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Axially Chiral C&#8211;N Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules with restricted rotation around a single bond or atropisomers are found in a wide number of natural products and bioactive molecules as well as in chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis and smart materials. Although&#160; most &#160;of these compounds are biaryls and heterobiaryls displaying a C&#8211;C stereogenic axis, there is a growing interest in less common and more challenging axially chiral C&#8211;N atropisomers. This review offers an overview of the&#160; various &#160; methodologies available for their asymmetric synthesis. A brief introduction is initially given to contextualize these axially chiral skeletons, including a historical background and examples of natural products containing axially chiral C&#8211;N axes. The preparation of different families of C&#8211;N based atropisomers is then presented from anilides to chiral five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring heterocycles. Special emphasis&#160; has been &#160;given to modern catalytic asymmetric&#160; strategies &#160;over the past decade for the synthesis of these chiral scaffolds. Applications of these methods to the preparation of natural products and biologically active molecules will be highlighted along the text</dc:description>

         <title>Direct gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenylation of X&#8211;H Bonds with Trifluoromethyl Ketone N&#8208;Triftosylhydrazones for Synthesis of Tetrasubstituted Heteroatomic gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct gem &#8208;difluoroalkenylation of X&#8211;H bonds represents the most straightforward approach to access heteroatomic gem &#8208;difluoroalkenes that, as the isostere of the carbonyl group, have great potency in drug discovery. However, the construction of tetrasubstituted heteroatomic gem &#8208;difluoroalkenes by this strategy is still an unsolved problem. Here, we report the first direct X&#8211;H bond gem &#8208;difluoroalkenylation of amines and alcohols with trifluoromethyl ketone N &#8208;triftosylhydrazones under silver (for (hetero)aryl hydrazones) or rhodium (for alkyl hydrazones), thereby providing a most powerful method for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted heteroatomic gem &#8208;difluoroalkenes. This method features broad substrate scope, high product yield, excellent functional group tolerance, and operational simplicity (open air condition). Moreover, the site&#8208;specific replacement of the carbonyl group with a gem &#8208;difluorovinyl ether bioisostere in drug Trimebutine and the post&#8208;modification of bioactive molecules demonstrated the potency of this method in the medicinal research. Finally, the reaction mechanism was investigated by combining experiments and DFT calculations, and disclosed that the key step of HF elimination occurred via five&#8208;membered ring transition state, and the difference in the electrophilicity of Ag&#8208; and Rh&#8208;carbenes as well as the multiple intermolecular interactions rendered the effectiveness of Rh catalyst selectively for alkyl hydrazones.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanomaterials with oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like activities have potential in antibacterial therapy. The optimal activity of most nanozymes occurred in acidic pH (3.0&#8211;5.0), while the pH in biological systems is mostly near neutral. Herein, a general system using 9&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;modified diphenylalanine (FmocFF) hydrogel for enhancing oxidase&#8208; and peroxidase&#8208;like activities of Pt NPs and other typical enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials at neutral or even alkaline pH is proposed. In this system, Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel provides an acidic microenvironment for Pt NPs due to hydrogen protons (H  +  ) produced by the dissociation of F at neutral pH. As a result, Pt NPs exhibits 6&#8208;fold enhanced oxidase&#8208;like and 26&#8208;fold peroxidase&#8208;like activity after being encapsulated into Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel at pH 7.0. Based on outstanding enzymatic activities and the antibacterial activity of Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel itself, Pt&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;FF hydrogel realizes excellent antibacterial effect. This design provides a universal strategy to break pH limitation of nanozymes, and promotes the biological applications of nanozymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Antibody&#8208;Rhamnose Cluster Conjugates Show Potent Complement&#8208;Dependent Cell Killing by Recruiting Natural Antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of homogeneous antibody&#8208;rhamnose and antibody&#8208;&#945;Gal cluster conjugates is described. The synthesis was achieved through a modular antibody Fc&#8208;glycan remodeling that includes site&#8208;specific chemoenzymatic Fc&#8208;glycan functionalization and subsequent click conjugation of synthetic rhamnose&#8208; and &#945;Gal trisaccharide clusters. A comparative cell&#8208;based assay indicated that the antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates showed potent complement&#8208;dependent targeted cancer cell killing by recruiting natural anti&#8208;rhamnose antibodies.







Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are one of the most rapidly growing drug classes used for the treatment of cancer, infectious and autoimmune diseases. Complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is one of the effector functions for antibodies to deplete target cells. We report here an efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined conjugates of a monoclonal antibody with a rhamnose&#8208; and an &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to recruit natural anti&#8208;rhamnose and anti&#8208;&#945;Gal antibodies, respectively, to enhance the CDC&#8208;dependent targeted cell killing. The synthesis was achieved by using a modular antibody Fc&#8208;glycan remodeling method that includes site&#8208;specific chemoenzymatic Fc&#8208;glycan functionalization and subsequent click conjugation of synthetic rhamnose&#8208; and &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to provide the respective homogeneous antibody conjugates. Cell&#8208;based assays indicated that the antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates could mediate potent CDC activity for targeted cancer cell killing and showed much more potent efficacy than the antibody&#8208;&#945;Gal trisaccharide cluster conjugates for CDC effects.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Eucophylline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two strategies based respectively on the free&#8208;radical carbo&#8208; and sulfonyl&#8208;cyanation of cyclopropenes and cyclobutenes were developed to achieve the total enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;eucophylline, a monoterpene alkaloid isolated from Leuconotis eugenifolius.







Abstract
The total enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;eucophylline 1 was achieved using as a key&#8208;structural motif a chiral piperidinone bearing the natural product all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. The elaboration of the latter is based on two strategies relying on the free&#8208;radical carbo&#8208;cyanation and sulfonyl&#8208;cyanation respectively of enantiopure substituted cyclopropenes and cyclobutenes. Co&#8208; or Ni&#8208;boride reduction of the nitrile functional group along with the cyclopropane and cyclobutane ring&#8208;opening then led to the formation of the chiral piperidinone ring. Further elaboration of the latter into the key 1&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane motif followed by its coupling with a 2&#8208;cyanoaniline allowed the formation of the tetrahydrobenzo[b][1,8]&#8208;naphthyridine skeleton of 1, which was finally accessible in 17 steps and 5.9&#8201;% overall yield from 1,1&#8208;dibromobutene.

         <dc:description>Herein we report a Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction of allenyl sulfides and  a  &#8208;diazoesters, which provides an efficient synthetic route to enantio&#8208;enriched chiral tertiary homopropargylic sulfides. This reaction features high enantioselectivities (up to 96%  ee  ) and good functional group tolerance. The alkyl substituted  a  &#8208;diazoester was demonstrated as the efficient substrates in the asymmetric Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction. Mechanistic studies, including kinetic experiments, were conducted to gain insights into the details of the reaction pathway. The potential synthetic utility of this protocol has also been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Unique Platforms to Gain Insight of &#963;&#8208;Hole Interactions for the Removal of Organic Dyes from Aquatic Ecosystems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of high crystallinity and rich host&#8208;guest chemistry in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), have situated them in an advantageous position, with respect to traditional porous materials, to gain insight on specific weak noncovalent supramolecular interactions. In particular, sulfur s&#8208;hole interactions are known to play a key role in the biological activity of living beings as well as on relevant molecular recognitions processes. However, so far, they have been barely explored. Here, we describe both how the combination of the intrinsic features of MOFs, especially the possibility of using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography (SCXRD), can be an extremely valuable tool to gain insight on sulfur s&#8208;hole interactions, and how their rational exploitation can be enormously useful in the efficient removal of harmful organic molecules from aquatic ecosystems. Thus, we have used a MOF, prepared from the amino acid L&#8208;methionine and possessing channels decorated with &#8211;CH2CH2SCH3 thioalkyl chains, to remove a family of organic dyes at very low concentrations (10 ppm) from water. This MOF is able to efficiently capture the four dyes in a very fast manner, reaching within five minutes nearly the maximum removal. Remarkably, the crystal structure of the different organic dyes within MOFs channels could be determined by SCXRD. This have enabled us to directly visualize the important role sulfur s&#8208;hole interactions play on the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions, representing one of the first studies on the rational exploitation of s&#8208;hole interactions for water remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive Characterization of Shredded Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Recycling Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report on an analytical study of dry&#8208;shredded lithium ion battery (LIB) materials with unknown composition. Samples from an industrial recycling process were analyzed concerning the elemental composition and (organic) compound speciation. Deep understanding of the base material for LIB recycling was obtained by identification and analysis of transition metal stoichiometry, current collector metals, base electrolyte and electrolyte additive residues, aging marker molecules and polymer binder fingerprints. For reversed engineering purposes, the main electrode and electrolyte chemistries were traced back to pristine materials. Furthermore, possible lifetime application and accompanied aging was evaluated based on target analysis on characteristic molecules described in literature. With this, the reported analytics provided precious information for value estimation of the undefined spent batteries and enabled tailored recycling process deliberations. The comprehensive feedstock characterization shown in this work paves the way for targeted process control in LIB recycling processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Factors Governing the Catalytic Insertion of CO2 into Arenes &#8211; A DFT Case Study for Pd and Pt Phosphane Sulfonamido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potential of Pd/Pt complexes for catalytic carboxylation of arenes with CO  2  is investigated by means of computational chemistry. Recently we reported that the bis[(2&#8208;methoxyphenyl)phosphino]&#8208;benzenesulfonamido palladium complex  1  inserts CO  2  reversibly in its Pd&#8208;C(aryl) bond generating carboxylato complex  2  . In the present work we study how geometric and electronic factors of various ligands and substrates influence the overall activation barrier (energy span, ES) of a potential catalytic cycle for arene carboxylation comprising this elementary step. The tendency of the key intermediates to dimerize and thus deactivating the potential catalysts is examined as well as the role of the base, which inevitably is needed to stabilize the reaction product. We show that Pd and Pt complexes  I(Pd)&#8208;L16&#8208;S1  and  I(Pt)&#8208;L16&#8208;S1  do not dimerize, enable the computation of complete catalytic cycles, and show interestingly low ES values of 26.8 and 24.5 kcal/mol, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;temperature quantum tunneling and hydrogen bonding rearrangements characterize the solid&#8208;solid phase transitions in a phosphonium&#8208;based protic ionic liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the complex phase behavior of the glass forming protic ionic liquid octylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [C 8 H 17 PD 3 ][NTf 2 ] by means of solidstate NMR spectroscopy. Combined line shape and spin relaxation studies of the deuterons in the PD 3 group of the octylphosphonium cation allow to map and correlate the phase behavior for a broad temperature range from 71 K to 343 K. In the solid PIL at 71 K, we observed a static state, characterized by the first deuteron quadrupole coupling constant reported for PD 3 deuterons. A transition enthalpy of about 12 kJ mol &#8208;1 from the static to the mobile state with increasing temperature suggests the breaking of a weak, charge&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond between cation and anion. The highly mobile phase above 100 K exhibits an almost disappearing activation barrier, strongly indicating quantum tunneling. Thus, we provide first evidence of tunneling driven mobility of the hydrogen bonded P&#8208;D moieties in the glassy state of PILs, already at surprisingly high temperatures up to 200 K. Above 250 K, the mobile phase turns from anisotropic to isotropic motion, and indicates strong internal rotation of the PD 3 group. The analyzed line shapes and spin relaxation times allow us to link the structural and dynamical behavior at molecular level with the phase behavior beyond the DSC traces .</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Evolution at Visible Light Wavelengths Using a Photocathode with Modal Strong Coupling between Plasmons and a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot Nanocavity</title>

         <dc:description>Hot&#8208;hole injection from plasmonic metal nanoparticles to the valence band of p&#8208;type semiconductors and reduction by hot electrons should be improved for efficient and tuneable reduction to obtain beneficial chemical compounds. We employed the concept of modal strong coupling between plasmons and a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) nanocavity to enhance the hot&#8208;hole injection efficiency. We fabricated a photocathode composed of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;NPs), p&#8208;type nickel oxide (NiO), and a platinum film (Pt film) (ANP). The ANP structure absorbs visible light over a broad wavelength range from 500 nm to 850 nm via hybrid modes based on the modal strong coupling between the plasmons of Au&#8208;NPs and the FP nanocavity of NiO on a Pt film. All wavelength regions of the hybrid modes of the modal coupling system promoted hot&#8208;hole injection from the Au&#8208;NPs to NiO and proton/water reduction by hot electrons. The incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency based on H 2 evolution through water/proton reduction by hot electrons reached 0.2% at 650 nm and 0.04% at 800 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the C/N Ratio of C&#8208;Rich Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) Materials by the Melamine/Carboxylic Acid Adduct Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile synthesis route to graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4)&#8208;type materials CNx having a large range of composition (0.66&lt;x&lt;1.4) is presented. The process is based on the decomposition of melamine/carboxylic acid adducts and yields peculiar 2D nanostructures with presumably C&#8208;rich nanodomains embedded in g&#8208;C3N4 domains. The characteristics of these nanocomposites are investigated by different techniques (X&#8208;ray diffraction, thermal analysis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and many others).







Abstract
C&#8208;rich graphitic carbonitride materials (CNx) with a large range of compositions have been prepared thanks to the self&#8208;assembly, in different ratios, of melamine (M) and a panel of polycarboxylic acids (A) such as oxalic, tartaric and citric acid. The thermal conversion of the formed adducts (MAy), led to CNx phases, with x ranging from 0.66 to 1.4 (x=1.33 for g&#8208;C3N4 for comparison). The properties of these materials were examined by different techniques (XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, TGA, XPS and DRIFT). It appears that the increase in the C content is associated with the disappearance of the long&#8208;range order of heptazine units and an increase in the sub&#8208;nanometer carbon&#8208;rich cluster size within the graphitic g&#8208;C3N4 structure. This trend is followed by a significant increase in the interlayer spacing and a lower proportion of N=C&#8722;N bonds compared to C=C bonds. The thermal stability under an inert atmosphere of these phases and their UV&#8208;Visible absorbance properties were also investigated.

         <title>Benchmarking of Density Functionals for the Description of Optical Properties of Newly Synthesized &#960;&#8208;Conjugated TADF Blue Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and computational guidelines based on benchmarking of DFT functionals for new &#960;&#8208;conjugated TADF emitters are reported. The three target compounds were obtained by multistep synthesis, including metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions and functional&#8208;group transformations. The emitters feature electron donors and acceptors moderately coupled through a spacer. The importance of the treatment of long&#8208;range exchange within the functionals and their ability to balance the &#960;&#8208;delocalization of the separate molecular fragments are explicitly outlined.







Abstract
Computational modeling of the optical characteristics of organic molecules with potential for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) may assist markedly the development of more efficient emitting materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Recent theoretical studies in this area employ mostly methods from density functional theory (DFT). In order to obtain accurate predictions within this approach, the choice of a proper functional is crucial. In the current study, we focus on testing the performance of a set of DFT functionals for estimation of the excitation and emission energy and the excited singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of three newly synthesized compounds with capacity for TADF. The emitters are designed specifically to enable charge transfer by &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation, at the same time possessing high&#8208;energy excited triplet states. The functionals chosen for testing are from various groups ranging from gradient&#8208;corrected through global hybrids to range&#8208;separated ones. The results show that the monitored optical properties are especially sensitive to how the long&#8208;range part of the exchange energy is treated within the functional. The accurate functional should also be able to provide well balanced distribution of the &#960;&#8208;electrons among the molecular fragments. Global hybrids with moderate (less than 0.4) share of exact exchange (B3LYP, PBE0) and the meta&#8208;GGA HSE06 are outlined as the best performing methods for the systems under study. They can predict all important optical parameters correctly, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

A spin&#8208;selective tribo&#8208;chemical reaction using a dinuclear lanthanide complex is demonstrated for the first time. The dinuclear complex is composed of two EuIII ions, hexafluoroacetylacetonato ligands, and anthracene&#8208;based phosphine oxide bridges. Single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed a face&#8208;to&#8208;face&#8208;type anthracene dimer structure in the dinuclear EuIII complex. Mechanical stimulus on the dinuclear EuIII complex induced selective formation of oxidized anthracene. This first spin&#8208;selective tribo&#8208;chemical reaction using a EuIII complex will offer new possibilities for the development of tribo&#8208;excitation chemistry.

         <title>Investigating a Boronate&#8208;Affinity&#8208;Guided Acylation Reaction for Labelling Native Antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding function: A boronate&#8208;affinity ligand and an S&#8208;aryl thioester have been developed that are capable of labelling native Abs with a functional molecule. Additionally, a photoactivatable crosslinker allows purification of labelled Abs in a reagentless manner, thereby producing homogeneous Ab&#8208;drug conjugates.







Abstract
The excellent molecular recognition capabilities of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have opened up exciting opportunities for biotherapeutic discovery. Taking advantage of the full potential of this tool necessitates affinity ligands capable of conjugating directly with small molecules to a defined degree of biorthogonality, especially when modifying natural Abs. Herein, a bioorthogonal boronate&#8208;affinity&#8208;based Ab ligand featuring a 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine and an S&#8208;aryl thioester to label full&#8208;length Abs is reported. The photoactivatable linker in the acyl donor facilitated purification of azide&#8208;labelled Ab (N3&#8208;Ab) was quantitatively cleaved upon brief exposure to UV light while retaining the original Ab activity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adding function&lt;/b&gt;: A boronate-affinity ligand and an S-aryl thioester have been developed that are capable of labelling native Abs with a functional molecule. Additionally, a photoactivatable crosslinker allows purification of labelled Abs in a reagentless manner, thereby producing homogeneous Ab-drug conjugates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excellent molecular recognition capabilities of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have opened up exciting opportunities for biotherapeutic discovery. Taking advantage of the full potential of this tool necessitates affinity ligands capable of conjugating directly with small molecules to a defined degree of biorthogonality, especially when modifying natural Abs. Herein, a bioorthogonal boronate-affinity-based Ab ligand featuring a 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine and an S-aryl thioester to label full-length Abs is reported. The photoactivatable linker in the acyl donor facilitated purification of azide-labelled Ab (N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Ab) was quantitatively cleaved upon brief exposure to UV light while retaining the original Ab activity. Click reactions enabled the precise addition of biotin, a fluorophore, and a pharmacological agent to the purified N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Abs. The resulting immunoconjugate showed selectivity against targeted cells. Bioorthogonal traceless design and reagentless purification allow this strategy to be a powerful tool to engineer native antibodies amenable to therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design and Integrative Assembly of Heteromeric Metalla[2]Catenanes Featuring Cp*Ir/Rh Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrative assembly of a series of heteromeric metalla[2]catenanes was realized on account of prior precise design. A new design strategy was proposed. The design strategy essentially follows the principle of shape complementarity. Based on careful rational design of the functional groups, the shape and the size of the building blocks, the integrative assembly of a series of heteromeric [2]catenanes were successfully achieved both by assembly of two pre&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;rectangles and by one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
We report a design strategy for integrative assembly of heteromeric [2]catenanes. The design focuses on the shape and functional group match of two different metalla&#8208;rectangles. A series of dipyridyl ligands with different lengths, widths and functional groups were designed and used for assembly experiments. Six heteromeric [2]catenanes were obtained both by direct mixture of two pre&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;rectangles and one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly. Multiple analytic methods were employed to characterize the catenanes, including single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis.

         <title>The Decisive Role of Spin States and Spin Coupling in Dictating Selective O2 Adsorption in Chromium(II) Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of spin state and spin coupling in gas binding selectivity in MOFs has been uncovered using periodic DFT calculations. The electron&#8208;transfer mechanism adopted by gaseous O2 leads to its strongly spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent binding, unlike the case for N2 and H2. O2/N2&#8208;selective adsorption/desorption processes have high commercial value, and this work offers a new strategy for such selective control.







Abstract
The coordinatively unsaturated chromium(II)&#8208;based Cr3[(Cr4Cl)3(BTT)8]2 (Cr&#8722;BTT; BTT3&#8722;=1,3,5&#8208;benzenetristetrazolate) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) has been shown to exhibit exceptional selectivity towards adsorption of O2 over N2/H2. Using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we attempted to decipher the origin of this puzzling selectivity. By computing and analyzing the magnetic exchange coupling, binding energies, the partial density of states (pDOS), and adsorption isotherms for the pristine and gas&#8208;bound MOFs [(Cr4(X)4Cl)3(BTT)8]3&#8722; (X=O2, N2, and H2), we unequivocally established the role of spin states and spin coupling in controlling the gas selectivity. The computed geometries and gas adsorption isotherms are consistent with the earlier experiments. The binding of O2 to the MOF follows an electron&#8208;transfer mechanism resulting in a CrIII superoxo species (O2.&#8722;) with a very strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the two centers, whereas N2/H2 are found to weakly interact with the metal center and hence only slightly perturb the associated coupling constants. Although the gas&#8208;bound and unbound MOFs have an S=0 ground state (GS), the nature of spin the configurations and the associated magnetic exchanges are dramatically different. The binding energy and the number of oxygen molecules that can favorably bind to the Cr center were found to vary with respect to the spin state, with a significant energy margin (47.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). This study offers a hitherto unknown strategy of using spin state/spin couplings to control gas adsorption selectivity in MOFs.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to welcome guests: In this review, we summarize the current strategies for introducing guest molecules into MOFs to improve their proton conductivity, and divide the guest molecules into four types. We also present the challenges and prospects of applying this strategy for these solid proton conducting materials.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a porous frame material, exhibit considerable electrical conductivity. In recent decades, research on the proton conductivity of MOFs has made gratifying progress. In this review, the designable guest molecules encapsulated into MOFs are summarized and generalized into four types in terms of promoting proton conductive performance, and then recent progress in the promotion of proton conductivity by MOFs encapsulating guest molecules is discussed. The existing challenges and prospects for the development of this strategy for promoting MOFs&#8217; proton conductivity are also listed.

Visible&#8208;light photoswitching: A photoswitchable ligand and palladium(II) ions form a dynamic mixture of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular structures. Visible&#8208;light photoswitching of the azobenzene&#8208;based ligand reversibly pumps the system away from equilibrium towards the thermodynamically unstable structure.







Abstract
A photoswitchable ligand and palladium(II) ions form a dynamic mixture of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular structures. The photoswitching ligand is an ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzene with appended pyridyl groups. Combining the E&#8208;isomer with palladium(II) salts affords a double&#8208;walled triangle with composition [Pd3L6]6+ and a distorted tetrahedron [Pd4L8]8+ (1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio at 298&#8197;K). Irradiation with 410&#8197;nm light generates a photostationary state with approximately 80&#8201;% of the E&#8208;isomer of the ligand and results in the selective disassembly of the tetrahedron, the more thermodynamically stable structure, and the formation of the triangle, the more kinetically inert product. The triangle is then slowly transformed back into the tetrahedron over 2&#8197;days at 333&#8197;K. The Z&#8208;isomer of the ligand does not form any well&#8208;defined structures and has a thermal half&#8208;life of 25&#8197;days at 298&#8197;K. This approach shows how a thermodynamically preferred self&#8208;assembled structure can be reversibly pumped to a kinetic trap by small perturbations of the isomer distribution using non&#8208;destructive visible light.

Porous UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 encapsulated AuPt alloy NPs exhibit a significant enhancement in the CO2 hydrogenation under low temperature (150&#8201;&#176;C). The outstanding performance of AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 was attributed to the synergetic effect induced by plasmonic metal Au, active metal Pt, and versatile substrate UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Importantly, the AuPt alloy structure retains both the optical behavior of plasmonic metal and the reactive behavior of catalytic metal. This construction strategy provides guidance for the preparation of high&#8208;performance plasmonic catalysts.







Abstract
Exploring new catalytic strategies for achieving efficient CO2 hydrogenation under mild conditions is of great significance for environmental remediation. Herein, a composite photocatalyst Zr&#8208;based MOF encapsulated plasmonic AuPt alloy nanoparticles (AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2) was successfully constructed for the efficient photothermal catalysis of CO2 hydrogenation. Under light irradiation at 150&#8201;&#176;C, AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 achieved a CO production rate of 1451&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 91&#8201;% selectivity, which far exceeded those obtained by Au@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 with Pt shell on Au (599&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and Au@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 (218&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). The outstanding performances of AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 were attributed to the synergetic effect originating from the plasmonic metal Au, doped active metal Pt, and encapsulation structure of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 shell. This work provides a new way for photothermal catalysis of CO2 and a reference for the design of high&#8208;performance plasmonic catalysts.

Cocrystallization of TEMPO with a series of dithiadiazolyl (DTDA) radicals, p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN), led to the isolation of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 radical&#8208;radical cocrystals [p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN]2[TEMPO] that exhibit a common S4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O structural motif. Computational studies reflect the robust nature of this interaction and identify a well&#8208;isolated S=
 spin ground state, largely localized on the TEMPO radical.







Abstract
Cocrystallization of the dithiadiazolyl (DTDA) radicals p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN) with TEMPO afforded the 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystals [p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN]2[TEMPO] (1&#8211;5) whose structures all reflect a common S4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O supramolecular motif. The nature of this interaction was probed by DFT calculations (M06/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ) on 1 which revealed that the enthalpy of formation of the [C6F5CNSSN]2[TEMPO] supramolecular motif from [C6F5CNSSN]2 and TEMPO is substantial (&#8722;54.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Electronic structure calculations revealed a TEMPO&#8208;based doublet S=
 configuration as the ground state with limited spin density on the DTDA rings (2.4&#8201;%). The corresponding spin quartet state is +78.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 higher in energy. An atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules analysis reveals four bond critical points (BCPs) between the TEMPO O and the DTDA S atoms as well as additional BCPs between selected DTDA S atoms and methyl H atoms of the TEMPO molecule. Herein, the structures of 2&#8211;5 are considered within the context of a hierarchical view of competing and complementary intermolecular interactions; in particular, the established supramolecular CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S&#8722;S synthon is sacrificed in order to form the new S4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Chemical Protein Synthesis Utilizing Fmoc&#8208;Masked Selenazolidine to Address the Redox Functionality of Human Selenoprotein F**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of the thioredoxin&#8208;like domain of the ER human selenoprotein F using novel Fmoc&#8208;protected selenazolidine is reported. This allowed us to perform different in&#8197;vitro biological characterizations, including redox potential determination, insulin turbidimetric assay, and the effect on the oxidative folding of Cys&#8208;rich protein models. Our results support that SELENOF acts as a reductase for non&#8208;native disulfide bonds in the ER.







Abstract
Human SELENOF is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) selenoprotein that contains the redox active motif CXU (C is cysteine and U is selenocysteine), resembling the redox motif of thiol&#8208;disulfide oxidoreductases (CXXC). Like other selenoproteins, the challenge in accessing SELENOF has somewhat limited its full biological characterization thus far. Here we present the one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of the thioredoxin&#8208;like domain of SELENOF, highlighted by the use of Fmoc&#8208;protected selenazolidine, native chemical ligations and deselenization reactions. The redox potential of the CXU motif, together with insulin turbidimetric assay suggested that SELENOF may catalyze the reduction of disulfides in misfolded proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SELENOF is not a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)&#8208;like enzyme, as it did not enhance the folding of the two protein models; bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and hirudin. These studies suggest that SELENOF may be responsible for reducing the non&#8208;native disulfide bonds of misfolded glycoproteins as part of the quality control system in the ER.

         <title>Investigation of Molecular Iridium Fluorides IrFn (n = 1&#8208;6): A Combined Matrix&#8208;Isolation and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photo&#8208;initiated defluorination of iridium hexafluoride (IrF  6  ) was investigated in neon and argon matrices at 6 K, and their photoproducts are characterized by IR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The primary photoproducts obtained after irradiation with  l  = 365 nm are iridium pentafluoride (IrF  5  ) and iridium trifluoride (IrF  3  ), while longer irradiation of the same matrix with  l  = 278 nm produced iridium tetrafluoride (IrF  4  ) and iridium difluoride (IrF  2  ) by Ir&#8208;F bond cleavage or F  2  elimination. In addition, IrF  5  can be reversed to IrF  6  by adding a F atom when exposed to blue&#8208;light (  l  = 470 nm ) irradiation. Laser irradiation (  l  = 266 nm) of IrF  4  also generated IrF  6  , IrF  5  , IrF  3  and IrF  2  . Alternatively, molecular binary iridium fluorides IrF  n  (  n  = 1&#8208;6) were produced by co&#8208;deposition of laser&#8208;ablated iridium atoms with elemental fluorine in excess neon and argon matrices under cryogenic conditions. Computational studies up to scalar relativistic CCSD(T)/triple&#8208;  &#950;  level and two&#8208;component quasirelativistic DFT computations including spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects supported the formation of these products and provided detailed insights into their molecular structures by their characteristic Ir&#8208;F stretching bands. Compared to the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, the influence of spin&#8208;orbit coupling dominates in IrF  5  , leading to a triplet ground state with  C  4v  symmetry, which was spectroscopically detected in solid argon and neon matrices.</dc:description>

In addition, IrF  5  can be reversed to IrF  6  by adding a F atom when exposed to blue-light (  l  = 470 nm ) irradiation. Laser irradiation (  l  = 266 nm) of IrF  4  also generated IrF  6  , IrF  5  , IrF  3  and IrF  2  . Alternatively, molecular binary iridium fluorides IrF  n  (  n  = 1-6) were produced by co-deposition of laser-ablated iridium atoms with elemental fluorine in excess neon and argon matrices under cryogenic conditions. Computational studies up to scalar relativistic CCSD(T)/triple-  &#950;  level and two-component quasirelativistic DFT computations including spin-orbit coupling effects supported the formation of these products and provided detailed insights into their molecular structures by their characteristic Ir-F stretching bands. Compared to the Jahn-Teller effect, the influence of spin-orbit coupling dominates in IrF  5  , leading to a triplet ground state with  C  4v  symmetry, which was spectroscopically detected in solid argon and neon matrices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Properties of Bromine Fused Salts Based on Quaternary Ammonium Molecules and Their Relevance for Use in a Hydrogen Bromine Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Properties of fused salts of quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) and various polybromides (PB) are investigated for the first time systematically on their applicability in a H2/Br2 flow battery. Fused salt capacities of up to 730&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 are reached. Conductivity, which bases on a hopping mechanism between PBs, viscosity and temperature stability depend on the chosen QAC and the fractions of PBs present at a selected state of charge of the electrolyte.







Abstract
Bromine complexing agents (BCA) in aqueous electrolytes for hydrogen bromine flow batteries are used to reduce bromine&#8216;s vapour pressure, while an insoluble and liquid fused salt is formed. The properties (concentrations, composition, conductivity and viscosity) of this fused salt are investigated in this study systematically ex situ by using 7 BCAs at different state of charge in HBr/Br2/H2O electrolytes with a theoretical capacity of 179.6&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1. Bromine is stored in the fused salt at concentrations up to 13.6&#8197;M, reaching theoretical volumetrical capacities up to 730&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 in fused salts. The fused salt consists of a pure, bromine&#8208; and water&#8208;free ionic liquid of organic [BCA]+ cations and polybromides, and its conductivity bases on a hopping mechanism among the polybromides. Alkyl side chain length of the BCAs and distribution of polybromides influence strongly the conductivity and viscosity of the fused salts. 1&#8208;ethylpyridin&#8208;1&#8208;iumbromide results to be favoured BCA for application.

         <title>A Universal DNA Aptamer that Recognizes Spike Proteins of Diverse SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants of Concern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is a unique one: A unique DNA aptamer has been discovered that has the ability to recognize the spike proteins of the wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its seven current variants of concern (VoCs), including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, B.1.617.1 B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.529 and is predicted to recognize the spike proteins of future VoCs.







Abstract
We report on a unique DNA aptamer, denoted MSA52, that displays universally high affinity for the spike proteins of wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa, Delta and Omicron variants. Using an aptamer pool produced from round 13 of selection against the S1 domain of the wildtype spike protein, we carried out one&#8208;round SELEX experiments using five different trimeric spike proteins from variants, followed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing and sequence alignment analysis of aptamers that formed complexes with all proteins. A previously unidentified aptamer, MSA52, showed Kd values ranging from 2 to 10&#8197;nM for all variant spike proteins, and also bound similarly to variants not present in the reselection experiments. This aptamer also recognized pseudotyped lentiviruses (PL) expressing eight different spike proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with Kd values between 20 and 50&#8197;pM, and was integrated into a simple colorimetric assay for detection of multiple PL variants. This discovery provides evidence that aptamers can be generated with high affinity to multiple variants of a single protein, including emerging variants, making it well&#8208;suited for molecular recognition of rapidly evolving targets such as those found in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Strengthening of the C&#8722;F Bond in Fumaryl Fluoride with Superacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;F bond of fumaryl fluoride is strengthened by protonation of the oxygen atom in a sea of superacid. The chain represents the reinforced connection between the carbon atom and the fluorine atom. The C&#8722;F bond even reveals a slight double&#8208;bond character and a formal positive charge on the fluorine atom. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;J. Kornath, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104422).

         <title>Quadrupolar Ultrafast Charge Transfer in Diaminoazobenzene&#8208;Bridged Perylenediimide Triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transfer of charge in covalently linked donor&#8211;acceptor systems is highly important in many areas of chemistry, artificial photosynthesis, semiconductor devices, and solar cells. Intramolecular charge transfer occurs when a fraction of the charge is transferred between the entities after photo&#8208;excitation of the electron donor or acceptor entity. In this study, molecular triads comprising two electron&#8208;deficient perylenediimides are covalently linked to a bridging electron donor, diamino&#8208;azobenzene, to give strong ground&#8208;state polarization resulting in wide&#8208;band optical coverage. Using fluorescence spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, charge&#8208;transfer reversal in these triads is also seen. Further, the formation of ultrafast quadrupolar charge transfer upon photoexcitation is demonstrated. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Fern&#225;ndez&#8208;L&#225;zaro, F. D&#8242;Souza, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104574).

         <title>Capture of Gaseous Iodine in Isoreticular Zirconium&#8208;Based UiO&#8208;n Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Influence of Amino Functionalization, DFT Calculations, Raman and EPR Spectroscopic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gaseous iodine has been captured by using a series of zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;n metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) sorbents. This study highlights the significant role of amino groups attached to the organic linker, which enhance the iodine uptake capacity, as well as its conversion into anionic iodide I3&#8722; species, trapped within UiO&#8208;n cavities. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Loiseau et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104437). Margot Friscourt and Orfeas Plastiras are thanked for the cover artwork.

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aldehydes with Allylboronates Enables Facile Access to Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for the preparation of ketones from aldehydes and allylic boronic esters is presented. This reaction involves the allylation of aldehydes with allylic boronic esters and the Rh&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking of homoallylic alcohols. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional groups. Mechanistic studies also supported that a tandem allylation and chain&#8208;walking process were involved.







Abstract
We present herein a novel strategy for the preparation of ketones from aldehydes and allylic boronic esters. This reaction involves the allylation of aldehydes with allylic boronic esters and the Rh&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking of homoallylic alcohols. The key to this successful development is the protodeboronation of alkenyl borylether intermediate via a tetravalent borate anion species in the presence of KHF2 and MeOH. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies also supported that the tandem allylation and chain&#8208;walking process were involved.

         <title>H/F Substitution Induced Large Increase of Tc in a 3D Hybrid Rare&#8208;Earth Double Perovskite Multifunctional Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional perovskites: Two 3D hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite compounds show multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties that ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and photoluminescence. The photoluminescence response shows that the emission intensity has no quench as the temperature increased. In particular, using the H/F substitution strategy generating an Rb&#8208;F coordinate bond enhanced the interactions between the cations and the anions to realize high Tc ferroelasticity.







Abstract
Increasing attention has been devoted to studying perovskite&#8208;type multifunctional stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with multiple channel physical characteristics. However, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve multifunction and regulate structural phase transition temperature in hybrid perovskites. Here, we report two three&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite compounds, (HQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (1, HQ=quinuclidium) and (4FHQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (2, 4FHQ=4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;quinuclidium), which exhibit ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and excellent photoluminescence response. The phase transition temperature of 2 increases 169&#8197;K compared with 1 through H/F substitution. This result is attributed to the H/F substitution inducing the generation of the Rb&#8208;F coordination bond between cations and anions. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence emission intensity of 2 shows no quench with the increase of temperature, in particular, the emission spectrum achieves fine regulation at high temperatures. This work provides a new solution for the realization of multi&#8208;functions and regulations of the properties based on hybrid perovskite materials with high critical temperatures.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mimetic Molecular Selective Catalysis via Single Zr Atom Catalysis in Chelated Cage Embedded in a Flexible Piezoelectrical Matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of supramolecular recognition and piezoelectrical field in soft assemblies in achieving molecularly selective high performance catalysis on single atom catalyst is first elucidated. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90&#8201;% after 100&#8197;min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted.







Abstract
The molecularly selective catalysis in enzyme is central to life. However, their functioning mechanism remains elusive. We propose here that the synergistic effects from (i) effective orbital hybridizing and energy gap decreasing via chelating on single Zr atom as the catalytic center, (ii) selective supramolecular encapsulation in the cage, and (iii) piezoelectrical field motivation are able to achieve the enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective high performance catalysis. Metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs) are added into a piezoelectrical polymer matrix to achieve the composite structure where ultrasonic treatment motivates redox reactions in the MOP&#8208;guest complex. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90&#8201;% after 100&#8197;min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted. This study first proposes a synergistic plot for enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalyst realization and is expected to inspire new mentality in efficient catalyst designing.

         <title>Selective, Transition Metal&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;Diboration of Alkyl Halides, Tolsylates, and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defunctionalization of readily available feedstocks to provide alkenes for the synthesis of multifunctional molecules represents an extremely useful process in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe a transition metal&#8208;free, simple and efficient strategy to access alkyl 1,2&#8208;bis(boronate esters) via regio&#8208; and diastereoselective diboration of secondary and tertiary alkyl halides (Br, Cl, I), tosylates, and alcohols. Control experiments demonstrated that the key to this high reactivity and selectivity is the addition of a combination of potassium iodide and N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA). The practicality and industrial potential of this transformation are demonstrated by its operational simplicity, wide functional group tolerance, and the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules. From a drug discovery perspective, this synthetic method offers control of the position of diversification and diastereoselectivity in complex ring scaffolds, which would be especially useful in a lead optimization program.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative C&#8211;O and C&#8211;N Coupling Reactions Using Air as Sole Oxidant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the oxygenation of tertiary arylamines, and the amination of tertiary arylamines and phenols. Key step of these coupling reactions is an iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative C&#8211;O or C&#8211;N bond formation which provides the corresponding products generally in high yields and with excellent regioselectivity. The transformations are accomplished using hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8211;iron(II) (FePcF 16 ) as catalyst in the presence of an acid or a base additive and require only ambient air as sole oxidant.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient synthesis for a wide variety of patellamide derivatives and phosphatase activity of copper&#8208;patellamide complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper complexes of patellamides have shown catalytic activity in a variety of reactions but their biological function remains unknown. There are significant differences between the natural macrocycles and synthetic analogues in the various catalytic activities. It therefore is essential to be able to perform  in vivo  and  ex vivo  reference measurements with the natural patellamide macrocycles, very similar derivatives and a large range of synthetic analogues. The preparative method described allows for a highly adaptable synthetic process producing building blocks for a large range of patellamide derivatives: apart from natural compounds, a new synthetic patellamide was prepared that does not have any substituents at any of the four heterocycles. Together with the variation of substituents at the aliphatic backbone, this allowed to elucidate the catalytic activity for phosphoester hydrolysis as a function of the structure and dynamics of the dicopper(II)&#8208;patellamide complexes, both by experiment and DFT&#8208;based mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reaction of the  N  &#8208;heterocylic carbene ligand  iPrIm (L1) and lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (TMSA) as a base with UCl4  resulted in U(IV) and U(V) complexes. Uranium&#8217;s +V oxidation state in (HL1)2  [U(V)(TMSI)Cl5] (TMSI = trimethylsilylimido) (2) was confirmed by HERFD&#8208;XANES measurements. Solid state characterization by SC&#8208;XRD and geometry optimisation of [U(IV)(L1)2  (TMSA)Cl3  ] (1) indicated a silylamido ligand mediated inverse  trans  influence (ITI).

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Chemisorption, Interpenetration and Polycatenation: Cationic MOFs and CPs from Group 13 Metal Halides and Di&#8208;Pyridyl&#8208;Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eight cationic, two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) were synthesized in reactions of the group 13 metal halides AlBr  3  , AlI  3  , GaBr  3  , InBr  3  and InI  3  with the dipyridyl ligands 1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (  bpe  ), 1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (  bpa  ) and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (  bipy  ). Seven of them follow the general formula  2  &#8734;  [MX  2  (  L  )  2  ]A, M = Al, In, X = Br, I, A  &#8208;  = [MX  4  ]  &#8208;  , I  &#8208;  , I  3  &#8208;  ,  L = bipy, bpa, bpe.  Thereby, the porosity of the cationic frameworks can be utilized to take up the heavy molecule iodine in gas&#8208;phase chemisorption vital for the capture of iodine radioisotopes. This is achieved by switching between I  &#8208;  and the polyiodide I  3  &#8208;  in the cavities at room temperature, including single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation. The MOFs are 2D networks that exhibit (4,4)&#8208;topology in general or (6,3)&#8208;topology for  2  &#8734;  [(GaBr  2  )  2  (  bpa  )  5  ][GaBr  4  ]  2  &#8729;  bpa  . The two&#8208;dimensional networks can either be arranged to an inclined interpenetration of the cationic two&#8208;dimensional networks, or to stacked networks without interpenetration. Interpenetration is accompanied by polycatenation. Due to the cationic character, the MOFs require the counter ions [MX  4  ]  &#8208;  , I  &#8208;  or I  3  &#8208;  counter ions in their pores. Whereas the [MX  4  ]  &#8208;  , ions are immobile, iodide allows for chemisorption. Furthermore, eight additional coordination polymers and complexes were identified and isolated that elaborate the reaction space of the herein reported syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile near&#8208;infrared super&#8208;resolution imaging of amyloid fibrils with the fluorogenic probe CRANAD&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CRANAD&#8208;2 is a fluorogenic curcumin derivative used for near&#8208;infrared detection and imaging in vivo of amyloid aggregates, which are involved in neurodegenerative diseases. We explore the performance of CRANAD&#8208;2 in two super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques, namely stimulated emission depletion (STED) and singlemolecule localization microscopy (SMLM), with markedly different fluorophore requirements. By conveniently adapting the concentration of CRANAD&#8208;2, which transiently binds to amyloid fibers, we show that it performs well in both techniques, achieving a resolution in the range of 45 &#8211; 55 nm. Correlation of SMLM with atomic force microscopy (AFM) validates the resolution of fine features in the reconstructed super&#8208;resolved image. The good performance and versatility of CRANAD&#8208;2 provides a powerful tool for near&#8208;infrared nanoscopic imaging of amyloids  in vitro  and  in vivo  .</dc:description>

         <title>Planar chiral rhodium complexes of 1,4&#8208;benzoquinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diene rhodium complexes are important catalysts in modern organic synthesis. Herein, we report a new approach to the such complexes with the uncommon planar chirality. The synthesis is achieved by face&#8208;selective coordination of the prochiral 2,5&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinones (R2&#8208;Q) with rhodium precursors containing the chiral auxiliary ligand S&#8208;salicyl&#8208;oxazoline (S&#8208;Salox). Such coordination leads to the formation of (R,R&#8208;R2&#8208;Q)Rh(S&#8208;Salox) complexes in high yields and with exceptional diastereoselectivity (d.r. &gt; 20:1). Subsequent replacement of the auxiliary ligand provides various benzoquinone rhodium complexes with retention of the planar chirality. Combined theoretical and experimental studies show that due to their electron&#8208;withdrawing nature benzoquinones bind metals stronger than the related 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene, but weaker than other common diene ligands, such as cyclooctadiene.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of Asx&#8208;turn types and their connate relationship with &#946;&#8208;turns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Models of asparagine&#8208;containing dipeptides, specifically designed to favor intrinsic folding into an Asx&#8208;turn, were characterized both theoretically, using quantum chemistry, and experimentally, using laser spectroscopy in the gas phase. Both approaches provided evidence for the spontaneous folding of both the Asn&#8208;Ala and Asn&#8208;Gly dipeptide models into the most stable Asx&#8208;turn, a conformation stabilized by a C10 H&#8208;bond which was very similar to a type II&#8217; &#946;&#8208;turn. In parallel, analysis of the Asx&#8208;turns implicating asparagine in crystallized protein structures in the Protein Data Bank revealed a sequence&#8208;dependent behavior. In Asn&#8208;Ala sequences, the Asx&#8208;turn was found in conjunction with a type I &#946;&#8208;turn for which the first of the four defining residues was Asn. The observation that the Asx turn in these structures is mostly of type II&#8217; (  i.e.  its most stable innate structure) suggests that this motif may foster the formation and/or enhance the stability of the backbone &#946;&#8208;turn. In contrast, the Asx turns observed in Asn&#8208;Gly sequences extensively adopted a type II Asx&#8208;turn structure, suggesting that their formation should be ascribed to other factors, such as hydration. The fact that the Asx&#8208;turn in a Asn&#8208;Gly sequence is also often found in combination with a hydrated &#946;&#8208;bulge supports the premise that a Asn&#8208;Gly sequence might efficiently promote the formation of the &#946;&#8208;bulge secondary structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton or Carbene Transfer? On the Dark and Light Reaction of Diazoalkanes with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;H Functionalization: In this combined experimental and computational study, the reaction of diaryl diazoalkanes with alcohols is reported. In the ground state, a direct proton transfer governs reactivity with acidic HFIP. On the contrary, photoexcitation leads to formation of a triplet carbene intermediate that undergoes an alcohol&#8208;assisted intersystem crossing to a solvent&#8208;stabilized carbene that results in high&#8208;yield photochemical O&#8722;H functionalization reactions.







Abstract
The formal alkylation reaction of OH groups with diazoalkanes under catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions finds broad application in organic synthesis. However, even today, this reaction is mainly limited to the use of diazomethane as reaction partner. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we aim at a fundamental understanding of the reaction of diazoalkanes with alcohols to make this transformation amenable to a generalized approach towards formal alkylation reactions of alcohols with diazoalkanes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest a direct proton transfer only in exceptional cases. In a more general setting, such O&#8722;H functionalization proceed both under dark and photochemical conditions via a key hydrogen&#8208;bonded singlet carbene intermediate that undergoes a protonation&#8211;addition mechanism. We conclude with applications of this approach in O&#8722;H functionalization reactions of alcohols, including simple fluorinated, halogenated and aliphatic alcohols and showcase functional&#8208;group tolerance of this method in the reaction of biologically active and pharmaceutically relevant alcohols.

         <title>Highly Selective Lysine Acylation in Proteins Using a Lys&#8208;His Tag Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short, designed Lys&#8208;His tag can be inserted into proteins where it autocatalyzes the highly selective acylation of the Lys side&#8208;chain amine with phenyl esters. The reaction conditions of this site&#8208;selective, chemical protein modification method are mild, and no oxidative reagents, reductants nor enzymes are required.







Abstract
Chemical modification of proteins has numerous applications, but it has been challenging to achieve the required high degree of selectivity on lysine amino groups. Recently, we described the highly selective acylation of proteins with an N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;His6 segment. This tag promoted acylation of the N&#8208;terminal N&#945;&#8208;amine resulting in stable conjugates. Herein, we report the peptide sequences Hisn&#8208;Lys&#8208;Hism, which we term Lys&#8208;His tags. In combination with simple acylating agents, they facilitate the acylation of the designated Lys N&#1013;&#8208;amine under mild conditions and with high selectivity over native Lys residues. We show that the Lys&#8208;His tags, which are 7 to 10 amino acids in length and still act as conventional His tags, can be inserted in proteins at the C&#8208;terminus or in loops, thus providing high flexibility regarding the site of modification. Finally, the selective and efficient acylation of the therapeutic antibody Rituximab, pure or mixed with other proteins, demonstrates the scope of the Lys&#8208;His tag acylation method.

         <title>Elucidating the Germanium Distribution in ITQ&#8208;13 Zeolites by Density Functional Theory**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferred Ge distributions in ITQ&#8208;13 silicogermanates with different Si/Ge ratios were investigated with electronic structure calculations, with the primary aim of predicting the most stable local structures across the range of Ge contents. Additional calculations were used to study the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the incorporated fluoride anions as a function of the local environment and the defluorination behaviour of different fluoride&#8208;containing cages.







Abstract
ITQ&#8208;13 is a medium&#8208;pore zeolite that can be prepared in all&#8208;silica form and as silicogermanate with Si/Ge ratios as low as 3. Usually synthesised in the presence of fluoride, ITQ&#8208;13 is among the very few systems containing fluoride anions in two distinct cage types, cube&#8208;like d4r units and [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages. Here, dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the energetically most favourable Ge distributions for Si/Ge ratios between 55 and 6. The calculations show Ge atoms are incorporated at both the corners of d4r cages and at the basal plane of the [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages, in accordance with 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Two Ge atoms at adjacent corners of [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages are stable at the highest Ge content considered (Si/Ge=6). Such a local environment has not yet been considered in the experimental literature. A calculation of the corresponding 19F&#8197;NMR resonance points to overlap with other resonances, which might preclude its clear identification. Additional calculations investigate the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the fluoride anions as a function of the local environment as well as the selective defluorination of the [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages.

         <title>In vitro anticancer ability of nano fluorescent 111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA on Hela cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In past decades, nanoscale metal&#8208;organic frameworks (NMOFs) have drawn more and more attention in multimodal imaging and targeting therapy of various malignant cancers. Here, we proposed to dope 111In into fluorescent In&#8208;based NMOFs (In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2), with an attempt to prepare a new nanomedicine with great anti&#8208;cancer potential. As a proof of concept, the obtained NMOF (In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA) with targeting motifs is able to act as a fluorescent probe to achieve Hela cell imaging. Moreover, the Auger electron emitter 111In built in corresponding radioactive NMOF (111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA) can bring clear damage to cancer cells, resulting in a high cell killing rate of 59.3% within 48 h. In addition, the cell cycle presented a significant dose&#8208;dependent G2/M inhibiting mode, which indicates that 111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA&#160;has the ability to facilitate the cancer cells to enter apoptotic program. This work demonstrated the potential of 111In labelled NMOFs in specific killings of cancer cells, providing a new approach to develop nanomedicines with theranostic function.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly sensitive &#8220;off/on&#8221; EPR probes to monitor enzymatic activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assessment of unregulated level of enzyme activity is a crucial parameter for early diagnoses in a wide range of pathologies. In this study, we propose the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) as an easy method to probe carboxylesterase (CE) enzymatic activity  in vitro  . For this application, were synthesized two amphiphilic, nitroxide containing esters, namely  Tempo&#8208;C12  (T&#8208;C12) and  Tempo&#8208;2&#8208;C12  (T&#8208;2&#8208;C12). They exhibit low solubility in water and form stable micelles in which the radicals are EPR almost silent, but the hydrolysis of the ester bond yields narrows and intense EPR signals. The intensity of the EPR signals is proportional to the enzymatic activity. CEs1, CEs2 and esterase from porcine liver (PLE) were investigated. The obtained results show that T&#8208;C12&#8208; and T&#8208;2&#8208;C12&#8208;containing systems display a much higher selectivity toward the CEs2, with a Limit of Detection of the same order of those ones obtained with optical methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Chemoenzymatic Installation of Hydroxy&#8208;Bearing Allyl Moiety on the Indole Ring of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The late&#8208;stage functionalization of indole&#8208; and tryptophan&#8208;containing compounds with reactive moieties facilitates downstream diversification and leads to changes in their biological properties. Here we describe the synthesis of two hydroxy&#8208;bearing allyl pyrophosphates. We demonstrate a chemoenzymatic method using a promiscuous indole prenyltransferase enzyme to install a dual reactive hydroxy&#8208;bearing allyl moiety directly on the indole ring of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides. This is the first report of late&#8208;stage indole modifications with this reactive group.</dc:description>

         <title>Type S Non Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases for the rapid generation of tailormade peptide libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial natural products in general, and non&#8208;ribosomally synthesized peptides in particular, are structurally diverse and provide us with a broad range of pharmaceutically relevant bioactivities. Yet, traditional natural product research suffers from rediscovering the same scaffolds and has been stigmatized as inefficient, time&#8208;, labour&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive. Combinatorial chemistry, on the other hand, can produce new molecules in greater numbers, cheaper and in less time than traditional natural product discovery, but also fails to meet current medical needs due to the limited biologically relevant chemical space that can be addressed. Consequently, methods for the high throughput generation of new natural products would offer a new approach to identifying novel bioactive chemical entities for the hit to lead phase of drug discovery programms. As a follow&#8208;up to our previously published proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study on generating bipartite type S non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), we now envisaged the&#160;  de novo  &#160;generation of non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) on an unreached scale. Using synthetic zippers, we split NRPS in up to three subunits and rapidly generated different bi&#8208; and tripartite NRPS libraries to produce 49 peptides, peptide derivatives, and&#160;  de novo  &#160;peptides at good titres up to 145 mg L  &#8208;1  . A further advantage of type S NRPSs not only is the possibility to easily expand the created libraries by re&#8208;using previously created type S NRPS, but that functions of individual domains as well as domain&#8208;domain interactions can be studied and assigned rapidly.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;fluorinated [7]helicenes are photolabile and undergo a double fluorine atom transfer.&#160;Herein, we show that the transferred product further undergoes a skeletal transformation on silica gel.&#160;The transformation begins with activation of the allylic C&#8211;F bond on the silanol surface.&#160;Then, the resulting carbocation readily undergoes a regioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution with water, depending on the position of the fluorine substituents.&#160;Hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol also activated the allylic C&#8211;F bond and acted as a nucleophile.&#160;These findings support the generation of a highly reactive cationic electrophilic intermediate in the successive transformations involving fluorine atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination and Hydroboration of Ru(II)&#8208;Borate Complexes: Dihydridoborate vs. Bis(dihydridoborate)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Treatment of [Cp*RuCl  2  ]  2  ,  1  ,[(COD)IrCl]  2  ,&#160;  2  or [(  p  &#8208;cymene)RuCl  2  ],  3  (Cp* =  &#951;  5  &#8208;C  5  Me  5  , COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene and  p  &#8208;cymene =  &#951;  6  &#8208;  i  PrC  6  H  4  Me) with heterocyclic borate ligands [Na[(H  3  B)L],  L  1  and  L  2  (  L  1  : L = amt,  L  2  : L = mp; amt = 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole, mp = 2&#8208;mercaptopyridine) led to the formation of borate complexes having uncommon coordination. For example, complexes  1  and  2  on reaction with  L  1  and  L  2  afforded dihydridoborate species [LAM(&#956;&#8208;H)  2  BHL]  4&#8208;6  (  4  : L  A  = Cp*, M = Ru, L = amt;  5  : L  A  = Cp*, M = Ru, L = mp;  6  : L  A  = COD, M = Ir, L = mp). On the other hand, treatment of  3  with  L  2  yielded  cis  &#8208; and  trans  &#8208;bis(dihydridoborate) species, [Ru{(  &#956;  &#8208;H)  2  BH(mp)}  2  ],  cis  &#8208;  7  and  trans  &#8208;  7  .

         <title>Solid Base Assisted Dual&#8208;Promoted Heterogeneous Conversion of PVC to Metal&#8208;Free Porous Carbon Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used in daily life, but its waste has become a serious environmental problem. A solid base assisted low&#8208;temperature solvothermal dehalogenation was developed in this work to sustainably and efficiently transform PVC into high&#8208;value dimethylamine hydrochloride (DMACl) chemical and N,O co&#8208;doped carbon monolith with hierarchically porous structure. The synergistic promotion of solid&#8208;base catalyst and solvent decomposition with the removal of HCl can shift forward the chemical equilibrium to promote the dechlorination of PVC and increase the carbon yield. Meanwhile, the solid&#8208;base catalyst can also act as a pore&#8208;forming additive to fabricate the carbon monolith with hierarchical pores. Induced by the high specific surface area, hierarchical pores and N,O co&#8208;doped structure, the generated carbon monolith exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance towards H  2  evolution. These discoveries shed light on the design of synergistically coupled solvent and solid catalyst to promote the heterogeneous conversion of waste chlorinated plastics into high&#8208;value chemicals for a sustainable future.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Strong Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Absorbing Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes for Robust and Efficient Light &#8208; Driven Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Weak light absorption has hidden the use of most Ir(III) complexes as efficient photosensitizers in photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water. To address this issue, a series of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes (  Ir1  &#8208;  Ir5  ), featuring different electron&#8208;donating substituents to enhance the absorptivity, have been synthesized and studied as photosensitizers (PSs) for light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from water.  Ir6  &#8211;  Ir7  were prepared as fundamental systems for comparisons. Electron donors, including 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole, triphenylamine, 4,4'&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine, 4,4'&#8208;di(  N  &#8208;hexylcarbazole)triphenylamine moieties were introduced on 6&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenanthridine&#8208;based cyclometalating (C^N) ligands to explore the donor effect on the hydrogen evolution performance of these cationic Ir(III) complexes. Remarkably,  Ir  4  with 4,4'&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine achieved the highest turn&#8208;over number (TON) of 12,300 and initial turnover frequency (TOF  i  ) of 394 h  &#8722;  1  , with initial activity (activity  i  ) of 547,000 &#956;mol g  &#8722;1  h  &#8722;1  and initial apparent quantum yield (AQY  i  ) of 9.59%, under the illumination of blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) for 105 hours, which demonstrated a stable three&#8208;component photocatalytic system with high efficiency. The TON (based on  n  (H  2  )/  n  (PSr)) in this study is the highest value reported to date among the similar photocatalytic systems using Ir(III) complexes with Pt nanoparticles as catalyst. Great potential of using triphenylamine&#8208;based Ir(III) PSs in boosting the photocatalytic performance has also been shown.</dc:description>

         <title>Sigma/pi bonding preferences of solvated alkali&#8208;metal cations to ditopic arylmethyl anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylmethyl anions allow alkali&#8208;metals to bind in a &#963;&#8208;fashion to the lateral carbanionic centre or a &#960;&#8208;fashion to the aryl ring or in between these extremities, with the trend towards &#960; bonding increasing on descending group 1. Here we review known alkali&#8208;metal structures of diphenylmethane, fluorene, 2&#8208;benzylpyridine and 4&#8208;benzylpyridine. Next, we synthesise Li, Na, K monomers of these diarylmethyls using polydentate donors PMDETA or Me  6  TREN to remove competing oligomerizing interactions, studying the effect that two aromatic rings have on negative charge (de)localisation via NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and DFT studies. Diphenylmethyl and fluorenyl anions maintain C(H)&#8208;M interactions regardless of alkali&#8208;metal, although the adjacent arene carbons engage in interactions with larger alkali&#8208;metals. Introducing a nitrogen atom into the ring (at the 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;position) encourages relocalisation of negative charge away from the deprotonated carbon and onto nitrogen. Phenyl(2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl moves from an enamide formation at one extremity (lithium) to an aza&#8208;allyl formation at the other extremity (potassium), while C&#8208; or N&#8208; coordination modes become energetically viable for Na and K phenyl(4&#8208;pyridyl)methyl complexes.</dc:description>
