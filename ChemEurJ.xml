Fishing carboxylic acids with allenamides as the bait are depicted for demonstrating a mild transformation employing allenamides as amino allyl surrogates for the esterification naturally abundant carboxylic acids feedstock; the cover shows some fish reaching the bait, hence representing the chemoselectivity of the developed protocol. The transparent nature of the sea water with air bubbles clarified that the present O&#8208;aminoallylation reaction does not require any external reagent and inert atmosphere. A DFT&#8208;study revealed that the reaction occurs via a protonation event as shown at the top of the picture. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;H.&#8208;Y. Cheong, J.&#8197;K. Park, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000778).

      <title>Rational Design of a Uranyl Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for the Capture and Colorimetric Detection of Organic Dyes</title>
      <dc:description>
A new uranyl containing metal&#8211;organic framework was prepared and the diffraction data reveals the structure consists of interpenetrating 3D nets with a 4,3&#8208;connected tbo topology. Each net contains large 22.8&#8197;&#197; pores and is constructed from monomeric, hexagonal bipyramidal uranyl nodes that are joined by 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)benzene ligands. The crystalline material is stable in aqueous media and due to the large void space (constituting 76&#8201;% of the unit cell by volume) can sequester organic dyes, the uptake of which induces a visible change to the color of the material. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R.&#8197;G. Surbella&#8201;III et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201905766).

      <title>Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of Propadiene</title>
      <dc:description>
This was definitely not a &#8220;Schnapsidee&#8221; (a German proverb that describes a bad idea during a convivial evening)! The simplest allene 1,3&#8208;propadiene is employed in intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions with secondary amines to give the corresponding allylamines in high regioselectivities. These compounds are not only highly attractive for subsequent functionalization, but are also formed catalytically by employing an earth&#8208;abundant titanium catalyst!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This was definitely not a &#8220;Schnapsidee&#8221;&lt;/b&gt; (a German proverb that describes a bad idea during a convivial evening)! The simplest allene 1,3&#8208;propadiene is employed in intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions with secondary amines to give the corresponding allylamines in high regioselectivities. These compounds are not only highly attractive for subsequent functionalization, but are also formed catalytically by employing an earth&#8208;abundant titanium catalyst! More information can be found in the Communication by R. Beckhaus, S. Doye, et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.20200348410.1002/chem.202003484&lt;/a&gt;).

      <title>Building C(sp3) Molecular Complexity on 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Bipyridine and 1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline in Rhenium Tricarbonyl Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>The reactions of [Re(N&#8208;N)(CO)  3  (PMe  3  )]OTf (N&#8208;N= 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, bipy; 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, phen) compounds with  t  BuLi and with LiHBEt  3  have been explored. Addition to the N&#8208;N chelate took place with different site&#8208;selectivity depending on both chelate and nucleophile. Thus, with  t  BuLi, an unprecedented addition to C5 of bipy, a regiochemistry non&#8208;accessible for free bipy, was obtained, while coordinated phen underwent  t  BuLi addition to C2 and C4. Remarkably, when LiHBEt  3  reacted with [Re(bipy)(CO)  3  (PMe  3  )]OTf, hydride addition to the 4 and 6 positions of bipy triggered an intermolecular cyclodimerization of two dearomatized pyridyl rings. In contrast, hydride addition to the phen analog resulted on partial reduction of one pyridine ring. The resulting neutral Re(I) products showed a varied reactivity with HOTf and with MeOTf to yield cationic complexes. These strategies rendered access to Re(I) complexes containing bipy&#8208; and phen&#8208;derived chelates with several C(sp  3  ) centers.</dc:description>

H2 gas is an alternative form of energy that can alleviate our heavy dependence on fossil fuels. Hydrogenase enzymes produce H2 naturally, holding promise in the future of H2&#8208;based energy economy. In their review on page&#8197;12494&#8197;ff., S.

These examples illustrate advances in environmentally benign approaches towards H2 production as simpler yet functional models of the complex enzymes, paving the way for a promising new era of sustainable energy production.

We have developed a concise and regioselective approach to chromenes and chromanes via an aryne&#8208;based synthetic strategy.

      <title>Spotlight on Photo&#8208;Induced Aryl Migration Reactions.</title>
      <dc:description>Rearrangement reactions are certainly one of the most useful approaches towards complex structures in organic chemistry. With efficient conditions, it is indeed possible to convert simple substrates in highly functionalized products. Moreover, combining this approach with an attractive initiation process, such as visible&#8208;light catalysis, makes these reactions particularly powerful. Recently, tremendous improvements have been made thanks to a better understanding of photoredox mechanisms. In this review, recent progresses on visible&#8208;light aryl migration reactions will be tackled, focusing especially on Smiles rearrangement and related reactions.</dc:description>

With efficient conditions, it is indeed possible to convert simple substrates in highly functionalized products. Moreover, combining this approach with an attractive initiation process, such as visible&#8208;light catalysis, makes these reactions particularly powerful. Recently, tremendous improvements have been made thanks to a better understanding of photoredox mechanisms. In this review, recent progresses on visible&#8208;light aryl migration reactions will be tackled, focusing especially on Smiles rearrangement and related reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Saccharide Recognition by a Three Arm&#8208;Shaped Host Having Preorganized Three&#8208;Dimensional Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Sites</title>
      <dc:description>Generally, cage&#8208;shaped hosts for saccharides can strongly bind to guest molecules owing to the three&#8208;dimensional preorganized hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites. However, the preparation of cage molecules is often difficult due to the low&#8208;yield macrocyclization step. Here, we report a three arm&#8208;shaped molecule possessing pyridine&#8211;acetylene&#8211;phenol units as a new kind of host having a preorganized three&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonding site. This three arm&#8208;shaped host was readily prepared compared to a cage&#8208;shaped analogue. This host associated with lipophilic glycosides to form chiral complexes, and the association constants were sufficiently high as well as those of the cage&#8208;shaped one. Furthermore, this host extracted native monosaccharides into a lipophilic solvent.</dc:description>

      <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonded BODIPY Frameworks with Tunable Optical Features</title>

These XB interactions promote singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet reverse intersystem crossing due to delocalization of oxygen electrons partially onto the Br and I, which leads to unexpected fluorescence enhancement of  B4&#8208;II  .

      <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Imidazolium Substituted Cp Ligands and their Ru Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Ligand design and application: The synthesis of electron&#8208;poor imidazolium substituted Cp&#8208;ylides is presented. Their electronic properties are elucidated based on NMR spectroscopy, DFT and reactivity studies. The first &#951;5&#8208;Cp coordination of electron&#8208;poor cationic ylides is confirmed by X&#8208;ray structure analyses and an equilibrium for the coordination of a Cp ligand is observed. Electrochemical investigations of the ligands and of the ruthenocenes quantify the decreasing donor properties with increasing number of imidazolium substituents.







Abstract
The synthesis of electron&#8208;poor mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri(imidazolium)&#8208;substituted Cp&#8208;ylides is presented and their electronic properties are discussed based on NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray structure analyses, electrochemical investigations and DFT calculations as well as by their reactivity toward [Ru(CH3CN)3Cp*](PF6). With mono&#8208; and di(imidazolium)&#8208;substituted cyclopentadienides the respective monocationic and dicationic ruthenocences are formed (X&#8208;ray), whereas tri(imidazolium) cyclopentadienides are too electron&#8208;poor to form the ruthenocenes. Cyclic voltammetric analysis of the ruthenocenes shows reversible oxidation at a potential that increases with every additional electron&#8208;withdrawing imidazolium substituent at the Cp ligand by 0.53&#8211;0.55&#8197;V in an electrolyte based on a weakly coordinating anion. A reversible oxidation can be observed for the free 1,3&#8208;disubstituted ligand as well.

Desymmetrisation: A divergent synthetic strategy to access both &#947;&#8208;amino acid and &#947;&#8208;lactam derivatives by treatment of meso&#8208;glutaric anhydrides with TMSN3 is reported (see scheme).







Abstract
The first divergent synthesis of both &#947;&#8208;amino acid and &#947;&#8208;lactam derivatives from meso&#8208;glutaric anhydrides is described. The organocatalytic desymmetrisation with TMSN3 relies on controlled generation of a nucleophilic ammonium azide species mediated by a polystyrene&#8208;bound base to promote efficient silylazidation. After Curtius rearrangement of the acyl azide intermediate to access the corresponding isocyanate, hydrolysis/alcoholysis provided uniformly high yields of &#947;&#8208;amino acids and their N&#8208;protected counterparts. The same intermediates were shown to undergo an unprecedented decarboxylation&#8211;cyclisation cascade in situ to provide synthetically useful yields of &#947;&#8208;lactam derivatives without using any further activating agents. Mechanistic insights invoke the intermediacy of an unconventional &#947;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (&#947;&#8208;NCA) in the latter process.

      <title>Protein&#8208;Templated Hit Identification through an Ugi Four&#8208;Component Reaction
</title>
      <dc:description>
Screening fast: The Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) is introduced as a novel reaction in kinetic&#8208;target guided synthesis (KTGS). Novel inhibitors of a model enzyme (aspartic protease endothiapepsin) and new binders of the emerging antibacterial target (&#946;&#8208;sliding clamp DnaN) were successfully identified. This new technique enables a rapid screening of a large number of compounds in early drug discovery.







Abstract
Kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis represents an efficient hit&#8208;identification strategy, in which the protein assembles its own inhibitors from a pool of complementary building blocks via an irreversible reaction. Herein, we pioneered an in situ Ugi reaction for the identification of novel inhibitors of a model enzyme and binders for an important drug target, namely, the aspartic protease endothiapepsin and the bacterial &#946;&#8208;sliding clamp DnaN, respectively. Highly sensitive mass&#8208;spectrometry methods enabled monitoring of the protein&#8208;templated reaction of four complementary reaction partners, which occurred in a background&#8208;free manner for endothiapepsin or with a clear amplification of two binders in the presence of DnaN. The Ugi products we identified show low micromolar activity on endothiapepsin or moderate affinity for the &#946;&#8208;sliding clamp. We succeeded in expanding the portfolio of chemical reactions and biological targets and demonstrated the efficiency and sensitivity of this approach, which can find application on any drug target.

&lt;p&gt;Kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis represents an efficient hit&#8208;identification strategy, in which the protein assembles its own inhibitors from a pool of complementary building blocks via an irreversible reaction. Herein, we pioneered an in situ Ugi reaction for the identification of novel inhibitors of a model enzyme and binders for an important drug target, namely, the aspartic protease endothiapepsin and the bacterial &#946;&#8208;sliding clamp DnaN, respectively. Highly sensitive mass&#8208;spectrometry methods enabled monitoring of the protein&#8208;templated reaction of four complementary reaction partners, which occurred in a background&#8208;free manner for endothiapepsin or with a clear amplification of two binders in the presence of DnaN. The Ugi products we identified show low micromolar activity on endothiapepsin or moderate affinity for the &#946;&#8208;sliding clamp. We succeeded in expanding the portfolio of chemical reactions and biological targets and demonstrated the efficiency and sensitivity of this approach, which can find application on any drug target.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthetically Versatile Nitrogen Acyclic Carbene stabilized Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have received significant attention as gold nanoparticle stabilizers due to their strong binding affinity towards gold. However, their tunability is limited by the difficulty in obtaining nonsymmetric NHCs. In this regard, N&#8208;acyclic carbenes (NACs) are attractive alternatives due to their high synthetic versatility, allowing easy tuning of their steric and electronic properties towards specific applications. This work reports the first series of stable and monodisperse NAC&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles. These particles with sizes ranging 3.8 to 11.6 nm were characterized using NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and TEM. The nanoparticles display good stability at elevated temperatures and for extended periods both dried or dispersed in a medium, as well as in the presence of exogenous thiols. Importantly, these NAC&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles offer a promising and versatile alternative to NHC&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the Thermal Stability and Photoisomerization of Azoheteroarenes through Macrocycle Strain</title>
      <dc:description>Azobenzene and its derivatives are one of the most&#8208;widespread molecular scaffolds in a range of modern applications, as well as in fundamental research. After photoexcitation, azo&#8208;based photoswitches revert back to the most stable isomer in a timescale ( [[EQUATION]] ) that determines the range of potential applications. Attempts to bring [[EQUATION]] to extreme values prompted to the development of azobenzene and azoheteroarene derivatives that either rebalance the E&#8208; and Z&#8208; isomer stabilities, or exploit unconventional thermal isomerization mechanisms. In the former case, one successful strategy has been the creation of macrocycle strain, which tends to impact the E/Z stability asymmetrically, and thus significantly modify [[EQUATION]] . On the bright side, bridged derivatives have shown an improved optical switching owing to the higher quantum yields and absence of degradation. However, in most (if not all) cases, bridged derivatives display a  reversed  thermal stability (more stable Z&#8208;isomer), and smaller [[EQUATION]] than the acyclic counterparts, which restricts their potential interest to applications requiring a fast forward and backwards switch. In this paper, we investigate the impact of alkyl bridges to the thermal stability of phenyl&#8208;azoheteroarenes using computational methods, and we reveal that is indeed possible to combine such improved photo&#8208;switching characteristics while preserving the  regular  thermal stability (more stable E&#8208;isomer), and increased [[EQUATION]] values under the appropriate connectivity and bridge length.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthetic Tigliane Intermediates Engage Thiols to Induce Potent Cell Line Selective Anti&#8208;Cancer Activity</title>
      <dc:description>
Advanced synthetic intermediates en route to D&#8208;ring inverted non&#8208;natural tiglianes display higher potency (e.g. MM96L and CAL27) as compared to natural tigliane esters, especially when moving away from PKC&#8208;activation sensitive cancer cell lines (e.g. MCF7).







Abstract
The tigliane ring system, which encompasses iconic members such as phorbol and TPA, is widely renowned due to numerous observations of displaying potent biological activity, and subsequent use as mainstream biochemical tools. Traditionally, naturally occurring phorboids are regarded as tumor promotors through PKC activation, although in recent times more highly oxidized natural derivatives have been identified as anti&#8208;tumor agents. In the view that only limited synthetic investigations toward skeletal stereochemical modification have been undertaken, non&#8208;natural systems could be useful for a better understanding of the tigliane pharmacophore via interrogation of cellular sensitivity. In this context the concise construction of a number of highly functionalized non&#8208;natural D&#8208;ring inverted phorbol esters were synthesized, via a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed [4+3] cycloaddition, and biologically evaluated using a range of cancer cell lines. The biological results highlight the notion that subtle changes in structure have dramatic effects on potency. Furthermore, although the non&#8208;natural derivatives did not outcompete the natural systems in the PKC&#8208;activation sensitive MCF7 cancer cell line, they outperformed in other cancer cell lines (MM96L and CAL27). This observation strongly suggested an alternate mode of action not involving activation of PKC, but instead involves thiol addition as indicated by glutathione addition and NF&#8208;&#954;B reporter activity.

      <title>BIAN&#8211;NHC Ligands in Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalysis: A Perfect Union of Sterically&#8208;Encumbered, Electronically&#8208;Tunable N&#8211;Heterocyclic Carbenes?</title>
      <dc:description>The discovery of NHCs (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes) as ancillary ligands in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysis ranks as one of the most important developments in synthesis and catalysis. It is now well&#8208;recognized that the strong&#963;&#8208;donating properties of NHCs along with the ease of scaffold modification and a steric shielding of the N&#8208;wingtip substituents around the metal center enable dramatic improvements in catalytic processes, including the discovery of reactions that are not possible using other ancillary ligands. In this context, although the classical NHCs based on imidazolylidene and imidazolinylidene ring systems are now well&#8208;established, recently tremendous progress has been made in the development and catalytic applications of BIAN&#8211;NHC (BIAN = bis(imino)acenaphtene) class of ligands. The enhanced reactivity of BIAN&#8211;NHCs is a direct result of the combination of electronic and steric properties that collectively allow for a major expansion of the scope of catalytic processes that can be accomplished using NHCs. BIAN&#8211;NHC ligands take advantage of (1) the stronger&#160;&#963;&#963;&#8208;donation, (2) lower lying LUMO orbitals, (3) the presence of an extended &#960;&#960;&#8208;system, (4) the rigid backbone that pushes the N&#8208;wingtip substituents closer to the metal center by buttressing effect, thus resulting in a significantly improved control of the catalytic center and enhanced air&#8208;stability of BIAN&#8211;NHC&#8211;metal complexes at low oxidation state.

      <title>Temperature as an extra dimension in multidimensional protein NMR.</title>
      <dc:description>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a particularly informative method for studying protein structure and dynamics in solution; however, it is also one of the most time&#8208;consuming. Modern approaches to biomolecular NMR are based on lengthy multidimensional (ND) experiments whose duration grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. The experimental time may even be several days in the case of 3D and 4D spectra. Moreover, the experiment often has to be repeated in several different conditions, for example in order to measure the temperature&#8208;dependent effects in a spectrum (temperature coefficients, TCs). In this paper we propose a new approach that involves joint sampling of indirect evolution times and temperature. This allows us to measure TCs with 3D spectra in even less time than is needed to acquire a single spectrum using the conventional approach. We propose two signal processing methods that are complementary in terms of sensitivity and resolution: a) dividing the data into overlapping subsets followed by compressed sensing reconstruction, and b) treating the complete data set with a variant of the Radon transform. The temperature&#8208;swept 3D HNCO spectra of two intrinsically disordered proteins&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;osteopontin and CD44 cytoplasmic tail&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;show that our new approach makes it possible to determine TCs and their non&#8208;linearities effectively. Non&#8208;linearities, which indicate the presence of a compact state, are particularly interesting. We provide the complete package of data acquisition and processing software for this new approach.</dc:description>

      <title>B&#8592;N&#8208;Incorporated Dibenzo&#8208;azaacene with Selective Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption and Visible Transparency</title>
      <dc:description>Organic compounds with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption and visible transparency are very desirable for fabrication of transparent/semi&#8208;transparent opto&#8208;electronic devices. Herein, we develop a molecule with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption property, QBNA&#8208;O, in which four B&#8592;N units are incorporated to the core and two benzodioxin groups are introduced at the termini of the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton. QBNA&#8208;O exhibits a small optical gap of 1.39 eV due to the strong electron&#8208;donating benzodioxin groups and the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing B&#8592;N units. In toluene solution, QBNA&#8208;O shows a strong absorption peak at 856 nm with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of only 41 nm as well as very weak absorption in the visible range from 380 nm to 760 nm.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organic compounds with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption and visible transparency are very desirable for fabrication of transparent/semi&#8208;transparent opto&#8208;electronic devices. Herein, we develop a molecule with selective near&#8208;infrared absorption property, QBNA&#8208;O, in which four B&#8592;N units are incorporated to the core and two benzodioxin groups are introduced at the termini of the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton. QBNA&#8208;O exhibits a small optical gap of 1.39 eV due to the strong electron&#8208;donating benzodioxin groups and the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing B&#8592;N units. In toluene solution, QBNA&#8208;O shows a strong absorption peak at 856 nm with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of only 41 nm as well as very weak absorption in the visible range from 380 nm to 760 nm. Thin films of QBNA&#8208;O exhibit the average visible transparency (AVT) of 78% at the thickness of 205 nm and 90% at the thickness of 45 nm. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) of QBNA&#8208;O display ambipolar transporting behavior with the electron mobility of 0.52 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and the hole mobility of 0.013 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 together with excellent air&#8208;stability.

      <title>DpgC&#8208;catalyzed peroxidation of&#160; DPA&#8208;CoA: insights into the spin&#8208;forbidden transition and charge transfer mechanisms</title>
      <dc:description>Despite being a very strong oxidizing agent, most organic molecules are not oxidized in the presence of O$_2$ at room temperature because O$_2$ is a diradical while most organic molecules are closed&#8208;shell. Oxidation then requires a change in the spin state of the system, forbidden according to non&#8208;relativistic quantum theory. To overcome this limitation, oxygenases usually rely on metal or redox cofactors to catalyze the incorporation of, at least, one oxygen atom into an organic substrate. However, some oxygenases do not require any cofactor, and the detailed mechanism followed by these enzymes remains elusive. To fill this gap, here we study the mechanism for the enzymatic cofactor&#8208;independent oxidation of&#160; 3,5&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetyl&#8208;CoA (DPA&#8208;CoA) combining multi&#8208;reference calculations on a model system, with QM/MM calculations. Our results reveal that intersystem crossing takes place without requiring the previous protonation of molecular oxygen. The characterization of the electronic states reveals that&#160; &#160;electron transfer is concomitant with the triplet&#8208;singlet transition. The enzyme plays a passive role in promoting the intersystem crossing, although spontaneous reorganization of the water&#8208;wire connecting the active site with the bulk presets the substrate for subsequent chemical transformations. Our results show that the stabilization of the singlet radical&#8208;pair between dioxygen and enolate is enough to promote spin&#8208;forbidden reaction without the need for neither metal cofactors nor basic residues in the active site.</dc:description>

The developed method comprises of a gold&#8208;catalysed alkynol cycloisomerization/ intramolecular addition of C2 of indole and subsequent BF  3  .OEt  2  mediated regioselective C3 allylation, resulting in the synthesis of the functionalized indoloisoquinolinone scaffold. The reaction involves 5&#8208;  endo  &#8208;alkynol cycloisomerization and the dearomative/ addition of indole C2 to the intermediate oxocarbenium cation, which results in two equilibrating fused and spiro pentacyclic intermediates which upon treatment with allylsilane in the presence of BF  3  .OEt  2  , undergo selective indole C3 allylation. Other nucleophiles such as hydride, azide and indole were also found to be compatible in this process.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulation of metallophilic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions in platinum cyclometalated luminophores with halogen bonding</title>

      <title>Waste Cleaning Waste: Combining Alginate with Biowaste&#8208;Derived Substances in Hydrogels and Films for Water Clean&#8208;up</title>
      <dc:description>Biowaste&#8208;derived substances isolated from green compost (BBS&#8208;GC) are environmental&#8208;friendly reactants similar to humic substances, which bring multiple functionalities, suitable to adsorb different kinds of pollutants in wastewater.

Our results show that both hydrogels and films are mechanically stable and can effectively remove differently charged dyes through an adsorption mechanism describable by the Freundlich model. BBS&#8208;GC&#8208;containing gels always performed better than samples prepared without BBS&#8208;GC, revealing that such unconventional materials can integrate waste valorization and water decontamination, potentially providing social and environmental benefits.</dc:description>

      <title>On the Role of Alkali&#8208;Metal&#8208;Like Superatom Al12P in Reduction and Conversion of Carbon Dioxide</title>
      <dc:description>Developing efficient catalysts for the conversion of CO  2  into fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals is of great significance to relieve the growing energy crisis and global warming. With the assistance of DFT calculations, it is interesting to find that, different from Al  12  X (X = Be, Al, and C), the  alkali&#8208;metal&#8208;like superatom Al  12  P  prefers to combine with CO  2  via a bidentate double oxygen coordination, yielding a stable Al  12  P(  &#951;  2  &#8208;O  2  C) complex containing an activated radical anion of CO  2  (  i.e.  , CO  2  &#8226;&#8722;  ). Thereby, this compound can not only participate in the subsequent cycloaddition reaction with propylene oxide, but also initiate the radical reaction with hydrogen gas to form high value chemicals, revealing that Al  12  P can play an important role in catalyzing these conversion reactions. Considering that Al  12  P has been produced in laboratory, and is capable of absorbing visible light to drive the activation and transformation of CO  2  , we optimistically anticipated that this work could guide the experimentalists to discover such an additional superatom catalyst for CO  2  transformation, and open up a new research field of superatom catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Exciton Transport in Molecular Semiconductor Crystals for Spin&#8208;Optoelectronics Paradigm</title>
      <dc:description>Organic semiconductors with ultralong&#8208;range exciton diffusion length is highly desirable for optoelectronics but currently remain rare. Here, we show the diffusion length of singlet excitons (LD) in 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA) crystals grown by solvent evaporation is up to ~124 nm. These crystals show a previously unseen parallelogram morphology with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer edge&#8208;on molecular stacking, isotropic optical waveguiding, radiation rate and non&#8208;radiation rate constants of 0.15 ns&#8208;1 and 0.26 ns&#8208;1 respectively, as well as good field effect transistor hole mobility and theoretically computed strong electronic couplings as high as 109 meV. Photoresponse experiments reveal that the photoconductivity of DPA crystals is surprisingly not related to the radiative pathway, but associated with rapid exciton diffusion to crystal surface for charge separation and carrier bimolecular recombination. Taken together, this study shows that DPA with ultralong&#8208;range exciton diffusion length is a promising semiconducting material for new organic optoelectronics paradigm.</dc:description>

      <title>Single&#8208;step glycosylations with 13C&#8208;labelled sulfoxide donors: a low&#8208;temperature NMR cartography of the distinguishing mechanistic intermediates</title>
      <dc:description>Glycosyl sulfoxides have gained recognition in the total synthesis of complex oligosaccharides and as model substrates for dissecting the mechanisms involved. While these donors are usually reacted under pre&#8208;activation conditions, an experimentally more convenient single&#8208;step protocol has also been reported, whereby the activation is performed in the presence of the acceptor alcohol; yet, the nature and prevalence of the reaction intermediates formed in this more complex scenario have comparatively received minimal attention. Herein, we report a systematic NMR&#8208;based study employing both  13  C&#8208;labelled and unlabelled glycosyl sulfoxide donors for the detection and monitorization of marginally populated intermediates. Our results conclusively show that glycosyl triflates play a key role in these glycosylations despite the presence of the acceptor alcohol. Importantly, the formation of covalent donor/acceptor sulfonium adducts has been identified as the main competing reaction, thus defining a non&#8208;productive consumption of the acceptor that could limit the reaction yield.</dc:description>

      <title>Influence of Amide Connectivity on the Hydrogen Bond Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of [n.n]Paracyclophanes</title>
      <dc:description>Reported here is the synthesis and self&#8208;assembly characterization of [n.n]paracyclophanes (  [n.n]pCps  , &#160;n = 2, 3) equipped with anilide hydrogen bonding units. These molecules differ from previous self&#8208;assembling [n.n]paracyclophanes (  [n.n]pCps  ) in the connectivity of their amide hydrogen bonding units (  C  &#8208;centered/carboxamide vs.  N  &#8208;centered/anilide). This subtle change results in a ~30&#8208;fold increase in the elongation constant for the  [2.2]pCp  &#8208;4,7,12,15&#8208;tetraanilide (  [2.2]pCpNTA  ) compared to previously reported  [2.2]pCp  &#8208;4,7,12,15&#8208;tetracarboxamide (  [2.2]pCpTA  ), and a ~300&#8208;fold increase in the elongation constant for the  [3.3]pCp  &#8208;5,8,14,17&#8208;tetraanilide (  [3.3]pCpNTA  ) compared to previously reported  [3.3]pCp  &#8208;5,8,14,17&#8208;tetracarboxamide (  [3.3]pCpTA  ). The  [n.n]pCpNTA  monomers also represent the reversal of a previously reported trend in solution&#8208;phase assembly strength when comparing  [2.2]pCpTA  and  [3.3]pCpTA  monomers. The origins of the assembly differences are geometric changes in the association between  [n.n]pCpNTA  monomers&#8212;revealed by computations and X&#8208;ray crystallography&#8212;resulting in a more favorable slipped stacking of the intermolecular &#960;&#8208;surfaces (  [n.n]pCpNTA  vs.  [n.n]pCpTA  ), and a more complementary H&#8208;bonding geometry (  [3.3]pCpNTA  vs.  [2.2]pCpNTA  ).</dc:description>

      <title>Chiral oligothiophenes with remarkable circularly polarized luminescence and electroluminescence in thin films</title>
      <dc:description>We report circular polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) in thin films of self&#8208;organized oligothiophenes. Four new 1,4&#8208;phenylene and 9H&#8208;carbazole&#8208;based oligothiophenes were ad hoc designed to ensure efficient spontaneous formation of chiral supramolecular order. They were easily synthetized and their chiroptical properties in thin films were measured. Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra revealed glum in the order of 10&#8208;2 on a wide wavelengths range, originating from their self&#8208;organized chiral supramolecular organization. These molecules have reasonable properties as organic semiconductors and for this reason they can constitute the active layer of circularlypolarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Thus, we could investigate directly their electroluminescence (EL) and CPEL, without resorting to blends, but rather in a simple multilayer device with basic architecture.

      <title>Enhanced polysulfides adsorptions on CNTs/Boron Nitride fibers for excellent Li&#8208;S Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are one of the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage system. However, serious capacity attenuation and poor cycling stability induced by the shuttle effect of polysulfide intermediates can impede the practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, we report a novel sulfur cathode by intertwining multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and porous boron nitride fibers (BNFs) for the subsequent loading of sulfur. This structural design enables trapping of active sulfur and serves to localize the soluble polysulfide within the cathode region, leading to low active material loss. Compared with CNTs/S, CNTs/BNFs/S cathodes delivered a high initial capacity of 1222 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 C. Upon increasing the current density of 4 C, the cell retained a capacity of 482 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 500 cycles with a capacity decay of only 0.044% per cycle.

      <title>What determines the selectivity of arginine dihydroxylation by the nonheme iron enzyme OrfP?</title>
      <dc:description>The nonheme iron enzyme OrfP reacts with L&#8208;Arg selectively to form the 3  R  ,4  R  &#8208;dihydroxyarginine product, which in mammals can inhibit the nitric oxide synthase enzymes involved in blood pressure control. To understand the mechanisms of dioxygen activation of L&#8208;Arg by OrfP and how it enables two sequential oxidation cycles on the same substrate, we performed a density functional theory study on a large active site cluster model. We show that substrate binding and positioning in the active site guides a highly selective reaction through C  3  &#8208;H hydrogen atom abstraction. This happens despite the fact that the C  3  &#8210;H and C  4  &#8210;H bond strengths of L&#8208;Arg are very similar. Electronic differences in the two hydrogen atom abstraction pathways drive the reaction with an initial C  3  &#8210;H activation to a low&#8208;energy  5  s&#8208;pathway, while substrate positioning destabilizes the C  4  &#8210;H abstraction and sends it over the higher&#8208;lying  5  p&#8208;pathway. We show that substrate and monohydroxylated products are strongly bound in the substrate binding pocket and hence product release is difficult and consequently its lifetime will be long enough to trigger a second oxygenation cycle.</dc:description>

      <title>Lanthanoid Complexes as Molecular Materials: The Redox Approach</title>
      <dc:description>The development of molecular materials with novel functionality offers promise for technological innovation.

      <title>Efficient Emission of Ultraviolet Light by Solid State Organic Fluorophores: Synthesis and Characterization of 1,4&#8208;Dialkeny&#8208;2,5&#8208;dioxybenzenes</title>
      <dc:description>The design and development of organic luminophores that exhibit efficient ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence in the solid state remains underexplored. Here, we report that 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;benzenes and 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;disiloxybenzenes act as such UV&#8208;emissive fluorophores. The dialkenyldioxybenzenes were readily prepared in three steps from 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diacetylbenzene or 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diformylbenzene and via two to four steps from 1,4&#8208;bis(diethoxyphosphonylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzene. The dial&#8208;kenyldioxybenzenes emit UV light in solution (  &#955;  em  = 350&#8211;387 nm) and in the solid state (  &#955;  em  = 328&#8211;388 nm). In addition, the quantum yields in the solid state were generally higher than those in solution. In particular, the adamantylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes fluoresced in the UV region with high quantum yields (  &#934;  = 0.37&#8211;0.55) in the solid state. Thin films of poly(methyl methacrylate) doped with the adaman&#8208;tylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes also exhibited UV emission with good efficiency (  &#934;  = 0.27&#8211;0.45). Density functional theory calculations revealed that the optical excitation of the dialkenyldimethoxy&#8208;benzenes involves intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the ether oxygen atoms to the twisted alkenyl&#8211;benzene&#8211;alkenyl moiety, whereas the dialkenylbis(triphenylsiloxy)benzenes were optically excited through intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the oxygen atoms and twisted  &#960;  &#8208;system to the phenyl&#8211;Si moieties of each triphenylsilyl group.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The design and development of organic luminophores that exhibit efficient ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence in the solid state remains underexplored. Here, we report that 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;benzenes and 1,4&#8208;dialkenyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;disiloxybenzenes act as such UV&#8208;emissive fluorophores. The dialkenyldioxybenzenes were readily prepared in three steps from 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diacetylbenzene or 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;diformylbenzene and via two to four steps from 1,4&#8208;bis(diethoxyphosphonylmethyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzene. The dial&#8208;kenyldioxybenzenes emit UV light in solution (  &#955;  em  = 350&#8211;387 nm) and in the solid state (  &#955;  em  = 328&#8211;388 nm). In addition, the quantum yields in the solid state were generally higher than those in solution. In particular, the adamantylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes fluoresced in the UV region with high quantum yields (  &#934;  = 0.37&#8211;0.55) in the solid state. Thin films of poly(methyl methacrylate) doped with the adaman&#8208;tylidene&#8208;substituted benzenes also exhibited UV emission with good efficiency (  &#934;  = 0.27&#8211;0.45). Density functional theory calculations revealed that the optical excitation of the dialkenyldimethoxy&#8208;benzenes involves intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the ether oxygen atoms to the twisted alkenyl&#8211;benzene&#8211;alkenyl moiety, whereas the dialkenylbis(triphenylsiloxy)benzenes were optically excited through intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer from the oxygen atoms and twisted  &#960;  &#8208;system to the phenyl&#8211;Si moieties of each triphenylsilyl group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Computational Mapping of Dirhodium(II) Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>The chemistry of dirhodium(II) catalysts is highly diverse, and can enable the synthesis of many different molecular classes. A tool to aid in catalyst selection, independent of mechanism and reactivity, would therefore be highly desirable. Here, we describe the development of a database for dirhodium(II) catalysts that is based on the principal component analysis of DFT&#8208;calculated parameters capturing their steric and electronic properties. This database maps the relevant catalyst space, and may facilitate exploration of the reactivity landscape for any process catalysed by dirhodium(II) complexes. We have shown that one of the principal components of these catalysts correlates with the outcome (e.g. yield, selectivity) of a transformation used in a molecular discovery project. Furthermore, we envisage that this approach will assist the selection of more effective catalyst screening sets, and, hence, the data&#8208;led optimisation of a wide range of rhodium&#8208;catalysed transformations.</dc:description>

      <title>Innovative Multipodal Ligands Derived from Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s Bases for the Sensitization of Lanthanide(III) Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of the first family of multipodal ligands with a Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base framework designed for the preparation of luminescent lanthanide(III) complexes. Eight ligands were designed and synthesized using different strategies, including alkylation reactions, amide couplings and Ugi multicomponent reactions. All ligands bear carboxylate groups for the coordination of the lanthanide(III) ion, with lanthanide(III) sensitizing units consisting of the Tr&#246;ger&#8217;s base framework itself or attached benzamides. Upon irradiation of the chromophoric ligands, the green terbium(III) emission was efficiently generated, whereas the europium(III) emission signal was negligible. The geometry and the substitution pattern of the ligands allow the control of the stoichiometry of the species formed and the Tb(III) luminescence sensitization efficiency, showing that  para  &#8211;substitution patterns are more efficient than  meta  &#8211;substitution ones for the formation of coordination compounds with lower Tb(III)/ligand ratio. We propose that the formed species are self&#8211;assembled 2:2 or 2:4 metallosupramolecular structures.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosting the Iodine Adsorption and Radioresistance of Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 MOFs via Aromatic Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>Effective capture of radioactive iodine is of paramount importance for the safe and long&#8208;term storage of fission products in nuclear fuel cycle. Herein, a series of functionalized Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 MOFs was employed as a model to investigate the effects of substituents on iodine adsorption in both solution and vapor states. Sorption studies revealed that the electro&#8208;donating amino group exhibits the most positive role on increasing the removal rate of iodine from cyclohexane and the uptake capacity of iodine vapor. Particularly, the disubstituted Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2  can effectively remove 91.9% of iodine (300 mg/L) from cyclohexane and capture 969 mg/g iodine vapor, significantly higher than 59.6% and 334 mg/g of untagged Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, respectively. In addition, the substituent effect on the radiolytic stability of MOFs was for the first time investigated, leading to the unearthing of one of the most radioresistant MOFs Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2  reported up to date.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural and Oxidation State Alternatives in Platinum and Palladium Complexes of a Redox&#8208;Active Amidinato Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>Reaction of [Pt(DMSO)  2  Cl  2  ] or [Pd(MeCN)  2  Cl  2  ] with the electron&#8208;rich LH = N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)ethanimidamide yielded mononuclear [PtL  2  ] (  1  ) but dinuclear [Pd  2  L  4  ] (  2  ), a paddle&#8208;wheel complex. The neutral compounds were characterized through experiments (crystal structures, electrochemistry, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy, magnetic resonance) and TD&#8208;DFT calculations as metal(II) species with noninnocent ligands L  &#8208;  . The reversibly accessible cations [PtL  2  ]  +  and [Pd  2  L  4  ]  +  were also studied, the latter as [Pd  2  L  4  ][B{3,5&#8208;(CF  3  )  2  C  6  H  3  }  4  ] single crystals. Experimental and computational investigations were directed at the elucidation of the electronic structures, establishing the correct oxidation states within the alternatives [Pt  II  (L  &#8208;  )  2  ] or [Pt  o  (L  &#8226;  )  2  ], [Pt  II  (L  0.5&#8208;  )  2  ]  +  or [Pt  III  (L  &#8208;  )  2  ]  +  , [(Pd  II  )  2  (&#956;&#8208;L  &#8208;  )  4  ] or [(Pd  1.5  )  2  (&#956;&#8208;L  0.75&#8208;  )  4  ], and [(Pd  2.5  )  2  (&#956;&#8208;L  &#8208;  )  4  ]  +  or [(Pd  II  )  2  (&#956;&#8208;L  0.75&#8208;  )  4  ]  +  . In each case, the first alternative was shown to be most appropriate. Remarkable results include the preference of platinum for mononuclear planar [PtL&#173;  2  ] with an N&#8208;Pt&#8208;N bite angle of 62.8(2)&#176; in contrast to [Pd  2  L  4  ], and the dimetal (Pd  2  4+  &#8594;Pd  2  5+  ) instead of ligand (L  &#8208;  &#8594;L  &#8226;  ) oxidation of the dinuclear palladium compound.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reaction of [Pt(DMSO)  2  Cl  2  ] or [Pd(MeCN)  2  Cl  2  ] with the electron&#8208;rich LH = N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)ethanimidamide yielded mononuclear [PtL  2  ] (  1  ) but dinuclear [Pd  2  L  4  ] (  2  ), a paddle&#8208;wheel complex. The neutral compounds were characterized through experiments (crystal structures, electrochemistry, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy, magnetic resonance) and TD&#8208;DFT calculations as metal(II) species with noninnocent ligands L  &#8208;  . The reversibly accessible cations [PtL  2  ]  +  and [Pd  2  L  4  ]  +  were also studied, the latter as [Pd  2  L  4  ][B{3,5&#8208;(CF  3  )  2  C  6  H  3  }  4  ] single crystals. Experimental and computational investigations were directed at the elucidation of the electronic structures, establishing the correct oxidation states within the alternatives [Pt  II  (L  &#8208;  )  2  ] or [Pt  o  (L  &#8226;  )  2  ], [Pt  II  (L  0.5&#8208;  )  2  ]  +  or [Pt  III  (L  &#8208;  )  2  ]  +  , [(Pd  II  )  2  (&#956;&#8208;L  &#8208;  )  4  ] or [(Pd  1.5  )  2  (&#956;&#8208;L  0.75&#8208;  )  4  ], and [(Pd  2.5  )  2  (&#956;&#8208;L  &#8208;  )  4  ]  +  or [(Pd  II  )  2  (&#956;&#8208;L  0.75&#8208;  )  4  ]  +  . In each case, the first alternative was shown to be most appropriate. Remarkable results include the preference of platinum for mononuclear planar [PtL&#173;  2  ] with an N&#8208;Pt&#8208;N bite angle of 62.8(2)&#176; in contrast to [Pd  2  L  4  ], and the dimetal (Pd  2  4+  &#8594;Pd  2  5+  ) instead of ligand (L  &#8208;  &#8594;L  &#8226;  ) oxidation of the dinuclear palladium compound.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Galectin&#8208;Glycan Interaction: Guideline for Monitoring by 77Se NMR Spectroscopy and Solvent (H2O/D2O) Impact on Binding</title>
      <dc:description>Functional pairing between cellular glyco&#173;con&#173;ju&#173;gates and tissue lectins like galectins has wide (patho)physio&#173;logical significance. Their study is facilitated by non&#8208;hydrolyzable deri&#173;va&#173;tives of the natural O&#8208;glycans, such as S&#8208; and Se&#8208;glycosides. The latter en&#173;able extensive analyses by specific  77  Se NMR spectroscopy, but still remain under&#173;explored. By the example of seleno&#173;&#173;digalac&#173;to&#173;side (SeDG) and the human galectins 1 and 3, we evaluate diverse  77  Se NMR detec&#173;tion methods and pro&#173;pose selec&#173;tive  1  H,  77  Se hetero&#173;nuclear Hartmann&#8208;Hahn transfer for efficient use in com&#173;peti&#173;tive NMR screening against a seleno&#173;glycoside spy ligand. By fluores&#173;cence aniso&#173;tropy, circular dichroism, and isothermal titra&#173;tion calori&#173;metry (ITC) we show that affinity and thermodynamics of SeDG bind&#173;ing by galectins are similar to thiodi&#173;galac&#173;toside (TDG) and N&#8208;acetyl&#173;lactos&#173;amine (LacNAc), con&#173;firm&#173;ing that Se substitution has no major impact. ITC data in D  2  O vs. H  2  O are similar for TDG and LacNAc binding by both galectins, but a solvent effect, indicating solvent rearrangement at the binding site, is hinted for SeDG and clearly observed for LacNAc dimers with extend&#173;ed chain length.</dc:description>

      <title>PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS Block Copolymer Templated Mesoporous Carbons: A Comparative Study of Nitrogen and Sulfur Doping in the Oxygen Reduction Reaction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
      <dc:description>Carbon materials slightly doped with heteroatoms such as nitrogen (N&#8208;RFC) or sulfur (S&#8208;RFC) are investigated as active catalysts for the electrochemical bioelectronic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to H  2  O  2  . Mesoporous carbons with wide, accessible pores were prepared by pyrolysis of a resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde resin using a PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS block copolymer as a sacrificial templating agent and the nitrogen and sulfur doping were accomplished in a second thermal treatment employing 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline and dibenzothiophene as nitrogen and sulfur precursors, respectively. The synthetic strategy allowed to obtain carbon materials with very high surface area and mesopore volume without any further physico&#8208;chemical post treatment.
Voltammetric rotating ring&#8208;disk measurements in combination with potentiostatic and galvanostatic bulk electrolysis measurements in 0.5 M H  2  SO  4  demonstrated a pronounced effect of heteroatom doping and mesopores volume on the catalytic activity and selectivity for H  2  O  2  . N&#8208;RFC electrode was employed as electrode material in a 45 h electrolysis showing a constant H  2  O  2  production of 298 mmol&#160;g  &#8208;1  &#160;h  &#8208;1  (millimoles of H  2  O  2  divided by mass of catalyst and electrolysis time), with a faradic efficiency (FE) up to 61% and without any clear evidence of degradation. The undoped carbon RFC showed a lower production rate (218 mM&#160;g  &#8208;1  &#160;h  &#8208;1  ) but a higher FE of 76 %, while the performances drastically dropped when S&#8208;RFC (production rate 11 mmol&#160;g  &#8208;1  &#160;h  &#8208;1  and FE = 39 %) was used.</dc:description>

      <title>How does iron storage protein ferritin interact with plutonium (and thorium) ?</title>
      <dc:description>The impact of the contamination of living organisms by actinide elements has been a constant subject of attention since the 1950s. But to date still little is understood. Ferritin is the major storage and regulation protein of iron in many organisms, it consists of a protein ring and a ferrihydric core at the center. This work sheds light on the interactions of early actinides (Th, Pu) at oxidation state +IV with ferritin and its ability to store those elements at physiological pH compared to Fe.&#160;
The Ferritin &#8208; thorium load curve suggests that Th(IV) saturates the protein (2840 Th atoms per ferritin) in a similar way that Fe does on the protein ring. Complementary spectroscopic techniques (Spectrophotometry, Infrared Spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy) were combined with Molecular Dynamics to provide a structural model of the interaction of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) with ferritin. Comparison of spectroscopic data together with MD calculations suggests that Th(IV) and Pu(IV) are complexed mainly on the protein ring and not on the ferrihydric core. Indeed from XAS data, there is no evidence of Fe neighbors in the Th and Pu environments. On the other hand, carboxylates from amino acids of the protein ring and a possible additional carbonate anion are shaping the cation coordination spheres. This thorough description from a molecular view point of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) interaction with ferritin, an essential iron storage protein, is a cornerstone in comprehensive nuclear toxicology</dc:description>
