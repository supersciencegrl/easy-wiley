      <title>An Imidazolium&#8208;based Lipid Analogue as Gene Transfer Agent</title>
      <dc:description>A novel, dicationic imidazolium salt is described and investigated towards its application for gene transfer. The polar head group and the long alkyl chains in the backbone contribute to a lipid&#8208;like behavior, while an alkyl ammonium group provides the ability for crucial electrostatic interaction for the transfection process. Detailed biophysical studies regarding its impact on biological membrane models and the propensity of vesicle fusion are presented. Fluorescence spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy show that the molecule leads to negligible changes in lipid packing, while displaying distinct vesicle fusion properties. Cell culture experiments reveal that mixed liposomes containing the novel imidazolium salt can serve as plasmid DNA delivery vehicles. In contrast, a structurally similar imidazolium salt without a second positive charge showed no ability to support DNA transfection into cultured cells. Thus, we introduce a novel and variable structural motif for cationic lipids, expanding the field of lipofection agents.</dc:description>

      <title>Bis&#8208;Anthracene Fused Porphyrin as An Efficient Photocatalyst: Facile Synthesis and Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Oxidative Coupling of Amines</title>
      <dc:description>Development of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for the conversion of amines is of great importance, but has remained a challenging task. Here, a bis&#8208;anthracene fused porphyrin (AFP) was synthesized in a high yield via a facile synthetic protocol, which involves a Suzuki coupling for the conjugation of two anthracene groups with a porphyrin ring, followed by oxidative cyclodehydrogenation. When serving as a photocatalyst, AFP exhibits outstanding photocatalytic performance for the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced aerobic oxidation of amines to imines at ambient conditions.

      <title>A journey from thermally&#8208;tunable synthesis to spectroscopy of phenylmethanimine in gas&#8208;phase and solution</title>
      <dc:description>Phenylmethanimine is an aromatic imine with a twofold relevance in chemistry: organic synthesis and astrochemistry. To tackle both aspects, a multidisciplinary approach has been exploited and a new, easily accessible synthetic approach to generate stable imine&#8208;intermediates in the gas phase and in solution has been introduced. The combination of this formation pathway &#8208;based on the thermal decomposition of hydrobenzamide&#8208; with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational characterization of phenylmethanimine laid the foundation for its first laboratory observation by means of rotational electric resonance spectroscopy. Both E and Z isomers have been accurately characterized, thus providing a reliable basis to guide future astronomical observations. A further characterization has been carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, showing the feasibility of this synthetic approach in solution. The temperature dependence as well as possible mechanisms of the thermolysis process have been examined.</dc:description>

      <title>In situ synthesis of manganese oxide as an oxygen&#8208;evolving catalyst: A new strategy</title>
      <dc:description>So far, all studies on oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction by Mn oxides in the presence of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) have been carried out by synthesizing Mn oxides in the first step. And then, followed by the investigation of the Mn oxides in the presence of oxidants for oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER). This paper presents a case study of a new and promising strategy for in situ catalyst synthesis by the adding Mn(II) to either CAN or KMnO  4  /CAN solution, resulting in the formation of Mn&#8208;based catalysts for OER. The catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy&#8208;dispersive spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

      <dc:description>Hydrogen isotopically labelled compounds are essential diagnostic tools in drug research and development, as they provide vital information about the biological metabolism of drug candidates and their metabolites. Herein we report a photoredox&#8208;initiated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) protocol which efficiently and selectively introduces deuterium or tritium at C(sp 3 )&#8211;H bonds, utilizing heavy water (D 2 O or T 2 O) as the hydrogen isotope source, and a guanidine base. This protocol has been successfully applied to the high incorporation of deuterium and tritium in several amino acids (lysine, glycine and proline), and also in small peptides which contain these. These tritium&#8208;labelled peptides of several commercial drugs and natural products are suitable for application in biological experiments, such as ligand&#8208;binding assays, or absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies.</dc:description>

      <title>1&#8208; and 2&#8208;Photon Phototherapeutic Effects of Ru(II) Polypyridine Complexes in the Hypoxic Centre of Large Multicellular Tumour Spheroids and Tumour&#8208;Bearing Mice</title>
      <dc:description>During the last decades, photodynamic therapy (PDT), an approved medical technique, has received increasing attention to treat certain types of cancer. Despite recent improvements, the treatment of large tumors remains a major clinical challenge due to the low ability of the photosensitizer (PS) to penetrate a 3D cellular architecture and the low oxygen concentrations present in the tumour centre. To mimic the conditions found in clinical tumors, exceptionally large 3D multicellular tumour spheroids (MCTSs) with a diameter of 800 &#181;m were used in this work to test a series of new Ru(II) polypyridine complexes as 1&#8208;Photon and 2&#8208;Photon PSs. These metal complexes were found to fully penetrate the 3D cellular architecture and to generate singlet oxygen in the hypoxic centre upon light irradiation. While having no observed dark toxicity, the lead compound of this study showed an impressive phototoxicity upon clinically relevant 1&#8208;Photon (595 nm) or 2&#8208;Photon (800 nm) excitation with a full eradication of the hypoxic centre of the MCTSs. Importantly, this efficacy was also demonstrated on mice bearing an adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial tumour.</dc:description>

      <title>The Combination of Cross&#8208;Hyperconjugation and &#963;&#8208;Conjugation in 2,5&#8208;Oligosilanyl Substituted Siloles</title>
      <dc:description>Reaction of a 2,5&#8208;dilithiated silole with excess dichlorodimethylsilane gives the respective 2,5&#8208;bis(chloro&#173;dimethylsilyl) substituted silole. This compound can be converted to 2,5&#8208;bis(oligosilanyl) substituted siloles by addition of a suitable oligosilanide. In the UV spectrum of the thus obtained compounds the lowest energy absorption is bathochromically shifted compared to the absorptions of the two constituents, namely the 2,5&#8208;disilyl substituted silole and a trisilane. The bathochromic shift is interpreted as being caused by a mixed &#963;&#8208;conjugation/cross&#8208;hyperconjugation. This assumption is supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations, which show a significant contribution from Si&#8211;Si bonds to the HOMO of the molecule.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Crystallisation of perovskite oxides from water or other polar solvents is reviewed, illustrating the scope for control of chemical composition, nanoscale form and crystal structure. This includes solids containing transition&#8208;metals and main group elements, extending to solid&#8208;solutions and intergrowths. The materials produced have a variety of useful properties from ferroelectricity, magnetism and conductivity to heterogeneous catalysis. For more information, see the Review by R.&#8197;I.

      <title>Frontispiece: Precursor Design Strategies for the Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of Functional Oxides: It's All in the Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
Limiting the energetic budget during the solution processing of oxides is one of the most crucial considerations, adhering to green chemistry principles. Low&#8208;temperature strategies require thought&#8208;out adjustments at the level of the chemical precursor system. Specific reagents can be added to trigger auto&#8208;combustion reactions, influence the sol&#8208;gel network, obtain UV&#8208;sensitive precursors or to tune the intermediates/transition states during decomposition. The successful implementation will also open up novel applications in flexible electronics and hybrid materials. For more details see the Review by W. Marchal et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;9070&#8197;ff.

      <title>Frontispiece: Metal Oxide Nanosheets as 2D Building Blocks for the Design of Novel Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional metal oxide nanocrystals are often made by a chemical delamination process in water, which involves a layered oxide phase as the starting material. The exfoliated nanosheets have aspect ratios comparable with that of a paper sheet, and they are also very flexible. Oxide nanosheets can be used as building blocks for the construction of improved or entirely new functional materials for a wide range of application areas: nanoelectronics, energy storage, catalysis and tribology, to name just a few.

      <dc:description>
Sustainable solution methods for flexible metal oxide semiconductors are increasingly attractive to address environmental challenges through simple, cost&#8208;effective, and printable large&#8208;area manufacturing processes. This review reports state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, flexible, solution&#8208;processed metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistor semiconductors; nanoparticles, combustion, aqueous, annealing, and novel deposition approaches to low&#8208;temperature fabrication of solution&#8208;processed metal oxide semiconductors, as well as novel structures, gate dielectrics, and electrodes. In addition, solution&#8208;processed metal oxide semiconductor&#8208;based flexible systems, including displays, sensors, memory devices, neuromorphic devices, and energy&#8208;harvesting devices (solar cells and nanogenerators) are described.

      <title>Frontispiece: Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Iron Oxide Nanostructured Materials and Their Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The syntheses and applications of iron oxide nanostructured materials are of great interest due to advantageous properties of these materials, such as, their high natural abundance, low cost, easy availability, or excellent magnetic behavior. A variety of liquid&#8208;phase synthesis methods has been developed so far. An overview on these methods as well as on applications of iron oxide nanostructured materials is given in the Review by H. Li and Y.&#8208;J. Zhu on page&#8197;9180&#8197;ff.

      <dc:description>
Laser synthesis of colloids emerged in recent years as a versatile approach to access a library of clean oxide nanoparticles relying on only four main strategies running at room temperature and ambient pressure: laser ablation in liquid, laser fragmentation in liquid, laser melting in liquid and laser defect&#8208;engineering in liquid. Here, established laser&#8208;based methodologies are reviewed through the presentation of a panorama of oxide nanoparticles. For more information, see the Review by V. Amendola, S.

      <title>Frontispiece: Flexible and Epitaxial Metal Oxide Thin Film Growth by Photoreaction Processing for Electrical and Optical Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
This review outlines key variables in photoreactions that affect epitaxial and polycrystalline thin film growth, including precursor materials, laser wavelength, laser fluence, and carbon. In addition, the features of the photoreaction process that can be controlled at a low temperature by oxygen non&#8208;stoichiometry are examined. Likewise, functions that are neither achieved by developing a gradient structure nor controlled by a thermal equilibrium reaction are detailed. For more details, see the Review by T. Tsuchiya et al. on page&#8197;9261&#8197;ff.

      <title>Frontispiece: Photochemistry in the Low&#8208;Temperature Processing of Metal Oxide Thin Films by Solution Methods</title>
      <dc:description>
Photochemistry can play a leading role in the low&#8208;temperature processing of metal&#8208;oxide thin films, affecting the different stages of the chemical solution deposition process. These stages include everything from the synthesis of the precursor solution to the formation of the amorphous metal&#8208;oxygen network in the film and its subsequent crystallization into the oxide phase. The lowering of the processing temperature provides environmental and economic benefits, in addition to technological advantages, such as the integration of functional oxide layers into flexible electronics systems.

      <title>Hierarchical Mn3O4 Anchored on 3D Graphene Aerogels via C&#8722;O&#8722;Mn Linkage with Superior Electrochemical Performance for Flexible Asymmetric Supercapacitor</title>
      <dc:description>
Carbon nanohorns: An asymmetric supercapacitor was constructed by using graphene aerogels reacted either with Mn(AC)2 to form the anode or CNH to form the cathode (see scheme).







Abstract
Flexible asymmetric supercapacitors are more appealing in flexible electronics because of high power density, wide cell voltage, and higher energy density than symmetric supercapacitors in aqueous electrolyte. In virtues of excellent conductivity, rich porous structure and interconnected honeycomb structure, three dimensional graphene aerogels show great potential as electrode in asymmetric supercapacitors. However, graphene aerogels are rarely used in flexible asymmetric supercapacitors because of easily re&#8208;stacking of graphene sheets, resulting in low electrochemical activity. Herein, flower&#8208;like hierarchical Mn3O4 and carbon nanohorns are incorporated into three dimensional graphene aerogels to restrain the stack of graphene sheets, and are applied as the positive and negative electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors devices, respectively. Besides, a strong chemical coupling between Mn3O4 and graphene via the C&#8208;O&#8208;Mn linkage is constructed and can provide a good electron&#8208;transport pathway during cycles. Consequently, the asymmetric supercapacitor device shows high rate cycle stability (87.8&#8201;% after 5000&#8197;cycles) and achieves a high energy density of 17.4&#8197;&#956;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with power density of 14.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (156.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;3) at 1.4&#8197;V.

      <title>London Dispersion and Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions in Bulky Molecules: The Case of Diadamantyl Ether Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>
Alkyl groups matter: Complexes between diadamantyl ether (DAE) and water and alcohols with increasing side&#8208;chain size have been studied by using rotational spectroscopy. DAE and the clustering molecules interact through an O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bond and London dispersion (LD) interactions. The H&#8722;C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C LD attractions take place between the alkyl groups of the alcohols and those of DAE. The LD interactions increase with increasing size of the alcohol.







Abstract
Diadamantyl ether (DAE, C20H30O) represents a good model to study the interplay between London dispersion and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions. By using broadband rotational spectroscopy, an accurate experimental structure of the diadamantyl ether monomer is obtained and its aggregates with water and a variety of aliphatic alcohols of increasing size are analyzed. In the monomer, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C London dispersion attractions between the two adamantyl subunits further stabilize its structure. Water and the alcohol partners bind to diadamantyl ether through hydrogen bonding and non&#8208;covalent Owater/alcohol&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;CDAE and C&#8722;Halcohol&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;CDAE interactions. Electrostatic contributions drive the stabilization of all the complexes, whereas London dispersion interactions become more pronounced with increasing size of the alcohol. Complexes with dominant dispersion contributions are significantly higher in energy and were not observed in the experiment. The results presented herein shed light on the first steps of microsolvation and aggregation of molecular complexes with London dispersion energy donor (DED) groups and the kind of interactions that control them.

      <title>Molten&#8208;Salt Media Synthesis of N&#8208;Doped Carbon Tubes Containing Encapsulated Co Nanoparticles as a Bifunctional Air Cathode for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Battery power: Cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in a N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube network were synthesized by the molten salt method and developed as an ORR and OER bifunctional electrocatalyst. The assembled rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery using Co@N&#8208;CNTs as an air cathode has a power density of 168&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Cost efficient bifunctional air cathodes possessing high electrocatalytic activity are of great importance for the development of secondary Zn&#8208;air batteries. In this work, cobalt nanoparticles are encapsulated within a 3D N&#8208;doped open network of carbon tubes (Co@N&#8208;CNTs) by a molten&#8208;salt synthesis procedure conducted at a high temperature. Physical characterization demonstrates that Co@N&#8208;CNTs are comprised of Co particle inserted carbon tubes with mesoporous tube walls, providing significant active surface area for electrochemical reactions. High electrocatalytic activity of Co@N&#8208;CNTs towards both oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions is due to its well&#8208;developed active surface and a synergistic effect between N&#8208;doped carbon and Co nanoparticles. Both primary and secondary Zn&#8208;air battery cells assembled using Co@N&#8208;CNTs as an air cathode show higher electrochemical performance than similar cells containing commercial Pt/C and Pt/C +RuO2, making the newly developed material a promising alternative to existing metal&#8208;based air cathodes.

      <title>Dodecahedral Au/Pt Nanobowls as Robust Plasmonic Electrocatalysts for Methanol Oxidation under Visible&#8208;Light Illumination</title>
      <dc:description>
Plasmonic nanocatalysts: Au/Pt nanobowls were fabricated by a facile and template&#8208;free method and used as plasmonic electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation. The electrocatalytic activity and stability were highly improved under visible&#8208;light illumination owing to the photothermal and hot&#8208;carrier effect, which were confirmed experimentally.







Abstract
Plasmonic nanostructures with large absorption areas under resonant excitation have been utilized extensively in photon&#8208;assisted applications. In this work, dodecahedral Au nanobowls were first prepared by an easy and template&#8208;free method only through the introduction of H2PtCl6 and I&#8722; during the growth procedure. The Au nanobowls show electron&#8208;field enhancement due to the high curvature of the bowl edge, the open region, and dodecahedral morphology. Au/Pt nanobowls, which couple plasmonic Au and catalytic Pt, were then constructed as plasmonic electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation. The mass activity reached 497.6&#8197;mA&#8201;mg&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light illumination, which is 1.9 times that measured in the dark. Simultaneously, the electrocatalytic stability is also greatly improved under light excitation. The enhanced properties of the plasmonic Au/Pt electrocatalysts are ascribed to the synergistic effect of the plasmon&#8208;enhanced photothermal and hot&#8208;carrier effects on the basis of experimental investigations. This work thus offers an effective methodology to construct efficient plasmonic electrocatalysts for fuel cells.

      <dc:description>Several non&#8208;hydrolytic sol&#8208;gel syntheses involving different precursors, oxygen donors, and conditions have been screened aiming to selectively produce mesoporous t&#8208;ZrO2 or m&#8208;ZrO2 with significant specific surface areas. The in situ water formation was systematically investigated by Karl Fisher titration of the syneresis liquids. XRD and nitrogen physisorption were employed to characterize the structure and texture of the ZrO2 samples. Significant amounts of water were found in several cases, notably in the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with ketones (acetone, 2&#8208;pentanone, acetophenone), and of ZrCl4 with alcohols (benzyl alcohol, ethanol) or acetone. Conversely, the reactions of Zr(OnPr)4 with acetic anhydride or benzyl alcohol at moderate temperature (200 &#176;C) and of ZrCl4 with diisopropyl ether appear strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic. Although reaction time and reaction temperature were also important parameters, the presence of water played a crucial role on the structure of the final zirconia: t&#8208;ZrO2 is favored in strictly non&#8208;hydrolytic routes, while m&#8208;ZrO2 is favored in the presence of significant amounts of water. 1H and 13C NMR analysis of the syneresis liquids allowed us to identify the main reactions responsible for the formation of water and of the oxide network. The morphology of the most interesting ZrO2 samples was further investigated by electron microscopy (SEM, TEM).</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the Topological Landscape of DNA&#8208;Cyclodextrin Nanocomplexes by Molecular Design</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report original molecular vectors that ensure broad flexibility to tune the shape and surface properties of plasmid DNA (pDNA) condensates. The prototypic design involves a cyclodextrin (CD) platform bearing a polycationic cluster at the primary face and a doubly&#8208;linked aromatic module bridging two consecutive monosaccharide units at the secondary face, which behaves as a topology&#8208;encoding element. Subtle differences at the molecular level then translate into disparate morphologies at the nanoscale, including rods, worms, toroids, globules, ellipsoids and spheroids. In vitro evaluation of the transfection capabilities revealed marked selectivity differences as a function of nanocomplex morphology. Remarkably high transfection efficiencies were associated to ellipsoidal or spherical shapes with a lamellar internal arrangement of pDNA chains and CD bilayers. Computational studies support that the stability of such supramolecular edifices is directly related to the tendency of the molecular vector to form noncovalent dimers upon DNA templation. Since the stability of the dimers depends on the protonation state of the polycationic clusters, the co&#8208;aggregates display pH responsiveness, which facilitates endosomal scape and timely DNA release, a key step in successful transfection. The results provide a versatile strategy for the construction of fully synthetic and perfectly monodisperse non&#8208;viral gene delivery systems uniquely suited for optimization schemes.</dc:description>

      <title>A Click Chemistry Approach to Developing Molecularly Targeted DNA Scissors</title>
      <dc:description>Nucleic acid click chemistry was used to prepare a family of chemically modified triplex forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) for application as a new gene&#8208;targeted technology. Azide&#8208;bearing phenanthrene ligands&#8212;designed to promote triplex stability and copper binding&#8212;were &#8216;clicked&#8217; to alkyne&#8208;modified parallel TFOs.

Our studies have shown that imine&#8208;POSS is able to chelate metal ions like Zn(II) to form a unique coordination complex. The silsesquioxane core and the hindrance of the side arms (their steric effect) influence the construction process of the homoleptic  Zn4@POSS&#8208;1  complex.

      <title>Hierarchical Synthesis, Structure, and Photophysical Properties of Gallium&#8208; and Ruthenium&#8208;Porphyrins with Axially Bonded Azo Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  &#160;The hierarchical synthesis of&#160;three porphyrin&#160;and&#160;four&#160;bisporphyrin derivatives is presented. This strategy relies on the incorporation linkers based on azo moieties appended with pyridyl and/or acetylenic groups that facilitate axial coordination to Ga&#8208; and Ru&#8208;metalloporphyrins. These porphyrinic systems allow for a quantitative analysis of the effects of diamagnetic anisotropy (DA) using&#160;  1  H NMR spectroscopic and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses. A simple power&#8208;law relationship between the proton chemical shift and distance from the porphyrin core is experimentally outlined, which confirms previous theoretical predictions and shows that the limit of DA is about 2 nm. Photophysical properties of the azo&#8208;linked porphyrins are analyzed by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, showing that significant&#160;  cis&#8208;trans  &#160;isomerization is not observed for azo ligands bound only to Ga&#8208;porphyrins. Incorporation of Ru&#8208;porphyrins to an azo ligand facilitates photoswitching behavior,&#160;but the process faces competition from decarbonylation of the Ru&#8208;porphyrin, and appreciable switching is only documented for&#160;  GaL1Ru  .</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrostibination of alkynes: A radical mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>The addition of Sb&#8208;H bonds to alkynes was reported recently as a new hydroelementation reaction that exclusively yields anti&#8208;Markovnikov  Z  &#8208;olefins from terminal acetylenes. We examine four possible mechanisms that are consistent with the observed stereochemical and regiochemical outcomes. A comprehensive analysis of solvent, substituent, isotope, additive, and temperature effects on hydrostibination reaction rates definitively refutes three ionic mechanisms involving closed&#8208;shell charged intermediates. Instead the data support a fourth pathway featuring open&#8208;shell neutral intermediates. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are consistent with this model, predicting an activation barrier that is in agreement with the experimental value (Eyring analysis) and a rate limiting step that is congruent with experimental kinetic isotope effect. We therefore conclude that hydrostibination of arylacetylenes is initiated by the generation of stibinyl radicals, which then participate in a cycle featuring Sb  II  and Sb  III  intermediates to yield the observed  Z  &#8208;olefins as products. This mechanistic understanding will enable rational evolution of hydrostibination as a methodology for accessing challenging products such as  Z  &#8208;olefins.</dc:description>

      <title>Helicity control in the aggregation of achiral squaraine dyes in solution and thin films</title>
      <dc:description>Squaraine dyes are well known for their strong absorption in the visible regime. Reports on chiral squaraine dyes are, however, scarce. To address this gap, we here report two novel chiral squaraine dyes and their achiral counterparts. The presented dyes are aggregated in solution and in thin films. A detailed chiroptical study shows that thin films formed by co&#8208;assembling the chiral dye with its achiral counterpart exhibit exceptional photophysical properties. The calculated dissymmetry factor  g  abs  of the co&#8208;assembled structures reaches a maximum when just 25% of the chiral dye are present in the mixture. The solid structures with the highest  g  abs  are achieved when the chiral dye is used solely as a director, rather than the structural component. The chiroptical data are further supported by selected spin&#8208;filtering measurements using mc&#8208;AFM. These findings provide a promising platform for investigating the relationship between the dissymmetry of a supramolecular structure and emerging material properties rather than a comparison between a chiral molecular structure and an achiral counterpart.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Controlling the activity of enzymes is an important feature for many processes in medicine, bioanalytics, and biotechnology. So far it was not successful to fully switch biocatalysts ON and OFF by thermoresponsive enzyme inhibitors. Here, we present poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s with IDA end groups (POx&#8208;IDA) that are LCST polymers and thus thermosensitive. They are capable of reversibly inhibiting the activity of horse radish peroxidase and laccase by more than 99%. Increasing the temperature makes the POx&#8208;IDA precipitate, which leads to 100% recovery of the respective enzyme activity. This switching cycle is fully reversible. The LCST of the POx&#8208;IDA can be tuned by varying the polymer composition to generate a wide range of switching windows.</dc:description>

      <title>Hybrid White Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Based on a Blue Cationic Iridium(III) Complex and Red Quantum Dots</title>
      <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state white light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) show promising advantages of simple solution fabrication processes, low operation voltage and compatibility with air&#8208;stable cathode metals, which are required for lighting applications. To date, white LECs based on ionic transition metal complexes (iTMCs) have been shown higher device efficiencies than white LECs employing other types of materials. However, relatively lower emission efficiencies of red iTMCs limit further improvement in device performance. Alternatively, efficient red CdZnSeS/ZnS core&#8208;shell quantum dots are integrated with a blue iTMC to form a hybrid white LEC in this work. With achieving good carrier balance under a proper device architecture, peak external quantum efficiency and power efficiency reach 11.2% and 15.1 lm W  &#8208;1  , respectively. Such device efficiency is indeed higher than those of the reported white LECs employing host&#8208;guest iTMCs. Time and voltage dependent electroluminescent (EL) characteristics of the hybrid white LECs are studied with the evidence of the temporal evolution of emission zone position extracted by fitting the simulated and measured EL spectra. The working principles of the hybrid white LECs are clarified and the high device efficiency renders the proposed new white&#8208;emitting devices suitable for solid&#8208;state lighting technology.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity of a Zinc Porphyrin for CO2 Reduction: Cooperative Effects of Triazole Units in the Second Coordination Sphere</title>
      <dc:description>The control of the second coordination sphere in a coordination complex plays an important role in improving catalytic efficiency. Herein, we report a zinc porphyrin complex  ZnPor8T  with multiple flexible triazole units comprising the second coordination sphere, as an electrocatalyst for the highly selective electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) to carbon monoxide (CO). This electrocatalyst converted CO  2  to CO with a Faradaic efficiency of 99% and a current density of &#8211;6.2 mA/cm  2  at &#8211;2.4 V vs Fc/Fc  +  in  N,N  &#8208;dimethylformamide using water as the proton source. Structure&#8208;function relationship studies were carried out on  ZnPor8T  analogs containing different numbers of triazole units and distinct triazole geometries; these unveiled that the triazole units function cooperatively to stabilize the CO  2  &#8208;catalyst adduct in order to facilitate intramolecular proton transfer. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating triazole units that function in a cooperative manner is a versatile strategy to enhance the activity of electrocatalytic CO  2  conversion.</dc:description>

      <title>High energy density heteroatom (O, N and S) enriched activated carbon in rational design of symmetric supercapacitor</title>
      <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;based symmetric supercapacitors (SCs) are known for their high power and long cyclability, making them an ideal candidate for power sources in new generation electronic devices. To boost their electrochemical performances, deriving activated carbon with heteroatoms like (N, O, and S) are highly desirable for increasing the specific capacitance. In this regard,&#160;self&#8208;doped heteroatoms activated carbon (AC) materials directly derived from bio&#8208;waste of the lima&#8208;bean shell by different KOH activation processes. The heteroatom enriched AC synthesized from 1:2 ratio of pretreated carbon and KOH (ONS@AC&#8208;2) shows excellent surface morphology with a large surface area of 1508 m2 g&#8208;1. As an SCs electrode material, the presence of heteroatoms (N and S) reduces the interfacial charge transfer resistance and increase the ion&#8208;accessible surface area which inherently provides additional pseudocapacitance. The ONS@AC&#8208;2 electrode attains a maximum specific capacitance (Csp) of 342 F g&#8208;1 at a specific current of 1 A g&#8208;1 in 1 M NaClO4 electrolyte at the wide potential window of 1.8 V. Moreover, as symmetric SCs the ONS@AC&#8208;2 electrode delivers a maximum Csc of 191 F g&#8208;1 with a maximum specific energy of 21.48 Wh kg&#8208;1 and high specific power of 14000 W kg&#8208;1 and excellent retention of its initial capacitance value (98%) even for 10000 cycles of charge/discharge. In addition, a flexible supercapacitor fabricated utilizing ONS@AC&#8208;2 electrodes and LiCl/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based gel polymer electrolyte shows a maximum Csc of 119 F g&#8208;1 with considerable specific energy and power.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural design and synthesis of SnO2@C@Co&#8208;NC composite as high&#8208;performance anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>To overcome the drawbacks of the structural instability and poor conductivity of SnO2&#8208;based anode materials, we designed and synthesized a hollow core&#8208;shell structured SnO2@C@Co&#8208;NC composite by employing the heteroatoms&#8208;doping and multi&#8208;confining strategy. This composite material displayed a much&#8208;reduced resistance for charge transfer and excellent cycling performance compared to the bare SnO2 NPs and SnO2@C composites. The doped heteroatoms and heterostructure boost the charge transfer, and the porous structure shortens the Li&#8208;ions diffusion pathway. Also, the volume expansion of SnO2 NPs was accommodated by the hollow space and restricted by the multi&#8208;shell of heteroatoms&#8208;doped carbon framework. As a result, this structured anode material delivered a high initial capacity of 1559.1 mA h g&#8208;1 at 50 mA g&#8208;1, and an initial charge capacity of 627.2 mA h g&#8208;1 at 500 mA g&#8208;1. Moreover, the discharge capacity could be maintained at 410.8 mA h g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles with an attenuation rate of only 0.069% per cycle. This multi&#8208;confined SnO2@C@Co&#8208;NC structure with superior energy density and durable lifespan is highly promising for the next&#8208;generation LIBs.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Specific Recognition of Guanosine Using Engineered Base Excised Aptamers</title>
      <dc:description>Purines and their derivatives are highly important molecules in biology for nucleic acids synthesis, energy storage, and signaling. While many DNA aptamers have been obtained for binding adenine derivatives such as adenosine, AMP and ATP, the success for specific binding of guanosine has been limited. Instead of performing new aptamer selections, we report herein a base&#8208;excised strategy to engineer existing aptamers for binding guanosine. Both the Na+&#8208;binding aptamer and classical adenosine aptamer were manipulated as the base&#8208;excising scaffold. A total of seven guanosine aptamers were desined, in which a G16&#8208;deleted Na+&#8208;aptamer showed the highest binidng specificity and affinity for guanoisne, with an apparent Kd of 0.78 mM. Single monophosphate difference was recognizable. Both the aptamer scaffold generality and excised&#8208;site generality were systematically studied. Overall, this work provides a few guanosine binding aptamers by using non&#8208;SELEX method. It also provides deeper insights into engineering aptamers for molecular recognition.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorine&#8208;18 Radiolabelling and Photophysical Characteristics of Multimodal PET&#8208;Fluorescence Molecular Probes</title>
      <dc:description>Positron emission tomography (PET)&#8208;fluorescence imaging is an emerging field of multimodality imaging seeking to attain synergy between the two techniques. The probes employed in PET&#8208;fluorescence imaging incorporate both a fluorophore and radioisotope which enable complementary information to be obtained from both imaging techniques  via  the administration of a single agent. Fluorine&#8208;18 is the most commonly used radioisotope in PET imaging and consequently many novel attempts to radiofluorinate various fluorophores have transpired over the past decade. In this review, the most relevant fluorine&#8208;18 labelled PET&#8208;fluorescence probes have been classified into four groups as per the implemented fluorophore: i) boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes, ii) cyanine dyes, iii) alternative organic fluorophores and iv) organometallics such as quantum dots (QDs) and rhenium complexes. The biological, radiochemical and photophysical properties of each probe have been systematically compared to aid future endevaours in PET&#8208;fluorescence chemistry.</dc:description>

In this review, the most relevant fluorine&#8208;18 labelled PET&#8208;fluorescence probes have been classified into four groups as per the implemented fluorophore: i) boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes, ii) cyanine dyes, iii) alternative organic fluorophores and iv) organometallics such as quantum dots (QDs) and rhenium complexes. The biological, radiochemical and photophysical properties of each probe have been systematically compared to aid future endevaours in PET&#8208;fluorescence chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Amphiphilic Polymeric Nanoparticles for Photoredox Catalysis in Water</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoredox catalysis takes a bath: Single&#8208;chain polymeric nanoparticles are utilized as an efficient and recyclable platform to perform photoredox catalysis in water. The reduction of aryl halides and C&#8722;C cross coupling reactions are studied upon UV&#8208;light illumination under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Photoredox catalysis has recently emerged as a powerful synthesis tool in organic and polymer chemistry. In contrast to the great achievements realized in organic solvents, performing photocatalytic processes efficiently in aqueous media encounters several challenges. Here, it is presented how amphiphilic single&#8208;chain polymeric nanoparticles (SCPNs) can be utilized as small reactors to conduct light&#8208;driven chemical reactions in water. By incorporating a phenothiazine (PTH) catalyst into the polymeric scaffold, metal&#8208;free reduction and C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions can be carried out upon exposure to UV light under ambient conditions. The versatility of this approach is underlined by a large substrate scope, tolerance towards oxygen, and excellent recyclability. This approach thereby contributes to a sustainable and green way of implementing photoredox catalysis.

      <title>Modeling the Reaction of Carboxylic Acids and Isonitriles in a Self&#8208;Assembled Capsule</title>
      <dc:description>
Filling the capsule: Reactions of a carboxylic acid with n&#8208;butyl and isopropyl isonitriles in a self&#8208;assembled capsule were investigated by DFT. For R=iPr, the transition state and the product of the final, acyl transfer step are significantly shorter than the preceding intermediate, and this results in energetically unfavorable empty spaces inside the capsule, which cause a higher barrier, whereas for R=nBu the C4 chain can untwine and thus maintain an appropriate guest length.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations were used to study the reaction of carboxylic acids with isonitriles inside a resorcinarene&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled capsule. Experimentally, it has been shown that the reactions between p&#8208;tolylacetic acid and n&#8208;butyl isonitrile or isopropyl isonitrile behave differently in the presence of the capsule compared both with each other and also with their solution counterparts. Herein, the reasons for these divergent behaviors are addressed by comparing the detailed energy profiles for the reactions of the two isonitriles inside and outside the capsule. An energy decomposition analysis was conducted to quantify the different factors affecting the reactivity. The calculations reproduce the experimental findings very well. Thus, encapsulation leads to lowering of the energy barrier for the first step of the reaction, the concerted &#945;&#8208;addition and proton transfer, which in solution is rate&#8208;determining, and this explains the rate acceleration observed in the presence of the capsule. The barrier for the final step of the reaction, the 1,3 O&#8594;N acyl transfer, is calculated to be higher with the isopropyl substituent inside the capsule compared with n&#8208;butyl. With the isopropyl substituent, the transition state and the product of this step are significantly shorter than the preceding intermediate, and this results in energetically unfavorable empty spaces inside the capsule, which cause a higher barrier. With the n&#8208;butyl substituent, on the other hand, the carbon chain can untwine and hence uphold an appropriate guest length.

      <title>Distinct helical molecular orbitals through conformational lock</title>
      <dc:description>Several theoretical studies have proposed strategies to generate helical molecular orbitals (Hel&#8208;MOs) in [n]cumulenes. While chiral even&#8208;[n] cumulenes feature Hel&#8208;MOs, odd&#8208;[n] cumulenes may also present them if the terminal groups lie on different planes. However, the proposed systems have been either experimentally unfeasible or resulted in opposite pseudo&#8208;degenerated Hel&#8208;MOs. We hereby demonstrate the introduction of a remarkable energy difference between helical orbitals of opposite twist by fixing the torsion angle between the terminal groups in butadiyne fragments. In order to experimentally lock the conformation of the terminal groups, we designed and synthesized cyclic architectures by combining acetylenes with chiral spirobifluorenes. The high stability of these systems with distinct helical orbitals allowed their isolation and full characterization. In our view these results constitute a milestone in the development of real systems presenting helical molecular orbitals.</dc:description>

      <title>Alternating Magnetic Field (AMF) Controlled Targeting Drug Delivery Based on Graphene Oxide&#8208;Grafted Nano&#8208;Supramolecules</title>
      <dc:description>Graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;grafted nano&#8208;supramolecules have been recently emerged as a neoteric nano&#8208;drug carrier in therapy of refractory diseases. Herein, we reported an original multicomponent nano&#8208;supramolecular drug carrier based on targeted peptide and magnetic GO whose behavior of drug releasing can be regulate by alternating magnetic field (AMF).

Owing to the host&#8208;guest interaction between &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and the cyclohexyl groups on MitP, GONiCD and HAMitP could form supramolecular assemblies during the doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;loading process, not only remarkably enhancing the drug&#8208;loading capacity, but also improving the drug&#8208;releasing efficiency under the stimulus of alternating magnetic field (AMF). During co&#8208;incubation with the tumor cells, the Dox&#8208;loading assemblies could strongly target the tumor mitochondria, and damage both the mitochondria and the nuclei, owing to Dox release from the assemblies induced by AMF.

      <title>The Photoisomerization Pathway(s) of Push&#8208;Pull Phenylazoheteroarenes</title>
      <dc:description>Azoheteroarenes are the most recent derivatives targeted to further improve the properties of azo&#8208;based photoswitches. Their light&#8208;induced mechanism for trans&#8208;cis isomerization is assumed to be very similar to that of the parent azobenzene. As such, they inherited from the controversy about the dominant isomerization pathway (rotation vs. inversion) depending on the excited state (n&#960;* vs. &#960;&#960;*). While the controversy seems settled in azobenzene, the extent to which the same conclusions apply to the more structurally&#8208;diverse family of azoheteroarenes is unclear. Here, we unravel by means of non&#8208;adiabatic molecular dynamics, the photoisomerization mechanism of three prototypical phenyl&#8208;azoheteroarenes with an increasing push&#8208;pull character. The evolution of the rotational and inversion conical intersection energies, the preferred pathway, and the associated kinetics upon both n&#960;* and &#960;&#960;* excitations can be linked directly with the push&#8208;pull substitution effects. Overall, we clarify the working conditions of this family of azo&#8208;dyes and identify a possibility to exploit push&#8208;pull substituents to tune their photoisomerization mechanism, with potential impact on their quantum yield.</dc:description>

      <title>Multiscale approach of spin crossover materials &#8208; a concept mixing Russian dolls and domino effects</title>
      <dc:description>The spin crossover (SCO) phenomenon corresponds to a modification that originates at the atomic scale. However, the simple consideration of the transformations that occur following the SCO at this scale or in its close vicinity does not allow anyone to truly understand, anticipate and thus take advantage of what happens at the scale of the material, and even less at the device one. As the fruit of years of work and experience on this phenomenon, we formalize here the concept of the multiscale understanding of SCO. Clearly, the deflagration generated by the initial impressive atomic modification on all the physical scales of the solid must be understood in terms of structure&#8208;properties relationships that fit together, like Russian dolls, and propagate according to a kind of domino effect. Each scale can both give different and independent consequences from those of the other scales but at the same time can influence those of a larger or smaller scale, the whole being imperatively to take into account. The concept appears well illustrated by the volume modification, always the same at the atomic level but drastically different and adaptable, in amplitude and sense, at any other physical scale. This approach results in a much wider range of potential applications than the atomic level alone initially suggests, including one serious path to shape memory materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Coupling of 1,3&#8208;Dipoles and Boronic Acids as a Sustainable Approach to C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
      <dc:description>
A scalable and metal&#8208;free approach to carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation using 1,3&#8208;dipole systems generated from hydrazonyl chloride or hydroxamoyl chloride precursors and aryl boronic acid derivatives is reported. Generation of the 1,3&#8208;dipole results in activation of the boronic acid, with migration of the pendant aryl group to forge a new C&#8722;C bond in yields up to 80&#8201;% (see scheme).







Abstract
The need for alternative, complementary approaches to enable C&#8722;C bond formation within organic chemistry is an on&#8208;going challenge in the area. Of particular relevance are transformations that proceed in the absence of transition&#8208;metal reagents. In the current study, we report a comprehensive investigation of the coupling of nitrile imines and aryl boronic acids as an approach towards sustainable C&#8722;C bond formation. In situ generation of the highly reactive 1,3&#8208;dipole facilitates a Petasis&#8211;Mannich&#8208;type coupling via a nucleophilic boronate complex. The introduction of hydrazonyl chlorides as a complementary nitrile imine source to the 2,5&#8208;tetrazoles previously reported by our laboratory further broadens the scope of the approach. Additionally, we exemplify for the first time the extension of this protocol into another 1,3&#8208;dipole, through the synthesis of aryl ketone oximes from aryl boronic acids and nitrile N&#8208;oxides.

      <title>Density Functional Theory Study of Pd Aggregation on a Pyridine&#8208;Terminated Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer</title>
      <dc:description>
How to aggregate: DFT calculations for the initial stage of Pd electrodeposition onto a pyridine&#8208;terminated self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) are reported. By using periodic models and methods comprising standard structure optimization and molecular dynamic simulations, the large energetic driving force for the initial metal aggregation is predicted.







Abstract
By using density functional theory calculations, the initial steps towards Pd metal cluster formation on a pyridine&#8208;terminated self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) consisting of 3&#8208;(4&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)phenyl)propane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol on an Au(1&#8201;1&#8201;1) surface are investigated. Theoretical modelling allows the investigation of structural details of the SAM surface and the metal/SAM interface at the atomic level, which is essential for elucidating the nature of Pd&#8211;SAM and Pd&#8211;Pd interactions at the liquid/solid interface and gaining insight into the mechanism of metal nucleation in the initial stage of electrodeposition. The structural flexibility of SAM molecules was studied first and the most stable conformation was identified, planar molecules in a herringbone packing, as the model for Pd adsorption. Two binding sites are found for Pd atoms on the pyridine end group of the SAM. The strong interaction between Pd atoms and pyridines illustrates the importance of SAM functionalisation in the metal nucleation process. Consistent with an energetic driving force of approximately &#8722;0.3&#8197;eV per Pd atom towards Pd aggregation suggested by static calculations, a spontaneous Pd dimerisation is observed in ab initio molecular dynamic studies of the system. Nudged elastic band calculations suggest a potential route with a low energy barrier of 0.10&#8197;eV for the Pd atom diffusion and then dimerisation on top of the SAM layer.

In this work, we rationally designed and synthesized a small set of four protein fluorogens with red or near&#8208;infrared emission. The fluorophores were characterized in the presence of albumin as a model protein environment and exhibited good fluorogenicity and brightness (fluorescence quantum yield up to 36 %). Once conjugated to a haloalkane ligand, the probes reacted with the protein self&#8208;labeling tag HaloTag with a high fluorescence enhancement (up to 156&#8208;fold). The spectroscopic properties of the fluorogens and their reaction with HaloTag were investigated  in vitro  experimentally and with the help of molecular dynamics. The two most promising probes, one in the red and one in the near&#8208;infrared range, were finally applied to image the nucleus or actin in live&#8208;cell and in wash&#8208;free conditions using fluorogenic and chemogenetic targeting of HaloTag fusion proteins.</dc:description>

      <title>Conformational Sensing by a Mammalian Olfactory Receptor</title>
      <dc:description>
Rotate to activate: Precisely what molecular features do the olfactory GPCRs sense in odorant ligands? The rodent Olfr2 receptor binds aliphatic aldehydes indiscriminately, but conformational restriction experiments on the flexible agonist, octanal, correlates the C5&#8722;C6 rotamer position with different receptor outputs&#8212;activation, partial activation, or antagonism. Thus, an olfactory GPCR can carry out conformational analysis during odor recognition.







Abstract
To identify odors, the mammalian nose deploys hundreds of olfactory receptors (ORs) from the rhodopsin&#8208;like class of the G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptor superfamily. Odorants having multiple rotatable bonds present a problem for the stereochemical shape&#8208;based matching process assumed to govern the sense of smell through OR&#8211;odorant recognition. We conformationally restricted the carbon chain of the odorant octanal to ask whether an OR can respond differently to different odorant conformations. By using calcium imaging to monitor signal transduction in sensory neurons expressing the mouse aldehyde OR, Olfr2, we found that the spatial position of the C7 and C8 carbon atoms of octanal, in relation to its &#8722;CHO group, determines whether an aliphatic aldehyde functions as an agonist, partial agonist or antagonist. Our experiments provide evidence that an odorant can manipulate an OR through its intrinsic conformational repertoire, in unexpected analogy to the photon&#8208;controlled aldehyde manipulation observed in rhodopsin.

The cover feature illustrates the mechanism of ATP detection by a new fluorescent receptor in aqueous solution. The receptor works like bellows: it exists in solution in a stacked form but opens only for binding of ATP. Moreover, the receptor represent an example of a ratiometric probe, which changes its color from yellow to blue upon ATP recognition. Test tubes in the picture display our efforts to separate the pyrene derivatives by column chromatography. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E.&#8197;A. Kataev et&#8197;al.

      <dc:description>
Evolution has led to conserved enzyme families that efficiently catalyze the same chemical reaction but in radically different thermal environments. In particular, some enzymes need to be stable and to work in very hot conditions that usually lead to protein melting. Using atomistic simulations and analytic modeling, it is shown that the temperature&#8208;dependence of the enzyme accessible conformations plays a key role in the determination of its optimum working temperature, that cannot be predicted from its melting temperature alone.

      <title>Growth and Atomic&#8208;Scale Characterization of Ultrathin Silica and Germania Films: The Crucial Role of the Metal Support</title>
      <dc:description>The present research article reports on the preparation and atomic&#8208;scale characterization of the thinnest possible films of the glass&#8208;forming materials silica and germania. To this end state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art surface science techniques, in particular scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory calculations have been&#160; employed. The investigated films range from monolayer to bilayer coverage where both, the crystalline and the amorphous films, contain characteristic XO$_4$ (X=Si,Ge) building blocks. A side&#8208;by&#8208;side comparison of silica and germania monolayer, zigzag phase and bilayer films supported on Mo(112), Ru(0001), Pt(111), and Au(111) leads to a more general comprehension of the network structure of glass former materials. This allows us to understand the crucial role of the metal support for the pathway from crystalline to amorphous ultrathin film growth.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present research article reports on the preparation and atomic&#8208;scale characterization of the thinnest possible films of the glass&#8208;forming materials silica and germania. To this end state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art surface science techniques, in particular scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory calculations have been&#160; employed. The investigated films range from monolayer to bilayer coverage where both, the crystalline and the amorphous films, contain characteristic XO$_4$ (X=Si,Ge) building blocks. A side&#8208;by&#8208;side comparison of silica and germania monolayer, zigzag phase and bilayer films supported on Mo(112), Ru(0001), Pt(111), and Au(111) leads to a more general comprehension of the network structure of glass former materials. This allows us to understand the crucial role of the metal support for the pathway from crystalline to amorphous ultrathin film growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Asymmetric Host Molecule bearing Pyridine Core for Highly Efficient Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#8208;OLEDs</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, two host materials, pCzBzbCz  and pCzPybCz  , were synthesized for achieving high efficiency and long lifetime of blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence&#8208;organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (TADF&#8208;OLEDs). The molecular design strategy is conducted by introducing pyridine group into the core structure of pCzPybCz  as an electron&#8208;withdrawing unit and electron&#8208;donating phenyl group into the structure of pCzBzbCz  . These host materials demonstrated good thermal stability and high triplet energy (T 1  = 3.07 eV for pCzBzbCz  and 3.06 eV for pCzPybCz  ) for fabricating blue TADF&#8208;OLEDs. In particular, pCzPybCz  &#8208;based OLED devices demonstrated an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.7% and an operational lifetime of 24 h (LT 90  , time to attain 90% of initial luminance) at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m &#8208;2  . This superior lifetime could be explained by the C&#8208;N bond dissociation energy (BDE) in the host molecular structure. Furthermore, a mixed host system using the electron&#8208;deficient 2,4&#8208;bis(dibenzo[ b,d  ]furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (DDBFT) was proposed to inhibit the formation of anion state of our host materials. In short, the device operational lifetime was further improved by applying DDBFT. The carbazole&#8208;based asymmetric host molecule containing pyridine core realized a high&#8208;efficiency blue TADF&#8208;OLED, showing a positive effect on the operating lifetime and can provide useful strategies for designing new host materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational design of a uranyl metal&#8208;organic framework for the capture and colorimetric detection of organic dyes</title>

The thermal and photophysical properties of RPL&#8208;1 were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis and absorbance, fluorescence, and lifetime spectroscopies.

      <dc:description>This study describes the synthesis, structure, and photophysical properties of a new luminescent polyaromatic boronic acid scaffold, diazaboryl&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;ketones (DNKs). These stable compounds display extremely bright fluorescence, aggregation&#8208;induced emission, positive solvatochromism, and solid state fluorescence. DFT calculations and X&#8208;ray crystallographic study revealed notable electronic and structural differences between these compounds and the parent diaminonaphthalene (DAN) adducts, Acylation of the DAN system causes a localization of both HOMO and LUMO onto the DNK unit, which supports the negligible influence of the B&#8208;aryl substituent. The LUMO energy is lowered, and its shape significantly altered. Photophysical data in solution and the solid state revealed blue&#8208;shifted, narrowed, and intense emissions for DNKs (up to 89% quantum yield). The potential utility of the fluorogenic DNK system was demonstrated with a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the determination of trace boronic acid contaminants in solid samples, down to one&#8208;ppm level, using HPLC with fluorescence detection.

      <dc:description>RNA interference (RNAi) is an essential and powerful tool for targeting and verifying specific gene functions. Conditional control of siRNA activity, especially using light activation, is a potential method to regulate target gene expression and functions.

      <dc:description>Reaction of 1,2&#8208;di(tetrazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethane (ebtz) with Fe(BF4)2&#183;6H2O in different nitriles yields one dimensional coordination polymers [Fe(ebtz)2(RCN)2](BF4)2&#8901;nRCN (n  =2 for R=&#8208;CH3&#160;  (1) and  n=0 for R=&#8208;C2H5&#160;  (2),&#8208;C3H7&#160;  (3),&#8208;C3H5&#160;  (4),&#8208;CH2Cl (5)) exhibiting spin crossover (SCO). SCO in  1  and  3&#8208;5  is complete and occurs above 160 K. In  2  it is shifted to lower temperatures and is accompanied by wide hysteresis (T1/2&#8595;=78 K, T1/2&#8593;=123 K) and proceeds extremely slow. Isothermal (80K) time resolved single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed a complex nature of the HS&#8594;LS transition in  2  . Initial, slow stage is associated with shrinkage of polymeric chains and with reduction of cell volume at 77% (in relation to difference between cell volumes VHS  &#8208;VLS  ) whereas only 16% of iron(II) ions changed spin state. In the second stage an abrupt SCO commences, associated with breathing of crystal lattice along direction of Fe&#8208;nitrile bonds, while the nitriles reorient. HS&#8594;LS switching triggered by light (808 nm) reveals the coupling of spin state and nitrile orientation. The importance of this coupling was confirmed by studies of [Fe(ebtz)2(C2H5CN/C3H7CN)2  ](BF4)2  mixed crystals (2a,  2b), showing a shift of T1/2  to higher values and narrowing of the hysteresis loop occurring together with an increase of fraction of butyronitrile. This increase reduces the capability of nitriles molecules to reorient. Density functional theory (DFT) studies of models of  1&#8208;5  suggest a particular possibility of  2  to adopt a low (140&#8208;145&#176;) value of its Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C(propionitrile) angle.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced Performance of Zirconium&#8208;Doped Ceria Catalysts for the Methoxycarbonylation of Anilines</title>
      <dc:description>The methoxycarbonylation of anilines stands as an attractive method for the phosgene&#8208;free production of carbamates. Despite the high yields reported for ceria as catalyst, the reduction of the amount of side products and the prevention of catalyst deactivation still represent major hurdles in this chemistry. One advantage of ceria is the possibility of tuning its reactivity by doping its lattice with other metals. A series of doped ceria&#8208;based materials, prepared by substitution with metals, are evaluated in the methoxycarbonylation of 2,4&#8208;diaminotoluene with dimethylcarbonate. Among all catalysts, containing Eu, Hf, La, Pr, Sm, Tb, Y or Zr oxides, ceria with 2 mol% ZrO2 exhibited 96% selectivity towards the desired carbamates, improving the CeO2 catalyst. Density functional theory demonstrates that two descriptors are needed: (i) a geometric factor that governs the reduction of energy barriers for carbamate formation through ureas; (ii) catalyst basicity as N&#8208;H bonds need to be activated. Assessment in subsequent reaction cycles revealed that the CeO2/ZrO2 catalyst is more stable than bulk CeO2, along with the reduction of fouling processes.</dc:description>

      <title>Isolated Cobalt Ions Embedded in Magnesium Oxide Nanostructures: Spectroscopic Properties and Redox Activity</title>
      <dc:description>Atomic dispersion of dopants and control over their defect chemistry are central goals in the development of oxide nanoparticles for functional materials with dedicated electronic, optical or magnetic properties. We produced highly dispersed oxide nanocubes with atomic distribution of cobalt ions in substitutional sites of the MgO host lattice via metal organic chemical vapour synthesis. Vacuum annealing of the nanoparticle powders up to 1173&#160;K has no effect on the shape of the individual particles and only leads to moderate particle coarsening. Such materials processing, however, gives rise to the electronic reduction of particle surfaces, which &#8211; upon O2 admission &#8211; stabilize anionic oxygen radicals that are accessible to UV/Vis diffuse reflectance and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Multi&#8208;reference quantum chemical calculations show that the optical bands observed mainly originate from transitions into 4A2g (4F), 4T1g (4P) states with a contribution of transitions into 2T1g, 2T2g (2G) states through spin&#8208;orbit coupling and gain intensity through vibrational motion of the MgO lattice or the asymmetric ion field. Related nanostructures are a promising material system for single atomic site catalysis. At the same time, it represents an extremely valuable model system for the study of interfacial electron transfer processes that are key to nanoparticle chemistry and photochemistry at room temperature, and in heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>
