         <title>Urea&#8208;comprising single core diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives: exploring the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly and charge transport properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular electronics exploits the distinctive features stemming from non&#8208;covalent interactions, guiding the self&#8208;assembly of molecules to craft materials endowed with customized electronic functionalities. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded materials, characterized by their capacity to establish dynamic and stable networks, introduce an extra dimension to the development of supramolecular electronic systems.
This study presents a comparative analysis of two remarkably small semiconductors utilizing diketopyrrolopyrrole functionalized with urea units as hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs, strategically positioned at opposing ends of the conjugated core. We show how the subtle distinction in functionalization not only influences morphology and self&#8208;assembly dynamics via hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking formation, but also holds significant consequences for ultimate charge transport properties. Our observations into the interplay of noncovalent interactions provide valuable insights and strategic pathways for the design of novel materials with enhanced electronic characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>From Neutral Diarsenes to Diarsene Radical Ions and Diarsene Dications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarsene [L(MeO)GaAs]2 (L = HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2, Ar = 2,6iPr2C6H3, 4) reacts with MeOTf and MeNHC (MeNHC = 1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) to the diarsene [L(TfO)GaAs]2 (5) and the carbene&#8208;coordinated diarsene [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)Ga(OMe)L] (6). The NHC&#8208;coordination results in an inversion of the redox properties of the diarsene 4, which shows only a reversible reduction event at E1/2 = &#8722;2.06 V vs Fc0/+, whereas the carbene&#8208;coordinated diarsene 6 shows a reversible oxidation event at E1/2 = &#8722;1.31 V vs Fc0/+1. Single electron transfer reactions of 4 and 6 yielded
[K[2.2.2.]cryp][L(MeO)GaAs]2 (8) and [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)Ga(OMe)L][B(C6F5)4] (9) containing the radical anion [L(MeO)GaAs]2&#8226;&#8722;</dc:description>

         <title>NiCo&#8208;LDH coupled with 2D ZIF&#8208;derived Co nitrogen doped carbon nanosheet arrays&#160;as a self&#8208;supporting electrocatalyst for detection of formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formaldehyde is susceptible to illegal addition to foodstuffs to extend their shelf life due to its antimicrobial, preservative and bleaching properties. In this study, a self&#8208;supporting &#8220;nanosheet on nanosheet&#8221; arrays electrocatalyst with core&#8208;shell heterostructure was prepared in situ by coupling NiCo layer double hydroxide with 2D ZIF derived Co&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon on carbon cloth (Co&#8208;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC). Co&#8208;N/C nanosheet arrays act as a scaffold core with good electrical conductivity, providing more NiCo&#8208;LDH nucleation sites to avoid NiCo&#8208;LDH agglomeration, thus having fast mass/charge transfer performance. While the NiCo&#8208;LDH nanosheet arrays shell with high specific surface area provide more active sites for electrochemical reactions. As an electrocatalytic sensing electrode, Co&#8208;N/C@NiCo&#8208;LDH NSAs/CC has a wide linear range of 1 &#956;M to 13 mM for formaldehyde detection, and the detection limit is 82 nM. Besides, the sensor has been applied to the detection of formaldehyde in food samples with satisfactory results.</dc:description>

         <title>On Haptotropic Rearrangements of Diphosphene and Diarsene Ligands in Titanium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dipnictenes of the type RE=ER (E&#160;=&#160;P, As, Sb, Bi) are the isovalence electronic heavier analogs of alkenes. Although diphosphenes and dipnictenes in general show a variety of binding modes in metal complexes, little is known about haptotropic shift reactions involving these ligands. Herein, we report an unprecedented &#951;2 to &#951;1 rearrangement of the dipnictene ligands in titanocene complexes of the type Cp2Ti(Pn2Ar2) (Pn = P, As; Ar&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;Me3&#8208;C6H2, Mes; 2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3, Dip; 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2, Tip), initiated by Lewis basic ligands (L = MeCN, PMe3, AdNC, CO). In the presence of L the dipnictene ligand changes its hapticity from &#951;2 to &#951;1 and complexes of the general form Cp2Ti(L)(Pn2Ar2) with a succinctly different electronic structure are obtained. Electronically, the new complexes are best described as biradicaloids with antiferromagnetically coupled (via a &#960;&#8208;bond) [Cp2TiIII]&#8226;+ and [Pn2Ar2]&#8226;&#8722; fragments. However, the biradical character of these systems is affected by the electronic features of the co&#8208;ligand and significantly decreases moving from PMe3/MeCN (&#963;&#8208;donors) to CNAd/CO (&#963;&#8208;donors/&#960;&#8208;acceptors).</dc:description>

         <title>An Organocatalytic Highly Enantioselective Stereospecific Synthesis of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dihydroisobenzofurans</title>

Both the (E&#8208; and Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone provide (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the 1,1&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran with excellent stereospecificity. In general, excellent yields (up to 95%) and enantioselectivity (up to 98% ee) were obtained. Furthermore, the resulting 1,1&#8208;disubstituted isobenzofuran or phthalan was converted to corresponding chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides without losing the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Rich Heterocycles Derived from a Phosphadiazonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocycles that pair main group elements and nitrogen are extremely important within the &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials research community. Compared to the vast number of boron&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles, those that include phosphorus are less common. Furthermore, the use of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen triple bonds of any type to prepare such compounds is unprecedented. Here, we pair pyridyl hydrazonide ligands with phosphadiazonium cations and demonstrate that the chelated Mes*NP group is directly implicated in the photophysical and redox properties observed for the resulting heterocycles. In doing so, we introduce a novel building block for the production of phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles that could find use in small molecule activation and catalysis or as the functional component of emerging organic electronics.</dc:description>

Here, we pair pyridyl hydrazonide ligands with phosphadiazonium cations and demonstrate that the chelated Mes*NP group is directly implicated in the photophysical and redox properties observed for the resulting heterocycles. In doing so, we introduce a novel building block for the production of phosphorus-containing heterocycles that could find use in small molecule activation and catalysis or as the functional component of emerging organic electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Empowering Protein Engineering through Recombination of Beneficial Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This comprehensive review underscores the pivotal role of beneficial substitution recombination in customizing protein functionalities, showcasing diverse experimental and computational methodologies across a broad spectrum of case studies.







Abstract
Directed evolution stands as a seminal technology for generating novel protein functionalities, a cornerstone in biocatalysis, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology. Today, with the development of various mutagenesis methods and advanced analytical machines, the challenge of diversity generation and high&#8208;throughput screening platforms is largely solved, and one of the remaining challenges is: how to empower the potential of single beneficial substitutions with recombination to achieve the epistatic effect. This review overviews experimental and computer&#8208;assisted recombination methods in protein engineering campaigns. In addition, integrated and machine learning&#8208;guided strategies were highlighted to discuss how these recombination approaches contribute to generating the screening library with better diversity, coverage, and size. A decision tree was finally summarized to guide the further selection of proper recombination strategies in practice, which was beneficial for accelerating protein engineering.

         <title>Oxidation of Alcohols in Continuous Flow with a Solid Phase Hypervalent Iodine Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discover a sustainable, solid&#8208;phase catalyst for fast and efficient oxidation of a wide range of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyls in continuous flow! The new approach enables successful oxidation of various alcohols, including previously unreactive primary alcohols, with minimal catalyst loadings and rapid product accessibility.







Abstract
One of the most useful transformations in the synthetic chemist arsenal is the oxidation of alcohols to their corresponding carbonyl congeners. Despite its seemingly straightforward nature, this transformative reaction predominantly relies on the use of metals or hazardous reagents, making these processes highly unsustainable. To address this challenge, we have developed a sustainable metal&#8208;free method for the oxidation of alcohols in continuous flow. Using a solid phase hypervalent iodine catalyst and nBu4HSO5 as a phase transfer catalyst and co&#8208;oxidant, primary and secondary alcohols were selectively oxidized to the corresponding carbonyl motifs. This operationally simple continuous&#8208;flow set&#8208;up is highly robust (15 cycles run without significant catalyst leaching or loss of reaction efficiency), uses green solvents, such as acetonitrile or acetic acid, and is readily scalable.

         <title>From the Iron Pentacarbonyl Cation to Heteroleptic &#951;6&#8208;arene Carbonyls and bis&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene Cations</title>

Access to low valent iron chemistry: Substitution of the carbonyl ligands in [Fe(CO)5]+[WCA]&#8722; generates bis&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene complexes of the type [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]+/2+([WCA]&#8722;)1/2 (arene=C6H6, C6H3Me3, C6H5F). Partial substitution gives the heteroleptic cations [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(CO)2]+[WCA]&#8722; (arene=C6H6, C6H3Me3, C6H5F, mes*). These salts have been characterized by EPR, M&#246;ssbauer, NMR and XRD analysis as well as computational methods.







Abstract
Partial ligand substitution at the iron pentacarbonyl radical cation generates novel half&#8208;sandwich complexes of the type [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(CO)2]&#8901;+ (arene=1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene, 1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Of those, the bulkier 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene (mes*) derivative [Fe(mes*)(CO)2]&#8901;+ was fully characterized by XRD analysis, IR, NMR, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry as the [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) salt. Chemical electronation, i.&#8201;e., the single electron reduction, with decamethylferrocene generates neutral [Fe(mes*)(CO)2], whereas further deelectronation under CO&#8208;pressure leads to a dicationic three&#8208;legged [Fe(mes*)(CO)3]2+ salt with [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; counterion. The full substitution of the carbonyl ligands in [Fe(CO)5]&#8901;+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; mainly resulted in disproportionation reactions, giving solid Fe(0) and the dicationic bis&#8208;arene salts [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]2+([Al(ORF)4]&#8722;)2 (arene=1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Only by employing the very large fluoride bridged anion [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;, it was possible to isolate an open shell bis&#8208;arene cation salt [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8901;+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;. The highly reactive cation was characterized by XRD analysis, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The disproportionation of [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8901;+ salts to give solid Fe(0) and [Fe(C6H6)2]2+ salts was analyzed by a suitable cycle, revealing that the thermodynamic driving force for the disproportionation is a function of the size of the anion used and the polarity of the solvent.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Based Sensors for Benzene Vapor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensing of benzene vapor is a hot spot due to the volatile drastic carcinogen even at trace concentration. However, achieving convenient and rapid detection is still a challenge. As a sort of functional porous materials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been developed as detection sensors by adsorbing benzene vapor and converting it into other signals (fluorescence intensity/wavelength,&#160;chemiresistive, weight or color, etc.). Supramolecular interaction between benzene molecules and the host framework, aperture size/shape and structural flexibility are influential factors in the performance of MOF&#8208;based sensors. Therefore, enhancing the host&#8208;guest interactions between the host framework and benzene molecules, or regulating the diffusion rate of benzene molecules by changing the aperture size/shape and flexibility of the host framework&#160;to enhance the detection signal are effective strategies for constructing MOF&#8208;based sensors. This concept highlights several types of MOF&#8208;based sensors for the detection of benzene vapor.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemically Driven para&#8208;Selective C(sp2)&#8722;H Alkylation Enabled by Activation of Alkyl Halides without Sacrificial Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With alkyl halides (I, Br, Cl) as a coupling partner, an electrochemically driven strategy for para&#8208;selective C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes (aryl esters, aldehydes, nitriles, and ketones) has been achieved to access diverse alkylated arenes in one step. The reaction enables the activation of alkyl halides in the absence of sacrificial anodes, achieving the formation of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds under mild electrolytic conditions.

Bubbles arising from wild gas evolution commonly exist in electrochemical systems. Herein, the concept of a &#8220;bubble&#8208;diode&#8221; breathable electrode to promote gaseous molecules to the external environment with high efficiency while avoiding bubble accumulation has been introduced from the original conception to the current state of maturation.







Abstract
Bubbles arising from wild gas evolution commonly exist in electrochemical systems, particularly in water electrolysis and rechargeable aqueous batteries (e.&#8201;g., Zn&#8208;air batteries). Substantial energy dissipation occurs due to the obstruction of active sites and ion&#8208;conducting pathways by evolving bubbles. Efforts are made to elucidate effective strategies for fast gas transport, most of which focus on minimizing bubble size and facilitating their timely detachment through complex techniques such as constructing super&#8208;hydrophilic nano&#8208;structure electrodes, flowing electrolytes, and ultrasonic oscillation. Recently, an innovative, facile, and highly efficient method utilizing a breathable electrode design to promote gaseous molecules to the external environment emerges as a promising approach since it avoids remarkable bubble accumulation while remaining free of additional accessories. This paper highlights the origin and evolution of this promising design. Starting with introducing the basic concept of traditional breathable electrodes based on hydrophobic polymer networks and discussing the current progress made in underlying mechanisms, a detailed description of the advanced design inspired by a &#8220;bubble&#8208;diode&#8221; concept with superior breathability follows. This Concept aims to contribute to a deep understanding of this technology and paves the way for further advancements in this renewable energy era.

         <title>Heterometallic AuI6AgI6 Macrocyclic Cluster Templated by a Supramolecular Melamine Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The AuI6AgI6 macrocyclic cluster has been constructed by a supramolecular templating approach. The bilayered tri&#8208;deprotonated melamine dimer [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722;]2 held together with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions is observed for the first time, and it is important for the highly ordered alignment of metal atoms. The supramolecular templates containing multiple symmetric binding sites present a facile approach to functional metal clusters.







Abstract
The application of supramolecular templates in aligning atomically precise heterometal arrays is important for pursuing functional materials. Herein, we report that a bilayered supramolecular tri&#8208;deprotonated melamine dimer functions as an effective template in the construction of a heterometallic gold(I)&#8208;silver(I) macrocyclic cluster [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722;]2&#8722;AuI6AgI6. X&#8208;ray single crystal structural analysis showed that a crown&#8208;like AuI6AgI6 macrocycle is aligned around two parallelly stacked &#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722; moieties hold together with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Theoretical calculations revealed that the [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722;]2 motif dominantly contributes to the near&#8208;occupied orbitals in the electronic structure, which is closely related to its luminescence properties. This work demonstrates that the supramolecular templates containing multiple symmetric binding sites may present a facile approach in the construction of functional metal clusters.

         <title>A New Look at the Mechanism of Cocrystal Formation and Coformers Exchange in Processes Forced by Mechanical and/or Thermal Stimuli &#8211; ex situ and in&#8197;situ Studies of Low&#8208;Melting Eutectic Mixtures</title>

The first attempt to explain in&#8197;situ with atomic resolution the multi&#8208;stage mechanism of cocrystals formation in various devices used for their preparation (ball mills, hot stage melting, MAS rotors).







Abstract
Three different devices: ball mill, hot stage melting, and magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR rotor were used for the preparation of ethenzamide (ET) cocrystals with glutaric acid (GLU), ethylmalonic acid (EMA) and maleic acid (MAL) as coformers. In each case, well&#8208;defined binary systems (ET:EMA, ET:GLU, ET:MAL) were obtained. The common features of the two solvent free methods of cocrystal formation (grinding, melting) are presented on the basis of arguments obtained by solid state NMR spectroscopy. Thermal analysis (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) proved that the eutectic phase arises over a wide range of molar ratios of components for each of the binary systems. NMR techniques, supported by theoretical calculations, allowed to provide details about the pathway of the reaction mechanism with atomic accuracy. It was found that the formation of ET cocrystals is a complex process that requires five steps. Each step has been recognized and described. Variable temperature 1D and 2D MAS NMR experiments allowed to track physicochemical processes taking place in a molten state. Moreover, it was found that in a multicomponent mixture consisting of all four components, ET, EMA, GLU, and MAL, ET in the molten phase behaves as a specific selector choosing only one partner to form binary cocrystals according to energy preferences. The process of exchange of coformers in binary systems during grinding, melting, and NMR measurements is described. The stabilization energies (Estab) and molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps computed for the cocrystals under discussion and their individual components rationalize the selection rules and explain the relationships between individual species.

         <title>Zeolite/Polymer Composites Prepared by Photopolymerization: Effect of Compensation Cations on Opacity and Gas Adsorption Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphical abstract: The composition of zeolite influences the photopolymerization process of zeolite/polymer&#8208;based composites. The nature of compensation cations was examined to determine their effect on the opacity of the cured composite (via colorimetric analyses) and on the gas adsorption properties (for water, carbon dioxide and 1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene) on calcined composites.







Abstract
The fabrication of structured zeolite adsorbents through photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing which offers a solution to the limitations of conventional shaping techniques has been demonstrated but many parameters still need to be optimized. In this study, we studied the influence of zeolite compensation cations on the photopolymerization and the composite's properties. Modified zeolites (LTA 4&#8197;A and FAU 13X exchanged with K+, Li+, Sr2+, Ca2+ or Mg2+) were incorporated in PEGDA with BDMK as photoinitiator, and the formulation was cured under mild conditions (LED@405&#8197;nm, room temperature, under air). Our results indicate that the nature of zeolite compensation cations affects the colorimetric properties of polymer/zeolite composites: a better translucency parameter results in higher depth of cure. After calcination at 650&#8201;&#176;C and complete removal of PEGDA, pure zeolitic monoliths were tested for adsorption of gas molecules of interest (carbon dioxide, dichlorobenzene and water). Structured 4&#8197;A and 13X monoliths obtained by 3D printing exhibit comparable adsorption capacity to commercial beads prepared from the same zeolites. This study enhances our understanding of the photopolymerization process involved in the production of polymer/zeolite composites. These composites are used in the fabrication of zeolitic objects through 3D printing, offering potential solutions to various environmental and dental challenges.

Modified zeolites (LTA 4&#8197;A and FAU 13X exchanged with K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) were incorporated in PEGDA with BDMK as photoinitiator, and the formulation was cured under mild conditions (LED@405&#8197;nm, room temperature, under air). Our results indicate that the nature of zeolite compensation cations affects the colorimetric properties of polymer/zeolite composites: a better translucency parameter results in higher depth of cure. After calcination at 650&#8201;&#176;C and complete removal of PEGDA, pure zeolitic monoliths were tested for adsorption of gas molecules of interest (carbon dioxide, dichlorobenzene and water). Structured 4&#8197;A and 13X monoliths obtained by 3D printing exhibit comparable adsorption capacity to commercial beads prepared from the same zeolites. This study enhances our understanding of the photopolymerization process involved in the production of polymer/zeolite composites. These composites are used in the fabrication of zeolitic objects through 3D printing, offering potential solutions to various environmental and dental challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic topological and supramolecular control of Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity based on a tunable self&#8208;complexing host&#8208;guest molecular switch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining two biorelevant concepts, i.&#8201;e., compartmentalization and regulator&#8208;induced conformational change allows control of the Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity between a furan moiety and maleimide in water. Using a thermosensitive regulator enables the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to be turned off at elevated temperature, whereas it is activated by lowering the temperature, representing a rare example of reduced reactivity at elevated temperature.







Abstract
Compartmentalization and binding&#8208;triggered conformational change regulate many metabolic processes in living matter. Here, we have synergistically combined these two biorelevant processes to tune the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactivity of a synthetic self&#8208;complexing host&#8208;guest molecular switch CBPQT4+&#8208;Fu, consisting of an electron&#8208;rich furan unit covalently attached to the electron&#8208;deficient cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) tetrachloride (CBPQT4+, 4Cl&#8722;) host. This design allows CBPQT4+&#8208;Fu to efficiently compartmentalize the furan ring inside its host cavity in water, thereby protecting it from the DA reaction with maleimide. Remarkably, the self&#8208;complexed CBPQT4+&#8208;Fu can undergo a conformational change through intramolecular decomplexation upon the addition of a stronger binding molecular naphthalene derivative as a competitive guest, triggering the DA reaction upon addition of a chemical regulator. Remarkably, connecting the guest to a thermoresponsive lower critical solution temperature (LCST) copolymer regulator controls the DA reaction on command upon heating and cooling the reaction media beyond and below the cloud point temperature of the copolymer, representing a rare example of decreased reactivity upon increasing temperature. Altogether, this work opens up new avenues towards combined topological and supramolecular control over reactivity in synthetic constructs, enabling control over reactivity through molecular regulators or even mild temperature variations.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Mononuclear N,N,O&#8208;Bound Fe(II) &#945;&#8208;Keto&#8208;Acid Complex</title>

Modelling &#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Enzymes. We employed a bulky, tripodal N,N,O phenolate ligand to synthesise the first example of a mononuclear, N,N,O&#8208;bound iron(II) &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;acid complex. This unique, pentacoordinate complex is a close structural model of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent iron enzymes. The complex undergoes rapid decarboxylation when exposed to O2, thereby mirroring important aspects of native enzyme reactivity.







Abstract
A bulky, tridentate phenolate ligand (ImPh2NNOtBu) was used to synthesise the first example of a mononuclear, facial, N,N,O&#8208;bound iron(II) benzoylformate complex, [Fe(ImPh2NNOtBu)(BF)] (2). The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 2 reveals that the iron centre is pentacoordinate (&#964;=0.5), with a vacant site located cis to the bidentate BF ligand. The M&#246;ssbauer parameters of 2 are consistent with high&#8208;spin iron(II), and are very close to those reported for &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;bound non&#8208;heme iron enzyme active sites. According to&#8197;NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, the structural integrity of 2 is retained in both coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating solvents. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the iron centre has a very low oxidation potential and is more prone to electrochemical oxidation than the redox&#8208;active phenolate ligand. Complex 2 reacts with NO to form a S=3/2 {FeNO}7 adduct in which NO binds directly to the iron centre, according to EPR, UV&#8208;vis, IR spectroscopies and DFT analysis. Upon O2 exposure, 2 undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to form a diiron(III) benzoate complex, [Fe2(ImPh2NNOtBu)2(&#956;2&#8208;OBz)(&#956;2&#8208;OH)2]+ (3). A small amount of hydroxylated ligand was also observed by ESI&#8208;MS, hinting at the formation of a high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediate. Initial reactivity studies show that 2 is capable of oxygen atom transfer reactivity with O2, converting methyl(p&#8208;tolyl)sulfide to sulfoxide.

         <title>High&#8208;Contrast Photoacoustic Imaging of Localized Cysteine in Orthotopic Breast Cancer Enabled by A Totally&#8208;Caged Methylene Blue Probe</title>

Dedicated to the 90th anniversary of South China Normal University.It developed a methylene blue&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with NIR optical absorption totally caged, which could afford dramatical &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; absorption transition for high&#8208;contrast photoacoustic sensing imaging (PASI) towards the localized cysteine. This work established an up&#8208;to&#8208;date strategy to originally eliminate the background photoacoustic signal for PASI to accurately monitor cysteine in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
High&#8208;contrast photoacoustic sensing imaging (PASI) was greatly determined by optical absorption changes of the absorbers usually enabled by activatable probes via controllably converting the absorbed electromagnetic energy to ultrasound waves. However, most of current photoacoustic probes still suffer from limited imaging contrast towards specific species because of their small absorption spectral changes in the near infrared (NIR) region. Herein, we developed a methylene blue&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with its NIR optical absorption totally caged, which could afford dramatical &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; absorption transition for high&#8208;contrast photoacoustic imaging towards the localized cysteine. The rationally designed methylene blue&#8208;based probe for cysteine (MB&#8208;Cys) would keep in off state with almost no absorption in NIR region, while upon activated by cysteine through cyclization reaction with acrylates, it would reconstruct the &#960;&#8208;conjugation system to release the free methylene blue with strong absorption centered at 665&#8197;nm (&gt;130&#8208;fold enhancement). The unique responsive behavior could enable the PASI for photoacoustic mapping the cysteine in orthotopic breast cancer in a high&#8208;contrast manner. Therefore, this work established an up&#8208;to&#8208;date strategy to originally eliminate the background photoacoustic signal for PASI to accurately monitor cysteine in&#8197;vivo.

In this work, a straightforward synthesis of C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindolines is achieved by a formal umpolung strategy. The protocols were tolerant of a wide variety of substituents on the indole and indoline ring. In addition, the C3&#8722;N1&#8217; bisindolines could be converted to C3&#8722;N1&#8217; indole&#8208;indolines and C3&#8722;N1&#8217;&#8208;bisindoles. Also, we have successfully synthesized (&#177;)&#8208;rivularin A through a biomimetic late&#8208;stage tribromination as a key step.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Interactions Enhanced Colorimetric Sensors for Both Acid and Base Vapor Based on Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

Imine&#8208;based COFs with spatial&#8208;distribution&#8208;defined D&#8208;A structures are successfully synthesized and exhibit simultaneous sensing ability towards both acidic and alkaline vapors.







Abstract
Due to the high surface area and uniform porosity of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), they exhibit superior properties in capturing and detecting even trace amounts of gases in the air. However, the COFs materials that possess dual detected functionality are still less reported. Here, an imine&#8208;based COF containing thiophene as a donor and triazine as an acceptor to form spatial&#8208;distribution&#8208;defined D&#8208;A structures was prepared. D&#8208;A system between thiophene and triazine facilitates the charge transfer process during the protonation process of the imine and the triazine units. The obtained COF exhibits simultaneous sensing ability toward both acidic and alkaline vapors with obvious colorimetric sensing functionality.

         <title>Water&#8208;Based Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Like Supramolecular Metallohydrogel Organized by Using a Native Ultrashort Peptide Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
l&#8208;His&#8208;l&#8208;Ile&#8208;l&#8208;Thr (HIT), a short unmodified &#8220;native&#8221; tripeptide, reacts selectively with Cu2+ ions in pure water to form a transparent supramolecular metallohydrogel. This is a rare phenomenon in which a tripeptide forms a metallohydrogel without any protective group. HIT is transformed from a random coil&#8208;like structure to a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like structure by the Cu2+ ions, thereby forming a hydrogel.







Abstract
Designing supramolecular hydrogels using short peptides is challenging. To control self&#8208;assembly, a certain amount of organic solvent is typically added to the system, or the short peptide is modified with a functional group that is hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or highly coordinative. We discovered that l&#8208;His&#8208;l&#8208;Ile&#8208;l&#8208;Thr (HIT), a very short unmodified &#8220;native&#8221; tripeptide, selectively responds to Cu2+ ions in pure water to form a transparent supramolecular metallohydrogel. Circular dichroism analysis revealed that Cu2+ ions, but no other metal species, caused HIT to change from a random&#8208;coil&#8208;like to a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like structure. Other spectroscopic methods were used to characterize the properties of the supramolecular metallohydrogel. These results are expected to facilitate the development of native short peptides as advanced functional biomaterials.

         <title>In vitro Production of Hemin&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) is crucial to improve various industrial and biotechnological processes. In this study, we successfully designed a hemin&#8208;based ArM with peroxidase activity. Our results reveal improved properties compared to the activity of free hemin. Moreover, we also achieved the fabrication of this ArM in&#8197;vitro and in emulsio.







Abstract
Developing enzyme alternatives is pivotal to improving and enabling new processes in biotechnology and industry. Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are combinations of protein scaffolds with metal elements, such as metal nanoclusters or metal&#8208;containing molecules with specific catalytic properties, which can be customized. Here, we engineered an ArM based on the consensus tetratricopeptide repeat (CTPR) scaffold by introducing a unique histidine residue to coordinate the hemin cofactor. Our results show that this engineered system exhibits robust peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity driven by the hemin. The expression of the scaffold and subsequent coordination of hemin was achieved by recombinant expression in bulk and through in&#8197;vitro transcription and translation systems in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil drops. The ability to synthesize this system in emulsio paves the way to improve its properties by means of droplet microfluidic screenings, facilitating the exploration of the protein combinatorial space to discover improved or novel catalytic activities.

         <title>Template Assisted Formation of 32&#8201;and 34&#960; Octaphyrins Embedded with Dithienopyrrole Cores: A New Scaffold to Unravel Proton Coupled Redox Switching and (Anti)Aromaticity</title>

The fourfold meso&#8208;substituted 32&#960; antiaromatic octaphyrin 1 embedded with dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrrole undergoes facile proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to its 34&#960; aromatic congener H21&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H+. Such a conversion was effective even in the presence of weak acids as well as small organic molecules like alcohols and amines. The stable aromatic freebase H21 exhibits near&#8208;planar conformation with colorimetric sensing for fluoride and hydroxide anions.







Abstract
Herein, we report two distinct octaphyrins obtained by the condensation of new dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]pyrrole based tetrapyrrane under two different acidic conditions. Fourfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin was the major product when the reaction was performed in the presence of an aryl aldehyde using trifluoroacetic acid. Whereas, the sixfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin was obtained when the precursor was condensed with pentafluorobenzaldehyde using para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid. Such a template effect of aryl aldehydes in oxidative coupling reactions is realized for the first time in literature. Experimental and theoretical studies suggested that the oxidized form of fourfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin is 32&#960; antiaromatic and undergoes proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the protonated form of 34&#960; aromatic congener upon treatment with protic acids. Furthermore, small organic molecules such as alcohols and amines were also found to promote chemical reduction. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure revealed that the aromatic counterpart is highly planar and stabilized by several intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and F&#8722;F interactions, leading to a large 3D supramolecular arrangement and exhibited colorimetric sensing for fluoride and hydroxide anions. On the other hand, sixfold meso&#8208;substituted octaphyrin did not show (anti)aromatic features, PCET or anion sensing, but its intriguing absorption features associated with protonation could make it an ideal candidate for pH&#8208;dependent bioimaging.

         <title>Chiral Supramolecular Organogel Constructed Using Riboflavin and Melamine: Its Application in Photo&#8208;Catalyzed Colorimetric Chiral Sensing and Enantioselective Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>

Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of optically active riboflavin and melamine derivatives produces a chiral supramolecular organogel, which acts as a light&#8208;stimulated chiral sensor and a chiral adsorbent that enables colorimetric chiral discrimination and optical resolution.







Abstract
The synthesis of a chiral supramolecular organogel via the hierarchical helical self&#8208;assembly of optically active riboflavin and melamine derivatives is described herein. Owing to the photocatalysis of riboflavin and the supramolecular chirality induced in the helically stacked riboflavin/melamine complex, the gel is observed to act as a light&#8208;stimulated chiral sensor of optically active alcohols by detecting the change in color from yellow to green. The gel also served as an efficient chiral adsorbent, enabling optical resolution of a racemic compound with high chiral recognition ability.

         <title>Cyclic Hydrocarbon Frameworks Containing Two Bismuth Atoms: Towards 9,10&#8208;Dibismaanthracene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of dinuclear bismuth heterocycles featuring the dihydro&#8208;dibismaanthrace structural motif are presented. These compounds involve bismuth halides, selenides, and heterobimetallic bismuth / transition&#8208;metal compounds with a versatile coordination chemistry. Synthetic access to the low&#8208;valent highly reactive dibismaanthracene (the so&#8208;called bismanthrene) has been probed and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based bismanthrene surrogates are suggested.







Abstract
When bismuth atoms are incorporated into cyclic organic systems, this commonly goes along with strained or distorted molecular geometries, which can be exploited to modulate the physical and chemical properties of these compounds. In six&#8208;membered heterocycles, bismuth atoms are often accompanied by oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen as a second hetero&#8208;element. In this work, we present the first examples of six&#8208;membered rings, in which two CH units are replaced by BiX moieties (X=Cl, Br, I), resulting in dihydro&#8208;anthracene analogs. Their behavior in chemically reversible reduction reactions is explored, aiming at the generation of dibisma&#8208;anthracene (bismanthrene). Heterometallic compounds (Bi/Fe, Bi/Mn) are introduced as potential bismanthrene surrogates, as supported by bismanthrene&#8208;transfer to selenium. Analytical techniques used to investigate the reported compounds include NMR spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free, Hindered, Regioselective Access to Multifunctional Groups Diarylamines via SNAr Substitution of P&#8208;Nitroso Aromatic Methyl Ether by Arylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional groups diarylamines efficiently produced from arylamines and p&#8208;nitrosoanisole derivatives by intermolecular SNAr under weak acid conditions. Relying on the catalysis of hydrogen protons, the SNAr reaction, which is endowed with resistance to space crowding, tolerance to halogen and nitroso groups, and high regioselectivity, can be carried out under mild conditions, even if the substrates involved do not have strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups.







Abstract
Multifunctional groups diarylamines, an innovative product, efficiently produced from arylamines and p&#8208;nitrosoanisole derivatives by intermolecular SNAr under weak acid conditions. This SNAr proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and more significantly, the substrates involved do not necessarily require strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Moreover, this SNAr is characterized by resistance to space crowding, tolerance to halogen and nitroso functional groups, and high regioselectivity. Mechanistic observations suggest that the SNAr is the result of the transfer of the positive charge center of the protonated nitroso group to the p&#8208;methoxy group.

The coordination chemistry of the homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;dinuclear tetrahedral molybdenum complexes [Mo2E2] (E=P, As, Sb) and [Mo2PE] (E=As, Sb) towards [(dppf)Cu(MeCN)2][BF4] are presented showing structural evidence of the side&#8208;on &#951;2&#8208;coordination of the tetrahedral [Mo2PE] and [Mo2E2] complexes and a rare &#951;1&#8208;coordination of the [Mo2PSb] complex.







Abstract
Novel isomorphous tetranuclear complexes, [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;E2{CpMo(CO)2}2]BF4 [E=P (1), As (4), Sb (5), (dppf=1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;ferrocene)] and [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE{CpMo(CO)2}2]BF4 [E=As (2), Sb(3)] were synthesized from the reactions between [(dppf)Cu(MeCN)2][BF4] and tetrahedral molybdenum complexes containing unsubstituted homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;diatomic group&#8208;15 elements [(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;E2{CpMo(CO)2}2] [E=P (A), As (D), Sb (E)] and [(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE{CpMo(CO)2}2] [E=As (B), Sb (C)], respectively. In all these products, the {Mo2E2} or {Mo2PE} moieties coordinate the Cu(I) center via a rare side&#8208;on &#951;2&#8208;coordination mode. The X&#8208;ray structure analyses of [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;PSb{CpMo(CO)2}2][BF4] demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of an &#951;1&#8208;coordination mode for the ligand complex C to coordinate to the Cu(I) center. All the products were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Electrochemical studies also revealed the formation of 1&#8211;5, and, further, to understand the structure and bonding of the products, theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) were conducted.

         <title>[3+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynyl Boronates and in&#8197;situ Generated Azomethine Ylide</title>

[3+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and in&#8197;situ generated azomethine ylide is used for the selective scalable synthesis of pyrroline&#8208; and diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane&#8208;derived boronates (i.&#8201;e., 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 cycloadducts). The C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions of the obtained building blocks illustrate their utility for organic synthesis and drug discovery.







Abstract
Scalable [3+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and in&#8197;situ generated unstabilized azomethine ylide is reported for the first time. The selective formation of either 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 cycloaddition products was achieved by carefully optimizing the reaction conditions, mainly by controlling the reactant stoichiometry, catalyst loading, and internal temperature. The developed protocol tolerated many valuable functional groups, including TMS, protected alcohol (as ether or THP derivatives), or aldehyde (as acetal). Further common C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions, as well as scaled&#8208;up procedures demonstrate the utility of the prepared compounds as building blocks for organic synthesis and drug discovery.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Construction of Metal Nanoparticles Loaded COF Catalysts for Aqueous Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of metal nanoparticles loaded COFs catalysts have been prepared via one&#8208;pot construction strategy without lab&#8208;cost procedures, demonstrating excellent hydrogenation performance under mild conditions. The new strategy can be further evolved as into a versatile platform to create new COFs materials and explore the resultant applications.







Abstract
The catalysis performance of metal nanoparticles (NPs) will be significantly deteriorated because of their spontaneous agglomeration during practical applications. Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) materials with functional groups and well&#8208;defined channels benefit for the dispersion and anchor of metal ions and the confined growth of metal NPs, working as an ideal platform to compose catalytic systems. In this article, we report a one&#8208;pot strategy for the preparation of metal NPs loaded COFs without the need of post&#8208;modification. During the polymerization process, the pre&#8208;added metal ions were stabilized by the rapidly formed COF oligomers and hardly disturb the construction of COFs. After reduction, metal NPs are uniformly anchored on the COF matrix. Eventually, a wide spectrum of metal NPs, including Au, Pd, Pt, AuPd, CuPd, CuPt and CuPdPt, loaded COFs are successfully prepared. The versatility and metal ions anchoring mechanism are verified with four different COF matrixes. Taking AuPd NPs as example, the resultant AuPd NPs loaded COF materials can selectively decompose ammonium formate and produce hydrogen in&#8208;situ, exhibiting over 99&#8201;% conversion of hydrodechlorination for chlorobenzenes and nitro&#8208;reduction reaction for nitroaromatic compounds under ambient temperature in aqueous solution.

&#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor agonists are used for the treatment of asthma, but also play a role in heart diseases. Several photoswitchable &#946;2&#8208;receptor agonists with nanomolar activity were synthesized and one adrenaline derivative is a one&#8208;digit nanomolar, trans&#8208;on, full agonist for the &#946;2&#8208;receptor. It represents a novel molecular probe for biological studies with high structural similarity to native adrenaline.







Abstract
&#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor (&#946;2&#8208;AR) agonists are used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but also play a role in other complex disorders including cancer, diabetes and heart diseases. As the cellular and molecular mechanisms in various cells and tissues of the &#946;2&#8208;AR remain vastly elusive, we developed tools for this investigation with high temporal and spatial resolution. Several photoswitchable &#946;2&#8208;AR agonists with nanomolar activity were synthesized. The most potent agonist for &#946;2&#8208;AR with reasonable switching is a one&#8208;digit nanomolar active, trans&#8208;on arylazopyrazole&#8208;based adrenaline derivative and comprises valuable photopharmacological properties for further biological studies with high structural accordance to the native ligand adrenaline.

We report the synthetic approach and the characterization of a family of highly water&#8208;soluble porphyrin&#8208;PBI donor&#8208;acceptor amphiphiles by the utilization of oligo&#8208;carboxylic acid capped Newkome dendrons. The amphiphiles form stable aggregates in basic aqueous solutions. The amphiphiles can be individualized by the addition of THF, which manifests itself, for example, in the reinstatement of fluorescence emission.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis and characterization of a family of three water&#8208;soluble bola&#8208;amphiphilic zinc&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide triads containing oligo carboxylic&#8208;acid capped Newkome dendrons in the periphery. Variations of the perylenebisimide (PBI) core geometry and dendron size (G1 and G2 dendrons with 3&#8208; and 9&#8208;carboxylic acid groups respectively) allow for tuning the supramolecular aggregation behavior with respect to variation of the molecular architecture. The triads show good solubility in basic aqueous media and aggregation to supramolecular assemblies. Theoretical investigations at the DFT level of theory accompanied by electrochemical measurements unravel the geometric and electronic structure of the amphiphiles. UV/Vis and fluorescence titrations with varying amounts of THF demonstrate disaggregation.

         <title>A New Series of Sandwich&#8208;Type 5,5&#8242;&#8208;Biterphenylenes: Synthetic Challenge, Structural Uniqueness and Photodynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crowded biaryls, bi&#8208;linear&#8208;terphenylenes, contain several aryl/terphenylenyl/aryl sandwiches. This unique structure provides an ideal model for studying the through&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, which are strongly reflected in the shielding of 1H&#8201;NMR chemical shifts, properties and aromaticity.







Abstract
A new series of biaryls, bi&#8208;linear&#8208;terphenylenes (BLTPs), were prepared using the tert&#8208;butyllithium&#8208;mediated cyclization as the key synthetic step. The three&#8208;dimensional structures of the studied compounds were verified using X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT calculations. Tetraaryl(ethynyl)&#8208;substituted BLTPs are highly crowded molecules, and the internal rotation around the central C&#8722;C bond is restricted due to a high barrier (&gt;50&#8197;kcal/mol).

&lt;p&gt;Highly crowded biaryls, bi-linear-terphenylenes, contain several aryl/terphenylenyl/aryl sandwiches. This unique structure provides an ideal model for studying the through-space &#960;-&#960; interactions, which are strongly reflected in the shielding of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8201;NMR chemical shifts, properties and aromaticity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new series of biaryls, bi-linear-terphenylenes (BLTPs), were prepared using the &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyllithium-mediated cyclization as the key synthetic step. The three-dimensional structures of the studied compounds were verified using X-ray crystallography and DFT calculations. Tetraaryl(ethynyl)-substituted BLTPs are highly crowded molecules, and the internal rotation around the central C&#8722;C bond is restricted due to a high barrier (&amp;gt;50&#8197;kcal/mol). These structures contain several aryl/terphenylenyl/aryl sandwiches, where the through-space &#960;-&#960; (TSPP) interactions are strongly reflected in the shielding of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8201;NMR chemical shifts, reduction of oxidation potentials, increasing aromaticity of the central six-membered ring and decreasing antiaromaticity of the four-membered rings in a terphenylenyl moiety based on NICS(0) and iso-chemical shielding surfaces. Despite the restricted C&#8722;C bond associated intramolecular TSPP interactions for BLTPs in the ground state, to our surprise, the electronic coupling between two linear terphenylenes (LTPs) in BLTPs in the excited state is weak, so that the excited-state behavior is dominated by the corresponding monomeric LTPs. In other words, all BLTPs undergo ultrafast relaxation dynamics via strong exciton-vibration coupling, acting as a blue-light absorber with essentially no emission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sn Bulk Phase Doping and Surface Modification on Ti4O7 for Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>

D&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7 was obtained by simple polymerization post&#8208;calcination method as a high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8208; ORR electrocatalyst to produce H2O2. For the D&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7, the doping of Sn not only improves the conductivity but also leads to Ti4O7 lattice distortion, which further forms more oxygen vacancies and Ti3+, This can reduce the binding energy of *OOH, which is conducive to the production of H2O2 by 2e&#8722; ORR. It exhibits a starting potential of 0.769&#8197;V in 0.1&#8197;M KOH solution, which is close to the theoretical starting potential of 2e&#8722; ORR (0.764&#8197;V), and H2O2 selectivity is as high as 95.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Developing stable and highly selective two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) electrocatalysts for producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is considered a major challenge to replace the anthraquinone process and achieve a sustainable green economy. Here, we doped Sn into Ti4O7 (D&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7) by simple polymerization post&#8208;calcination method as a high&#8208;efficiency 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalyst. In addition, we also applied plain calcination after the grinding method to load Sn on Ti4O7 (L&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7) as a comparison. However, the performance of L&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7 is far inferior to that of the D&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7. D&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7 exhibits a starting potential of 0.769&#8197;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) and a high H2O2 selectivity of 95.7&#8201;%. Excitingly, the catalyst can maintain a stable current density of 2.43&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 3600&#8197;s in our self&#8208;made H&#8208;type cell, and the cumulative H2O2 production reaches 359.2&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1 within 50,000&#8197;s at 0.3&#8197;V. The performance of D&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7 is better than that of the non&#8208;noble metal 2e&#8722; ORR catalysts reported so far. The doping of Sn not only improves the conductivity but also leads to the lattice distortion of Ti4O7, further forming more oxygen vacancies and Ti3+, which greatly improves its 2e&#8722; ORR performance compared with the original Ti4O7. In contrast, since the Sn on the surface of L&#8722;Sn&#8722;Ti4O7 displays a synergistic effect with Tin+ (3&#8804;n&#8804;4) of Ti4O7, the active center Tin+ dissociates the O=O bond, making it more inclined to 4e&#8722; ORR.

         <title>Triflate's bigger brother: The unprecedented tribrate anion, [Br3CSO3]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tribromomethansulfonate anion (&#8220;tribrate&#8221;), [Br3CSO3]&#8722;, has been prepared for the first time. The anion is, up to now, the biggest brother of the well&#8208;known triflate anion. Key step of the synthesis is the bromination of phenyl&#8208;methanesulfonate by KOBr. The new anion could be investigated in the solid state for the example of K[Br3CSO3](H2O).







Abstract
The synthesis of the unprecedented [Br3CSO3]&#8722; anion starts with the bromination of phenylmethanesulfonate, C6H5OSO2CH3, with KOBr leading to C6H5OSO2CBr3. The formation of the [CBr3] moiety has been proved, also by an X&#8208;ray structure determination of the compound (triclinic, P&#8208;1, a=685.9(2), b=698.1(2), c=1190.2(3)&#8197;pm, &#945;=93.99(1)&#176;, &#946;=97.42(1)&#176;, &#947;=94.45(1)&#176;). The ester C6H5OSO2CBr3 can be split under basic conditions. The resulting acid provides access to the yet unknown tribromomethanesulfates (&#8220;tribrates&#8221;). K[Br3CSO3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, the first tribrate known so far has been characterized comprehensively, including an X&#8208;ray structure determination (monoclinic, C2/c, a=2267.1(2), b=1282.25(8), c=2618.2(2)&#8197;pm, &#946;=111.266(2)&#176;), vibrational spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Moreover, the thermal analysis shows that, after loss of the crystal water, the tribrate decomposes between 530 and 630&#8197;K.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of the unprecedented [Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion starts with the bromination of phenylmethanesulfonate, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, with KOBr leading to C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The formation of the [CBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] moiety has been proved, also by an X-ray structure determination of the compound (triclinic, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-1, &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;=685.9(2), &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;=698.1(2), &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;=1190.2(3)&#8197;pm, &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;=93.99(1)&#176;, &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;=97.42(1)&#176;, &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;=94.45(1)&#176;). The ester C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be split under basic conditions. The resulting acid provides access to the yet unknown tribromomethanesulfates (&#8220;tribrates&#8221;). K[Br&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, the first tribrate known so far has been characterized comprehensively, including an X-ray structure determination (monoclinic, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;2/&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;=2267.1(2), &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;=1282.25(8), &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;=2618.2(2)&#8197;pm, &lt;i&gt;&#946;=&lt;/i&gt;111.266(2)&#176;), vibrational spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Moreover, the thermal analysis shows that, after loss of the crystal water, the tribrate decomposes between 530 and 630&#8197;K.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Actuate Acyl Azolium and Acetone with violet Aurora!! The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free photoinduced methodology is highly desirable to access thermodynamically less favoured (Z)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. We demonstrate that acetone acts as a reactant as well as a solvent, acyl azolium salt acts as an aroyl surrogate, and the triplet state of acyl azolium promotes intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from acetone under violet LED irradiation. This mild and environmentally friendly protocol does not require any metals, ligands, or oxidants.







Abstract
Mono &#945;&#8208;acylation of acetone has been achieved for the first time by reacting with bench&#8208;stable acyl azolium salts under violet&#8208;LED light at room temperature. The intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from acetone to triplet state of azolium salts under violet LED irradiation resulted in thermodynamically less favourable (Z)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 selectivity via C&#8722;C bond formation. This compelling protocol access the desired &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation product under metal&#8208;, ligand&#8208; and oxidant&#8208;free conditions on a wide range of substrates.

Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials were used as the precursor to synthesize carbon based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Janus architecture composed of In2S3&#8722;In2O3 (In&#8722;S&#8722;O) nanoparticles. The 2D in&#8208;plane Janus catalysts has exhibited excellent electrochemical performances promoting oxygen electroreduction to hydrogen peroxide, owning to its abundant electrochemical active sites and large specific surface area.







Abstract
We use MOFs material as precursor to synthesize carbon based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials loaded with In2S3&#8722;In2O3 (In&#8722;S&#8722;O) nanoparticles. The In&#8722;S&#8722;O nanoparticles have exhibited Janus architecture composed of two compounds with different crystal structures that are combined in&#8208;plane on 2D carbon material surface. The excellent properties of this in&#8208;plane Janus material include 2D nanoarchitecture and its Janus properties formed by combining two different crystal structures. It has exhibited excellent electrochemical performances due to its abundant electrochemical active sites and large specific surface area. According to experiments, the electron transfer number of the material for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction is about 2.4, and the hydrogen peroxide yield is 32&#8197;mg/h&#8201;cm2. In the further test of liquid flow electrolytic cell, the yield can reach up to 172&#8197;mg/h&#8201;cm2.

         <title>Polar covalent apex&#8208;base bonding in borapyramidanes probed by solid&#8208;state NMR and DFT calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy has been applied to probe the bonding properties of borapyramidane molecules. Combining the spectroscopic and quantum&#8208;chemical data, the bonding scenario is best described as covalent with a high degree of polarity. The study highlights the high sensitivity of NMR in probing bonding properties.







Abstract
Pyramidane molecules have attracted chemists for many decades due to their regular shape, high symmetry and their correspondence in the macroscopic world. Recently, experimental access to a number of examples has been reported, in particular the rarely reported square pyramidal bora[4]pyramidanes. To describe the bonding situation of the nonclassical structure of pyramidanes, we present solid&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) as a versatile tool for deciphering such bonding properties for three now accessible bora[4]pyramidane and dibora[5]pyramidane molecules. 11B solid&#8208;state NMR spectra indicate that the apical boron nuclei in these compounds are strongly shielded (around &#8722;50&#8197;ppm vs. BF3&#8208;Et2O complex) and possess quadrupolar coupling constants of less than 0.9&#8197;MHz pointing to a rather high local symmetry. 13C&#8722;11B spin&#8208;spin coupling constants have been explored as a measure of the bond covalency in the borapyramidanes. While the carbon&#8208;boron bond to the &#8722;B(C6F5)2 substituents of the base serves as an example for a classical covalent 2&#8208;center&#8208;2&#8208;electron (2c&#8211;2e) sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;sp2&#8208;boron &#963;&#8208;bond with 1J(13C&#8208;11B) coupling constants in the order of 75&#8197;Hz, those of the boron(apical)&#8208;carbon(basal) bonds in the pyramid are too small to measure. These results suggest that these bonds have a strongly ionic character, which is also supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

         <title>Electrochemical Diselenation of BODIPY Fluorophores for Bioimaging Applications and Sensitization of 1O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of red&#8208;emitting BODIPY derivatives through a mild electrochemical diselenation process is reported. The study encompasses substrate scope exploration, photophysical characterization, computational analysis, and the demonstration of their potential as emission&#8208;tunable fluorescent probes with large Stokes shift for lipid droplet visualization, offering broad&#8208;ranging applications in bioimaging and related fields.







Abstract
We report a rapid, efficient, and scope&#8208;extensive approach for the late&#8208;stage electrochemical diselenation of BODIPYs. Photophysical analyses reveal red&#8208;shifted absorption &#8211; corroborated by TD&#8208;DFT and DLPNO&#8208;STEOM&#8208;CCSD computations &#8211; and color&#8208;tunable emission with large Stokes shifts in the selenium&#8208;containing derivatives compared to their precursors. In addition, due to the presence of the heavy Se atoms, competitive ISC generates triplet states which sensitize 1O2 and display phosphorescence in PMMA films at RT and in a frozen glass matrix at 77&#8197;K. Importantly, the selenium&#8208;containing BODIPYs demonstrate the ability to selectively stain lipid droplets, exhibiting distinct fluorescence in both green and red channels. This work highlights the potential of electrochemistry as an efficient method for synthesizing unique emission&#8208;tunable fluorophores with broad&#8208;ranging applications in bioimaging and related fields.

The study encompasses substrate scope exploration, photophysical characterization, computational analysis, and the demonstration of their potential as emission-tunable fluorescent probes with large Stokes shift for lipid droplet visualization, offering broad-ranging applications in bioimaging and related fields.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a rapid, efficient, and scope-extensive approach for the late-stage electrochemical diselenation of BODIPYs. Photophysical analyses reveal red-shifted absorption &#8211; corroborated by TD-DFT and DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD computations &#8211; and color-tunable emission with large Stokes shifts in the selenium-containing derivatives compared to their precursors. In addition, due to the presence of the heavy Se atoms, competitive ISC generates triplet states which sensitize &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and display phosphorescence in PMMA films at RT and in a frozen glass matrix at 77&#8197;K. Importantly, the selenium-containing BODIPYs demonstrate the ability to selectively stain lipid droplets, exhibiting distinct fluorescence in both green and red channels. This work highlights the potential of electrochemistry as an efficient method for synthesizing unique emission-tunable fluorophores with broad-ranging applications in bioimaging and related fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactivity of Frustrated Lewis Pair: Carbocation versus Radical Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensive DFT calculations show that both radical HCAr2&#8901; and carbocation HCAr2+ are thermally accessible from the bulky phosphonium Mes3P&#8722;CHAr2+, which are further kinetically favored by HCAr2&#8901; radical self&#8208;dimerization and by nucleophilic alkene trapping, respectively.







Abstract
Recent reports of radical formation within frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) suggested that single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) could play an important role in their chemistry especially for C&#8722;C coupling. In sharp contrast, our extensive dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations show that although reactive benzhydryl radical along with phosphine radical cation species can be kinetically generated from bulky phosphines and benzhydryl cation, direct P&#8722;C hetero&#8208;coupling may lead to bulky phosphonium cation as reactive carbocation transfer reagents to styrene substrates, which is kinetically much more favorable than the recently proposed radical C&#8722;C coupling between benzhydryl radical and styrene. Similarly, meta&#8208;stable radical cation Mes3P+&#8901; salt is also kinetically accessible via SET reactions of Mes3P and B(C6F5)3 with 0.5 equivalent of p&#8208;O2C6Cl4.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Catalyzed at the Exterior of Chiral Coordinated Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement of the chiral space inside a molecular host is an ideal platform for enantioselective reactions. However, this concept significantly limits the scope of reactants because reactants must be trapped inside molecular hosts. Instead, we utilized the exteriors of chiral molecular capsules as chiral sources and realized the kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Confined spaces inside molecular hosts can function as reaction vessels. However, this concept significantly limits the scope of reactants. When the exterior of molecular hosts is used instead, we can ease the restriction because reactants are not necessary to be trapped inside molecular hosts, although studies along this line have not been reported. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of enantioselective reactions at the exterior of chiral molecular hosts, we utilized host&#8208;guest complexes of enantiomerically enriched Cu&#8208;coordinated capsules and guests possessing a catalytic center to realize the kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols. Under suitable reaction conditions, a selectivity factor of 2.6 was realized, demonstrating that the reactions occur at the exterior of the capsules. A series of experiments indicated that the substituents on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arms and the alkyl chains on the lower rim contributed to the enantioselectivity of the reactions.

         <title>Front Cover: Electrochemical Diselenation of BODIPY Fluorophores for Bioimaging Applications and Sensitization of 1O2 (Chem. Eur. J. 11/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and efficient approach with a broad scope for the late&#8208;stage electrochemical diselenation of BODIPYs is reported. The selenium&#8208;containing BODIPYs can stain lipid droplets selectively, exhibiting fluorescence in both green and red channels. The Se&#8208;functionalized BODIPYs exhibit larger Stokes shifts than their precursors, and sensitization of 1O2 from triplet states formed by competitive intersystem crossing, which makes them suitable for bioimaging studies and, potentially, and simultaneously, for photodynamic therapy. The electrochemical synthetic method offers an efficient and versatile alternative for the preparation of Se&#8208;functionalized fluorescent compounds with relevant physicochemical and biological profiles. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Braunschweig, E.&#8197;N. da&#8197;Silva&#8197;J&#250;nior, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303883).

Triflate's bigger brother: The unprecedented tribrate anion [Br3CSO3]&#8211; is flanked by its smaller siblings, the triflate and the trichlate anions. The new big brother was obtained by bromination of phenyl methane sulfonate with KOBr, followed by splitting of the ester under basic conditions. The new anion was studied through X&#8208;ray diffraction of its potassium salt. Furthermore, the thermal decomposition was investigated, and the Raman data of the anion are reported. The background image shows the church tower of the famous cathedral of Cologne, the place of birth for the new anion. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;S. Wickleder and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303617).

         <title>Cover Feature: Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Catalyzed at the Exterior of Chiral Coordinated Capsules (Chem. Eur. J. 11/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetic resolution of racemic secondary alcohols has been realized in an acylation reaction catalyzed by a supramolecular catalyst consisting of an enantiomerically enriched Cu&#8208;coordinated capsule and an achiral guest possessing a catalytic center.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The kinetic resolution&lt;/b&gt; of racemic secondary alcohols has been realized in an acylation reaction catalyzed by a supramolecular catalyst consisting of an enantiomerically enriched Cu-coordinated capsule and an achiral guest possessing a catalytic center. The enantioselective acylation proceeds at the exterior of a supramolecular catalyst. The cover picture represents the catalytic center of the supramolecular catalyst that accelerates the acylation of either enantiomer, resulting in the successful kinetic resolution of racemic secondary alcohols.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the multifaceted roles of trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls, focusing on their unprecedented properties and applications in synthesizing structurally diverse heterocycles of biologically relevance. Various approaches for heterocyclic synthesis, including enantioselective, multistep, combinatorial, solvent&#8208;free, transition metal catalysis, organocatalysis, and multicomponent syntheses are reviewed.







Abstract
Trifluoromethyl group relishes a privileged position in the realm of medicinal chemistry because its incorporation into organic molecules often enhances the bioactivity by altering pharmacological profile of molecule. Trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls have emerged as pivotal building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry due to their facile accessibility, stability and remarkable versatility. Owing to presence of nucleophilic and electrophilic sites, they offer multifunctional sites for the reaction. This review covers a meticulous exploration of their multifaceted role, encompassing an in&#8208;depth analysis of mechanism, extensive scope, limitations and wide&#8208;ranging applications in diverse organic synthesis, covering the literature from the 21st century. This comprehensive review encapsulates the applications of trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls and their synthetic equivalents as precursors of complex and diverse heterocyclic scaffolds, fused heterocycles and spirocyclic compounds having medicinal and material importance. Their potent synthetic utility in cyclocondensation reactions with binucleophiles, cycloaddition reactions, C&#8722;C bond formations, asymmetric multicomponent reactions using classical/solvent&#8208;free/catalytic synthesis have been presented. Influence of unsymmetrical trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketones on regioselectivity of transformation is also reviewed. This review will benefit the synthetic and pharmaceutical communities to explore trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;dicarbonyls as trifluoromethyl building blocks for fabrication of heterocyclic scaffolds having implementation into drug discovery programs in the imminent future.

         <title>Revisiting Peri&#8208;Aryloxyquinones: From a Forgotten Photochromic System to a Promising Tool for Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peri&#8208;AryloxyQuinones (PAQs) undergo a reversible light&#8208;induced arylotropy between para&#8208; and ana&#8208;quinone states. The structure&#8208;switch relationships, mechanism of molecular photochromism as well as potential applications and prospects of PAQs in optically switchable materials and devices are discussed.







Abstract
Emerging applications of photochromic compounds demand new molecular designs that can be inspired by some long&#8208;known yet currently forgotten classes of photoswitches. In the present review, we remind the community about Peri&#8208;AryloxyQuinones (PAQs) and their unique photoswitching behavior originally discovered more than 50&#8197;years ago. At the heart of this phenomenon is the light&#8208;induced migration of an aromatic moiety (arylotropy) in peri&#8208;aryloxy&#8208;substituted quinones resulting in ana&#8208;quinones. PAQs feature absorbance of both isomers in the visible spectral region, photochromism in the amorphous and crystalline state, and thermal stability of the photogenerated ana&#8208;isomer. Particularly noticeable is the high sensitivity of the ana&#8208;isomer towards nucleophiles in solution. In addition to the mechanism of molecular photochromism and the underlaying structure&#8208;switch relationships, we analyze potential applications and prospects of aryloxyquinones in optically switchable materials and devices. Due to their ability to efficiently photoswitch in the solid state, PAQs are indeed attractive candidates for such materials and devices, including electronics (optically controllable circuits, switches, transistors, memories, and displays), porous crystalline materials, crystalline actuators, photoactivated sensors, and many more. This review is intended to serve as a guide for researchers who wish to use photoswitchable PAQs in the development of new photocontrollable materials, devices, and processes.

         <title>Borirenes and Boriranes: Development and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 11, February 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borirenes and boriranes, both featuring a BC2 three&#8208;membered ring, represent a class of compounds that combine substantial ring strain with Lewis acidity. Further fusion with benzene and o&#8208;carborane through a shared CC bond leads to benzoborienes and carborane&#8208;fused boriranes, which exhibit even higher ring strain. This minireview summarizes their synthesis and reactivity and offers perspectives.







Abstract
Strained compounds constitute a highly topical area of research in chemistry. Borirene and borirane both feature a BC2 three&#8208;membered ring. They can be viewed as the structural analogues of cyclopropane and cyclopropene, where a CH2 unit of the carbonaceous counterparts is replaced with BH, respectively. Indeed, this structural variation introduces numerous intriguing aspects. For instance, borirane and borirene are both Lewis acidic due to the presence of a tricoordinate borane center. In addition, borirene is 2&#960; aromatic according to H&#252;ckel's rule. In addition to their ability to form adducts with Lewis bases and the capacity of borirenes to act as ligands in coordination with metals, both borirenes and boriranes exhibit ring&#8208;opening reactivity due to the considerable ring strain. Under specific conditions, coordinated boriranes can even cleave two BC bonds to serve as formal borylene sources (although the reaction mechanisms are quite complex). On the other hand, recent successful syntheses of benzoborienes and their carborane&#8208;based three&#8208;dimensional analogues (also referred to as carborane&#8208;fused boriranes) have introduced novel perspectives to this field. For instance, they display excellent ring&#8208;expanding reactivity, possibly attributed to the boosted ring strain arising from the fusion of borirenes with benzene and boriranes with o&#8208;carborane. Importantly, their applications as valuable &#8220;BC2&#8221; synthons have become increasingly evident along with the newly disclosed reactivity. Additionally, the boosted Lewis acidity of carborane&#8208;fused boriranes, thanks to the potent electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of o&#8208;carborane, combined with their readiness for ring enlargement, makes them promising candidates as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks in the construction of chemically responsive luminescent materials. This review provides a summary of the synthesis and reactivity of borirene and borirane derivatives, with the aim of encouraging the design of new borierene&#8208; and borirane&#8208;based molecules and inspiring further exploration of their potential applications.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Lactones, Cyclopropanes and ATRA Products: Revealing the Role of Sodium Ascorbate
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemistry: A direct and mild photochemical synthesis of lactones, cyclopropanes and ATRA products, utilizing sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid as the halogen/hydrogen bonding mediator and irradiation at 370&#8197;nm, 390&#8197;nm or 427&#8197;nm LED as the irradiation source. A variety of iodo&#8208;reagents were activated via halogen or hydrogen bonding and reacted successfully with a number of alkenes without the use of an external photocatalyst, leading to products in good to excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;% yield).







Abstract
Light&#8208;mediated processes have received significant attention, since they have re&#8208;surfaced unconventional reactivity platforms, complementary to conventional polar chemistry. &#947;&#8208;Lactones and cyclopropanes are prevalent moieties, found in numerous natural products and pharmaceuticals. Among various methods for their synthesis, light&#8208;mediated protocols are coming to the spotlight, although these are contingent upon the use of photoorgano&#8208; or metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, we introduce a novel photochemical activation of iodo&#8208;reagents via the use of cheap sodium ascorbate or ascorbic acid to enable their homolytic scission and addition onto double bonds. The developed protocol was applied successfully to the formal [3+2] cycloaddition for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;lactones, traditional atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reactions and the one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step conversion of alkenes to cyclopropanes. In all cases, the desired products were obtained in good to high yields, while the reaction mechanism was thoroughly investigated. Depending on the nature of the iodo&#8208;reagent, a halogen or a hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is formed, which initiates the process.

         <title>Synthesis of [1]Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes through Iodine&#8208;Mediated Sulfur Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic method has been developed for [1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes (BTBTs), which are attracting a great deal of attention as organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). The advantage of the method is its simplicity, namely, heating readily available 2&#8208;arylbenzo[b]thiophenes and elemental sulfur in the presence of molecular iodine. Iodine plays a very important role in the reaction, as discussed in the proposed reaction pathways.







Abstract
[1]Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes (BTBTs) are important molecules that have been extensively studied as high&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Therefore, it is important to develop a simple synthetic method for these molecules. In this paper, a synthetic method to obtain the BTBTs from 2&#8208;arylbenzo[b]thiophenes and elemental sulfur, in which two C&#8722;S bonds are formed at once, is described. In this method, molecular iodine plays a very important role as an additive. The role of iodine is discussed in the presumed reaction pathways.

         <title>Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Keto&#8208;Sulfoxides from Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gem&#8208;difluorinated sulfoxides were obtained in a simple procedure from sulfoxonium ylides, in a different reaction mode from the classical behaviour (geminal addition of a nucleophile and electrophile, followed by sulfoxide extrusion. Experimental studies give insight to the mechanism of the reaction, with a change in the RDS according with ylide substitution. Sulfur&#8208; and fluorine&#8208;containing organic compounds are quite attractive and important in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Organic molecules containing fluorine and sulfur atoms represent a large percentage of approved pharmaceuticals. Those with combination of both S and F atoms in their structure such as Xtandi, approved in 2012 for prostate cancer, indicates the importance of synthetic methods that accommodates both atoms in an organic moiety. In this study, a novel aspect of sulfoxonium ylide reactivity was explored, unveiling a streamlined and mild synthesis method for gem&#8208;difluorinated keto&#8208;sulfoxides. Our protocol offers a direct and practical approach to prepare these compounds in 14&#8211;80&#8201;% chemical yields, that were represented by 21 examples. NMR studies and Hammett correlations gave strong evidence about the mechanism of this transformation.

         <title>(Diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine Oxide &#8211; A Diazoalkane Reagent for [3+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A safe and efficient method for the in&#8208;situ preparation of (diazomethyl)dimethylphosphine oxide &#8211; a hereto unexplored diazoalkane reagent &#8211; is developed. The method is based on the diazotization of the corresponding P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted amine (readily available in multigram quantities) in non&#8208;aqueous media. The protocol provides the target product as ca. 1.5 M CHCl3 solution which is stable at &#8211;18 &#176;C. The utility of the synthesized diazoalkane is illustrated by&#160;its [3+2] cycloaddition with electron&#8208;poor alkynes and alkenes providing the corresponding P(O)Me2&#8208;substituted pyrazoles and pyrazolines with moderate to good efficiency. In this view, the title compound represents and an important extension of medicinally relevant phosphine oxide reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Backside versus Frontside SN2 Reactions of Alkyl Triflates and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleophilic substitution reactions are elementary reactions in organic chemistry that are used in many synthetic routes. By quantum chemical methods, we have investigated the intrinsic competition between the backside SN2 (SN2&#8208;b) and frontside SN2 (SN2&#8208;f) pathways using a set of simple alkyl triflates as the electrophile in combination with a systematic series of phenols and partially fluorinated ethanol nucleophiles. It is revealed how and why the well&#8208;established mechanistic preference for the SN2&#8208;b pathway slowly erodes and can even be overruled by the unusual SN2&#8208;f substitution mechanism going from strong to weak alcohol nucleophiles. Activation strain analyses disclose that the SN2&#8208;b pathway is favored for strong alcohol nucleophiles because of the well&#8208;known intrinsically more efficient approach to the electrophile resulting in a more stabilizing nucleophile&#8211;electrophile interaction. In contrast, the preference of weaker alcohol nucleophiles shifts to the SN2&#8208;f pathway, benefiting from a stabilizing hydrogen bond interaction between the incoming alcohol and the leaving group. This hydrogen bond interaction is strengthened by the increased acidity of the weaker alcohol nucleophiles, thereby steering the mechanistic preference toward the frontside SN2 pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating Matere Bonds in Pertechnetate Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this manuscript we evaluate the X&#8208;ray structure of five new pertechnetate derivatives of general formula [M(H2O)4(TcO4)2], M = Mg, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn (compounds 1&#8211;5) and one perrhenate compound Zn(H2O)4(ReO4)2 (6). In these complexes the metal center exhibits an octahedral coordination with the pertechnetate units as axial ligands. All compounds exhibit the formation of directional Tc&#183;&#183;&#183;O Matere bonds (MaBs) that propagate the [M(H2O)4(TcO4)2], into 1D supramolecular polymers in the solid state. Such 1D polymers are linked, generating 2D layers, by combining additional MaBs and hydrogen bonds (HBs). Such concurrent motifs have been analyzed theoretically, suggesting the noncovalent &#963;&#8208;hole nature of the MaBs. The interaction energies range from weak (~ &#8211;2 kcal/mol) for the MaBs to strong (~ &#8211;30 kcal/mol) for the MaB + HB assemblies, where HB dominates. In case of M = Zn, the corresponding perrhenate Zn(H2O)4(ReO4)2 complex, has been also synthesized for comparison purposes, resulting in the formation of an isostructural X&#8208;ray structure, corroborating the structure&#8208;directing role of Matere bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting of G&#8211;quadruplex DNA with 99mTc(I)/Re(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes Carrying Pyridostatin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main goal of this work was to elucidate the potential relevance of (radio)metal chelates of 99mTc and Re targeting G&#8208;quadruplex structures for the design of new tools for cancer theranostics. 99mTc provides the complexes with the ability to perform single&#8208;photon&#8208;emission computed tomography imaging studies, while the Re complexes should act as anticancer agents upon interaction with specific G4 DNA or RNA structures present in tumor tissues. Towards this goal, we have developed isostructural 99mTc(I) and Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes anchored by a pyrazolyl&#8208;diamine (Pz) chelator carrying a pendant pyridostatin (PDS) fragment as the G4&#8208;binding motif. The interaction of the PDS&#8208;Pz&#8208;Re (8) complex with different G4&#8208;forming oligonucleotides was studied by circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and FRET&#8208;melting assays. The results showed that the Re complex retained the ability to bind and stabilize G4&#8208;structures from different DNA or RNA sequences, namely those present on the SRC proto&#8208;oncogene and telomeric RNA (TERRA sequence). PDS&#8208;Pz&#8208;Re (8) showed low to moderate cytotoxicity in PC3 and MCF&#8208;7 cancer cell lines, as typically observed for G4&#8208;binders. Biodistribution studies of the congener PDS&#8208;Pz&#8208;99mTc (12) in normal mice showed that the complex undergoes a fast blood clearance with a predominant hepatobiliary excretion, pointing also for a high in vitro stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Lung Ventilation Imaging Using Hyperpolarized Diethyl Ether Gas Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyperpolarized 129Xe gas was FDA&#8208;approved as an inhalable contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of a wide range of pulmonary diseases in December 2022. Despite the remarkable success in clinical research settings, the widespread clinical translation of HP 129Xe gas faces two critical challenges: the high cost of the relatively low&#8208;throughput hyperpolarization equipment and the lack of 129Xe imaging capability on clinical MRI scanners, which have narrow&#8208;bandwidth electronics designed only for proton (1H) imaging. To solve this translational grand challenge of gaseous hyperpolarized MRI contrast agents, here we demonstrate the utility of batch&#8208;mode production of proton&#8208;hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas via heterogenous pairwise addition of parahydrogen to ethyl vinyl ether. An approximately 0.1&#8208;liter bolus of hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas was produced in 1 second and injected in excised rabbit lungs. Lung ventilation imaging was performed using sub&#8208;second 2D MRI with up to 2x2 mm2 in&#8208;plane resolution using a clinical 0.35 T MRI scanner without any modifications. This feasibility demonstration paves the way for the use of inhalable diethyl ether as a gaseous contrast agent for pulmonary MRI applications using any clinical MRI scanner.</dc:description>

         <title>The Catalytic Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Acyclic Enolates for the Construction of Quaternary and Tetrasubstituted Stereogenic Centres</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the catalytic asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) of acyclic prochiral nucleophiles, namely enolates, as a means of accessing congested quaternary and tetrasubstituted stereogenic centres. In particular, strategies for the stereocontrolled access to acyclic enolate nucleophiles, as well as the impact of enolate geometry on the stereochemical outcome of allylic alkylation, are highlighted.







Abstract
To facilitate the discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals, the demand for novel stereofunctionalised building blocks has never been greater. Whilst molecules bearing quaternary and tetrasubstituted stereogenic centres are ideally suited to explore untapped areas of chemical space, the asymmetric construction ofsterically congested carbon centres remains a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis. The enantioselective assembly of acyclic stereogenic centres is even more demanding due to the need to restrict a much wider range of geometries and conformations of the intermediates involved. In this context, the catalytic asymmetric allylicalkylation (AAA) of acyclic prochiral nucleophiles, namely enolates, has become an indispensable tool to access a range of linear&#945;&#8208;quaternary and&#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted carbonyl compounds. However, unlike the AAA of cyclic enolates with a fixed enolate geometry, to achieve high levels of stereocontrol in the AAA of acyclic enolates, the stereoselectivity of enolisation must be considered. The aim of this review is to offer acomprehensivediscussion of catalytic AAA reactions of acyclic prochiral enolates and their analogues to generate congested quaternary and tetrasubstituted chiral centres using metal, non&#8208;metal and dual catalysis, with particular focus given to the control of enolate geometry and its impact on the stereochemical outcome of the reaction.

         <title>Stability of the protactinium(V) mono&#8208;oxo cation probed by first&#8208;principle calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protactinium (Z=91) deviates from the neighboring actinides by forming PaO3+ in solution instead of PaO2+. Complex stability, evaluated through Gibbs free energy, favors PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) with Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, NO3&#8722; and SO42&#8722;, but not with OH&#8722;, F&#8722; and C2O42&#8722;. QTAIM and NBO analyses reveal a triple bond in Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond, with increased covalency Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, NO3&#8722; providing insights into protactinium's unique chemical behavior.







Abstract
This study explores the distinctive behavior of protactinium (Z=91) within the actinide series. In contrast to neighboring elements like uranium or plutonium, protactinium in the pentavalent state diverges by not forming the typical dioxo protactinyl moiety PaO2+ in aqueous phase. Instead, it manifests as a monooxo PaO3+ cation or a Pa5+. Employing first&#8208;principle calculations with implicit and explicit solvation, we investigate two stoichiometrically equivalent neutral complexes: PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) and Pa(OH)4(X), where X represents various monodentate and bidentate ligands. Calculating the Gibbs free energy for the reaction PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O)&#8594;Pa(OH)4(X), we find that the PaO(OH)2(X)(H2O) complex is stabilized with Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, and SO42&#8722; ligands, while it is not favored with OH&#8722;, F&#8722;, and C2O42&#8722; ligands. Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) methods reveal the Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond as a triple bond, with significant contributions from the 5f and 6d shells. Covalency of the Pa mono&#8208;oxo bond increases with certain ligands, such as Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, and NO3&#8722;. These findings elucidate protactinium's unique chemical attributes and provide insights into the conditions supporting the stability of relevant complexes.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, but not with OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. QTAIM and NBO analyses reveal a triple bond in Pa mono-oxo bond, with increased covalency Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, NCS&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; providing insights into protactinium's unique chemical behavior.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study explores the distinctive behavior of protactinium (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;=91) within the actinide series. In contrast to neighboring elements like uranium or plutonium, protactinium in the pentavalent state diverges by not forming the typical dioxo protactinyl moiety PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in aqueous phase. Instead, it manifests as a monooxo PaO&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; cation or a Pa&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;. Employing first-principle calculations with implicit and explicit solvation, we investigate two stoichiometrically equivalent neutral complexes: PaO(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(X)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and Pa(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(X), where X represents various monodentate and bidentate ligands. Calculating the Gibbs free energy for the reaction PaO(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(X)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&#8594;Pa(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(X), we find that the PaO(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(X)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) complex is stabilized with Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, NCS&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ligands, while it is not favored with OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ligands. Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) methods reveal the Pa mono-oxo bond as a triple bond, with significant contributions from the 5f and 6d shells. Covalency of the Pa mono-oxo bond increases with certain ligands, such as Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, NCS&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. These findings elucidate protactinium's unique chemical attributes and provide insights into the conditions supporting the stability of relevant complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence Mechanism of Interfacial Oxidation of Li3YCl6 Solid Electrolyte on Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we confirmed the influence of oxidative byproducts of Li3YCl6 on its reduction potential and investigates its redox mechanism. Through combined characterization techniques and electrochemical measurements, it was discovered that when the cathode voltage surpassed the oxidation voltage of the electrolyte or in the presence of an exotic element&#8208;induced condition, the electrolyte underwent oxidation of the halide element, resulting in the absence of ligands. Simultaneously, such process generated LixYCl3+x with a distinct reduction potential compared to pristine Li3YCl6. The Y element within LixYCl3+x experienced reduction to a lower valence state during the discharge process. Consequently, such structural change led to a significant rise in interfacial impedance and a decline in the performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for all solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSLBs) due to their high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and excellent chemical stability with cathode materials. However, when tested in practice, their intrinsic electrochemical stability windows do not well match the conditions for stable operation of ASSBs. Existing literature reports halide&#8208;based ASSBs that still operate well outside the electrochemical stability window, while ASSBs that do not operate within the window are not well studied or the studies are based on the cathode material interface. In this study, we aim to elucidate the mechanism behind all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery failure by investigating how the reduction potential of Li3YCl6 solid&#8208;state electrolyte itself changes under overcharging conditions. Our findings demonstrate that in Li&#8208;In|Li3YCl6|Li3YCl6&#8208;C half&#8208;cells during the first state of charge, Cl ions participate in charge compensation, resulting in a depletion of ligands. This phenomenon significantly affects the reduction potential of Y3+, causing it to be reduced to Y2Cl3 and ultimately to Y0 at conditions far exceeding its actual reduction potential. Furthermore, we analyze the interfacial impedance induced by this process and propose a novel perspective on battery failure.

         <title>Exploring the Theoretical Foundations of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emission: A Comprehensive TD&#8208;DFT Study on Phenothiazine Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in phenothiazine&#8208;based systems, through this study, we analyse ten recognized TADF&#8208;active configurations using TD&#8208;DFT and Multiwfn. It validates El Sayed&#8242;s rule and visualizes charge transfer dynamics, exploring diverse sulfur oxidation states and phenothiazine substitutions to identify additional TADF&#8208;active compounds. Insights into rISC rates and dihedral angles contribute to a comprehensive understanding, guiding phenothiazine material design for experimentalists.







Abstract
This study conducts a thorough theoretical investigation of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in phenothiazine&#8208;based systems, examining ten molecular configurations recognized experimentally as TADF&#8208;active. Employing Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT), our analysis spans the investigation of singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST), spin&#8208;orbit coupling, and excitation characteristics using Multiwfn. This approach not only validates the adherence to El Sayed's rule across these systems but also provides a detailed understanding of charge transfer dynamics, as visualized through heat maps. A significant aspect of our study is the exploration of different oxidation states of sulfur and site substitutions on phenothiazine. This systematic variation aims to identify additional TADF&#8208;active compounds, drawing parallels with properties characterizing other known TADF emitters. Our investigation into Reverse Intersystem Crossing (rISC) rates and the analysis of dihedral angles in relation to &#916;EST values offer nuanced insights into the TADF behaviours of these molecules. By integrating rigorous computational analysis with practical implications, we provide a foundational understanding that enhances the design and optimization of phenothiazine&#8208;based materials for optoelectronic applications. This work not only advances our theoretical understanding of TADF in phenothiazine derivatives but also serves as a guide for experimentalists and industry professionals in the strategic design of new TADF materials.

         <title>C&#8722;F Bond Insertion: An Emerging Strategy for Constructing Fluorinated Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions are powerful methods for preparing fluorinated molecules, however their development has been severely hampered by the challenge of activating strong C&#8722;F bonds without sequestering the released fluoride. Recently, several strategies have emerged that allow for C&#8722;F insertion of a range of fluorinated substrates. In this article, the recent breakthroughs are discussed focusing on the key underlying concepts.







Abstract
C&#8722;F Insertion reactions, where an organic fragment formally inserts into a carbon&#8211;fluorine bond in a substrate, are highly attractive, yet largely unexplored, methods to prepare valuable fluorinated molecules. The inherent strength of C&#8722;F bonds and the resulting need for a large thermodynamic driving force to initiate C&#8722;F cleavage often leads to sequestering of the released fluoride in an unreactive by&#8208;product. Recently, however, several groups have succeeded in overcoming this challenge, opening up the study of C&#8722;F insertion as an efficient and highly atom&#8208;economical approach to prepare fluorinated compounds. In this article, the recent breakthroughs are discussed focusing on the key conceptual advances that allowed for both C&#8722;F bond cleavage and subsequent incorporation of the released fluoride into the product.

         <title>A Simple Manganese(I) Catalyst for the Efficient and Selective Hydrophosphination of Olefins with PH3, Primary, and Secondary Phosphanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mn(I) amido complex with a tridentate P,N,N ligand, which is easily synthesized from commercially available chemicals, is a remarkable efficient (pre)catalyst for the hydrophosphination of alkenes using secondary and primary aryl and alkyl phosphines and even PH3 as reagents.







Abstract
A tridentate ligand L with a P,NH,N donor motif was synthesized in few steps from commercially available precursors. Upon reaction with [MnBr(CO)5], an octahedral 18&#8208;electron complex [Mn(CO)3(L)]Br (1) is obtained in which L adopts a facial arrangement. After deprotonation of the NH group in the cationic complex unit, a neutral Mn(I) amido complex [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;H)] (2) is formed under loss of CO. Rearrangement of L&#8208;H leads to a trigonal bipyramidal structure in which the P and N donor centers are in trans position. Further deprotonation of 2 results in a dep&#8208;blue anionic complex fragment [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8722; (3). DFT calculations and a QTAIM analysis show that the amido complex&#8197;2 contains a Mn&#8208;N bond with partial double bond character and 3 an aromatic MnN2C2 ring. The anion [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8722; reacts with Ph2PH to give a phosphido complex, which serves as phosphide transfer reagent to activated olefins. But the catalytic activity is low. However, the neutral amido complex&#8197;2 is an excellent catalyst and with loadings as low as 0.04&#8197;mol&#8201;%, turn over frequencies of &gt;40&#8217;000&#8197;h&#8722;1 can be achieved. Furthermore, secondary and primary alkyl phosphines as well as PH3 can be added in a catalytic hydrophosphination reaction to a wide range of activated olefins such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, esters, and nitriles. But also, vinyl pyridine and some styrene derivatives are converted into the corresponding phosphanes.

Upon reaction with [MnBr(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;], an octahedral 18-electron complex [Mn(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;)]Br (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) is obtained in which &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt; adopts a facial arrangement. After deprotonation of the NH group in the cationic complex unit, a neutral Mn(I) amido complex [Mn(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) is formed under loss of CO. Rearrangement of &lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;H&lt;/b&gt; leads to a trigonal bipyramidal structure in which the P and N donor centers are in &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; position. Further deprotonation of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; results in a dep-blue anionic complex fragment [Mn(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2H&lt;/b&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). DFT calculations and a QTAIM analysis show that the amido complex&#8197;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; contains a Mn-N bond with partial double bond character and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; an aromatic MnN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ring. The anion [Mn(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;2H&lt;/b&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reacts with Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PH to give a phosphido complex, which serves as phosphide transfer reagent to activated olefins. But the catalytic activity is low. However, the neutral amido complex&#8197;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is an excellent catalyst and with loadings as low as 0.04&#8197;mol&#8201;%, turn over frequencies of &amp;gt;40&#8217;000&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; can be achieved. Furthermore, secondary and primary alkyl phosphines as well as PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be added in a catalytic hydrophosphination reaction to a wide range of activated olefins such as &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, esters, and nitriles. But also, vinyl pyridine and some styrene derivatives are converted into the corresponding phosphanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Dearomatizing Methoxylation of Phenols and Naphthols: Synthetic and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenols and naphthols are dearomatized to methoxycyclohexadienones under simple and robust electrochemical conditions, in a green way without chemical oxidants. The mechanism of the reaction is established using density functional theory calculations, which also explain the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity for differently&#8208;substituted substrates.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxidative dearomatizing methoxylation of phenols and naphthols was developed. It provides an alternative route for the preparation of methoxycyclohexadienones, important and versatile synthetic intermediates, that eliminates the need for stoichiometric high&#8208;energy chemical oxidants and generates hydrogen as a sole by&#8208;product. The reaction proceeds in a simple constant current mode, in an undivided cell, and it employs standardized instrumentation. A collection of methoxycyclohexadienones derived from various 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted phenols and 1&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols was obtained in moderate to excellent yields. These include a complex derivative of estrone, as well as methoxylated dearomatized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols (BINOLs). The mechanism of the reaction was subject to profound investigations using density functional theory calculations. In particular, the reactivity of two key intermediates, phenoxyl radical and phenoxenium ion, was carefully examined. The obtained results shed light on the pathway leading to the desired product and rationalize experimentally observed selectivities regarding a side benzylic methoxylation and the preference for the functionalization at the para over the ortho position. They also uncover the structure&#8208;selectivity relationship, inversely correlating the steric bulk of the substrate with its propensity to undergo the side&#8208;reaction. Moreover, the loss of stereochemical information from enantiopure BINOL substrates during the reaction is rationalized by the computations.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the Reactions of Aliphatic Imines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only products resulting from [4+2] cycloaddition pathways were observed in the reactions of different isocyanates with aliphatic imines. The alternative [2+2] pathway is strongly disfavored, and the corresponding diazetidinone products were not observed. For imines incorporating a specifically located thioester group, acyl isocyanates and aryl isocyanates gave different final products. More information can be found in the Research Article by K.&#8208;H. Altmann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304272).

         <title>Aromaticity in the Electronic Ground and Lowest Triplet States of Molecules with Fused Thiophene Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Off&#8208;nucleus isotropic shielding isosurfaces computed with DFT show that while the sulflower with eight thiophene rings follows Baird's rule by switching from aromatic in its electronic ground state to antiaromatic in its lowest triplet state, the sulfower with six thiophene rings disobeys the rule by becoming even more aromatic in its lowest triplet state.







Abstract
Analysis of the variations of the off&#8208;nucleus isotropic magnetic shielding, &#963;iso(r), around thiophene, thienothiophenes, dithienothiophenes and sulflowers in their electronic ground (S0) and lowest triplet (T1) states reveals that some of the features of aromaticity and bonding in these molecules do not fit in with predictions based on the popular H&#252;ckel's and Baird's rules. Despite having 4n &#960; electrons, the S0 states of the sulflowers are shown to be aromatic, due to the local aromaticities of the individual thiophene rings. To reduce its T1 antiaromaticity, the geometry of thiophene changes considerably between S0 and T1: In addition to losing planarity, the carbon&#8208;carbon two &#8216;double&#8217; and one &#8216;single&#8217; bonds in S0 turn into two &#8216;single&#8217; and one &#8216;double&#8217; bonds in T1. Well&#8208;defined Baird&#8208;style aromaticity reversals are observed between the S0 and T1 states of only three of the twelve thiophene&#8208;based compounds investigated in this work, in contrast, the sulflower with six thiophene rings which is weakly aromatic in S0 becomes more aromatic in T1. The results suggest that the change in aromaticity between the S0 and T1 states in longer chains of fused rings is likely to affect mostly the central ring (or the pair of central rings); rings sufficiently far away from the central ring(s) can retain aromatic character.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Promoted Reductive Amination of DNA&#8208;Conjugated Amines for DNA&#8208;Encoded Library Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step reductive amination reaction between DNA&#8208;conjugated amines and aromatic, aliphatic, or heterocyclic aldehydes, utilising the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, borate buffer, and NaBH4. The methodology is applicable to a broad substrate scope, with regards to both on&#8208;DNA amine and aldehyde, and is fully compatible with DNA&#8208;amplification and sequencing; it is a new method for secondary and tertiary amine formation in DEL synthesis.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have become a leading technology for hit identification in drug discovery projects as large, diverse libraries can be generated. DELs are commonly synthesised via split&#8208;and&#8208;pool methodology; thus, chemical transformations utilised must be highly efficient, proceeding with high conversions. Reactions performed in DEL synthesis also require a broad substrate scope to produce diverse, drug&#8208;like libraries. Many pharmaceutical compounds incorporate multiple C&#8722;N bonds, over a quarter of which are synthesised via reductive aminations. However, few on&#8208;DNA reductive amination procedures have been developed. Herein is reported the application of the micelle&#8208;forming surfactant, TPGS&#8208;750&#8208;M, to the on&#8208;DNA reductive amination of DNA&#8208;conjugated amines, yielding highly efficient conversions with a broad range of aldehydes, including medicinally relevant heterocyclic and aliphatic substrates. The procedure is compatible with DNA amplification and sequencing, demonstrating its applicability to DEL synthesis.

         <dc:description>Incorporation of privileged catalytic scaffolds into a macrocyclic skeleton represents an attractive strategy to furnish supramolecular catalysis systems with enzyme&#8208;mimetic cavity and multi&#8208;site cooperation. Herein we reported the synthesis, structure, binding properties and catalytic application of a series of chiral bis&#8208;phosphate macrocycles toward the challenging asymmetric electrophilic fluorination. With a large, integrated chiral cavity and two cooperative phosphate sites, these macrocycles exhibited good inclusion toward 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) dicationic ammoniums through complementary ion&#8208;pair and C&#8210;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O interactions, as confirmed by crystallographic and solution binding studies. In fluorocyclization of tryptamines with Selectfluor reagent which has a similar DABCO&#8208;based dicationic structure, only 2 mol% macrocycle catalyst afforded the desired pyrroloindoline products in moderate yields and up to 91% ee. For comparison, the acyclic mono&#8208;phosphate analogue gave obviously lower reactivity and enantioselectivity (&lt;20% ee), suggesting a remarkable macrocyclic effect. The high catalytic efficiency and superior stereocontrol were ascribed to the tight ion&#8208;pair binding and cavity&#8208;directed noncovalent interaction cooperation.</dc:description>

         <title>Bright Fluorescent p&#8208;Phenylene&#8208;bridged Triarylmethyl Highly Stable Diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two units of highly stable luminescent triarylmethyl radical, (3,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyl)bis(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (PyBTM), were bridged by p&#8208;phenylene linker. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of PyBTM&#8208;PhPyBTM was at most 0.4% in various organic solvents. Adding two mesityl groups on the terminals did not improve the PLQY. In the MesPyBTM&#8208;PhPyBTM&#8208;Mes, the mesityl group did not worked as an electron donor unlike the previously reported monoradical MesPyBTM. However, adding two n&#8208;hexyl groups on the bridging p&#8208;phenylene did greatly improve it, and the PLQY of the PyBTM&#8208;(Hex2Ph)PyBTM was 7% in dichloromethane and acetone, and 12% in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film. Twisting p&#8208;phenylene linker by hexyl groups hindered the p&#8208;conjugation and suppressed the non&#8208;radiative decay of the excited state.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction and Formic Acid Oxidation by Formal Nickel(I) Complexes of Di&#8208;isopropylphenyl Bis&#8208;iminoacenaphthene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Processing CO2 into value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels stands as one of the most crucial tasks in addressing the global challenge of the greenhouse effect. In this study, we focused on the complex (dpp&#8208;bian)NiBr2 (where dpp&#8208;bian is di&#8208;isopropylphenyl bis&#8208;iminoacenaphthene) as a precatalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 into CH4 as the sole product. Cyclic voltammetry results indicate that the realization of a catalytically effective pattern requires the three&#8208;electron reduction of (dpp&#8208;bian)NiBr2. The chemically reduced complexes [K(THF)6]+[(dpp&#8208;bian)Ni(COD)]&#8211; and [K(THF)6]+[(dpp&#8208;bian)2Ni]&#8211; were synthesized and structurally characterized. Analyzing the data from the electron paramagnetic resonance study of the complexes in a solution, along with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, reveals that the spin density is predominantly localized at their metal centers. The superposition of trajectory maps of the electron density gradient&#160; field &#160;and the one&#8208;electron electrostatic force field, along with the atomic charges, discloses that, within the first coordination sphere, the interatomic charge transfer occurs from the metal atom to the ligand atoms and that the complex anions can thus be formally described by the general formulas (dpp&#8208;bian)2&#8211;Ni+(COD) and (dpp&#8208;bian)2&#8211;Ni+. It was shown that the reduced nickel complexes can be oxidized by formic acid; resulting from this reaction, the two&#8208;electron and two&#8208;proton addition product dpp&#8208;bian&#8208;2H is formed.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Hydrothermal Synthesis of NVO Cathodes with Varied Lattice NH4+ Content: Effect on Structural Evolution and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc ion batteries have been extensively researched due to their distinctive advantages such as low cost and high safety. Vanadium oxides are important cathode materials, however, poor cycle life caused by vanadium dissolution limits their application. Recent studies show that the lattice NH4+ in vanadium oxides can act as a pillar to enhance structural stability and play a crucial role in improving its cycling stability. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research on the effect of the lattice NH4+ content on structural evolution and electrochemical performance. Herein, we synthesize vanadium oxides with different contents of lattice NH4+ by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction. The vanadium oxides with lattice NH4+ exhibit high initial capacity, as well as good cycling stability and rate performance compared to bare vanadium oxide. Combined with electrochemical analyses, ex&#8208;situ structural characterizations, and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction tests, we reveal that the lattice NH4+ content plays a positive role in vanadium oxides' structural stability and cation diffusion kinetics. This work presents a direction for designing high&#8208;performance vanadium cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Hollow Microcubes SnS2 as Negative electrode for Sodium&#8208;ion and Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs and KIBs) are considered the most promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries in energy storage fields. Tin sulfide (SnS2) is regarded as an attractive negative candidate for NIBs and KIBs thanks to its superior power density, high&#8208;rate performance and natural richness. Nevertheless, the slow dynamics, the enormous volume change and the decomposition of polysulfide intermediates limit its practical application. Herein, microcubes SnS2 were prepared through sacrificial MnCO3 template&#8208;assisted and a facile solvothermal reaction strategy and their performance was investigated in Na and K&#8208;based cells. The unique hollow cubic structure and well&#8208;confined SnS2 nanosheets play an important role in Na+/K+ rapid kinetic and alleviating volume change. The effect of the carbon additives (Super P/C65) on the electrochemical properties were investigated thoroughly. The in operando and ex&#8208;situ characterization provide a piece of direct evidence to clarify the storage mechanism of such conversion&#8208;alloying type negative electrode materials.</dc:description>

The cations feature [Rh(COD)]+ fragments, coordinated by one (N, Bi), two (P, As) or three (Sb) triphenylpnictogen moieties.

         <title>Palladium catalyzed carbonylation reaction of indole/pyrrole involving HCFO&#8208;1233zd (E)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3&#8208;Idolenone is a key intermediate in the synthesis of many drugs and plays an important role in synthetic chemistry and biochemistry. A new method for the synthesis of trifluoromethylated 3&#8208;indolenones by carbonylation catalyzed by Pd(0) is described. In the absence of an additive, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;propylene (an inexpensive ozone&#8208;friendly CF3 structural unit) reacts with indole and carbon monoxide to synthesize trifluoromethylatedindolenone in good yield, regioselectivity and chemoselectivity and with strong resistance to basal functional groups such as alkynes, aldehydes and esters. Notably, in addition to indole compounds being well transformed into the corresponding products, pyrrole, heteroindole can also is also suitable for the corresponding chemical transformation. This study provides a scientific method for the late construction of trifluoromethylated indole/pyrrole 3&#8208;ketene.</dc:description>

         <title>Signal Transduction Allows Temporal Control of the Potential of a Concentration Cell Driven by the Decarboxylation of an Activated Carboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthropomorphic nitroacetic acid puts a plug into a socket turning a light bulb ON. After its time&#8208;controlled degradation to nitromethane and CO2, the light bulb is no longer connected to the socket and turns OFF. A time&#8208;controllable pH signal is transduced in a time&#8208;controllable voltage signal, which can be exploited to govern electric devices. More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Capocasa, S. Di&#8197;Stefano and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303897).

         <title>Evaluating Diazene to N2 Interconversion at Iron&#8208;Sulfur Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological N2&#160;reduction occurs at sulfur&#8208;rich multiiron sites, and an interesting potential pathway is concerted double reduction/protonation of bridging N2&#160;through PCET. Here, we test the feasibility of using synthetic sulfur&#8208;supported diiron complexes to mimic this pathway. Oxidative proton transfer from &#956;&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;diazene (HN=NH) is the microscopic reverse of the proposed N2&#160;fixation pathway, revealing the energetics of the process. Previously, Sellmann assigned the purple metastable product from two&#8208;electron oxidation of [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2H2)] (L1&#160;= tetradentate SSSS ligand) at &#8722;78 &#176;C as [{Fe2+(PPr3)L1}2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2)]2+, which would come from double PCET from diazene to sulfur atoms of the supporting ligands. Using resonance Raman, M&#246;ssbauer, NMR, and EPR spectroscopies in conjunction with DFT calculations, we show that the product is not an N2&#160;complex. Instead, the data are most consistent with the spectroscopically observed species being the mononuclear iron(III) diazene complex [{Fe(PPr3)L1}(&#951;2&#8208;N2H2)]+. Calculations indicate that the proposed double PCET has a barrier that is too high for proton transfer at the reaction temperature, and is so exergonic&#160;that it would be irreversible as a result of the high Fe3+/2+&#160;redox potential. This system establishes the "ground rules" for designing reversible N2/N2H2&#160;interconversion through PCET, such as tuning the redox potentials of the metal sites.</dc:description>

         <title>TBADT&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Stereoselective Radical Alkylation of Chiral N&#8208;Sulfinyl Imines: Towards Efficient Synthesis of Diverse Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe a sustainable and efficient photocatalytic method for the stereoselective radical alkylation of chiral sulfinyl imines. By employing readily available non&#8208;prefunctionalized radical precursors and low loading of TBADT as a direct HAT photocatalyst, we successfully obtain diverse chiral amines with high yields and excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. This method provides an efficient approach for accessing a diverse array of medicinally relevant compounds, including both natural and synthetic &#945;&#8208;amino acids, aryl ethyl amines, and other structural motifs commonly found in approved pharmaceuticals and natural product.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charged Triple&#8208;Ion Clusters (CTICs) form by addition of an anion or cation to an ion pair and are intermediate species on ionic&#8208;crystal nucleation pathways. Computations show that the energies and lifetimes for positive and negative CTICs vary differently for BaSO4 and CaCO3. This difference can be related to asymmetrical nucleation behavior observed in solutions with cation&#8208; versus with anion excess.







Abstract
Minerals form in natural systems from solutions with varying ratios of their lattice ions, yet non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions have generally been overlooked in investigations of new formation (nucleation) of ionic crystals. Here, we investigated the influence of cation:anion ratio in the solution on the initial steps of nucleation by studying positively and negatively charged triple ion complexes and subsequent particle size evolution. Our model systems are carbonates and sulfates of calcium and barium, as it was recently shown that solution stoichiometry affects the timing and rate of their nucleation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and dynamic light scattering (DLS) flow experiments show that nucleation correlates with the stability and lifetime of the initial complexes, which were significantly impacted by the cation:anion stoichiometry and ion type. Specifically, 
 was found to have higher association constants and its lifetime was twofold longer than

 and 
. Contrastingly, for 
, 
 was found to have lower association constants and its lifetime was shorter than 
. These trends in stability and lifetime follow the same asymmetrical behaviour as observed experimentally for particle formation using techniques like DLS. This suggests a causal relationship between the stability and lifetime of the initial charged complexes and the nucleation under non&#8208;stoichiometric conditions.

         <title>Recent Advances of Flexible MXene and its Composites for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene has significant potential as an electrode material for supercapacitors due to its high conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, and rich surface chemical properties. This paper reviews the synthesis, preparation, performance, and electrochemical reaction mechanism of flexible MXenes; Summarized the latest progress in freestanding flexible MXene composites for supercapacitors, as well as the challenges and possible improvements in their practical applications.







Abstract
MXenes have unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, rich surface chemistry, and convenient processability. These characteristics make them ideal for producing flexible materials with tunable microstructures. This paper reviews the laboratory research progress of flexible MXene and its composite materials for supercapacitors. And introduces the general synthesis method of MXene, as well as the preparation and properties of flexible MXene. By analyzing the current research status, the electrochemical reaction mechanism of MXene was explained from the perspectives of electrolyte and surface terminating groups. This review particularly emphasizes the composite methods of freestanding flexible MXene composite materials. The review points out that the biggest problem with flexible MXene electrodes is severe self&#8208;stacking, which reduces the number of chemically active sites, weakens ion accessibility, and ultimately lowers electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is necessary to composite MXene with other electrode materials and design a good microstructure. This review affirms the enormous potential of flexible MXene and its composite materials in the field of supercapacitors. In addition, the challenges and possible improvements faced by MXene based materials in practical applications were also discussed.

         <title>Amorphous Anode Materials for Fast&#8208;charging Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous materials have emerged as effective solutions to enhance the fast charging performance of anodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The concept summarizes the recent strides made in this emerging field and outlines the various strategies employed for designing anodes to incorporate amorphous materials. The challenges and future prospects have also been discussed.







Abstract
Fast&#8208;charging technology is set to revolutionize the field of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), driving the creation of next&#8208;generation devices with the ability to get charged within a short span of time. From the anode perspective, it is of paramount importance to design materials that can withstand continuous Li+ insertion/deinsertion at high charging rates and still remain unaffected by factors such as mechanical fractures, electrolyte side reactions, polarisation, lithium plating and heat generation. Herein, the recent advancements in the design of amorphous materials as anodes for fast&#8208;charging LIBs have been discussed. While the development of this particular class of materials for application in high&#8208;rate anodes has been paid limited attention in recent literature, it holds immense promise for improving the fast&#8208;charging capabilities. This concept summarizes the recent strides made in this emerging field, outlining the strategies employed in the design of amorphous anodes and emphasizing the crucial role played by the amorphous nature in achieving fast&#8208;charging performance. Further, the successive initiatives that can be undertaken to drive the progress of amorphous materials for fast charging LIBs have also been detailed, which could potentially improve their commercial viability.

         <title>Exceptional capture of methane at low pressure by an iron&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MFM&#8208;300(Fe) shows exceptional high uptake of CH4 at low pressure, which enables the highly efficient capture of CH4 and separation of CH4/N2 under ambient conditions. The unique and strong binding interaction between MFM&#8208;300(Fe) and CH4 is revealed structurally via complementary experimental techniques coupled with modelling.







Abstract
The selective capture of methane (CH4) at low concentrations and its separation from N2 are extremely challenging owing to the weak host&#8208;guest interactions between CH4 molecules and any sorbent material. Here, we report the exceptional adsorption of CH4 at low pressure and the efficient separation of CH4/N2 by MFM&#8208;300(Fe). MFM&#8208;300(Fe) shows a very high uptake for CH4 of 0.85&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;mbar and 298&#8197;K and a record CH4/N2 selectivity of 45 for porous solids, representing a new benchmark for CH4 capture and CH4/N2 separation. The excellent separation of CH4/N2 by MFM&#8208;300(Fe) has been confirmed by dynamic breakthrough experiments. In&#8197;situ neutron powder diffraction, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopies, coupled with modelling, reveal a unique and strong binding of CH4 molecules involving Fe&#8722;OH&#8943;CH4 and C&#8943;phenyl ring interactions within the pores of MFM&#8208;300(Fe), thus promoting the exceptional adsorption of CH4 at low pressure.

         <title>Development of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) ligands through target directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry: a novel class of possible antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tackling the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) inhibition via Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry (DCC). Leveraging protein recognition, in the presence of a continually self&#8208;correcting, evolving dynamic library, we were able to find novel ligands for RAGE. Our biological tests confirmed their superior affinities, as well as potential as antagonists, a fresh perspective for inhibiting this multifaceted and inflammation&#8208;associated receptor.







Abstract
RAGE is a transmembrane receptor of immunoglobulin family that can bind various endogenous and exogenous ligands, initiating the inflammatory downstream signaling pathways, including inflammaging. Therefore, RAGE represents an attractive drug target for age&#8208;related diseases. For the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, we employed protein&#8208;templated dynamic combinatorial chemistry (ptDCC) using RAGE&#8242;s VC1 domain as a template, the first application of this approach in the context of RAGE. The affinities of DCC hits were validated using microscale thermophoresis. Subsequent screening against AGE2 (glyceraldehyde&#8208;modified AGE)&#8208;sRAGE (solubleRAGE) (AGE2&#8208;BSA/sRAGE) interaction using ELISA tests led to the identification of antagonists with micromolar potency. Our findings not only demonstrate the successful application of ptDCC on RAGE but also highlight its potential to address the pressing need for alternative strategies for the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, an area of research that has experienced a slowdown in recent years.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Double Desymmetrization via Vinylogous Michael Addition of Prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dicyanoalkenes to Cyclopentendiones</title>

         <dc:description>
An asymmetric double desymmetrization reaction has been realized through vinylogous Michael addition reaction of prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanocyclohexane to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione catalyzed by a chiral Ag&#8208;(R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS catalyst. This method enables the formation of four chiral centers, including an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in a single C&#8722;C bond formation event.







Abstract
An asymmetric double desymmetrization methodology has been developed for synthesizing densely functionalized chiral cyclopentylcyclohexane scaffolds. We have constructed four chiral centers, including an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in a single C&#8722;C bond formation event. The methodology has high functional&#8208;group tolerance and delivers a broad range of enantioenriched products. This vinylogous Michael addition reaction of prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanocyclohexane to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione is catalyzed by a chiral Ag&#8208;(R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS catalyst.

         <title>Geometric and Electronic Engineering in Co/VN Nanoparticles to Boost Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Aqueous/Flexible Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co/VN@NC nanofoam exhibits a competitive difference (0.65 V) between the half&#8208;wave potential of ORR and OER potential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, leading to an elevated peak power density (156/85 mW cm&#8722;2) in aqueous/flexible ZABs. It is attributed to the disordered carbon reinforcing the confinement of electrons, and the coupling of components optimizing the absorption of intermediates.







Abstract
Modulating metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;support interactions is one of the potent tools for augmenting catalytic performance. Herein, highly active Co/VN nanoparticles are well dispersed on three&#8208;dimensional porous carbon nanofoam (Co/VN@NC) with the assistance of dicyandiamide. Studies certify that the consequential disordered carbon substrate reinforces the confinement of electrons, while the coupling of diverse components optimizes charge redistribution among species. Besides, theoretical analyses confirm that the regulated electron configuration can significantly tune the binding strength between the active sites and intermediates, thus optimizing reaction energy barriers. Therefore, Co/VN@NC exhibits a competitive potential difference (&#916;E, 0.65&#8197;V) between the half&#8208;wave potential of ORR and OER potential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outperforming Pt/C+RuO2 (0.67&#8197;V). Further, catalyst&#8208;based aqueous/flexible ZABs present superior performances with peak power densities of 156 and 85&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, superior to Pt/C&#8208;based counterparts (128 and 73&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This research provides a pivotal foundation for the evolution of bifunctional catalysts in the energy sector.

         <title>Stereocontrol via Propeller Chirality in FLP&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>

Chiral propeller&#8211;shaped triaryl framework of a binaphthyl&#8208;based amino&#8208;borane catalyst induces facial selectivity in the hydride transfer to prochiral iminiums in asymmetric hydrogenation of enamines.







Abstract
Utilization of chiral frustrated Lewis pairs as catalysts in enantioselective hydrogenation of unsaturated molecules represents a promising approach in asymmetric synthesis. In our effort to improve our current understanding of the factors governing the stereoselectivity in these catalytic processes, herein we examined the mechanism of direct hydrogenation of aromatic enamines catalyzed by a binaphthyl&#8211;based chiral amino&#8211;borane. Our computational analysis reveals that only one particular conformer of the key borohydride reaction intermediate can be regarded as a reactive form of this species. This borohydride conformer has a well&#8211;defined chiral propeller shape, which induces facial selectivity in the hydride transfer to pro&#8211;chiral iminium intermediates. The propeller chirality of the reactive borohydride conformer is generated by the axially chiral binaphthyl scaffold of the amino&#8211;borane catalyst through stabilizing &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. This new computational insight can be readily used to interpret the high degree of stereoinduction observed for these reactions. We expect that the concept of chirality relay could be further exploited in catalyst design endeavors.

         <title>Continuous Synthesis of a Macrocyclic Sulfite of Polyethylene Glycol by Cascaded Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here: We proposed a novel continuous process for the synthesis of macrocyclic polyethylene glycol sulfite (PEG&#8208;MCSi), which is a versatile building block for many PEG derivatives. In contrast to batch reactions, continuous production for this intermediate proves to be stable in terms of yield over a long course, and is therefore suitable for bulk production of PEG&#8208;MCSi.







Abstract
Many macrocyclic compounds are attractive drug&#8208;like molecules or intermediates due to their special properties. However, the bulk synthesis of such compounds are hindered by the necessity of using diluted solutions, in order to prevent intermolecular reactions that yields oligomer impurities, thereby resulting in a low production efficiency. Such challenge can be adequately addressed by using continuous reactors, allowing improved efficiency with smaller space footprints. In this work, we proposed a novel continuous process for the synthesis of a macrocyclic sulfite of tetraethylene glycol (PEG4&#8208;MCSi), which is a precursor to a very useful building block, PEG4&#8208;macrocyclic sulfate (PEG4&#8208;MCS). The basic reaction parameters, including stoichiometry and temperature, were first confirmed with small batch reactions, and the effectiveness of coiled reactors and continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) were compared. Cascaded CSTRs were proven to be suitable, and the reaction parameters were subject to further optimization to give a robust continuous process. The process was then tested with 4&#8197;parallel runs for up to 64&#8197;h. Finally, the merits and demerits of batch and continuous reactions were also compared, demonstrating the suitability of latter in the bulk production of macrocyclic PEG&#8208;MCSi compounds.

We report a stereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation strategy to linearly fused polycyclic piperidines from readily available substrates. These products can be chemoselectively functionalized to generate analogs that represent common substructures in bioactive compounds.







Abstract
Linearly fused polycyclic piperidines represent common substructures in natural products and biologically active small molecules. We have devised a Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation strategy to these compounds that converts readily available 2&#8208;tetralones and indanones into these scaffolds with the potential for control of both enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Importantly, these compounds can be chemoselectively functionalized, providing an efficient and robust methodology to these important nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules.

         <title>Molecular Dynamics of Steroidal Rotors Probed by Theoretical, Spectroscopic and Dielectric Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different steroidal molecular rotors with a dipolar fluorine&#8208;substituted phenyl group rotator were synthesized. Raman and FT&#8208;IR measurements were used to analyse the effect of fluorine substitution on molecular dynamics of the phenyl ring. The electric properties were investigated with the impedance spectroscopy. ECD spectroscopy was used to approximate the solid&#8208;state structure of one of the rotors.







Abstract
Our study focuses on molecular rotors with fast&#8208;moving rotators and their potential applications in the development of new amphidynamic crystals. Steroidal molecular rotors with a dipolar fluorine&#8208;substituted phenyl group as the rotator were synthesized and characterized. Three different rotors were investigated with varying numbers of fluorine atoms. A comprehensive analysis was performed using vibrational spectroscopy (Raman, FT&#8208;IR), electronic circular dichroism (ECD), and dielectric response to understand the behavior of the investigated model rotors. The results were supported by theoretical calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. The angle&#8208;dependent polarized Raman spectra confirmed the crystallinity of the samples. Nearly frequency and temperature&#8208;independent permittivity suggest low&#8208;frequency librational motion of stators. An in&#8208;depth analysis of ECD spectra revealed high conformational flexibility in solution, resulting in low ECD effects, while in the solid&#8208;state with restricted rotation, significant ECD effects were observed. These findings shed light on the conformational behavior and potential applications of the studied steroidal molecular rotors.

         <title>Artificial Processive Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A processive catalyst undergoes several rounds of catalysis before it is released from the substrate. The drawing shows possible ways (A&#8211;D) in which a synthetic catalyst can interact with the substrate to achieve processivity.







Abstract
Processive catalysts remain attached to a substrate and perform multiple rounds of catalysis. They are abundant in nature. This review highlights artificial processive catalytic systems, which can be divided into (A) catalytic rings that move along a polymer chain, (B) catalytic pores that hold polymer chains and decompose them, (C) catalysts that remain attached to and move around a cyclic substrate via supramolecular interactions, and (D) anchored catalysts that remain in contact with a substrate via multiple catalytic interactions (see frontispiece).

         <title>Insulating 6,6&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric Acid Methyl Ester on Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides: Impact of the Hybrid Materials on the Optical and Electrical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PCBM was insulated onto the surfaces of ten transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) through covalent functionalization. Comprehensive studies were conducted on their optical and electronic properties, including photoluminescence, conductivity, and photo&#8208;response. PCBM customized the properties of each TMDs, classifying them into three groups based on alignment: type I, type II, and metallic.







Abstract
In this study we develop a strategy to insulate 6,6 &#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) on the basal plane of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Concretely single layers of MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2 and ultrathin MoO2 and WO2 were grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Then, the thiol group of a PCBM modified with cysteine reacts with the chalcogen vacancies on the basal plane of TMDs, yielding PCBM&#8208;MoS2, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WS2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2, PCBM&#8208;WTe2, PCBM&#8208;MoO2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2. Afterwards, all the hybrid materials were characterized using several techniques, including XPS, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, AFM, and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, PCBM causes a unique optical and electrical impact in every TMDs. For MoS2 devices, the conductivity and photoluminescence (PL) emission achieve a remarkable enhancement of 1700&#8201;% and 200&#8201;% in PCBM&#8208;MoS2 hybrids. Similarly, PCBM&#8208;MoTe2 hybrids exhibit a 2&#8208;fold enhancement in PL emission at 1.1&#8197;eV. On the other hand, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2 and PCBM&#8208;WS2 hybrids exhibited a new interlayer exciton at 1.29&#8211;1.44, 1.7 and 1.37&#8208;154&#8197;eV along with an enhancement of the photo&#8208;response by 2400, 3200 and 600&#8201;%, respectively. Additionally, PCBM&#8208;WTe2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2 showed a modest photo&#8208;response, in sharp contrast with pristine WTe2 or WO2 which archive pure metallic character.

         <title>Dansylated Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide as the Fluorescent Dye Clickable to Unsaturated Bonds without Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited in the various research fields. However, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dye onto common polymers is not the practical preparation technique. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, click reaction, and optical properties of dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO). The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes.







Abstract
Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited in the fields of aesthetical purposes, biomedical engineering, and three&#8208;dimensional printing applications. While the fluorescent materials are prepared by the polymerization of fluorescent monomer or the blending a fluorescent dye with common polymer, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dye onto common polymers is not the practical technique. In this paper, dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO) has been designed and synthesized to be a stable nitrile N&#8208;oxide as the derivative of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. While Dansyl&#8208;NO shows good reactivity to an alkene and an alkyne to give fluorescent Dansyl&#8208;Ene and Dansyl&#8208;Yne, respectively, it hardly reacts to a nitrile. The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes. To know the effects of solvent on the fluorescent properties, the UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectra of Dansyl&#8208;Ene are measured in three solvents. Dansyl&#8208;Ene shows fluorescent solvatochromism, which appears to be red&#8208;shifted along with the increase in solvent polarity. Poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) directly reacts with Dansyl&#8208;NO to give fluorescent modified SB. The emission spectrum of modified SB is blue&#8208;shifted compared with that of Dansyl&#8208;Ene. The blue&#8208;shift could be possibly attributed to the presence of less polar polymer skeleton around the dansyl moieties of modified SB.

         <title>Gold&#8208;catalyzed endo&#8208;selective Ring&#8208;opening of Epoxides and its Application in Construction of Poly&#8208;ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphical Abstract. An efficient, gold&#8208;catalyzed 6&#8208;endo selective ring&#8208;opening of epoxides to prepare 3&#8208;hydoxyl tetrahydropyran motifs is reported. This method also allows to construct the subunits of marine ladder&#8208;like poly&#8208;ethers (MLP), emulating the Nakanishi's hypothesis in biosynthesizing MLP toxins. In addition, tricyclic core of macrolide natural products lituarines A&#8722;C is synthesized over 8 steps from known started material.







Abstract
Tetrahydropyran and tetrahydropyran&#8208;fused poly&#8208;ethers scaffolds are found in many classes of natural products and medicinally relevant small molecules. Here we describe a catalytic system for 6&#8208;endo selective ring&#8208;opening of epoxides by Au(I) or Au(III) catalyst that provides rapid access to various tetrahydropyran&#8208;derived motifs. It also could efficiently construct the subunits of marine ladder&#8208;like poly&#8208;ethers through emulating the Nakanishi's hypothesis on the biosynthesis of these toxins.

&lt;p&gt;Graphical Abstract. An efficient, gold-catalyzed 6-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; selective ring-opening of epoxides to prepare 3-hydoxyl tetrahydropyran motifs is reported. This method also allows to construct the subunits of marine ladder-like poly-ethers (MLP), emulating the Nakanishi's hypothesis in biosynthesizing MLP toxins. In addition, tricyclic core of macrolide natural products lituarines A&#8722;C is synthesized over 8 steps from known started material.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tetrahydropyran and tetrahydropyran-fused poly-ethers scaffolds are found in many classes of natural products and medicinally relevant small molecules. Here we describe a catalytic system for 6-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt; selective ring-opening of epoxides by Au(I) or Au(III) catalyst that provides rapid access to various tetrahydropyran-derived motifs. It also could efficiently construct the subunits of marine ladder-like poly-ethers through emulating the Nakanishi's hypothesis on the biosynthesis of these toxins. The synthetic utility of this method is also demonstrated in the preparation of the tricyclic core of tetrahydropyran-containing macrolide natural products lituarines A&#8722;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carboranylphosphines: B9&#8208;Substituted Derivatives with Enhanced Reactivity for Anchoring to Dendrimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specifically functionalized carboranes (bearing NH2 and OH groups) were synthesized to be grafted onto dendrimers, but steric hindrance prevents full substitution even of the hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene core, as illustrated by birds crowned by a carborane competing for access to food. The beaks are red (oxygen atoms), signifying the strongly nucleophilic OH. The feet are dark red (phosphorus atoms), which they could potentially use to complex a few metals after they have finished eating. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8208;M. Caminade, E. Hey&#8208;Hawkins and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303867). Artwork by Dr. Chistoph Selg.

         <title>When is an Imine Directing Group a Transient Imine Directing Group in C&#8211;H Functionalization?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8216;Transient&#8217; C&#8211;H functionalization has emerged in recent years to describe the use of a dynamic linkage, often an imine, to direct cyclometalation and subsequent functionalization. As the field continues to grow in popularity, we consider the features that make an imine directing group transient.&#160;A transient imine should be i) formed dynamically&#160;in situ, ii) avoid discrete introduction or cleavage steps, and iii) offer the potential for catalysis in both the directing group and metal.&#160;&#160;This concept article contrasts transient imines with pioneering early studies of imines as directing groups for the formation of metallacycles and the use of preformed imines in C&#8211;H functionalization. Leading developments in the use of catalytic additives to form transient directing groups (as aldehyde or amine) are covered including selected highlights of the most recent examples of catalytic imine directed C&#8211;H functionalization with transition metals.</dc:description>

         <title>Co(II) Substitution Enhances the Esterase Activity of a de Novo Designed Zn(II) Carbonic Anhydrase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonic Anhydrases (CAs) are targets for de&#160;Novo protein designers due to the simplicity of the active site and rapid rate of the reaction. The first reported mimic contained a Zn(II) bound to three histidine imidazole nitrogens and an exogenous water molecule, closely mimicking the native enzymes&#8217; first coordination sphere. Co(II) has served as an alternative metal to interrogate CAs due to its d7 electronic configuration for more detailed solution characterization. We present here the Co(II) substituted [Co(II)(H2O/OH&#8722;)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3n+ that behaves similarly to native Co(II) substituted human&#8208;CAs. Like the Zn(II) analogue, the cobalt&#8208;derivative at slightly basic pH is incapable of hydrolyzing p&#8209;nitrophenylacetate (pNPA); however, as the pH is increased a significant activity develops, which at pH values above 10 eventually yields a catalytic efficiency that exceeds that of the [Zn(II)(OH&#8722;)]N(TRIL2WL23H)3+. X&#8208;ray absorption analysis is consistent with an octahedral species at pH 7.5 that converts to a 5&#8208;coordinate species by pH 11. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy monitors this transition, giving a pKa value of 10.3. We assign this conversion to the formation of a 5&#8208;coordinate Co(II)(Nimid)3(OH)(H2O) species. The pH dependent kinetic analysis indicates the maximal rate (kcat) and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), follow the same pH profile as the spectroscopic conversion to the pentacoordinate species.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible coupling of germylone with isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The germylone dimNHCGe (5, dimNHC = diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition with isocyanates RNCO (R = 4&#8208;tolyl or 3,5&#8208;xylyl) to furnish novel alkyl carboxamido germylenes 6 (R=4&#8208;tolyl) and 7 (R= 3,5&#8208;xylyl), featuring a C&#8208;C bond between the former carbene carbon and the isocyanate moiety. Heating a mixture of 7 with 4&#8208;tolyl isocyanate to 100 &#176;C results in isocyanate metathesis, demonstrating reversible C&#8208;C bond formation on the reduced germanium compound. DFT calculations suggest that this process occurs via the reductive dissociation of isocyanate from 8 that regenerates the parent Ge(0) compound 5.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Liquid Crystallinity and Electroluminescence via Sulfonation of S&#8208;Annulated Perylene Tetraester</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a comparative analysis of S&#8208;annulated perylene tetraester (PTE&#8208;S) and its sulfone (PTE&#8208;SO2) analogue. This sulfone modification reduced melting point and stabilized a room temperature columnar rectangular (Colr) phase in contrast to its parent PTE&#8208;S which showed a crystalline behaviour at room temperature. This molecular design also leads to red&#8208;shifted absorbance and emission in comparison to PTE&#8208;S, along with a tuning of photoluminescence from sky blue to green, achieving an impressive quantum yield of 85%. OLED devices fabricated using PTE&#8208;SO2 as emitter material at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, and 1 wt.% in CBP as host material. A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.9% was observed with the 0.5 wt.% PTE&#8208;SO2 in CBP with CIE coordinates of (0.45, 0.35), accompanied by an orange luminance of 848 cd/m2. Notably, a device with a 0.5 wt% doping concentration of PTE&#8208;S demonstrates an EQE of 3.5%, and cyan luminance of 2,598 cd/m2.</dc:description>

         <title>The Resorcinarene Hexameric Capsule as a Supramolecular Photoacid to Trigger Olefin Hydroarylation in Confined Space</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembled resorcinarene capsule C6 shows remarkable photoacidity upon light irradiation, which is here exploited to catalyze olefin hydroarylation reactions in confined space. An experimental pKa* value range of &#8208;3.3 &#8208; &#8208;2.8 was estimated for the photo&#8208;excited hexameric capsule C6*, and consequently an increase in acidity of 8.8 log units was observed with respect to its ground state (pKa = 5.5&#8208;6.0). This makes the hexameric capsule the first example of a self&#8208;assembled supramolecular photoacid. The photoacid C6* can catalyze hydroarylation reaction of olefins with aromatic substrates inside its cavity, while no reaction occurred between them in the absence of irradiation and/or capsule. DFT calculations corroborated a mechanism in which the photoacidity of C6* plays a crucial role in the protonation step of the aromatic substrate. A further proton transfer to olefin with a concomitant C&#8208;C bond formation and a final deprotonation step lead to product releasing.</dc:description>

         <title>QM/MM Study Into the Mechanism of Oxidative C=C Double Bond Cleavage by Lignostilbene&#8208;a,b&#8208;Dioxygenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enzymatic biosynthesis of fragrance molecules from lignin fragments is an important reaction in biotechnology for the sustainable production of fine chemicals. In this work we investigated the biosynthesis of vanillin from lignostilbene by a nonheme iron dioxygenase using QM/MM and tested several suggested proposals via either an epoxide or dioxetane intermediate. Binding of dioxygen to iron(II) gives fast electron transfer from substrate to oxidant to generate an iron(II)&#8208;superoxo species with lignostilbene cation radical. The dioxygenase mechanism starts with electrophilic attack of the terminal oxygen atom of the superoxo group on the central C=C bond of lignostilbene, whereby the second&#8208;coordination sphere effects in the substrate binding pocket that led to preferential dioxetane formation. The work is rationalized with thermochemical cycles and valence bond schemes that explain the electron transfer processes during the reaction mechanism. Particularly, the polarity of the protein and the local electric field and dipole moments enable a facile electron transfer and an exergonic dioxetane formation pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic&#8211;Plasmonic Nanocomposites as Versatile Substrates for Surface&#8211;enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores magnetic&#8211;plasmonic nanocomposites for SERS, focusing on their design, fabrication, and surface functionalization. It highlights their potential in applications like medical diagnostics and environmental monitoring and anticipates significant future contributions to scientific and technological advancements in these fields.







Abstract
Surface&#8211;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, a highly sensitive technique for detecting trace&#8211;level analytes, relies on plasmonic substrates. The choice of substrate, its morphology, and the excitation wavelength are crucial in SERS applications. To address advanced SERS requirements, the design and use of efficient nanocomposite substrates have become increasingly important. Notably, magnetic&#8211;plasmonic (MP) nanocomposites, which combine magnetic and plasmonic properties within a single particle system, stand out as promising nanoarchitectures with versatile applications in nanomedicine and SERS spectroscopy. In this review, we present an overview of MP nanocomposite fabrication methods, explore surface functionalization strategies, and evaluate their use in SERS. Our focus is on how different nanocomposite designs, magnetic and plasmonic properties, and surface modifications can significantly influence their SERS&#8208;related characteristics, thereby affecting their performance in specific applications such as separation, environmental monitoring, and biological applications. Reviewing recent studies highlights the multifaceted nature of these materials, which have great potential to transform SERS applications across a range of fields, from medical diagnostics to environmental monitoring. Finally, we discuss the prospects of MP nanocomposites, anticipating favorable developments that will make substantial contributions to various scientific and technological areas.

         <title>Divergent Electrochemical Synthesis of Indoles through pKa Regulation of Amides: Synthetic and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes an unprecedented chemo&#8208;divergent synthesis of C&#8208;3&#8208;free and C&#8208;3&#8208;selenylated indoles with exclusive chemoselectivity through controlled and selective electrochemical oxidation of 2&#8208;amino stilbene derivatives. The chemoselectivity was achieved by regulating the pKa of the N&#8722;H proton. Detailed experimental and computational studies assist in explaining the ambiguous chemical nature of diversely N&#8208;protected 2&#8208;amino stilbenes in synthesizing chemo&#8208;divergent indole frameworks.







Abstract
A divergent synthetic approach to access highly substituted indole scaffolds is illustrated. By virtue of a tunable electrochemical strategy, distinct control over the C&#8208;3 substitution pattern was achieved by employing two analogous 2&#8208;styrylaniline precursors. The chemoselectivity is governed by the fine&#8208;tuning of the acidity of the amide proton, relying on the appropriate selection of N&#8208;protecting groups, and assisted by the reactivity of the electrogenerated intermediates. Detailed mechanistic investigations based on cyclic voltametric experiments and computational studies revealed the crucial role of water additive, which assists the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer event for highly acidic amide precursors, followed by an energetically favorable intramolecular C&#8722;N coupling, causing exclusive fabrication of the C&#8208;3 unsubstituted indoles. Alternatively, the implementation of an electrogenerated cationic olefin activator delivers the C&#8208;3 substituted indoles through the preferential nucleophilic nature of the N&#8208;acyl amides. This electrochemical approach of judicious selection of N&#8208;protecting groups to regulate pKa/E&#176; provides an expansion in the domain of switchable generation of heterocyclic derivatives in a sustainable fashion, with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.

         <title>Versatile Palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization to access new luminescent azaphosphaphenalene motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein a swift and versatile palladium cyclization is presented using readily accessible catalysts and starting materials to produce new azaphosphaphenalene motifs. The luminescent properties of these products were evaluated and some of the key compounds had their structure unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray analysis. The phosphorus atom offers interesting possibilities for post functionalization.







Abstract
Using a straightforward sequence of diphosphonylation and a Pd&#8208;catalysed concerted&#8208;metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD), a synthetic strategy towards polyaromatic phosphorus containing heterocycles was developed. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of new azaphosphaphenalenes, using easily accessible palladium catalysts and starting materials. The key tetrahydroquinoline intermediates of the reaction were synthesised via a fast and effective procedure and could be isolated as such, or further reacted towards the target polyaromatic structures. The obtained products showed interesting luminescent properties and their emission, excitation and quantum yields were evaluated.

The luminescent properties of these products were evaluated and some of the key compounds had their structure unambiguously confirmed by X-ray analysis. The phosphorus atom offers interesting possibilities for post functionalization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a straightforward sequence of diphosphonylation and a Pd-catalysed concerted-metalation-deprotonation (CMD), a synthetic strategy towards polyaromatic phosphorus containing heterocycles was developed. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of new azaphosphaphenalenes, using easily accessible palladium catalysts and starting materials. The key tetrahydroquinoline intermediates of the reaction were synthesised via a fast and effective procedure and could be isolated as such, or further reacted towards the target polyaromatic structures. The obtained products showed interesting luminescent properties and their emission, excitation and quantum yields were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generalist versus Specialist Self&#8208;Replicators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Whether assembly&#8208;driven self&#8208;replicators that emerge from a mixture of two building blocks specialize on one resource or are generalists was found to depend on their supramolecular organization.







Abstract
Darwinian evolution, including the selection of the fittest species under given environmental conditions, is a major milestone in the development of synthetic living systems. In this regard, generalist or specialist behavior (the ability to replicate in a broader or narrower, more specific food environment) are of importance. Here we demonstrate generalist and specialist behavior in dynamic combinatorial libraries composed of a peptide&#8208;based and an oligo(ethylene glycol) based building block. Three different sets of macrocyclic replicators could be distinguished based on their supramolecular organization: two prepared from a single building block as well as one prepared from an equimolar mixture of them. Peptide&#8208;containing hexamer replicators were found to be generalists, i.&#8201;e. they could replicate in a broad range of food niches, whereas the octamer peptide&#8208;based replicator and hexameric ethyleneoxide&#8208;based replicator were proven to be specialists, i.&#8201;e. they only replicate in very specific food niches that correspond to their composition. However, sequence specificity cannot be demonstrated for either of the generalist replicators. The generalist versus specialist nature of these replicators was linked to their supramolecular organization. Assembly modes that accommodate structurally different building blocks lead to generalist replicators, while assembly modes that are more restrictive yield specialist replicators.

         <title>Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence Promoted by AIE&#8208;active Chiral Co&#8208;assemblies in Liquid Crystal Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of chiral co&#8208;assembled liquid crystal polymer (PTZ doped in S&#8208;PB2) exhibits reversed and amplified yellow CPL emission (|glum|=0.13) after thermal annealing treatment. This is due to the variation of chiral co&#8208;assemblies from spherical aggregates to helical nanofibers. Noticeably, the largest glum value could reach up to +0.91/&#8208;0.82 by increasing the film thickness.







Abstract
Recently, extensive works have focused on increasing the dissymmetry factors (glum) of various circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, which is one of the most important factors for future applications of CPL. Herein, we designed a chiral co&#8208;assembled liquid crystal polymer (LCP) PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2, which was prepared by chiral binary co&#8208;polymer (R/S&#8208;PB2) doped with achiral phenothiazine derivation dye (PTZ). For comparison, ternary co&#8208;polymerized LCP (R/S&#8208;PT) was synthesized by co&#8208;polymerizing with mesogenic monomer, chiral monomer and emissive monomer. Both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Interestingly, the CPL signals of both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT were reversed and amplified after thermal annealing treatment. The |glum| values of the co&#8208;assembled PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 were up to 0.13 at a 32&#8197;nm thickness, which was 5.4 times that of R/S&#8208;PT (|glum|=0.024). This is due to PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could form more orderly chiral co&#8208;assembly structures. Noticeably, increasing the LCP film thickness could further improve the glum value, and the maximum glum of PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could be enhanced to +0.91/&#8722;0.82 at a 220&#8197;nm thickness.

         <title>Application of quasi solid electrolytes in organic based electrochromic devices: A mini review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes for the construction of electrochromic devices (ECDs) is attractive because of their ease of preparation, availability, low cost, improve electrochromic performance, good ionic conductivity and prevention of leakages in ECDs. Hence, It is important to understand the current state of developing quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes and ways of improving their efficiencies.







Abstract
The interest in all solid organic based electrochromic devices (ECDs) is on the increase. This is because these devices offer the applicability of electrochromic materials in products such as smart sensors, smart windows, flexible wearables and energy storage devices. The use of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes for the construction of these ECDs is attractive because of their ease of preparation, availability, low cost, improve electrochromic performance, good ionic conductivity and prevention of leakages in ECDs. Hence, in this review, a detailed discussion is presented on the progress in the development of semi&#8208;solid electrolytes for ECDs fabrication. The preparation of the most common electrolytes that have been applied for organic based ECDs are summarized. Particular attention is given to efforts and strategies that have been adopted to improve the efficiency of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes. Importantly, knowledge gaps that warrant further research are clearly identified and recommendations for future works are suggested. This review will be very beneficial for both established and new researchers in the field of electrochromic devices and material science.

         <title>Organic Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complexes As Potential Semiconducting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article overviews the synthesis, characterization, and physico&#8208;chemical properties of the organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes, often referred to as charge transfer complexes. Donors, categorized as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrogen heterocycles, and sulphur&#8208;containing aromatic compounds, are examined in their reactions with various acceptors like TCNQ, TCNE, fullerenes, and others. The article delves into applications of resulting complexes for physico&#8208;electronic purposes and includes theoretical investigations to rationalize the observed properties.







Abstract
In this review article, the synthesis, characterization and physico&#8208;chemical properties of the organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes are highlighted and a special emphasis has been placed on developing them as semiconducting materials. The electron&#8208;rich molecules, i.&#8201;e., donors have been broadly grouped in three categories, namely polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrogen heterocycles and sulphur containing aromatic donors. The reactions of these classes of the donors with the acceptors, namely tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), tetracyanoethylene (TCNE), tetracyanobenzene (TCNB), benzoquinone, pyromellitic dianhydride and pyromellitic diimides, fullerenes, phenazine, benzothiadiazole, naphthalimide, DMAD, maleic anhydride, viologens and naphthalene diimide are described. The potential applications of the resulting DA complexes for physico&#8208;electronic purposes are also included. The theoretical investigation of many of these products with a view to rationalise their observed physico&#8208;chemical properties is also discussed.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Driven Control Over Triply and Quadruply Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Supramolecular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foldamers consisting of two hydrogen bonding motifs (HBMs) connected by a central azobenzene exhibit concentration and light dependent switching between four states.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers offer tremendous potential to produce new &#8220;smart&#8221; materials, however, there remains a need to develop systems that are responsive to external stimuli. In this work, visible&#8208;light responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymers comprising photoresponsive supramolecular synthons (I&#8211;III) consisting of two hydrogen bonding motifs (HBMs) connected by a central ortho&#8208;tetrafluorinated azobenzene have been characterized by DOSY NMR and viscometry. Comparison of different hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs reveals that assembly in the low and high concentration regimes is strongly influenced by the strength of association between the HBMs. I, Incorporating a triply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer, was found to exhibit concentration dependent switching between a monomeric pseudo&#8208;cycle and supramolecular oligomer through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the HBMs. II, Based on the same photoresponsive scaffold, and incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded homodimer was found to form a supramolecular polymer which was dependent upon the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium and thus dependent upon both concentration and photochemical stimulus. Finally, III, incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer represents the first photoswitchable AB type hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymer. Depending on the concentration and photostationary state, four different assemblies dominate for both monomers II and III, demonstrating the ability to control supramolecular assembly and physical properties triggered by light.

         <title>Photoswitching in a Liquid Crystalline Pt(II) Coordination Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An example of single&#8208;component multimode photoswitch was demonstrated by designing a novel Pt(II) coordination complex decorated with spiropyran, which can deliver distinct apparent colors, photoluminescent colors and liquid crystal textures in response to light.







Abstract
Photoswitching of photoluminescence has sparked tremendous research interests for super&#8208;resolution imaging, high&#8208;security&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and other high&#8208;tech applications. However, the excitation of photoluminescence is usually ready to trigger the photoswitching process, making the photoluminescence readout unreliable. Herein, we report a new photoswitch by the marriage of spiropyran with platinum(II) coordination complex. Viable photoluminescence can be achieved upon excitation by 480&#8197;nm visible light while the photoswitching can be easily triggered by 365&#8197;nm UV light. The feasible photoswitching may be benefited from the formed liquid crystalline (LC) phase of the designed photoswitch as a crystalline spiropyran is normally unable to implement photoswitching. Compared to the counterparts, this LC photoswitch can show distinct and reliable apparent colors and emission colors before and after photoswitching, which may promise the utility in high&#8208;security&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting and other advanced information technologies.

         <title>Aurones: Unexplored Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitches for Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aurone derivatives have been introduced for the first time as a novel class of visible&#8208;light photoswitches in aqueous medium possessing good quantum yields, high conversions in photostationary states and remarkably long (up to 7 years) lifetimes of the photoisomers. Moreover, the aurone scaffold can be easily modified with functional substituents without affecting its robust photochemical performance paving a way towards a range of applications.







Abstract
The development of synthetically accessible photoswitches showing an efficient performance in aqueous medium has recently become an urgent task due to the rapid progress of photopharmacology and novel biomedical applications. In response to this challenge, in this work, aurone derivatives are introduced as a novel class of efficient visible&#8208;light photoswitches for aqueous medium. In general, aurones exhibit superior performance in water, including significantly higher quantum yields, compared with other indigoid photoswitches (hemithioindigo and hemiindigo). Especially remarkable are the half&#8208;lives of the photoinduced E&#8208;isomers of aurones in water, reaching up to 7&#8197;years. Further modification of the aurone scaffold with substituents that increase water solubility does not affect most of the photoswitching characteristics and even improves some them. The highly advantageous property profile of the aurone photoswitches make them a perfect novel platform for the design of light&#8208;controllable systems in the areas requiring photoswitching in aqueous medium.

         <title>Covalent Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Metal&#8208;Organic Cages: Concepts and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is a powerful research paradigm capable of constructing metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with customized structures and properties. A variety of efficient organic reactions have been developed for the functionalization of MOCs, and these new products have shown potential applications in multiple fields.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) are supramolecular coordination complexes that have internal cavities for hosting guest molecules and exhibiting various properties. However, the functions of MOCs are limited by the choice of the building blocks. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is a technique that can introduce new functional groups and replace existing ones on the MOCs without changing their geometry. Among many PSM methods, covalent PSM is a promising approach to modify MOCs with tailored structures and functions. Covalent PSM can be applied to either the internal cavity or the external surface of the MOCs, depending on the functionality expected to be customized. However, there are still some challenges and limitations in the field of covalent PSM of MOCs, such as the balance between the stability of MOCs and the harshness of organic reactions involved in covalent PSMs. This concept article introduces the organic reaction types involved in covalent PSM of MOCs, their new applications after modification, and summarizes and provides an outlook of this research field.

         <title>Synthesis and functionalities of FeSn12 superatom prepared by single atom introduction with a dendrimer template</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of synthesis method for superatoms is significant for the design to mimic an atom. The asymmetric dendrimer &#8220;pyTPM G4&#8221; introduces one Fe atom, making solution&#8208;phase synthesis of FeSn12. The synthesis and obtained structure were clarified and the electronic state was investigated by theoretical calculations. The prepared superatom showed Near&#8208;IR emission and magnetism enhancement.







Abstract
Superatoms are promising as new building block materials that can be designed by precise controlling of the constituent atoms. Stannaspherene (Sn122&#8722;) is a rigid cage&#8208;like cluster with icosahedral symmetry, for which one&#8208;atom encapsulation was theoretically expected and detected in the gas phase. Here, a single&#8208;atom introduction method into stannaspherene using a dendrimer template with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) protection is demonstrated. This advanced solution&#8208;phase synthesis allows not only the selective doping of one atom into the cluster cage, but also enable further detail characterization of optical and magnetic properties that were not possible in the gas&#8208;phase synthesis. In other words, this liquid&#8208;phase synthesis method has enabled the adaptation of detailed analytical methods. In this study, FeSn12 was synthesized and characterized, revealing that a single Fe atom introduction in the Sn122&#8722; cage result in the appearance of near&#8208;infrared emission and enhancement in the magnetism.

         <title>Versatile Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission Polymers from Barbier Polymerization of Cinnamic Esters with Tunable Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cinnamic ester was successfully used as monomer to prepare polymers with NTIL characteristics through Barbier PIE strategy, which exhibited adjustable NTIL from AIE type to ACQ type. Further potential applications and the mechanism of luminescent polymer in explosive detection were carried out.







Abstract
Cinnamic ester is a common and abundant chemical substance, which can be extracted from natural plants. Compared with traditional esters, cinnamic ester contains &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl structure with multiple reactive sites, resulting in more abundant reactivities and chemical structures. Here, a versatile polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is successfully demonstrated through Barbier polymerization of cinnamic ester. Attributed to its abundant reactivities of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl structure, Barbier polymerization of cinnamic esters with different organodihalides gives polyalcohol and polyketone via 1,2&#8208;addition and 1,4&#8208;addition, respectively, which is also confirmed by small molecular model reactions. Meanwhile, these organodihalides dependant polyalcohol and polyketone exhibit different non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) from aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) type to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) type, where novel PIE luminogens (PIEgens) are revealed. Further potential applications in explosive detection are carried out, where it achieves TNT detection sensitivity at&#8197;ppm level in solution and ng level on the test paper. This work therefore expands the structure and functionality libraries of monomer, polymer and NTIL, which might cause inspirations to different fields including polymer chemistry, NTIL, AIE and PIE.

         <title>&#8220;The Sulfur Dance&#8221; Around Arenes and Heteroarenes &#8208; the Reversible Nature of Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The features of a category of reversible nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions in view of their significance and wide scope in aromatic and heteroaromatic chemistry are presented. Exchange of sulfur components surrounding arenes and heteroarenes may occur at 25&#8201;&#176;C, in a process that one may call a &#8220;sulfur dance&#8221;. A dynamic covalent system involving four components illustrates the thermodynamically&#8208;driven formation of a thiacalix[2]arene[2]pyrimidine. This work stimulates the implementation of reversible SNAr reactions in organic, materials and covalent dynamic chemistry.







Abstract
We disclose the features of a category of reversible nucleophilic aromatic substitutions in view of their significance and generality in dynamic aromatic chemistry. Exchange of sulfur components surrounding arenes and heteroarenes may occur at 25&#8201;&#176;C, in a process that one may call a &#8220;sulfur dance&#8221;. These SNAr systems present their own features, apart from common reversible reactions utilized in dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC). By varying conditions, covalent dynamics may operate to provide libraries of thiaarenes with some selectivity, or conversion of a hexa(thio)benzene asterisk into another one. The reversible nature of SNAr is confirmed by three methods: a convergence of the products distribution in reversible SNAr systems, a related product redistribution between two per(thio)benzenes by using a thiolate promoter, and from kinetic/thermodynamic data. A four&#8208;component dynamic covalent system further illustrates the thermodynamically&#8208;driven formation of a thiacalix[2]arene[2]pyrimidine by sulfur component exchanges. This work stimulates the implementation of reversible SNAr in aromatic chemistry and in DCC.

         <title>Polymer Backbone Chemistry Shapes the Alkaline Stability of Metallopolymer Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallopolymers employ a metal center to facilitate the transport of ions in anion&#8208;exchange membranes. The characteristics of metallopolymers emerge from the intricate interplay between the metal complex and polymer backbone. Our investigation scrutinizes the influence of polymer backbone chemistry on the metalation reaction and the alkaline resilience of metallopolymers.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells and water electrolyzers have garnered significant attention in past years due to their potential role in sustainable and affordable energy conversion and storage. However, the chemical stability of the polymeric anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AEMs), the key component in these devices, currently limits their lifespan. Recently, metallopolymers have been proposed as chemically stable alternatives to organic cations, using metal centers as ion transporters. In metallopolymer AEMs, various properties such as alkaline stability, water uptake, flexibility, and performance, are determined by both the metal complex and polymer backbone. Herein we present a systematic study investigating the influence of the polymer backbone chemistry on some of these properties, focusing on the alkaline stability of low&#8208;oxophilicity gold metallopolymers. Despite the use of a common N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand, upon gold metalation using the same reaction conditions, different polymer backbones end up forming different gold complexes. These findings suggest that polymer chemistry affects the metalation reaction in addition to the other properties relevant to AEM performance.

         <title>Luminescent Supramolecular Ionic Frameworks based on Organic Fluorescent Polycations and Polyanionic Phosphorescent Metal Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emissive ionic frameworks are designed by associating blue emissive tetraphenylethylene moieties functionalized with four imidazolium heads and red&#8208;NIR phosphorescent dianionic Mo or tetracationic Re&#8208;based octahedral clusters. Resulting hybrids show a porous structure in their crystalline state and their chemical and thermal stability depends on the charge of the metal cluster. Emission in the red&#8208;NIR by 1PA and 2PA were evidenced in both cases.







Abstract
Emissive ionic supramolecular frameworks are designed by associating tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetra&#8208;cationic units and di&#8208;anionic molybdenum or tetra&#8208;anionic rhenium octahedral clusters. Obtained structures were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The emission properties of the hybrids were investigated as dry powders or in various solvents by one photon and two photon absorption leading to a O2 concentration dependent luminescence color for the Mo based hybrid.

         <title>Functionalized Polyamine Synthesis with Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although polyamines are pivotal in various biological processes, the difficulties in accessing structurally modified polyamines have limited their exploration for discovering bioactive compounds. The cover feature picture shows how catalysts (left) are irradiated by light. Rapid photoredox&#8208;catalyzed functionalization of target polyamines (right) allows the attachment of various substituents to develop novel bioactive molecules and diverse molecular probes to advance chemical biology studies. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Murakami and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304374).

         <title>Cationic Hypervalent Chalcogen Bond Catalysis on the Povarov Reaction: Reactivity and Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bond catalysis, particularly cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysis, is considered to be an effective strategy for organocatalysis. In this work, the cationic hypervalent chalcogen bond catalysis for the Povarov reaction between N&#8208;benzylideneaniline and ethyl vinyl ether was investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic reaction involves the cycloaddition process and the proton transfer process, and the rate&#8208;determining step is the cycloaddition process. Cationic hypervalent tellurium derivatives bearing CF3 and F groups exhibit superior catalytic activity. For the rate&#8208;determining step, the Gibbs free energy barrier decreases as the positive electrostatic potential of the chalcogen bond catalysts increases. More importantly, the Gibbs free energy barrier has a strong linear correlation with the electrostatic energy of the chalcogen bond in the catalyst&#8208;substrate complex. Furthermore, the catalytic reactions include the endo pathway and exo pathway. The C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction between the substituent of the ethyl vinyl ether and the aryl ring of the N&#8208;benzylideneaniline contributes to the endo&#8208;selectivity of the reaction. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of chalcogen bond catalysis, providing insights for designing chalcogen bond catalysts with high performance.</dc:description>

         <title>C 3&#8208;symmetric luminescent diketone with amido&#8208;linkage as a polymorphic fluorescence emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study introduces a novel C3&#8208;symmetric b&#8208;diketone compound, BTA&#8208;D3, and its monomeric counterpart, D, with a focus on their synthetic procedure, photophysical properties and aggregation behavior. Both compounds exhibit characteristic absorption and weak fluorescence in solution, with BTA&#8208;D3 displaying higher absorption coefficients due to its larger number of diketone units. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest increased co&#8208;planarity of diketone groups in BTA&#8208;D3. A significant finding is the Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) property of BTA&#8208;D3, as its fluorescence intensity increases dramatically when exposed to specific solvent ratios. The AIE behavior is attributed to intermolecular excitonic interaction between BTA&#8208;D3 molecules in self&#8208;organized aggregates. We also studied fluorescence anisotropy of BTA&#8208;D3 and D. Despite its larger size, BTA&#8208;D3 showed reduced anisotropy values because of efficient intramolecular energy migration among three diketone units. Furthermore, BTA&#8208;D3 demonstrates unique polymorphism, yielding different emission colors and structures depending on the solvent used. A unique approach is presented for promoting the growth of self&#8208;organized aggregate structures via solvent evaporation, leading to distinct fluorescence properties. This research contributes to the understanding of C3&#8208;symmetric structural molecules and provides insights into strategies for controlling molecular alignment to achieve diverse fluorescence coloration in molecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding Chemical Frontiers: Approaches for Generating Diverse and Bioactive Natural Product&#8208;Like Compounds Libraries from Extracts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The realms of natural products and synthetic compounds exhibit distinct chemical spaces that not only differ but also complement each other. While the convergence of these two domains has been explored through hemisynthesis and conventional pharmacomodulation endeavours applied to natural frameworks, a recent and innovative approach has recently emerged that involves the combinatorial generation of libraries of &#8216;natural product&#8208;like compounds&#8217; (NPLCs) through the direct synthetic derivatization of natural extracts. This has led to the production of numerous NPLCs that incorporate structural elements from both their natural (multiple saturated rings, oxygen content, chiral centres) and synthetic (aromatic rings, nitrogen and halogen content, drug&#8208;like properties) precursors. Through careful selection of extracts and reagents, specific bioactivities have been achieved, and this strategy has been deployed in various ways, showing great promise without reaching its full potential to date. This review seeks to provide an overview of reported examples involving the chemical engineering of extracts, showcasing a spectrum of natural product alterations spanning from simple substitutions to complete scaffold remodelling. It also includes an analysis of the accomplishments, perspectives and technical challenges within this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic, Oxidative Cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond in Lignin Models and Native Lignin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is challenging to realize the selective C&#8208;C bond cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages for production of high&#8208;value aromatic chemicals due to its intrinsic inertness and complex structure. Here we report a light&#8208;driven, chlorine&#8208;radical&#8208;based protocol to realize the oxidative C&#8208;C bond cleavage in various lignin model compounds catalyzed by commercially available TPT and CaCl2, achieving high conversion and good to high product yields at room temperature. Mechanistic studies reveal that the preferential activation of C&#946;&#8208;H bond facilitates the oxidation and C&#8208;C bond cleavage of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model via chlorine radical. Furthermore, this method is also applicable to the depolymerization of natural lignin extracts, furnishing the aromatic oxygenates from the cleavage of C&#945;&#8208;C&#946; bonds. This study provides experimental foundations to the depolymerization and valorization of lignin into high value&#8208;added aromatic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics and Coordination of a P2N2 Ligand &#8211; from Twisted Conformation to Chelation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on their general spacial flexibility, their Lewis and Br&#248;nsted basicity, and ability to mimic second sphere effects the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane ligand family and their complexes have re&#8208;gained substantial scientific interest. It was now possible to structurally analyze a recently reported member of this family with p&#8208;tolyl and t&#8208;butyl substituents on P and N, respectively, (P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu). Notably, the ligand crystallizes with a &#8216;twisted&#8217; backbone. This compound is the very first of its kind to have been unambiguously characterized with regard to its chemical and molecular structure as being in this conformation. A temperature&#8208;dependent NMR study provides insight into the molecular dynamics of two isomers in solution, which are most likely also both twisted, as judged by the observed limited reactivity. Despite the in principle unfavorable conformation of the free ligand, it was successfully chelated to tungsten and molybdenum centers in mononuclear carbonyl complexes. The ligand, a derivative thereof and four new complexes were comprehensively characterized and analyzed in comparison. This includes single crystal XRD molecular structures of P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu and all four complexes. P2p&#8208;tolN2tBu, regardless of its twisted conformation, is able to coordinate to metal centers given that enough energy (heat) for a conformational change is provided.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Based on their general spacial flexibility, their Lewis and Br&#248;nsted basicity, and ability to mimic second sphere effects the 1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctane ligand family and their complexes have re-gained substantial scientific interest. It was now possible to structurally analyze a recently reported member of this family with p-tolyl and t-butyl substituents on P and N, respectively, (P2p-tolN2tBu). Notably, the ligand crystallizes with a &#8216;twisted&#8217; backbone. This compound is the very first of its kind to have been unambiguously characterized with regard to its chemical and molecular structure as being in this conformation. A temperature-dependent NMR study provides insight into the molecular dynamics of two isomers in solution, which are most likely also both twisted, as judged by the observed limited reactivity. Despite the in principle unfavorable conformation of the free ligand, it was successfully chelated to tungsten and molybdenum centers in mononuclear carbonyl complexes. The ligand, a derivative thereof and four new complexes were comprehensively characterized and analyzed in comparison. This includes single crystal XRD molecular structures of P2p-tolN2tBu and all four complexes. P2p-tolN2tBu, regardless of its twisted conformation, is able to coordinate to metal centers given that enough energy (heat) for a conformational change is provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of the Small Superelectrophile [C2(OH)2Me2]2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The acid&#8208;activation of 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds plays a key role in a variety of electrophilic reactions, some of which are only accessible in superacidic media when a superelectrophilic dication is formed. To obtain structural and electronic information about these elusive species, the vicinal dication [C2(OH)2Me2]2+ is synthesized and characterized by Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Since this superelectrophile could not be stabilized in convenient superacids, the usage of liquid SO2 turned out to be crucial. The experimental data are discussed together with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analyses quantify the superelectrophilic interactions found in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Ring Opening of a Tetracyclic Tetraphosphane with Twofold Metallocene Bridging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A direct route to a doubly ferrocene bridged tetracyclic tetraphosphane 1 was developed via reductive coupling of Fe(CpPCl2)2 (2a), where a chlorine terminated linear P4&#8208;compound 3 could be identified as an intermediate. Selective P&#8208;P bond activation was further achieved by reacting 1 with elemental selenium or [Cp*Al]4, where regioselective insertion of Se or Al atoms resulted in ferrocenylene bridged [P4Se] (4) or [P4Al] (7) moieties. Compound 7 can be transformed to a hydrogen terminated linear P4 species, 8, with protic solvents. Methylation of compound 1 with MeOTf, proceeds via intermediate formation of monomethylated species 5, which gradually produced Me2&#8208;terminated dicationic 6, again containing a linear P4&#8208;unit. Besides spectroscopic characterization, the structural details of compounds 1, 4, 6, and 8 could be determined by SC&#8208;XRD. Moreover, DFT calculations were used to rationalize the reactivity of 1, derived compounds and intermediates. As a key feature, 1 undergoes ring opening polymerization to a linear polyphosphane 9.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Formed Electron Inhibitor Enabling Dendrite&#8208;free Garnet Electrolytes: A Case Study of Fumed Silica</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ta&#8208;doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs) show great promise for solid&#8208;state batteries due to its high conductivity and safety. However, one of the challenges it faces is lithium dendrite propagation upon long&#8208;term cycling. To address this issue, we propose the incorporation of fumed silica (FS) at the grain boundaries of LLZTO to modify the properties of the garnet pellet, which effectively inhibits the dendrite growth. The introduction of FS has demonstrated several beneficial effects. Firstly, it reduces the migration barrier of lithium ions, which helps prevent dendrite formation and propagation. Additionally, FS reduces the electronic conductivity of the SEs pellet, suppressing the dendrite formation. Moreover, the formed lithium silicates from FS might also be acted as electron inhibitor, thus inhibiting the lithium dendrite growth upon cycling. By investigating the use of FS as a modifier in LLZTO&#8208;based electrolytes, our study contributes to advancing dendrite&#8208;free solid&#8208;state electrolytes and thus the development of high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of Electronic Structures of the Urchin&#8208;Like NiCoP/CoP Nanocatalysts for Fast Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of stable, efficient, and low&#8208;cost catalysts toward ammonia borane hydrolysis is of vital significance for the practical implementation of this hydrogen production technology. Integrating interface engineering and nano&#8208;architecture&#160;engineering is a favorable strategy to elevate catalytic performance, as it can modify the electronic structure and provide sufficient active sites simultaneously. In this work, urchin&#8208;like NiCoP/CoP heterostructures&#160;are prepared via a three&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;oxidation&#8208;phosphorization synthesis route. It is demonstrated that&#160;the original Ni/Co molar ratio and the amount of phosphorus are crucial for adjusting the morphology, enhancing the exposed surface area, facilitating charge transfer, and modulating the adsorption and activation of H2O molecules.&#160;Consequently, the optimal Ni1Co2P heterostructure displays remarkable catalytic properties in the hydrolysis of ammonia borane with a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 30.3 molH2&#183;min&#8208;1&#183;molmetal&#8208;1, a low apparent activation energy of 25.89&#160;kJ&#183;mol&#8208;1,&#160;and good stability. Furthermore, by combining&#160;infrared spectroscopy&#160;and isotope kinetics experiments, a possible mechanism for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;DABCO Salts as an Unprecedented Sensing Platform for the Detection of Thiols and Selenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quaternary&#160;N&#8208;aryl&#8208;DABCO salts were introduced for the first time as a highly selective sensing platform for thiols and selenols. By employing this platform, a highly sensitive coumarin based "off&#8208;on" fluorescent probe was designed and synthesized. The probe possesses a good solubility in water, low background fluorescence, and, most importantly, demonstrates high selectivity to aryl thiols and selenols over their aliphatic counterparts and other common nucleophiles. A dramatic increase in fluorescent intensity is achieved through the selective cleavage of the quaternized DABCO&#8208;ring, yielding a piperazine derivatives with a high fluorescent quantum yield (~72%). Moreover, stability of the probe to the most used reducing agents DTT and TCEP was demonstrated. Limits of detection for&#160;p&#8208;thiocresol and phenyl selenide were evaluated to be 22 nM and 6 nM respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Size&#8208;Switchable Ru Nanoaggregates for Enhancing Phototherapy: Hyaluronidase&#8208;Triggered Disassembly to Alleviate Deep Tumor Hypoxia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypoxia is a critical factor for restricting photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumor, and it becomes increasingly severe with increasing tissue depth. Thus, the relief of deep tumor hypoxia is extremely important to improve the PDT efficacy. Herein, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive size&#8208;switchable hyaluronic acid&#8208;hybridized Ru nanoaggregates (HA@Ru NAs) were developed via screening reaction temperature to alleviate deep tumor hypoxia for improving the tumor&#8208;specific PDT by the artful integration multiple bioactivated chemical reactions in situ and receptor&#8208;mediated targeting (RMT). In this nanosystem, Ru NPs not only enabled HA@Ru NAs to have near infrared (NIR)&#8208;mediated photothermal/photodynamic functions, but also could catalyze endogenous H2O2 to produce O2in situ. More importantly, hyaluronidase (HAase) overexpressed in the TME could trigger disassembly of HA@Ru NAs via the hydrolysis of HA, offering the smart size switch capability from 60 to 15 nm for enhancing tumor penetration. Moreover, the RMT characteristics of HA ensured that HA@Ru NAs could specially enter CD44&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells, enhancing tumor&#8208;specific precision of phototherapy. Taken together these distinguishing characteristics, smart HA@Ru NAs successfully realized the relief of deep tumor hypoxia to improve the tumor&#8208;specific PDT.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of defects and charges on the colloidal

stabilization of graphene in water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mastering graphene preparation is an essential step to its integration into practical applications.For large&#8208;scale purposes, full graphite exfoliation appears as a suitable route for grapheneproduction. However, it requires overpowering attractive van der Waals forces demanding largeenergy input, with the risk of introducing defects in the material. This difficulty can beovercome by using graphite intercalation compounds (GIC) as starting material. The greaterinter&#8208;sheet separation in GICs (compared with graphite) allows the gentler exfoliation ofsoluble graphenide (reduced graphene) flakes. A solvent exchange strategy, accompanied bythe oxidation of graphenide to graphene, can be implemented to produce stable aqueousgraphene dispersions (Eau de graphene, EdG), which can be readily incorporated into manyprocesses or materials. In this work, we prove that electrostatic forces are responsible for thestability of fully exfoliated graphene in water, and explore the influence of the oxidation andsolvent exchange procedures on the quality and stability of the EdG. We show that the amountof defects in graphene is limited if graphenide oxidation is carried out before exposing thematerial to water, and that gas removal of water before the incorporation of pre&#8208;oxidizedgraphene is advantageous for the long&#8208;term stability of the EdG.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Detrimental Functional Groups in Conductive Additives Toward High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conductive additives are of great importance for the adequate utilization of active materials in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries by establishing conductive networks in the composite cathode. However, it usually causes severe interfacial side reactions with solid electrolytes, especially sulfide electrolytes, leading to sluggish ion transportation and accelerated performance degradation. Herein, a simple hydrogen thermal reduction process is proposed on a commonly used conductive additive Super P, which effectively removes the surface oxygen functional groups and weakens the interfacial side reactions with sulfide. With a small amount of 1 wt% reduced Super P, ASSLBs demonstrates a competitive capacity of 180.2 mAh g&#8208;1, which is much higher than the 130.8 mAh g&#8208;1 of untreated Super P. Impressively, reduced Super P based ASSLBs also exhibit a higher capacity retention of 81.8% than 64.6% of untreated Super P. The cathode interfacial chemical evolutions reveal that reduced Super P could effectively alleviate the side reactions of sulfide. Reduced Super P shows better reversible capacity compared to reduced carbon nanofiber with almost no loss of capacity retention, due to its more complete conductive network. Our results highlight the importance of oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups for conductive additives, lightening the prospect of low&#8208;cost 0D conductive additives for practical ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Transformations for the Construction of All&#8208;Carbon Quaternary Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric catalytic carbene reactions have been well documented in the last few decades for the expeditious assembly of chiral molecules with structural diversity. However, the enantioselective construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers remains a challenge in this area. In this review article, two types of asymmetric carbene reactions that beyond cyclopropanation, cyclopropenation, and B&#252;chner reaction, have been summarized for the construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers: 1) using carbene species as a 1C synthon that reacts with a trisubstituted prochiral center; 2) sequential installation of two different C&#8208;C bonds on the carbene position, which features a gem&#8208;difunctionalization reaction. Especially, the asymmetric metal carbene gem&#8208;dialkylation process, which has emerged as a practical and versatile method for the expeditious assembly of complex architectures from readily available chemical resources, is a complementary approach for the expeditious assembly of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiropyran&#8208;Based Photoisomerizable &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid for Membrane&#8208;Active Peptide Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoisomerizable peptides are promising drug candidates in photopharmacology. While azobenzene&#8208; and diarylethene&#8208;containing photoisomerizable peptides have already demonstrated their potential in this regard, reports on the use of spiropyrans to photoregulate bioactive peptides are still scarce. This work focuses on the design and synthesis of a spiropyran&#8208;derived amino acid, (S)&#8208;2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;(6&#180;&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1&#180;,3&#180;,3&#180;&#8208;trimethylspiro&#8208;[2H&#8208;1&#8208;benzopyran&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;indolin&#8208;6&#8208;yl])propanoic acid, which is suitable for the preparation of photoisomerizable peptides. The utility of this amino acid is demonstrated by incorporating it into the backbone of BP100, a known membrane&#8208;active peptide, and by examining the photoregulation of the membrane perturbation by the spiropyran&#8208;containing peptides. The toxicity of the peptides (against the plant cell line BY&#8208;2), their bacteriotoxicity (E. coli), and actin&#8211;auxin oscillator modulation ability were shown to be significantly dependent on the photoisomeric state of the spiropyran unit.</dc:description>

         <title>3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Ions Are Versatile Bioorthogonal Dipoles for Use in Cycloadditions with Cyclooctynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#8208;oxidopyridinium ions are water stable and soluble heteroaromatic betaines that behave as latent dipoles and undergo a wide variety of cycloadditions. Research into the cycloaddition reactions of 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums was spearheaded by Alan R. Katritzky and collaborators from the early 1970s until the late 1980s, but they have yet to be used for bioorthogonal applications. Herein we report that 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums can readily react with 4&#8208;dibenzocyclooctynol (DIBO), a common bioorthogonal handle, in a [3+2] cycloaddition. The mechanism was investigated by altering the electronics of the reaction by changing the substituent on the 5 position of the pyridinium. Electron&#8208;donating 5&#8208;substituents have been shown to significantly increase the rate of the reaction, with bimolecular rate constants ranging from 0.003 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1 with 5&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxidopyridinium to 1.07 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1 with 5&#8208;amino&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxidopyridinium. 3&#8208;oxidopyridiniums&#8217; appreciable cycloaddition rates and compatibility with bioorthogonally relevant environments give them the potential to be used in a variety of bioconjugation applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Specified Coupling Reactions of Nitroarenes by Heterogeneous Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being different from conventional reductive coupling reactions of nitroarenes, structurally modifiable heterogeneous cobalt catalysts reveal excellent performance in precise use of a single intermediate during the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of the nitroarenes. This concept would provide a novel direction for the efficient utilization of nitroaromatics in the manufacture of high&#8208;value products.







Abstract
The in&#8208;depth study on reduction&#8211;specified coupling reactions of the nitroarenes by heterogeneous cobalt catalysis opens a door for diversified syntheses of functional N&#8208;containing molecules. Guided by the structure&#8211;function relationship of heterogeneous materials, rational design of nano&#8211;catalysts can effectively regulate the routes of organic reactions. Precise transformation of the intermediates generated during the nitroarene reduction with a suitable nano&#8211;catalyst is a promising way to develop new tandem reactions, and to synthesize structurally novel compounds that are of difficult access with the conventional approaches.

         <title>Mechanochemical C&#8722;H Arylation and Alkylation of Indoles Using 3&#8201;d Transition Metal and Zero&#8208;Valent Magnesium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report our recent discovery of mechanochemical C&#8722;H arylation and alkylation reaction of indoles using 3&#8201;d transition metal (iron and cobalt) via online preparation of highly sensitive organomagnesium reagents. This method addresses the limitations of the 3&#8201;d transition&#8208;metal catalytic C&#8722;H functionalization, and provides an efficient, concise, and sustainable approach for this field.







Abstract
Although the 3&#8201;d transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization have been extensively employed to promote the formation of valuable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, the persistent problems, including the use of sensitive Grignard reagents and the rigorous operations (solvent&#8208;drying, inert gas protection, metal pre&#8208;activation and RMgX addition rate control), still leave great room for further development of sustainable methodologies. Herein, we report a mechanochemical technology toward in&#8208;situ preparation of highly sensitive organomagnesium reagents, and thus building two general 3&#8201;d transition&#8208;metal catalytic platforms that enables regioselective arylation and alkylation of indoles with a wide variety of halides (including those containing post transformable functionalities and heteroaromatic rings). This mechanochemical strategy also brings unique reactivity and high step&#8208;economy in producing functionalized N&#8208;free indole products.

         <title>Photopharmacology of Protease Inhibitors: Current Status and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No fear of the dark. Photopharmacology is an emerging technique in which bioactive molecules are turned on (or turned off) by means of light. This enables a spatial and temporal control of their activity. In this review, we discuss the progress of photopharmacology in the field protease inhibitors.







Abstract
Proteases are involved in many essential biological processes. Dysregulation of their activity underlies a wide variety of human diseases. Photopharmacology, as applied on various classes of proteins, has the potential to assist protease research by enabling spatiotemporal control of protease activity. Moreover, it may be used to decrease side&#8208;effects of protease&#8208;targeting drugs. In this review, we discuss the current status of the chemical design of photoactivatable proteases inhibitors and their biological application. Additionally, we give insight into future possibilities for further development of this field of research.

         <title>Organic Molecules Mimic Alkali Metals Enabling Spontaneous Harpoon Reactions with Halogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Octamethylcalix[4]pyrrole (omC4P) behaves like alkali metals and reacts with halogens (X) via the harpoon mechanism to form charge&#8208;separated omC4P+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;X&#8722; complexes.harpoon reactionlong range electron transferphotoelectron spectroscopy







Abstract
The harpoon mechanism has been a milestone in molecular reaction dynamics. Until now, the entity from which electron harpooning occurs has been either alkali metal atoms or non&#8208;metallic analogs in their excited states. In this work, we demonstrate that a common organic molecule, octamethylcalix[4] pyrrole (omC4P), behaves just like alkali metal atoms, enabling the formation of charge&#8208;separated ionic bonding complexes with halogens omC4P+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;X&#8722; (X=F&#8722;I, SCN) via the harpoon mechanism. Their electronic structures and chemical bonding were determined by cryogenic photoelectron spectroscopy of the corresponding anions and confirmed by theoretical analyses. The omC4P+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;X&#8722; could be visualized to form from the reactants omC4P+X via electron harpooning from omC4P to X at a distance defined by the energy difference between the ionization potential of omC4P and electron affinity of X.

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction by Urea Hangman Mn Terpyridine species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on our previous study in chemical subtleties of the  proton tunneling distance for metal hydride formation (PTD&#8208;MH) to regulate the selectivity of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), we have developed a family of Mn terpyridine derivatives, in which urea groups functioning as multipoint hydrogen&#8208;bonding hangman to accelerate the reaction rate. We found that such changes to the second coordination sphere significantly increased the turnover frequency (TOF) for CO2 reduction to ca. 360 s&#8208;1&#160;with this family of molecular catalysts while maintaining high selectivity (ca. 100% &#177; 3) for CO even in the presence of a large amount of phenol as proton source. Notably, the compounds studied in this manuscript all exhibit large value for CO&#160;as that achieved by Fe porphyrins derivates, while saving up to 0.55 V in overpotential with respect to the latter.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The construction of diverse and distinctive self&#8208;assembled structures in water, based on the control of the self&#8208;assembly processes of artificial small molecules, has received considerable attention in supramolecular chemistry. Cage&#8208;like perforated vesicles are distinctive and interesting self&#8208;assembled structures. However, the development of self&#8208;assembling molecules that can easily form perforated vesicles remains challenging. This paper reports a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly property of a 4&#8208;aminoquinoline (4&#8208;AQ)&#8208;based amphiphile with a tetra(ethylene glycol) chain, in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). This property allows to form perforated vesicles after heating at 80 &#176;C (&gt; LCST). The self&#8208;assembly process of the 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile can be controlled by heating at 80 &#176;C (&gt; LCST) or 60 &#176;C (&lt; LCST). After cooling to room temperature, the selective construction of the perforated vesicles and nanofibers was achieved from the same 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile. Furthermore, the perforated vesicles exhibited slow morphological transformation into intertwined&#8208;like nanofibers but were easily restored by brief heating above the LCST.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Investigation of a Soluble Distannene with no Trans&#8208;Bent Angle or Twisting in the Solid&#8208;State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By treating KSiiPr3 with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 the distannene Sn2(TIPS)4 (TIPS = iPr3Si) is formed in a metathesis reaction. The crystal structure analysis of Sn2(TIPS)4 reveals a planar arrangement of the substituents in the solid&#8208;state and hence the second planar alkene like distannene of its kind. Due to the TIPS substituents, Sn2(TIPS)4 is well soluble in all commonly used organic solvents, opening the door for various analytics and reactivity studies. Due to its stability in solution, various reactions can be performed such as cycloaddition reactions with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene (DMBD) and TMS&#8208;azide.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet Energy Transfer Mechanism in Copper Photocatalytic N&#8211; and O&#8211;Methylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methylation reactions are chemically simple but challenging to perform under mild and non&#8208;toxic conditions. A photochemical energy transfer strategy was merged with copper catalysis to enable fast reaction times of minutes and broad applicability to N&#8208;heterocycles, (hetero&#8208;)aromatic carboxylic acids, and drug&#8208;like molecules in high yields and good functional group tolerance. Detailed mechanistic investigations, using kinetic analysis, aprotic MS, UV/Vis, and luminescence quenching experiments revealed a triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanism between hypervalent iodine(III) reagents and readily available photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Lantern&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Cages (MOCs) by Protective Control of Ligand Exchange Rates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembling systems in nature display remarkable complexity with assemblies of different sub&#8208;units to generate functional species. Synthetic analogues of such systems are a challenge, often requiring the ability to bias distributions that are under thermodynamic assembly control. Using lantern&#8208;type MOCs (metal&#8208;organic cages) as a prototypical self&#8208;assembling system, herein we explore the role that steric bulk plays in controlling the exchange rate of ligands in paddlewheel&#8208;based assemblies, and thus the stability of cages, in competitive self&#8208;assembling scenarios. The effective lifetime of the lantern&#8208;type MOCs varies over an order of magnitude depending on the steric bulk proximal to the metal nodes with lifetimes of the cages ranging from tens of minutes to several hours. The bulk of the coordinating solvents likewise reduces the rate of ligand exchange, and thus yields longer&#8208;lived species. Understanding this subtle effect has implications for controlling the stability of complex assemblies in competitive environments with implications for guest release and application.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four donor&#8208;acceptor boron difluoride complexes based on the carbazole electron donor and the [1,3,5,2]oxadiazaborinino[3,4&#8208;a][1,8]naphthyridine acceptor were designed, synthesized, and systematically spectroscopically investigated in solutions, in dye&#8208;doped polymer films, and in the solid states. The dyes exhibit an intense blue to red solid&#8208;state emission with photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 59% in pure dye samples and 86% in poly(methyl methacrylate) films. All boron complexes show aggregation&#8208;induced emission and reversible mechanofluorochromism. The optical properties of these dyes and their solid state luminescence can be tuned by substitution pattern, i.e., the substituents at the naphthyridine unit. Exchange of CH3&#8208; for CF3&#8208;groups does not only increase the intramolecular charge transfer character, but also provides a crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Glycosylated Soluble Fas Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled cell death is essential for the regulation of the immune system and plays a role in pathogen defense. It is often altered in pathogenic conditions such as cancer, viral infections and autoimmune diseases. The Fas receptor and its corresponding membrane&#8208;bound ligand (FasL) are part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway activated in these cases. A soluble form of FasL (sFasL), produced by ectodomain shedding, displays a diverse but still elusive set of non&#8208;apoptotic functions and sometimes even serves as a pro&#8208;survival factor. To gather more knowledge about the characteristics of this protein and the impact N&#8208;glycosylations may have, access to homogeneous posttranslationally modified variants of sFasL is needed. Therefore, we developed a flexible strategy to obtain such homogeneously N&#8208;glycosylated variants of sFasL by applying chemical protein synthesis. This strategy can be flexibly combined with enzymatic methods to introduce more complex, site selective glycosylations.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Isolobal Relation between Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;NiP3 and White Phosphorus by Experimental Charge Density Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolobale principle as established by Hoffmann was tested in this work by the highest level of experimental charge density analysis. X&#8208;ray restrained wavefunction fitting as well as multipolar modelling showed in accord that [Ni]P3 is a suitable isolobale analogue to white phosphorus. The deep dive into its bonding analysis reveals insights about the differences in reactivity compared to P4.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth analysis of the description of bonding within Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P3 (Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcyclopentadienyl, [Ni]P3) employing X&#8208;ray diffraction based multipolar modeling, density functional theory (DFT) as well as an &#8220;experimental wavefunction&#8221; obtained from X&#8208;ray restrained wavefunction (XRW) fitting is presented. The results are compared to DFT calculations on white phosphorus &#8211; an isolobal analogue to [Ni]P3. A complementary bonding analysis shows insights into the reactivity of [Ni]P3. The isolobal principle is reflected in every aspect of our analysis and the employed methods seamlessly predict the differences in reactivity of [Ni]P3 and P4. Crystallographic modeling, solid&#8208;state NMR, and DFT calculations describe the dynamic behavior of the cyclo&#8208;P3 unit in the title molecule.

         <title>Structure and Photophysics of N&#8208;Tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines and their Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysics of a series of N&#8208;tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines with O, S, Se, and Te heteroatoms is strongly structure&#8208;dependent. Time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy and DFT calculations indicate that the O and S dyads possess a pseudo&#8208;equatorial structure and the lowest energy excited singlet state has charge&#8208;transfer character, but the Se and Te dyads possess pseudo&#8208;axial structure and a tolan localised excited state.







Abstract
The study focuses on the structural and photophysical characteristics of neutral and oxidized forms of N&#8208;tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines PZX&#8208;tolan with X=O, S, Se, and Te. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses show a pseudo&#8208;equatorial (pe) structure of the tolan substituent in the O, S, and Se dyads, while the Te dyad possesses a pseudo&#8208;axial (pa) structure. DFT calculations suggest the pe structure for O and S, and the pa structure for Se and Te as stable forms. Steady&#8208;state and femtosecond&#8208;time resolved optical spectroscopy in toluene solution indicate that the O and S dyads emit from a CT state, whereas the Se and Te dyads emit from a tolan&#8208;localized state. The T1 state is tolan&#8208;localized in all cases, showing phosphorescence at 77&#8197;K. The heavy atom effect of chalcogens induces intersystem crossing from S1 to Tx, resulting in a decreasing S1 lifetime from 2.1&#8197;ns to 0.42&#8197;ps. The T1 states possess potential for singlet oxygen sensitization with a high quantum yield (ca. 40&#8201;%) for the O, S, and Se dyads. Radical cations exhibit spin density primarily localized at the heterocycle. EPR measurements and quasirelativistic DFT calculations reveal a very strong g&#8208;tensor anisotropy, supporting the pe structure for the S and Se derivatives.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aliphatic Amines with Alkylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the Cu&#8208;catalysed coupling of alkylboronic esters and aliphatic amines. This mild method is functional group tolerant, and uses O2 from air as the terminal oxidant. Investigation into the mechanism suggest that the boronic ester reacts with an aminyl radical, formed in&#8197;situ, to generate an alkyl radical intermediate.







Abstract
We report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling of aliphatic amines with benzylic and aliphatic boronic esters to give high value alkyl amines, products found widely in applications from medicinal chemistry to materials science. This operationally simple reaction, which can be performed on gram scale, runs under mild conditions and exhibits broad functional group tolerance. The terminal oxidant of the reaction is O2 from the air, avoiding the need for additional chemical oxidants. Investigation into the reaction mechanism suggests that the boronic ester is activated by an aminyl radical, formed through oxidation of the amine by the Cu catalyst, to give a key alkyl radical intermediate. To demonstrate its utility and potential for late&#8208;stage functionalization, we showcase the method as the final step in the total synthesis of a TRPV1 antagonist.

         <title>Sniffing Out the Sustainable Future: The Renewability Revolution in Fragrance Chemistry**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this review, the impact of the transition from today&#8217;s petrochemical economy towards a 100/100 renewable and biodegradable future is discussed: &#8220;citrus&#8221;, &#8220;green&#8221;, &#8220;fruity&#8221;, &#8220;floral&#8221;, &#8220;floriental&#8221;, &#8220;oriental&#8221;, &#8220;woody&#8221;, &#8220;chypre&#8221; and &#8220;foug&#232;re&#8221;. After benchmark data on ingredients usage, definitions on biodegradation and sustainability are given. Celebrating the 150th anniversary of svanillin, its historic synthesis from renewable starting materials serves as introduction. Citrus scents upcycled from the beverages industry are already an ideal case for 100/100 with new opportunities for artificial essential oils. In the fruity domain, transparent and lactonic ingredients are available in a sustainable manner. In the domain of green odorants, there is a lack of green chemistry for important key materials. In the floral family, renewability is more critical than biodegradability, but cost is an issue. Thanks to Ambrox and maltol, florientals and orientals will persist, while woody notes severely lack an Iso E Super replacer. In the chypre genre, patchouli became the new moss, but more musks are increasingly in demand. With their high percentage of linalool and dihydromyrcenol, the construction of foug&#232;res could well become a precedent for other families, despite challenges in vetiver and salicylates. Still, the challenges exemplified create immense opportunities for new perfumery materials</dc:description>
