         <title>Zinc Sensing with a Pyridine&#8208;Based Lanthanide Contrast Agent: Structural Analysis in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original paramagnetic probe was developed, whose Magnetic Resonance Imaging efficacy is modified upon Zn2+ complexation. A combination of NMR, DFT and luminescence studies shows that these changes are due to a modification of the Gd3+ coordination sphere. The complex exhibits high selectivity for Zn2+ over other physiological cations.







Abstract
Zinc is an important physiological cation, and its misregulation is implicated in various diseases. It is therefore important to be able to image zinc by non&#8208;invasive methods such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In this work, we have successfully synthesized a novel Gd3+&#8208;based complex specifically for Zn2+ sensing by MRI. Using a combination of NMR, luminescence, potentiometric, and relaxivity experiments, completed with DFT calculations, we demonstrate that incorporating a short linker between the Zn2+ sensing unit and the Gd3+ complex leads to unique behavior of the system in the absence of Zn2+. A significant increase in efficacy of the system is observed upon Zn2+ binding, and importantly, the complex is highly selective for Zn2+ relative to other physiological cations. A comprehensive structural study reliably determines the microscopic parameters at the origin of the Zn2+ response, primarily an increase in the number of water molecules directly coordinated to Gd3+ upon Zn2+ binding. Crucially, the system maintains a strong response to Zn2+ binding in the presence of Human Serum Albumin, highlighting its potential for biological applications.

         <title>Mechanically Adaptive Materials Based on Dynamic Chemical Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanically adaptive polymers (MAPs) can regulate mechanical properties in response to external stimuli or environmental changes. Utilizing dynamic chemical bonds to construct polymer networks presents an effective and preferential strategy in designing MAPs for various practical applications. This review primarily focuses on the recent advancements in the fabrication, mechanisms, and functions of MAPs based on dynamic bonds.







Abstract
Adaptiveness is an important feature for biological creatures to survive and interact with variable environments. Mechanically adaptive polymers (MAPs), which have been developed recently inspired by this adaptive nature, can regulate their mechanical properties in response to external stimuli or environmental changes. Specifically, MAPs based on dynamic chemical bonds have been synthesized and reported as an emerging material because of the intrinsic self&#8208;adaptability, outstanding mechanical properties and durable applications. This review primarily focuses on the recent advancements in the fabrication of MAPs through the utilization of dynamic covalent bonds and non&#8208;covalent bonds. A comprehensive summary of the methodologies and mechanisms employed to attain high energy dissipation in MAPs is provided. Subsequently, the review offers incisive analyses of the intrinsic functionalities of MAPs, such as high impact&#8208;stiffening, damping, and buffering capabilities. Finally, the developmental achievements within this domain are recapitulated, the potential challenges, and future research perspectives in MAPs are deliberated.

         <title>Development of Chiral&#8208;At&#8208;Ruthenium Mesoionic Carbene Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces C&#8322;&#8208;symmetric chiral ruthenium complexes featuring &#963;&#8208;donating 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene mesoionic carbene (MIC) ligands. These new class of complexes exhibit excellent catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in nitrene&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;closing C(sp3)&#8722;H amination reactions. Notably, they eliminate the need for phosphine co&#8208;catalysts and enhance electron density at the ruthenium center, offering potential advancements in ruthenium&#8208;based chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalysis.







Abstract
Building on our previously established chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal approach, in which the overall chirality of the transition metal catalyst is solely determined by a stereogenic metal center, we here present a new addition to the family of C2&#8208;symmetric chiral&#8208;at&#8208;ruthenium catalysts. These are C2&#8208;symmetric chiral ruthenium complexes featuring strongly &#963;&#8208;donating 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene mesoionic carbene (MIC) ligands. The complexes demonstrate excellent catalytic activity and enantioselectivity in a nitrene&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;closing C(sp3)&#8722;H amination of an aliphatic azide, leading to the formation of an N&#8208;Boc&#8208;protected chiral pyrrolidine. This study highlights the potential of this new class of chiral mesoionic carbene ruthenium complexes to further enhance or modify the reactivity of ruthenium&#8208;based chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal catalysts.

         <title>Poly(1,3&#8208;Dioxolane)&#8208;Modified Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 as the Electrolyte for Enhanced Solid Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ploy(1,3&#8208;dioxolane) (PDOL) layer was constructed by a Al(OTf)3&#8208;induced in&#8208;situ solidification process between the interface of LATP and anode/cathode. The as&#8208;prepared PDOL as an &#8220;interfacial adhesive&#8221; can fill the gap between the LATP and the electrode, providing a better interfacial contact and reduced interfacial impedance. Such interfacial adhesive layer not only effectively prevents Li metal from reducing LATP but also provides intimate interface contact and limits unnecessary electron transport.







Abstract
Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP) as the solid&#8208;electrolyte has attracted much attention for Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, the unstable LATP/Li interface and the insufficient contact between the anode/cathode and LATP usually lead to the structural collapse of LATP and the large solid&#8211;solid interfacial resistance for Li+ transport. Herein, a poly(1,3&#8208;dioxolane) (PDOL) adhesive layer was constructed by a Al(OTf)3&#8208;induced in&#8208;situ solidification process between the interface of LATP and anode/cathode. Such PDOL interfacial adhesive layer alleviates adverse reduction reactions at the LATP/Li interface and provides stable and well&#8208;contacted bilateral electrode interfaces. Benefitting from the PDOL interfacial adhesive, the Li|adhesive&#8208;LATP|Li symmetric cells achieve a current density up to 0.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibit a good cycling stability for more than 2750&#8197;h at 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Li|adhesive&#8208;LATP|LiFePO4 solid&#8208;state batteries with interface modification exhibit a capacity of 158&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C with a retention of 94&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Fluorinated Macrocycle for Adsorptive Separation and Chromatographic Separation of Toluene and Methylcyclohexane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving both chromatographic separation and adsorptive separation using a single material is a highly desirable goal. Herein, this study describes a fluorinated macrocycle 4FTP3 to realize the adsorptive separation of toluene from a toluene/methylcyclohexane mixture with a purity of 99.3&#8201;% in a single adsorption cycle. Additionally, the use of 4FTP3 as a gas chromatographic stationary phase permitted the high&#8208;resolution separation of a toluene/methylcyclohexane mixture.







Abstract
Achieving the adsorptive separation and chromatographic separation of industrially the important chemicals toluene and methylcyclohexane using the same material is a highly desirable goal. We have successfully accomplished this using a fluorinated macrocycle tetrafluoroterphen[3]arene (4FTP3), which was synthesized and used for gas chromatographic separation in our previous work. The macrocycle 4FTP3 permitted the adsorptive separation of toluene from a toluene/methylcyclohexane mixture (1&#8201;:&#8201;1, v/v) with a purity of 99.3&#8201;% in a single adsorption cycle. Additionally, the use of 4FTP3 as a gas chromatographic stationary phase permitted the high&#8208;resolution separation of a toluene/methylcyclohexane mixture, with a retention capacity decreasing in the order of: toluene&gt;methylcyclohexane. Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis revealed that the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interactions between 4FTP3 and toluene resulted in an enhanced binding affinity, association enthalpy, and longer retention time for toluene. This macrocycle is of particular interest for use as a separation material due to its simultaneous adsorptive separation and gas chromatographic separation of toluene/methylcyclohexane. The present fluorinated macrocycle may therefore have roles to play in both analytical science and the chemical industry.

         <title>Hydride Rebound: A Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP)&#8208;Type Cooperative Mechanism for H2 Activation by a Potassium Aluminyl Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydrogen activation by the potassium&#8208;bridged aluminyl K2[Al(NON)]2 occurs via a frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;type rebound mechanism. The potassium ions play explicit roles in stabilizing a nascent 2&#8208;bridging hydride. The cooperative action of both K+ and Al metal centres significantly reduce the barrier for this process as compared to concerted oxidative addition.







Abstract
Combining experiment and theory, the mechanisms of H2 activation by the potassium&#8208;bridged aluminyl dimer K2[Al(NON)]2 (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) and its monomeric K+&#8208;sequestered counterpart have been investigated. These systems show diverging reactivity towards the activation of dihydrogen, with the dimeric species undergoing formal oxidative addition of H2 at each Al centre under ambient conditions, and the monomer proving to be inert to dihydrogen addition. Noting that this K+ dependence is inconsistent with classical models of single&#8208;centre reactivity for carbene&#8208;like Al(I) species, we rationalize these observations instead by a cooperative frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;type mechanism (for the dimer) in which the aluminium centre acts as the Lewis base and the K+ centres as Lewis acids. In contrast to previous theoretical work on this precise system by Schaefer and co&#8208;workers, the potassium ions are shown to play explicit roles in stabilizing a nascent 2&#8208;bridging hydride, formed by heterolytic H&#8722;H bond cleavage (with accompanying protonation of the aluminium&#8208;centred lone pair). K&#8208;to&#8208;Al hydride &#8220;rebound&#8221; into the vacant aluminium&#8208;centred p&#8208;orbital then completes the net addition of H2 via sequential H+/H&#8722; transfer. The experimentally determined kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD=2.6) reflects a high degree of bond activation in the transition state (as predicted quantum chemically).

         <title>Reactions of Tertiary Aliphatic Cations with Silylated Alkynes: Substitution, Cyclization and Unexpected C&#8722;H Activation Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capozzi's pioneering reaction involving tertiary aliphatic cations and silylated alkynes in 1982 laid the groundwork for an innovative solution to aliphatic&#8208;alkyne coupling. Building on this, our study systematically explored reaction conditions, broadening its applicability to diverse functional groups. Notably, we observed high diastereoselectivities and an unexpected C&#8722;H activation, yielding a cyclooctane&#8208;fused cyclobutene, further expanding the utility of this reaction.







Abstract
Capozzi's groundbreaking work in 1982 introduced a fascinating reaction involving highly reactive tertiary aliphatic cations and silylated alkynes. This reaction provided an innovative solution to the challenge of coupling a fully substituted tertiary aliphatic fragment with an alkyne moiety. Building upon Capozzi's pioneering efforts, we started an extensive exploration of reaction conditions to expand the initial scope of this reaction. Through meticulous control of the reaction parameters, we uncovered conditions capable of accommodating various functional groups, thereby enhancing the reaction&#8216;s applicability. Intriguingly, our study revealed remarkably high diastereoselectivities for substrates with substitution in the &#945;&#8208;position. Additionally, we made an unexpected discovery: an intriguing C&#8722;H activation of a cyclooctane ring furnishing a cyclooctane&#8208;fused cyclobutene. These findings not only extend the utility of Capozzi's original concept but also underscore the potential of highly reactive cations in modern organic C&#8722;H activation reactions.

         <title>Selenium Nucleophilicity and Electrophilicity in the Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular SN2 Reactions of Selenenyl Sulfide Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogenol&#8208;dichalcogenide exchange reactions of linear and cyclic dichalcogenides are investigated in silico to gain insight into their relative rates. The unveiled role of double exchange reactions in the chemistry of RX1, a selenenyl sulfide TrxR1 probe, explains the origin of its specificity even under high&#8208;thiol concentrations and provides hints to design new selective TrxR1 probes.







Abstract
Chalcogenide exchange reactions are an important class of bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions (SN2) involving sulfur and selenium species as nucleophile, central atom, and/or leaving group, which are fundamental throughout redox biology and metabolism. While thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange reactions have been deeply investigated, those involving selenium are less understood, especially with regards to the polarised selenenyl sulfides RSe&#8211;SR&#8217;. This functional group, which is fundamental in the biochemistry of glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase enzymes, was recently incorporated in the molecular scaffold of a TrxR1 specific probe, &#8220;RX1&#8221;. Here, we investigate the SN2@S and SN2@Se reactions of selenenyl sulfides in silico to provide the first comprehensive overview of their kinetic and thermodynamic trends, referencing against symmetrical disulfides and diselenides. Then, the role of SN2@S and SN2@Se reactions in RX1 chemistry is explored, and a mechanistic picture of its biological chemistry is provided. Additionally, we quantify the role of alternative exchange reactions in the double&#8208;exchange chemistry of RX1. This analysis rationalises the origins of RX1&#8217;s TrxR&#8208;specificity even within thiol&#8208;rich cellular environments and can support the design and applications of a range of selenenyl sulfide&#8208;based bioactive probes. Particularly, we observe that the intramolecular SN2@Se reaction which restores RX1 ground state is an effective protective mechanism against unspecific activation by thiols, explaining its capacity to work in high&#8208;thiol concentration.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;based Photocatalysis: From Fundamental Principles to Applications in the Generation of C&#8722;X (X=C, O, N, H, Si) Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a fundamental aspect of cobalt&#8208;based photocatalysis with reference to its different working mechanisms with and without external photocatalyst, in detail. Recent advances in this field over a span of last six years have been discussed along with the strategies for such reactions and the existing challenges.







Abstract
Over the past few decades, the merger of photocatalysis and transition metal&#8208;based catalysis or self&#8208;photoexcitation of transition metals has emerged as a useful tool in organic transformations. In this context, cobalt&#8208;based systems have attracted significant attention as sustainable alternatives to the widely explored platinum group heavy metals (iridium, rhodium, ruthenium) for photocatalytic chemical transformations. This review encompasses the basic types of cobalt&#8208;based homogeneous photocatalytic systems, their working principles, and the recent developments (2018&#8208;2024) in C&#8722;X (X=C, N, O, H, Si) bond formations. Noteworthy to mention that cobalt&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalysis is beyond the scope of the present review. An elaborate presentation on the mechanistic intricacies of cobalt&#8208;based photocatalysis, without any external photocatalyst, and cobalt&#8208;based dual organophotoredox catalysis have been provided in this comprehensive review, excluding the dual&#8208;metal photoredox catalysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only contemporary review encompassing the aforementioned two major types of cobalt&#8208;based photocatalysis, in general synthetic chemistry, covering all types of C&#8722;X bond formations spanning a range of the last six years.

         <title>Development of a Highly Selective Synthesis of 4&#8211;Substituted Tetrahydroquinolines: Substrate Scope and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a general and selective deprotonation functionalization reaction of tetrahydroquinolines at the 4&#8211;position using organolithiums and phosphoramide ligands. In addition to the development of a direct deprotonation alkylation reaction with primary and secondary alkyl halides, a Negishi cross&#8211;coupling protocol was realized to afford products with a range of aromatic halides. These methods were applied to the late&#8208;stage installation of tetrahydroquinolines into a variety of substrates including pharmaceuticals as well as natural product analogues. The use of thorough mechanistic investigations revealed the aggregation state of the newly formed tetrahydroquinoline anion to be a separated ion pair, which proved critical to optimizing the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Halogen Substitution on the Regioselective Deiodination of Thyroid Hormone Analogues by Deiodinase Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The deiodination of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) by the three isoforms of selenium&#8208;containing iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs) is an important process in the human body for the maintenance of the thyroid hormone homeostasis. Selenium compounds are known to mimic the function of DIO3 by catalyzing the 5&#8208;deiodination of T4 and a co&#8208;operative halogen and chalcogen bonding is responsible for their activity. The substitution of 4'&#8208;OH group of T4 by an electron withdrawing group not only alters the reactivity but also changes the regioselectivity of deiodination. However, the effect of other halogen atoms (F, Cl or Br) in place of iodine in T4 on the regioselectivity has not been explored. In this paper, we describe simple synthetic methodologies toward various halogen analogues of T4. We also show that 2D NMR spectroscopy can be used as a powerful tool to identify the location of various halogen substitutions on the phenolic or tyrosyl rings. The deiodination experiments with peri&#8208;substituted naphthalene diselenol reveal that the regioselectivity or specificity towards iodine atom is not altered upon introduction of more electronegative halogen atoms (F, Cl and Br), reinforcing the concept of halogen bonding in the deiodination reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear Dysprosium Compounds: The Importance of Rigid Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipolar vs exchange coupling in bis&#8208;fluorido and peroxido bridged dinuclear Dy complexes lead to ferro vs antiferromagnetic coupling with consequences for the magnetic dynamics. The peroxide&#8208;bridged compound is a rare of example of the direct addition of hydrogen peroxide and significantly outperforms the bis&#8208;fluorido bridged analogue as a result of the reduction of vibrational freedom through the rigidity of the bridge.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, structures and magnetic behaviour of two isostructural dinuclear Dy3+ complexes where the metal ions of a previously reported monomeric building block are connected by a peroxide (O22&#8722;) or a pair of fluoride (2&#215;F&#8722;) bridges. The nature of the bridge determines the distance between the metal ion dipoles leading to a dipolar coupling in the peroxido bridged compound of only ca. 70&#8201;% of that in the bis&#8208;fluorido bridged dimer. The sign of the overall coupling between the metals is antiferromagnetic for the peroxido bridged compound and ferromagnetic for the bis&#8208;fluorido bridged complex. This in turn influences the magnetisation dynamics. We compare the relaxation characteristics of the dimers with those of the previously reported monomeric building block. The relaxation dynamics for the bis&#8208;fluorido system are very fast. On the other hand, comparing the properties of the monomer, the peroxido bridged sample and the corresponding Y&#8208;doped sample show that the relaxation properties via a Raman process have very similar parameters. We show that a second dysprosium is important for either tuning or detuning the Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) properties of a system.

         <title>Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Scintillators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray scintillators have recently garnered considerable attention due to their indispensable roles in radiation detection, safety inspection, therapy, and medical imaging. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the development of high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators, focusing innovations driven by molecular engineering approaches.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray scintillators, materials that convert high&#8208;energy radiation into detectable light in the ultraviolet to visible spectrum, are widely used in industrial and medical applications. Organic and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid systems have emerged as promising alternatives for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging due to their mechanical flexibility, lightweight, tunable excited states, and solution processability for large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, these systems often suffer from weak X&#8208;ray absorption and insufficient exciton utilization, which seriously affects their scintillation performance, limiting their potential for broader application and commercialization. This review highlights recent advances in molecular engineering for developing high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators. It focuses on molecular design principles, such as the heavy atom effect, donor&#8208;acceptor/host&#8208;guest strategies, hydrogen/halogen bonding, molecular sensitization, and crystal packing, for enhancing scintillation performance. By leveraging these approaches, researchers have made significant strides in improving X&#8208;ray scintillation efficiency and advancing the potential of these materials for commercial applications.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article explores the advancements and challenges in utilizing coordination cages and their confinement effects to further the development of polyoxometalates (POMs). It reviews supramolecular approaches through examples of host&#8208;guest encapsulation and cavity&#8208;directed synthesis, highlights their applications, and presents future perspectives for the field.







Abstract
The confinement effects within coordination cages present powerful tools in modern chemistry, particularly for the synthesis and manipulation of complex molecules. This concept article reviews the use of coordination cages to stabilize and tune the properties of polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of nano&#8208;sized metallic clusters, expanding the focus beyond traditional organic reactions. The article provides a brief overview of coordination cages, POM chemistry and discusses the encapsulation of POMs in coordination cages, highlighting how these cages provide a confinement effect that enhances the stability and reactivity of POMs. Additionally, the concept of cavity&#8208;directed synthesis is explored as a method for creating labile POMs, which are often unstable in aqueous conditions, underlining its implications for supramolecular catalysis. Future research will focus on expanding the structures and applications of encapsulated POMs, as well as improving cage designs to unlock new cluster architectures.

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Nanocomposite Au@Graphene Oxide Continuous Flow Synthesis in Water for Degradation of Organic Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free&#8208;standing gold nanoparticle decorated graphene oxide (Au@GO) rapidly forms in aqueous auric acid under continuous flow using a vortex fluidic device (VFD), as a photo&#8208;contact electrification process in the rapidly rotating tilted VFD tube under 254&#8197;nm UV irradiation, with Au@GO rapidly catalysing the degradation of organic dyes by excess in&#8197;situ generated hydrogen peroxide.







Abstract
We have developed a rapid and facile method for preparing free&#8208;standing nanocomposite of gold nanoparticles with graphene oxide (Au@GO) in water under continuous flow in the absence of harsh reducing agents and any other auxiliary substances, as a method with favourable green chemistry metrics. This uses a vortex fluidic device (VFD) where induced mechanical energy and photo&#8208;contact electrification associated with the dynamic thin film in the rapidly rotating tube tilted at 45&#176; while simultaneously UV irradiated (&#955;=254&#8197;nm, 20&#8197;W) results in decomposition of water to hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide with growth of the gold nanoparticles on the surface of the GO. We have established that the resulting Au@GO composite sheets rapidly catalyse the degradation of commercial dyes like methyl orange (MO) and methylene blue (MB) using the hydrogen peroxide generated in&#8197;situ in the VFD. This process relies on active radicals generated through liquid&#8208;solid photo&#8208;contact electrification of water in the VFD which dramatically minimises the generation of waste in industrial applications, with the reaction having implications for wastewater treatment.

         <title>Morphological Evolution of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks into Hedrite, Sheaf and Spherulite Superstructures with Localized Different Coloration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hyperbranched metal&#8208;organic superstructures reported here exhibit diverse morphologies, including hedrites, sheafs, and spherulites. These structures are formed via non&#8208;crystallographic branching, which represents a distinct growth mechanism typically observed in many materials and is being reported for the first time in metal&#8208;organic frameworks.







Abstract
The branched metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are the first superstructures of this kind, and the growth mechanism may explain crystal shapes of other materials. The mechanism of the formation of fascinating structures having a hedrite, sheaf or spherulite appearance are detailed. The branching can be controlled, resulting in crystals that either exhibit multiple generations of branching or a single generation. These structures might result from an increasing number of defects on fast&#8208;grown rods. As the basal facets become less reactive, material is added to the prism facets, leading to secondary nucleation and triangular branches. These triangular structures are connected to the rod surface, growing longer than the central rod. Electron diffraction analyses show that the sheafs are polycrystalline structures with their fantails consisting of single&#8208;crystalline nanorods deviating gradually from each other in their orientation. The crystallographic structure consists of channels with opposite handedness. The accessibility of the nanochannels and the porosity of the superstructures are demonstrated by chromophore diffusion into the channels. The confinement and alignment of the chromophores inside the channels resulted in polarized&#8208;light dependent coloration of the crystals; the polycrystallinity generated areas having different optical properties.

         <title>One&#8208;Electron NO to N2O Pathways via Heme Models and Lewis Acid: Metal Effects and Differences from the Enzymatic Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to native nitric oxide reductases using a two&#8208;electron process, Fe and Co hemes, activated by BF3, were recently found to effect this reaction with one electron. Our mechanistic study revealed their complete reaction pathways and advantageous reactivity origins of Fe heme compared to Co and the native pathway.







Abstract
Some pathogens use heme&#8208;containing nitric oxide reductases (NORs) to reduce NO to N2O as their defense mechanism to detoxify NO and reduce nitrosative stress. This reduction is also significant in the global N cycle. Our previous experimental work showed that Fe and Co porphyrin NO complexes can couple with external NO to form N2O when activated by the Lewis acid BF3. A key difference from conventional two&#8208;electron enzymatic reaction is that one electron is sufficient. However, a complete understanding of the entire reaction pathways and the more favorable reactivity for Fe remains unknown. Here, we present a quantum chemical study to provide such information. Our results confirmed Fe's higher experimental reactivity, showing advantages in all steps of the reaction pathway: easier metal oxidation for NO reduction and N&#8722;O cleavage as well as a larger size to expedite the N/O coordination mode transition. The Co system, with a similar product energy as the enzyme, shows potential for further development in catalytic NO coupling. This work also offers the first evidence that this new one&#8208;electron NO reduction is both kinetically competitive and thermodynamically more favorable than the native pathway, supporting future initiatives in optimizing NO reduction agents in biology, environment, and industry.

         <title>Quantum&#8208;Classical Simulations Reveal the Photoisomerization Mechanism of a Prototypical First&#8208;Generation Molecular Motor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that in a prototypical alkene&#8208;based first&#8208;generation molecular motor efficient forward photoisomerization is achieved through a slow picosecond&#8208;timescale excited&#8208;state decay, which only takes place from a largely twisted dark minimum, far from any conical&#8208;intersection point. After relaxation to the ground state, it is the topography of the potential energy surface, controlled by the conformation of the central cyclopentene rings, which mainly determines the high yields of forward photoisomerization in our investigated motor.







Abstract
Light&#8208;driven molecular rotary motors convert the energy of absorbed light into unidirectional rotational motion and are key components in the design of molecular machines. The archetypal class of light&#8208;driven rotary motors is chiral overcrowded alkenes, where the rotational movement is achieved through consecutive cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization reactions and thermal helix inversion steps. While the thermal steps have been rather well understood by now, our understanding of the photoisomerization reactions of overcrowded alkene&#8208;based motors still misses key points that would explain the striking differences in operation efficiency of the known systems. Here, we employ quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the excited&#8208;state decay and photoisomerization mechanism in a prototypical alkene&#8208;based first&#8208;generation rotary motor. We show that the initially excited bright state undergoes an ultrafast relaxation to multiple excited&#8208;state minima separated by low energy barriers and reveal a slow picosecond&#8208;timescale decay to the ground state, which only occurs from a largely twisted dark excited&#8208;state minimum, far from any conical&#8208;intersection point. Additionally, we attribute the origin of the high yields of forward photoisomerization in our investigated motor to the favorable topography of the ground&#8208;state potential energy surface, which is controlled by the conformation of the central cyclopentene rings.

         <title>Construction of Luminescent Terpyridine&#8208;Based Metallo&#8208;Bowties with Alkyl Chain&#8208;Bridged Dimerized Building Blocks</title>

         <dc:description>
Luminescent terpyridine (TPY)&#8208;based metallo&#8208;bowties were constructed using a flexible alkyl chain to bridge TPY building blocks, offering a novel alternative to the conventional &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. The introduction of alkyl chain guides the self&#8208;assembly into well&#8208;defined metallo&#8208;bowties while simultaneously eliminating the quenching effects commonly associated with the &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. This approach provides a versatile platform for the design and construction of complex metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures with desired optical properties.







Abstract
Numerous metallo&#8208;supramolecules with well&#8208;defined sizes and shapes have been successfully constructed via the strong coordination interaction between terpyridine (TPY) moieties and ruthenium cations. However, the pseudo&#8208;octahedral geometry of &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; unit hampers the luminescent properties of such metallo&#8208;architectures, thus limiting their applications as optical materials. To address this issue, we herein use a flexible alkyl chain to bridge TPY building blocks, replacing conventional &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. The introduction of alkyl chain guides the self&#8208;assembly into desired architecture while simultaneously eliminating the quenching effects typically associated with the &lt;TPY&#8208;Ru&#8208;TPY&gt; linkage. More importantly, this design strategy enables the precise construction of bowtie&#8208;shaped metallo&#8208;supramolecules with significantly enhanced emission. The incorporation of alkyl chain linkage not only maintains structural integrity but also enhances optical performance, making these metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies highly promising for applications in advanced photonic and luminescent materials. This study offers a versatile approach to construct complex metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures with desired optical properties.

         <title>TiO2&#8208;Phase&#8208;Mediated Size Effect of Rh Nanoparticles on Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective regulation of Rh nanoparticle size by crystal phase engineering of TiO2 facilitates the adsorption and activation of CO2 on the surface of catalysts, resulting in excellent CO2 hydrogenation activity.







Abstract
Photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation on TiO2&#8208;based catalysts has drawn extensive attention. However, few reports have focused on the impact of particle size of the active sites by altering TiO2 crystal phase on the CO2 hydrogenation activity. Herein, we successfully regulated Rh nanoparticle size by adjusting the crystal phases of TiO2 at different calcination temperatures and obtained impressive photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation performance. Notably, the anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 loaded with Rh nanoparticles achieved a CH4 production rate of 2.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1 with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity and a single&#8208;pass CO2 conversion rate of 69.4&#8201;%. Given the anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 is more favorable for the presence of surface hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies, which can facilitate the distribution of Rh cations, Rh nanoparticles on the anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 exhibited the smallest sizes. Small Rh particle size further enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation, leading to high photothermal CO2 hydrogenation performance. Furthermore, the optimized Rh nanoparticle&#8208;loaded anatase&#8208;phase TiO2 catalyst exhibited high structural stability and resistance to coke accumulation, maintaining stability during long&#8208;term performance tests. This work investigated the particle size effect of active sites adjusted by crystal phase of light&#8208;harvesting materials on the photothermal catalytic performance, providing guidance for the preparation of effective catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to CH4.

         <title>H&#169;Li4Au4&#8722;: Planar Tetracoordinate Hydrogen in an Electrostatic Interaction Dominated Superhalogen Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>

The star D4h H&#169;Li4Au4&#8722; superhalogen anion with a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen (ptH) center was designed. The electrostatic interactions dominate the stability of the ptH, while the contribution of multicenter covalent bonds is limited.







Abstract
Planar hypercoordination has intrigued researchers for decades, yet hydrogen remained absent from this category until recently. Despite some advancements, further exploration of the emerging field of planar hypercoordinate hydrogen chemistry is still necessary. Herein, we report a D4h symmetric H&#169;Li4Au4&#8722; cluster containing a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen (ptH) center. Both density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio calculations revealed that designed H&#169;Li4Au4&#8722; is a real global minimum. Meanwhile, it also possesses excellent dynamic stability. This stability is dominated by electrostatic interactions, and reinforced by multicenter covalent bonds rather than any aromaticity. Interestingly, it is the first superhalogen anion in the ptH cluster and is expected to experimental synthesis and characterization.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Coreactants Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One plus one is greater than two: A remarkable electrochemiluminescence (ECL) enhancement of Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA is observed by introducing another coreactant, TEOA, with a 10.8&#8208;fold increase of ECL intensity and 1.7&#8208;fold extension of ECL layer. The enhancement was interpreted by a chemical oxidation route, in which TEOA+&#8901; acts as an enhancer to produce more TPrA+&#8901; and meanwhile allow the remote formation of TPrA+&#8901;. This dual&#8208;coreactants strategy works not only in solution with freely diffusive Ru(bpy)32+ but also on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;functionalized microbeads, showing promise in ECL&#8208;based bioassay and microscopy.







Abstract
The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of ruthenium(II) tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl) (Ru(bpy)32+) with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) as the good coreactant can be unexpectedly enhanced by a weak coreactant, such as triethanolamine (TEOA). First, the intensity of ECL emitted by Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA can be remarkably amplified by 10.8&#8208;fold after adding some amount of TEOA. Moreover, the ECL layer thickness, measured by self&#8208;interference spectroscopy, is also doubled. The enhancement far exceeding the superposition of respective contribution of TPrA and TEOA was elucidated by a &#8220;chemical oxidation mechanism&#8221;, in which TEOA+&#8901; acts as a chemical enhancer to oxidize TPrA in solution and to accelerate significantly the ECL reaction kinetics. This mechanism was proved by single&#8208;photon counting experiment and finite element simulations. In addition, the dual&#8208;coreactants strategy works well not only in solution with freely diffusive Ru(bpy)32+, but also on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;functionalized microbeads, suggesting that ethanolamines could act as cheap, easily available and low&#8208;background enhancers for ECL&#8208;based bioanalysis and microscopy.

         <title>Development of a Synthetic Platform for Ent&#8208;Pimaranes Reveals their Potential as Novel Non&#8208;Redox Active Ferroptosis Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full account of five distinct synthetic strategies towards a subfamily of ent&#8208;pimaranes is given. Highlights include radical and cationic polyene cyclizations for construction of the tricyclic core. Valuable insights from unsuccessful approaches informed the final route, which culminated in the enantioselective synthesis of eight ent&#8208;pimaranes. Biological investigations identified ent&#8208;pimaranes as novel and unusual non&#8208;redox active ferroptosis inhibitors.







Abstract
We present a comprehensive account on the evolution of a synthetic platform for a subfamily of ent&#8208;pimaranes. For the most complex member, norflickinflimiod C, five distinct strategies relying on either cationic or radical polyene cyclizations to construct the requisite tricyclic carbon scaffold were explored. Insights from early and late stage oxidative and reductive dearomatization studies ultimately led to a mild, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed arene hydrogenation for the final synthetic route. A Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation was found to be suitable to render the platform enantioselective and diversification of a late&#8208;stage key intermediate culminated in the total synthesis of eight ent&#8208;pimaranes in 11&#8211;16 steps. These compounds were found to inhibit the formation of pro&#8208;inflammatory leukotrienes and other 5&#8208;lipoxygenase products. Notably, three ent&#8208;pimaranes exhibited low micromolar, non&#8208;redox active ferroptosis inhibition with remarkable structural specificity.

A bimetallic MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn nanoparticles uniformly anchored on N, S co&#8208;doped graphene nanosheets (MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn@NSG) are developed as an anode electrode for Li&#8208;ion battery. In the MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn nanocomposite, the generated Sn&#8722;O&#8722;Mo bond can modulate the electronic and composition structures to improve the intrinsic conductivity of SnO2 and reinforce the structural stability during cycles. Featuring excellent electronic conductivity and a hierarchical NBG matrix, the optimized MoO2&#8208;2SnO2/Sn@NSG anode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties.







Abstract
Obtaining a robust electrode composed of Sn&#8208;based metal oxides and carbonaceous matrix through nanoscale structure engineering is essential for effectively improving Li&#8208;ion batteries&#8217; electrochemical performance and stability. Herein, we report a bimetallic MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn nanoparticles uniformly anchored on N, S co&#8208;doped graphene nanosheets (MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn@NSG) as an anode electrode for Li&#8208;ion battery via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal and thermal treatment approach. In the MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn nanocomposite, the generated Sn&#8722;O&#8722;Mo bond can modulate the electronic and composition structures to improve the intrinsic conductivity of SnO2 and reinforce the structural stability during cycles. Moreover, featuring excellent electronic conductivity via coupling of MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn and hierarchical NBG matrix, the MoO2&#8208;xSnO2/Sn@NSG electrode possesses ultrafast electrochemical kinetics and superior long&#8208;term cycling stability and rate capability. Additionally, the hierarchical MoO2&#8208;2SnO2/Sn@NSG can suppress the aggregation and accommodate the volume variations of active substances, thereby providing more lithium storage sites. Consequently, the optimized MoO2&#8208;2SnO2/Sn@NSG anode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 904&#8197;mA&#8197;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling performance with the reversible capacity of 456&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 600 cycles. The universal synthesis technology of bimetallic oxide anodes for advanced LIBs may provide vital guidance in designing high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>Polysilsesquioxane Open Hollow Spheres for Heavy Metal Ions Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polysilsesquioxane open hollow spheres are fabricated through a step&#8208;growth formation process assisted by polystyrene microsphere templates. The openness of the hollow sphere is significantly influenced by the vortex flow generated by magnetic stirring. The material exhibits remarkable adsorption efficiency for heavy metals, attributed to its unique open hollow structure and the presence of thiol groups on its surface.







Abstract
Hollow microspheres with open windows on the shells have shown significant potential in adsorption, catalysis, and drug delivery fields, owing to their low density, large interior volume, high specific surface area, and abundant availability of adsorption sites. However, creating open hollow spheres with structurally stable and entirely organic&#8208;functionalized surfaces remains a challenge. Herein, we fabricated polysilsesquioxane open hollow spheres using trialkoxysilane containing mercaptopropyl groups under vigorous stirring, employing polystyrene microspheres as a template. Various reaction parameters were explored, revealing stirring speed as the key factor influencing the morphology and openness of the microspheres. By examining the morphology of intermediate products at different reaction times, we proposed a step&#8208;growth mechanism for microsphere formation. The resulting materials exhibited high adsorption capacity and selectivity towards Hg2+ and Pb2+, attributed to the presence of thiol groups and the open&#8208;hollow structure. Our approach provides a robust method for producing open hollow materials with functionalized surfaces, offering potential applications in the adsorption field.

         <title>Highly Efficient Aggregation&#8208;induced Electrochemiluminescence Performance of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Electron&#8208;rich Conjugated Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiophene units were introduced into three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with electron&#8208;rich conjugated structures. The COFs exhibited aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) performance. The ECL intensity of COFs with terthienyl units (TTA&#8208;TAPE) is 206 times that of COFs with furan units in the presence of tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. A strategy for designing highly efficient AIECL&#8208;active COFs emitters was proposed.







Abstract
Since aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) luminophore overcomes the restriction of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching in solid luminescent materials, AIECL luminophore has become a promising material in the field of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) engineering. However, the lack of ECL emitters with high AIECL performance limits its wide application. Herein, imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with C4 symmetrical tetraphenyl ethylene and C2 symmetrical five&#8208;membered heteroaromatic monomers are designed as ECL emitter in aqueous media. Significantly, the ECL intensity of COFs with terthienyl units (TTA&#8208;TAPE) is 206 times that of COFs with furan units in the presence of tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA), which is the result of enhancing ECL signals by increasing the thiophene units and &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation of COFs. Furthermore, the ECL mechanism of these COFs is vested in the bandgap model. Thus, the study provides a strategy for designing highly efficient ECL&#8208;active COFs emitters with excellent AIECL efficiency.

         <title>Selective Self&#8208;Assembly of Supramolecular Helices and Macrocycles Directed by Halogen Bonding</title>

Supramolecular helices controlled by intermolecular I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonds and bimolecular supramolecular planar macrocycles controlled by intermolecular &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N or &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonds were selectively constructed from H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers with an equivalent degree of polymerization.







Abstract
In this study, several hydrogen&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers (compounds 1&#8211;5) with the same degree of polymerization were designed and synthesized. The polyfluoroiodobenzene or iodoethynyl polyfluoroiodobenzene segment was modified as a halogen donor at the end of the monomer, and pyridine or pyridine oxynitride served as the corresponding halogen acceptor segment. The crystal structure of compound 1 indicates that the supramolecular double helices were constructed by stacking a P helix and an M helix in an antiparallel manner in the direction of intermolecular I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonding. The zig&#8208;zag&#8208;shaped linear structures of compounds 2 and 3 were generated under the induction of intermolecular I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonds. [1+1] near&#8208;planar bimolecular supramolecular macrocycles in compounds 4 and 5 were formed by multiple groups of effective intramolecular three&#8208;center hydrogen bonding and strong I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N and I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#8722;O&#8722;N+ halogen bonds. Hirshfeld surface analysis and theoretical modelling of the halogen bonding energy were performed. The noncovalent interactions on the surface of the monomers and the halogen bonding energy were investigated in detail.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Stereodivergent Synthesis of N&#8208;Glycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A switchable stereoselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;glycosylation of readily accessible glycals is described herein. This technique is enabled by a site&#8208;selective incorporation of a hydrogen atom across an olefin prior to C&#8722;N bond&#8208;formation, with stereodivergency being dictated on kinetic or thermodynamic grounds. This technique is characterized by its operational simplicity, exquisite selectivity and broad applicability, not only complementing classical protocols for preparing N&#8208;glycosides but also offering a new gateway to expedite the rapid and reliable access to molecular architectures of relevance in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a stereoselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;glycosylation of glycals. The reaction is enabled by addition of an in&#8197;situ generated nickel hydride across an olefin prior to C&#8722;N bond&#8208;formation. Stereodivergence can be accomplished on kinetic or thermodynamic grounds, thus giving access to either &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;glycosides with equal ease. The protocol is distinguished by its operational simplicity, generality and exquisite selectivity, thus offering a new gateway to expedite the synthesis of N&#8208;glycosides.

         <title>Regulating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Organic Luminophores Through Stepwise Stabilization by Coordination and In&#8208;Situ Precipitation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dim and short&#8208;lived RTP emissive organic molecules were transferred into afterglow materials with an emission efficiency of 45&#8201;% and emission lifetime of 1.9&#8197;s, through a straightforward coordination and in&#8208;situ precipitation reaction. The coordination reaction reduced the energy gaps between singlet and triplet states and stabilized the excited states of the guest molecules.







Abstract
Developing efficiency and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials through straightforward methods is highly desired. In this work, a stepwise stabilization strategy was proposed by the coordination and in&#8208;situ precipitation reactions among organic precursors, inorganic cation and anions, producing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials with high emission efficiency (phosphorescence quantum yield of 45&#8201;%). Structural and photophysical characterizations revealed the coordination reaction reduced the energy gaps between singlet and triplet states and stabilized the excited states of the guest molecules. The in&#8208;situ precipitation reaction produced a solid matrix, which provided isolated environments for protecting the excitons from quenching. The applications of RTP materials in information encryption were demonstrated. The presented results provided a new clue for producing RTP materials, and extended their applications in wide fields.

         <title>Stimuli Induced Reversible Switching Between a Self&#8208;Assembled 2&#8208;Catenane and the Constituent Coordination Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible switching between a 2&#8208;catenane and the constituent macromonocyclic coordination rings have been accomplished. The ring separation could be realized when a suitable guest moiety acted as stimulus whereas sequestering the bound guest using another stimulus (i.&#8201;e. powerful host) resulted back the 2&#8208;catenane.







Abstract
A pair of comparable sized C&#8208;shaped bis&#8208;monodentate ligands (L1 and L22+) and a linear bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (L3) complementing to the terminal&#8208;lengths of the C&#8208;shaped ligands have been identified. One&#8208;pot combination of cis&#8208;Pd(tmeda)2+, L1 and L3 (2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio) in water resulted an octa&#8208;cationic 2&#8208;catenane, [Pd2(tmeda)2(L1)(L3)]28+ in which two identical tetra&#8208;cationic macromonocyclic coordination rings are interlocked; however, a guest bound coordination ring was formed in presence of a selected di&#8208;anionic guest. Complexation of cis&#8208;Pd(tmeda)2+ with a mixture of L22+ and L3 (2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio) in water resulted the hexa&#8208;cationic macromonocyclic coordination ring, [Pd2(tmeda)2(L2)(L3)]6+ whereas a guest bound coordination ring was formed in the presence of the di&#8208;anionic guest. Addition of the guest to the preformed octa&#8208;cationic catenane caused ring separation to favour the guest&#8208;bound ring. This guest bound ring could be reverted to the 2&#8208;catenane by sequestering the bound guest using the relatively electron deficient hexa&#8208;cationic coordination ring. Thus, a design principle for reversible switching between a 2&#8208;catenane and the constituent macromonocyclic&#8208;rings using anion&#8208;binding/&#8208;sequestering as the core concept has been established.

         <title>Free Alcohol&#8208;Mediated Radical Alkynylation and Allylation of Unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel free aliphatic alcohol&#8208;mediated radical alkynylation and allylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is disclosed. The transition&#8208;metal free protocol features exclusive site&#8208;selectivity, high product diversity, and simple operation, supplying a robust manifold for C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization using easily available aliphatic alcohols as feedstock.







Abstract
The daunting challenges in converting alcoholic O&#8722;H bonds with high bond&#8208;dissociation energy (BDE) to alkoxy radicals and harnessing those unruly reaction species largely limit exploiting free alcohols in C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. Herein we describe a novel radical alkynylation and allylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with unmodified aliphatic alcohols. The use of phenyliodine bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA) enables the formation of alkoxy radicals under mild photochemical conditions. &#945;&#8208;Methyl styrene serves as a sacrificial&#8208;reagent that significantly improves the reaction outcomes. This transition&#8208;metal free protocol further features broad substrate scope, exclusive site&#8208;selectivity, high product diversity, and simple operation, supplying a robust manifold for C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization using easily available aliphatic alcohols as feedstock.

         <title>Sulfur and Oxygen Transfer Reactions with Simultaneous NHC&#8208;Coordination from Cyclic Thioureas and Ureas to a Stable Silylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur and oxygen transfer reactions of cyclic thioureas and ureas to an isolable silylene were examined. The sulfur transfer of a cyclic thiourea to the silylene formed the corresponding Si=S species. In the reaction of a cyclic urea, an oxygen transfer and the subsequent silyl migrations occurred to furnish a stable azomethine ylide.







Abstract
Reactions of cyclic thioureas (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;thione and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;thione) and ureas (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;one and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one) with an isolable dialkylsilylene were examined. In these reactions, cyclic thioureas served as sulfur and NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) sources, and the corresponding silanethione and NHC&#8208;derived products formed via silanethione&#8208;NHC complexes. Reactions of cyclic ureas with the silylene afforded a new NHC and an isolable azomethine ylide. These reactions involved oxygen atom transfer and 1,3&#8208;silyl migrations, which were supported by computational studies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of a Perfluorinated Amphiphilic Cyanine Dye into Branched Tubular J&#8208;Aggregates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and structural investigations of a novel perfluorinated amphiphilic cyanine dye are reported. The formation of J&#8208;aggregates possessing several supramolecular double&#8208;layered morphologies based on cryogenic transmission electron microscopy studies is described. For the first time the transformation of vesicles into a population of branched nanotubes is shown.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly process is governed by the individual constituents of molecules through precise non&#8208;covalent interactions. Amphiphilic cyanines are intriguing in supramolecular chemistry due to the large polarizability of their delocalized &#960;&#8211;electron systems, their tuneable optical properties and their ability to form well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled structures in different media. Here we present the synthesis of a novel tetrahydroxy amphiphilic carbocyanine dye with perfluoro alkylated chains &#8722;(CH2)2&#8722;(CF2)5&#8722;CF3 as hydrophobic segments and aminoproanediol as hydrophilic segment. The target molecule was synthesized in a multi&#8208;step process, which illustrates the complexity and precision required to achieve the desired structure. This study focuses on the comparison of the influence of C8H17 and C8H4F13 tails and the effects of carboxylated and non&#8208;ionic aminopropanediol head groups as substituents on self&#8208;assembly of the TBC dye. Absorption and fluorescence measurements show similar spectroscopic properties to cyanine dyes studied previously. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM) reveals formation of multiple supramolecular aggregates. As supramolecular assembly is very sensitive to sample preparation, multilamellar or multivesicular vesicles are obtained preferentially in vigorously vortexed solutions. Moreover, time&#8208;dependent tube formation was observed in gently mixed solutions. Thereby, we could follow the growing mechanism of the unprecedented Y&#8208;junctions of supramolecular tubes.

         <title>Ag&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization&#8208;Intermolecular Sulfinyl Group Transfer Cascade Reactions Enabling Enantioselective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Sulfinylisoquinolines</title>

         <dc:description>
Cyclization &#8211; intermolecular sulfinyl group transfer reactions of N&#8208;sulfinylimines derived from ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzaldehydes were effectively promoted by &#960;&#8208;Lewis acidic Ag catalysts, affording the 4&#8208;sulfinylisoquinolines in good yields. Additionally, the Ag&#8208;catalyzed reactions in the presence of quinidine acetate as a chiral nucleophilic cocatalyst, yielded the chiral sulfoxides with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
N&#8208;Sulfinylimines derived from ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzaldehydes were efficiently converted into the corresponding 4&#8208;sulfinylisoquinolines in good to excellent yields. The reaction proceeds via cyclization followed by intermolecular migration of the sulfinyl group from the nitrogen atom to the silver&#8208;bound carbon of the resulting cyclized vinylsilver intermediate with the aid of either a counteranion or a nucleophilic species. Moreover, the Ag&#8208;catalyzed reaction in the presence of quinidine acetate as a chiral nucleophilic cocatalyst yielded chiral isoquinolines with high enantioselectivities through a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT).

         <title>An Ion Pair Receptor for Selective Solid&#8208;Liquid Extraction of LiCl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion pair receptor composed of a functionalized calix[4]arene and a calix[4]pyrrole unit extracts lithium chloride with high selectivity from a solid mixture of alkali metal chloride salts and releases it upon contact with water.







Abstract
We have synthesized a new ion pair receptor (2) consisting of a cone&#8208;calix[4]arene bearing a combination of ethyl esters and ethers as a cation binding site and a calix[4]pyrrole subunit acting as an anion binding site. Ion pair receptor 2 complexes LiCl, NaCl, and CsCl among alkali metal chloride salts with distinct complexation modes and affinities in 10&#8201;% methanol&#8208;d4 in chloroform&#8208;d. For instance, relatively small Li+ and Na+ cations are bound to the oxygen atoms of the functionalized calix[4]arene lower rim with Cl&#8722; being hydrogen bonded to the calix[4]pyrrole NHs while the larger Cs+ cation is bound to the cone&#8208;shaped calix[4]pyrrole cavity via a &#960;&#8208;cation interaction. By contrast, in the co&#8208;presence of all MCl salts (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs), receptor 2 binds LiCl with complete selectivity. Besides, receptor 2 is capable of extracting LiCl selectively into a chloroform or a dichloromethane organic phase from its solid source containing all other MCl salts.

&lt;/i&gt; in chloroform-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;. For instance, relatively small Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations are bound to the oxygen atoms of the functionalized calix[4]arene lower rim with Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; being hydrogen bonded to the calix[4]pyrrole NHs while the larger Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation is bound to the cone-shaped calix[4]pyrrole cavity via a &#960;-cation interaction. By contrast, in the co-presence of all MCl salts (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs), receptor &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; binds LiCl with complete selectivity. Besides, receptor &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is capable of extracting LiCl selectively into a chloroform or a dichloromethane organic phase from its solid source containing all other MCl salts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Organic EnT Photocatalyst 4CzMeBN and the Application in the Synthesis of cis&#8208;Fused Azetidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic EnT photocatalyst 4CzMeBN was developed as an alternative of widely used Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbbpy)PF6. 4CzMeBN was prepared facilely from commercially available 4CzIPN and features high triplet state energy and long lifetime of triplet state. The powerful catalytic performance of 4CzMeBN was demonstrated by the photosynthesis of cis&#8208;fused azetidines.







Abstract
A powerful EnT photocatalyst 4CzMeBN has been developed and utilized in the synthesis of cis&#8208;fused azetidines via dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition under visible light. The photocatalyst 4CzMeBN is a donor&#8208;acceptor cyanoarene and features high triplet state energy and long lifetime of triplet state, which would be an alternative to widely used EnT photocatalyst Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbbpy)PF6. The photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition provides a facile method to synthesize valuable dihydroisoquinolone&#8208;fused azetidines with high efficiency.

         <title>Beyond the Diffusion Limit: Pre&#8208;Associated Ion&#8208;Pair Photoinitiating Systems for Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;stoichiometric photoinitiating system containing the dye cristal violet as a photoinitiator and an excess of borate as coinitiator was found to form a photoreactive ion&#8208;pair which reacts extremely rapidly under light excitation without any need of diffusional process.







Abstract
The pre&#8208;association mechanism of an ion&#8208;pair Type II photoinitiating system (PIS) acting in the visible range was studied. The choice of a dye as photoinitiator (crystal violet) with an excited state lifetime of 200&#8197;ps ensured the absence of dynamical quenching by the borate salts used as coinitiator. In spite of the fact that no diffusional bimolecular quenching can take place, excellent polymerization efficiency was found, underlining the high reactivity of the PIS. A saturation effect is observed when increasing the concentration of borate as a consequence of the pre&#8208;association mechanism arising from coulombic interaction between the cationic dye and the anionic coinitiator. The association equilibria of the system were described and the corresponding association constant values were calculated, allowing to quantify the pre&#8208;association efficiency. This was further successfully correlated to the observed maximal rates of polymerization. The efficiency of this super&#8208;stoichiometric sample with an excess of borate was finally compared to the stoichiometric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 dye:borate ion&#8208;pair. It is shown that the pre&#8208;association mechanism could lead to much higher efficiency than the stoichiometric ion&#8208;pair.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pairs from Al&#8722;E{14} Bonds (E{14}=Ge, Sn, Pb)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) with Al and E{14} (E{14}=Ge, Sn, Pb) centres is described. Analysis of unsupported Al&#8722;E{14} bonds show a Lewis basic (LB) Al and a Lewis acidic (LA) E{14}, with appreciable E{14}&#8594;Al back donation. Reaction with ethene forms the ethylene bridged FLP with segregated the LA (Al) and LB (Ge/Sn) centres. The Al/Ge FLP reacts with CO2 carbodiimide to afford activation and insertion products, respectively.







Abstract
The potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8722;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) reacts with group 14 chloroamidinates E{14}(Am)Cl (E{14}=Ge, Sn, Pb. [Am]&#8722;=[tBuC(NDipp)2]&#8722;) to form (NON)Al&#8722;E{14}(Am) Lewis pairs with unsupported Al&#8722;E{14} bonds, including the first structurally authenticated Al&#8722;Pb bond. Analysis using spectroscopic (NMR, UV&#8208;vis and M&#246;ssbauer for E{14}=Sn), X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational (DFT, QTAIM, TD&#8208;DFT) methods conclude an Al&#8722;E{14} &#963;&#8208;bond derived from a Lewis basic Al and a Lewis acidic tetrylene, with back&#8208;donation from the E{14} s&#8208;orbital lone pair donor NBO to acceptor NBOs on Al that are derived from s/p&#8208;orbitals. The reaction of the Al&#8722;Ge compound with CO2 forms the dioxocarbene (NON)Al(&#956;&#8208;O2C)Ge(Am), whilst under the same conditions the Al&#8722;Sn compound reacts with additional CO2 to form the carbonate, (NON)Al(&#956;&#8208;CO3)Sn(Am). Addition of ethene to the Al&#8722;E{14} (E{14}=Ge, Sn) compounds introduces an ethylene bridge between the aluminium and group 14 atoms forming a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP). Reaction of the (Al/Ge) FLP with CO2 forms an activation product with new Al&#8722;O and Ge&#8722;C bonds, whilst reaction with iPrN=C=NiPr proceeds with insertion into the Al&#8722;C bond to form an aluminium amidinate.

         <title>Facile and Regioselective Deuteration of C2&#8208;Alkylated Imidazolium Salts in the Presence of Cesium Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
C2&#8208;alkylated imidazolium salts are readily and regioselectively deuterated on their C2&#945; exocyclic position and/or C4=C5 heterocyclic backbone using D2O, a cheap, non&#8208;toxic deuterium source, and Cs2CO3, a weak, innocuous, inorganic base. This simple and efficient procedure eases the access to valuable isotopomers of compounds that are widely employed as bioactive molecules, ionic liquids, organocatalysts, and carbene ligand precursors.







Abstract
Thirteen imidazolium iodides bearing benzyl, mesityl, or 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl substituents on their nitrogen atoms, and C1&#8211;C4 alkyl chains on their C2 carbon atom were readily deuterated with D2O as a cheap and non&#8208;toxic deuterium source in the presence of Cs2CO3, a weak, innocuous, inorganic base. The isotopic exchange proceeded quickly and efficiently under mild, aerobic conditions to afford a range of aNHC and NHO precursors regioselectively labeled on their C2&#945; exocyclic position and/or C4=C5 heterocyclic backbone. A &#8220;carbene&#8208;free&#8221; mechanism was postulated, in which the carbonate anion acts as a catalyst to activate an exocyclic, acidic C&#8722;H bond and ease a deuterium transfer from D2O to the imidazolium salt in a concerted fashion.

     alt="Facile and Regioselective Deuteration of C2-Alkylated Imidazolium Salts in the Presence of Cesium Carbonate"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C2-alkylated imidazolium salts are readily and regioselectively deuterated on their C2&#945; exocyclic position and/or C4=C5 heterocyclic backbone using D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, a cheap, non-toxic deuterium source, and Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a weak, innocuous, inorganic base. This simple and efficient procedure eases the access to valuable isotopomers of compounds that are widely employed as bioactive molecules, ionic liquids, organocatalysts, and carbene ligand precursors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen imidazolium iodides bearing benzyl, mesityl, or 2,6-diisopropylphenyl substituents on their nitrogen atoms, and C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; alkyl chains on their C2 carbon atom were readily deuterated with D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as a cheap and non-toxic deuterium source in the presence of Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a weak, innocuous, inorganic base. The isotopic exchange proceeded quickly and efficiently under mild, aerobic conditions to afford a range of aNHC and NHO precursors regioselectively labeled on their C2&#945; exocyclic position and/or C4=C5 heterocyclic backbone. A &#8220;carbene-free&#8221; mechanism was postulated, in which the carbonate anion acts as a catalyst to activate an exocyclic, acidic C&#8722;H bond and ease a deuterium transfer from D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to the imidazolium salt in a concerted fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Experimental Characterization of a Sialyl Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the sialyl cation, the intermediate of sialylation reactions, is experimentally characterized for the first time using messenger&#8208;tagging infrared spectroscopy. The results suggest that this intermediate is stabilized by remote participation of the C5&#8208;NHAc group, leading to the formation of a bicyclic structure. Here, the &#946;&#8208;side is shielded, potentially contributing to the &#945;&#8208;selectivity of various SN1&#8208;type sialylation reactions.







Abstract
Sialic acids are monosaccharide residues involved in several biological processes. Controlling the stereoselectivity of sialylation reactions is challenging and mechanistic studies on the structure of its intermediate, the sialyl cation, are scarce. Here it is shown that a sialyl cation can be generated and isolated from an ionized sialic acid precursor. This short&#8208;lived species is structurally characterized for the first time using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy. In combination with quantum chemical calculations, the results reveal that the positive charge at the anomeric carbon of the sialyl cation is stabilized by remote participation of the C5&#8208;NHAc group leading to the formation of a bridged structure. In this structure, the &#946;&#8208;side is shielded from nucleophilic attack, potentially explaining the &#945;&#8208;selectivity of this building block in SN1&#8208;type sialylation reactions. Other modes of participation are energetically unfavored and cannot be observed experimentally.

         <title>Defining the Synthetic Scope of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides by Quantifying their Electrophilicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrophilicities E of ortho&#8208;quinone methides (oQMs) were determined by following the kinetics of oQM reactions with carbanions in DMSO. Embedding the oQMs in Mayr's reactivity scales facilitates selecting nucleophilic reaction partners for oQMs as exemplified by several novel reactions with neutral or negatively charged C&#8208;, N&#8208;, and S&#8208;nucleophiles.







Abstract
A series of aryl&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;quinone methides (oQMs) was synthesised and structurally characterised. Kinetic studies of the nucleophilic additions of carbanions (reference nucleophiles) to oQMs were used to determine second&#8208;order rate constants k2 for the carbon&#8208;carbon bond forming reactions (20&#8201;&#176;C, DMSO) at the oQMs&#8217; exocyclic &#960;&#8208;bond. Analysing the kinetic data by the linear free energy relationship lg k2=sN(N+E) revealed the Mayr electrophilicities E of the oQMs. The electrophilicities E of oQMs correlate linearly with Hammett substituent constants and experimentally determined reduction potentials Epred as well as with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs), which provides valuable tools for prediciting the reactivity of further types of oQMs. Embedding the oQMs in Mayr's reactivity scales enables to predict novel nucleophilic reaction partners for oQMs and can productively be used to prepare simple Michael adducts as well as 4+2 or 4+1 cyclisation products as demonstrated in this work by several novel reactions with neutral or negatively charged C&#8208;, N&#8208;, and S&#8208;nucleophiles.

         <title>Insight into the Simultaneous Super&#8208;Stable Mineralization of AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ Using MgFe&#8208;LDHs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous mineralization of AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ with efficiency of &gt;99.0% in 240 min in aqueous solution and of &gt;81.1% in 14 days in soil can be achieved by both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3, during which the released Mg2+ ions were demonstrated to be able to promote the emergence and growth of red bean seedlings.







Abstract
Multiple&#8208;heavy&#8208;metal contamination in soil, such as the simultaneous presence of AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+, which can reduce crop yields and damage human health, is a serious issue to be addressed. Herein, the MgFe&#8208;LDHs (layered double hydroxides) intercalated with carbonate and nitrate (MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3) were synthesized by Separate Nucleation and Aging Steps and ion&#8208;exchange method, respectively. The MgFe&#8208;CO3 demonstrated the maximum saturation adsorption capacity of 55.86, 543.48 and 1597.4&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 for single AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ in aqueous solution, while MgFe&#8208;NO3 exhibited 92.50, 387.59 and 869.56&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively. Kinetic and thermodynamic results for mineralization of single AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ fitted well with the pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, indicating the occurrence of chemisorption and monolayer adsorption for both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3. Furthermore, simultaneous mineralization of AsO43&#8722;, Cd2+ and Pb2+ with &gt;99.0&#8201;% efficiency in 240&#8197;min in aqueous solution and &gt;81.1&#8201;% efficiency in 14&#8197;days in soil can be achieved by both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3. Preliminary red bean seedlings cultivation experiments indicated that the released Mg2+ ions from MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3 were capable to promote the emergence and growth of red bean seedlings. Detailed XRD and XPS results demonstrated that the AsO43&#8722; anions were adsorbed on the laminate of LDHs, whereas the Pb3(OH)2(CO3)2 was the mineralization product for both MgFe&#8208;CO3 and MgFe&#8208;NO3. In terms of Cd2+, CdCO3 was obtained as a mineralization product for MgFe&#8208;CO3, while CdCO3 and Cd(OH)2 can be detected due to the slow transformation of MgFe&#8208;NO3 to MgFe&#8208;CO3 in air.

         <title>Front Cover: Morphological Evolution of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks into Hedrite, Sheaf and Spherulite Superstructures with Localized Different Coloration (Chem. Eur. J. 7/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover illustrates the morphology of stunning hyperbranched metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Such structures arise through non&#8208;crystallographic branching, where defects on fast&#8208;growing rods are likely to contribute to secondary nucleation and the formation of triangular branches. The polycrystalline sheafs consist of single&#8208;crystalline nanorods with shifted orientations. Chromophore diffusion into nanochannels produces localized, polarized&#8208;light&#8208;dependent coloration. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Lahav, M.&#8197;E. van der Boom and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403577). The authors thank Nitzan Shauloff for designing the cover.

         <title>Cover Feature: Confinement Effects of Coordination Cages on the Synthesis and Application of Polyoxometalates (Chem. Eur. J. 7/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement effects within coordination cages unlock new possibilities for stabilizing and tuning polyoxometalates (POMs). The cover uses the metaphor of birds in a cage to illustrate these effects, with the background emphasizing the structural interplay between POMs and coordination cages. This synergy also paves the way for innovative applications in catalysis, energy storage, electronics, and magnetics, exemplifying the elegance of supramolecular design. More information can be found in the Concept by C.&#8208;L. Liu, T.&#8197;N. Parac&#8208;Vogt and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403856).

         <dc:description>
A magician entertains spectators by linking a pair of metal rings followed by unlinking those using mechanical tricks. The cover artwork illustrates the linking and unlinking of a pair of self&#8208;assembled dynamic coordination rings (molecular magic rings). The rings are interlocked when taken in water and separated by applying a chemical trick in the form of stimulus&#8208;I, which is a guest molecule suitable for occupying the inner&#8208;space of the rings. Such a guest can be sequestered by stimulus&#8208;II, which is a more powerful host. More information about the tricks can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;K. Chand and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403837).

         <title>Cover Feature: Dinuclear Dysprosium Compounds: The Importance of Rigid Bridges (Chem. Eur. J. 7/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature shows the influence of different bridging units between two DyIII ions on the magnetic coupling and dynamic behaviour. The peroxo&#8208;bridge is rigid because the O&#8722;O bond leads to a longer inter&#8208;Dy distance resulting in antiferromagnetic coupling and slow relaxation of magnetisation characteristic of an SMM. The bis&#8208;fluoride bridges are floppy as there is no connection between the two bridging atoms. This compound is ferromagnetically coupled but shows no SMM behaviour. The rigidity clearly influences the dynamic behaviour likely as a result of different spin&#8211;phonon coupling. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Perfetti, J. Bendix, A.&#8197;K. Powell and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403002).

         <title>Neutral Interface Directed 3D Confined Self&#8208;Assembly of Block Copolymer: Anisotropic Patterned Particles with Ordered Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neutral interface directed 3D confined self&#8208;assembly (3D&#8208;CSA) of block copolymer represents a robust strategy for the production of polymer particles featuring ordered nanostructures and various shapes, particularly those with anisotropic characteristics. This review elucidates the fundamental law governing shape control, the methodologies for constructing neutral interfaces, as well as the diverse properties and potential applications of anisotropic patterned particles.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional confined self&#8208;assembly (3D&#8208;CSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is a distinctive and robust strategy that can yield colloidal polymer particles boasting ordered internal structures and diverse morphologies. The unique advantage of neutral interface lies in its ability to create anisotropic particles with surface patterns. The resulting unique polymer particles exhibit deformability under swelling, coupled with excellent spreadability and optical properties. These particles can also be used for fabrication of anisotropic nanoobjects or mesoporous particles via disassembly or serving as templates. This review comprehensively outlines the research advancements in neutral interface&#8208;guided 3D&#8208;CSA systems, including surfactant engineering, internal structure control, properties and future possibilities of anisotropic patterned particles.

Boron atoms, due to their electron&#8208;deficient nature, have been extensively studied in luminescent, semiconductor, and chemical sensing materials. This review highlights the synthesis and properties of boron&#8208;containing graphene nanoribbons, covalent organic frameworks, and 2D conjugated polymers. Their tunable electronic structures pave the way for innovations in optoelectronics, catalysis, energy storage and etc.







Abstract
Organic two&#8208;dimensional materials have garnered widespread attention due to their well&#8208;defined structures, structural diversity, and rich electronic effects, demonstrating significant application potential across various fields. Atomic&#8208;level manipulation of the structures of organic two&#8208;dimensional materials has been a primary strategy for enriching and optimizing their properties. The introduction of heteroatoms often significantly affects their electronic structure, thereby endowing these materials with novel and unique properties. Boron atoms, due to their electron&#8208;deficient nature, have been extensively studied in luminescent materials, semiconductor materials, and chemical sensing materials. Consequently, boron&#8208;containing organic two&#8208;dimensional materials are also believed to be promising as a new class of materials with excellent optoelectronic and chemical activities.

&lt;p&gt;Boron atoms, due to their electron-deficient nature, have been extensively studied in luminescent, semiconductor, and chemical sensing materials. This review highlights the synthesis and properties of boron-containing graphene nanoribbons, covalent organic frameworks, and 2D conjugated polymers. Their tunable electronic structures pave the way for innovations in optoelectronics, catalysis, energy storage and etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic two-dimensional materials have garnered widespread attention due to their well-defined structures, structural diversity, and rich electronic effects, demonstrating significant application potential across various fields. Atomic-level manipulation of the structures of organic two-dimensional materials has been a primary strategy for enriching and optimizing their properties. The introduction of heteroatoms often significantly affects their electronic structure, thereby endowing these materials with novel and unique properties. Boron atoms, due to their electron-deficient nature, have been extensively studied in luminescent materials, semiconductor materials, and chemical sensing materials. Consequently, boron-containing organic two-dimensional materials are also believed to be promising as a new class of materials with excellent optoelectronic and chemical activities. This article collates and summarizes the preparation and property studies of three types of boron-containing organic two-dimensional materials in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
This review article provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments in the area of hydroxamate&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). It primarily focuses on their synthesis, structural characteristics, and porosity. Finally, it highlights the potential for future applications, including catalysis, small molecule capture, and semiconductive materials.







Abstract
This mini&#8208;review focuses on recent developments in hydroxamate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibit unique structures and properties distinct from those of carboxylate&#8208;based MOFs. Hydroxamates (RCONHO&#8722;) form MOFs with novel structural motifs and functionalities. In this review, synthetic strategies, structural characteristics, and functional applications of key examples of hydroxamate&#8208;based MOFs are described, providing insights into the influence of the hydroxamate ligand on the MOF properties compared to that of the carboxylate&#8208;based analogues.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF)&#8208;Based Sensors for Mercury (Hg) Detection: Design Strategies and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 7, February 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work summarizes the advances of MOFs sensors for Hg and the main MOFs are UIO, ZIF, and MIL. Fluorescence and colorimetry are the two types of optical sensors for Hg. The recognition elements include T&#8208;rich aptamers, noble metal nanoparticles, central metal ions, and organic functional groups of MOFs. Portable devices like microfluidics and smartphones are developed to facilitate portability.







Abstract
Monitoring mercury (Hg) is critical for environmental and public health. Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based sensors demonstrate the advantage of high sensitivity and rapid response. We summarize the advances of MOF sensors for Hg2+ detection from the perspective of MOF type and role in the sensors. First, we introduce three MOFs used in Hg sensors&#8208;UIO, ZIF, and MIL&#8208;that have demonstrated superior performance. Then, we discuss the specifics of MOF&#8208;based sensors for Hg2+ detection in terms of the recognition and signal elements. Currently, the recognition elements include T&#8208;rich aptamers, noble metal nanoparticles, central metal ions, and organic functional groups inherent to MOFs. Sensors with fluorescence and colorimetric signals are the two main types of optical MOF sensors used for Hg detection. Electrochemical sensors have also been fabricated, but these are less frequently reported, potentially due to the limited conductivity and cycling stability of MOFs. Notably, dual&#8208;signal sensors mitigate background signals interference and enhance the accuracy of Hg2+ detection. Furthermore, to facilitate portability and user&#8208;friendliness, portable devices such as microfluidics, paper&#8208;based devices, and smartphones have been developed for Hg2+ detection, showcasing potential applications. We also address the challenges related to MOF&#8208;based sensors for Hg2+ and future outlook.

         <title>Colorimetric Detection of Naphthalene Enabled by Intra&#8208; to Intermolecular Charge Transfer Interplay Induced by &#960;&#8208;hole&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; Interactions of a TPA&#8208;Attached Pyrazinacene</title>

         <dc:description>
A donor&#8208;acceptor pyrazinacene derivative with triphenylamine substituents selectively recognizes naphthalene via &#960;&#8208;hole&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, inducing a striking reversible color change from greenish blue to red&#8208;violet. Crystallographic and DFT studies reveal the ICT&#8208;CT interplay, establishing an innovative platform for adaptive and sensitive colorimetric sensors.







Abstract
A new Donor&#8208;Acceptor type pyrazinacene derivative (1) featuring strong ICT was synthesized by linking electron&#8208;donating triphenylamine (TPA) and electron&#8208;accepting CN groups via a pyrazinacene core. The compound exhibits a dramatic color change from greenish blue to red&#8208;violet upon selective recognition of naphthalene (3) to form a 1:1 co&#8208;crystal (1&#8226;3). This color change is induced by intermolecular CT between pyrazinacene and naphthalene's aromatic moieties, driven by &#960;&#8208;hole&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. Crystal structure analysis and DFT calculations confirm that the molecular recognition process is facilitated by the unique &#960;&#8208;hole&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, leading to a reversible color switching mechanism. The findings offer new insights into selective molecular recognition and ICT&#8208;CT interplay in nonporous adaptive crystals.

         <title>Stabilization of a Terminal Hydride through Regioselective Protonation in a Diiron Complex Inspired by [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protonation studies of the complex [Fe2(&#181;&#8208;pdt)(&#954;2&#8208;dmpe)2(CO)2] (1), inspired by the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases active site cofactor, yield terminal and bridging hydrido isomers in a ratio that depends on the acid strength and steric hindrance. A terminal hydride ligand is mainly obtained in presence of weaker acids such as [HPtBu3][BF4] and [HNEt3][BF4] while a bridging isomer is predominantly formed with stronger acids such as [HPPh3][BF4] and [H(OEt2)][BF4]. The terminal isomer is comparatively stable and undergoes isomerization into the bridging hydride following first&#8208;order kinetics, with half&#8208;lives of 21 days and 3 days at room temperature and 40&#176;C, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Exchange in Thioguanosine Coordination Polymers of Gold (I) and Silver (I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterometallic coordination polymers of Au(I) and Ag(I) with 6&#8208;thioguanosine, poly([AuxAg1&#8208;x(6&#8722;tG)]), have been prepared and were observed to form hydrogels. We find that the composition of the heterometallic polymer is proportional to&#160;the mole fractions of the metals in the preparation solution. Optical absorption spectra show single peaks for &#955; &gt; 300 nm which can be interpolated in a linear manner between x = 0.0 and x = 1.0 consistent with the formation of a heterometallic polymer rather than a mixture of homopolymers. However photoluminescence and circular dichroism spectra are sensitive to the supramolecular structure of the polymers and show more complex behaviour. Atomic force microscopy indicated that the molecular chains of the Au homopolymer entwine to form strands that are predominantly right&#8208;hand helices. The&#160;Ag homopolymer&#160;has previously been shown to form left&#8208;hand helices. Intermediate compositions have more complex structures because of the competition between the left and right&#8208;handed preferences of the homopolymers. Finally, we have shown that the metal&#8208;ligand bonds are labile on a timescale of about 5 h at ambient temperature (about 293 K). Mixtures of homopolymers transform to the corresponding heterometallic coordination polymer by metal exchange as judged by optical absorption, photoluminescence and circular dichroism spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring Lead&#8208;Free (Guanidinium)3Bi2Br9 Perovskite&#8208;type Crystal toward X&#8208;ray Detection with an Ultralow Detection Limit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead&#8208;free bismuth halogen perovskites have emerged as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection, owing to their unique properties of bulk resistivity, significant X&#8208;ray absorption capabilities and diminished ion migration. Herein, using the facile low&#8208;temperature solution method, we obtained a large&#8208;size single crystal of (guanidinium)3Bi2Br9 (GBB), which adopts a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) inorganic perovskite&#8208;like framework. The as&#8208;grown crystals show high resistivity (3.51 &#215; 1012 &#937; cm), low trap density (1.14 &#215; 1010 cm&#8208;3) and large carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime product (&#956;&#964; =1.13&#215;10&#8208;3 cm2 V&#8208;1) under X&#8208;ray irradiation. Strikingly, the X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated on GBB single crystals exhibit notable performances including low dark current drift, high sensitivity of ~1645.7 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, and ultralow detection limit of ~0.85 nGyair s&#8722;1. This detection limit is among the lowest level for the reported 0D perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors. This study illuminates the prospective research into novel lead&#8208;free hybrid perovskites for the advancement of high&#8208;performance detectors of irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Recycling of Cathode Materials from Spent Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries: Principles, Strategies, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, lithium&#8208;ion batteries have become an important part of the global transition to green and low&#8208;carbon energy. However, due to the rapidly increasing demand and production of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, there is a large amount of spent batteries that need to be disposed of. The most critical and valuable recycling of spent batteries is the recycling of cathode materials. Pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy are traditional recycling processes aimed at extracting valuable metal elements from cathode materials. However, these methods have several disadvantages, including destruction of the structure of cathode materials, lengthy repair processes, high energy consumption and high environmental pollution. The direct recycling process is a popular repair technology for cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The aim is to restore or upgrade the cathode materials in a non&#8208;destructive manner or convert them into other functional products for secondary use, characterized by a short repair process, high atom utilization, lower costs and lower carbon emissions. This perspective summarizes the current status of lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling, with a focus on direct recycling of cathode materials. It describes the pretreatment process, theoretical foundations, direct regeneration strategies and perspectives and provides insights for relevant researchers.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the J&#8208; and H&#8208;Aggregates and Supramolecular Polymerization Pathways of Anthanthrene by Tuning the Hydrogen Bonding Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two wedge&#8208;shaped anthanthrene dyes have been designed for supramolecular polymerization. Manipulating the number and/or the position of the amide functional groups can effectively tune the molecular packing (H&#8208; and J&#8208; aggregates), and supramolecular polymerization pathways. This work expands the &#960; building block for the construction of supramolecular polymers.







Abstract
Exploration of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated building blocks for construction of supramolecular polymers is at the forefront of self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we incorporate a highly planar anthanthrene skeleton into the design of two supramolecular monomers 1 and 2. Their supramolecular polymerization have been comprehensively investigated by spectroscopic studies. Our results reveal that the number and/or position of the amide groups exert pronounced effect on the molecular aggregations and the mechanisms of the supramolecular polymerization. Monomer 1 self&#8208;assembles in a cooperative manner to form 1D nanofibers though face&#8208;to&#8208;face H&#8208;type aggregation. In contrast, 2 adopts J&#8208;aggregation to form supramolecular polymer via isodesmic mechanism.

         <title>Rhodium(III)&#8208;NSi Catalyzed Styrene Hydrosilylation: Evidence of the Hemilabile Character of NSi&#8208;Type Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hemilabile character of the NSi ligand in 18e saturated Rh&#8211;(&#954;2&#8208;NSi) species has been demonstrated.







Abstract
The 18e saturated rhodium(III) species [Rh(H)(X)(&#954;2&#8208;NSitBu2)(bipyMe2)] (NSitBu2={4&#8208;methylpyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yloxy}ditertbutylsilyl; bipyMe2=4,4'&#8208;dimethylbipyridine) (X=Cl, 1; OTf, 2) have been prepared and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and in the case of 2 it has been possible to determine its solid&#8208;state structure by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Complex 1 has proven to be an effective catalyst precursor for the reaction of styrene derivatives with hydrosilanes in CD2Cl2. However, under catalytic conditions complex 2 decomposes. The performance of the 1&#8208;catalyzed reaction of styrene with hydrosilanes strongly depends on the nature of the silane, the best catalytic performance was achieved using HSiMe2Ph. Theoretical and 1H NMR studies indicate that the hemilabile nature of the NSi ligand is key to understanding the catalytic activity of compound 1.

         <title>In Situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Investigation of Isotope&#8208;Selective Breathing in MIL&#8208;53 During Dihydrogen Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8197;situ continuous wave EPR approach utilising Cr3+ and V4+ ions in the framework of MIL&#8208;53 (Al) is successfully conducted to monitor the dihydrogen isotopologue&#8208;selective breathing transition on the flexible MIL&#8208;53 (Al) framework. In addition, the temperature&#8208;dependent 3p ESEEM experiment can be implemented to sense the D2 from the perspective of the V4+ spin probe in the MIL&#8208;53 (Al).







Abstract
The development of smart materials capable of separating dihydrogen isotopologues has risen recently. Among potential candidates, the flexible MIL&#8208;53 (Al) has been gaining attention due to its structural flexibility providing the so&#8208;called &#8216;&#8217;breathing mechanism&#8217;&#8217; that can be useful to separate hydrogen isotopologues selectively. In the present work, an in&#8197;situ continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance investigation has been proven as a sensitive technique to follow the isotopologue&#8208;selective adsorption&#8208;desorption of dihydrogen species on the paramagnetic metal&#8208;doped MIL&#8208;53 (Al0.99Cr0.01) and MIL&#8208;53 (Al0.99V0.01), respectively. The presence of paramagnetic spin probes such as Cr3+ and V4+ inside the MIL&#8208;53 framework allows for monitoring the framework transition including the 2nd transition step that selectively occurs at p&gt;100&#8197;mbar when D2 gas is adsorbed on the pores at 23&#8197;K. Furthermore, investigation of D2 desorption from MIL&#8208;53 (Al0.99V0.01) by temperature&#8208;dependent hyperfine spectroscopy provides a more detailed analysis of the D2 desorption process on a microscopic scale with respect to the embedded spin probe.

         <title>Heterole&#8208;Fused [20]&#8208; and [22]Smaragdyrins and Fused&#8208;Heterole&#8208;Bridged [20]&#8208; and [22]Smaragdyrin Dimers</title>

Heterole&#8208;fused [20]&#8208; and [22]smaragdyrins and fused heterole&#8208;bridged [20]&#8208;and [22]smaragdyrin dimers were synthesized. The installed fused heterole segments distinctly mitigate the paratropic ring current of the [20]smaragdyrin but exert only small effects on the diatropic ring current of the [22]smaragdyrin.







Abstract
In order to examine the effects of the fused heterole on the electronic properties of aromatic and antiaromatic smaragdyrins, 2,3&#8208;thiophene&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;indole&#8208;fused [20]smaragdyrins were synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and subsequent oxidative fusion reaction, and were reduced with NaBH4 to the corresponding [22]smaragdyrins. Fused&#8208;thiophene&#8208; and fused&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;bridged [20]&#8208; and [22]smaragdyrin dimers were also synthesized in the similar manner. The installed fused heteroles mitigate the paratropic ring current of the [20]smaragdyrin but exert only minor effects on the diatropic ring current of the [22]smaragdyrin. Similar features are also observed for the fused&#8208;heterole&#8208;bridged [20]&#8208; and [22]smaragdyrin dimers.

         <title>Enhanced K&#8208;Storage Kinetics for N&#8208;Doped Carbon via Controllable Dedoping Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PNC electrode was prepared by simple pyrolysis method with simultaneous doping and dedoping of N atoms, which significantly increased the K&#8208;storage active sites while forming stable SEI layer, resulting in stable charge transfer resistance and fast K&#8208;storage kinetics, and thus exhibiting the great rate performance and long&#8208;term cycle stability.







Abstract
As a potential alternative to next&#8208;generation LIBs, carbonaceous materials have garnered significant attention as anode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries due to their low cost and environmental friendliness. However, carbonaceous materials cannot fulfill the demand of anode for PIBs, due to volume expansion and poor stability during charging/discharging process. It is well&#8208;known that N doping can provide active sites for K&#8208;storage, and expand the layer distance between graphite layers. Therefore, a simple one&#8208;step pyrolysis strategy was proposed to synthesize different nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon to investigate the effects of N&#8208;doping and dedoping on K&#8208;storage performance. Through the synergistic effect of N&#8208;doping and the carbon vacancy defects formed during the de&#8208;doping process, alleviating volume expansion and promoted K+ transport rate. As a result, the PNC demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance, showing good long&#8208;term cycling stability (with a capacity of 195&#8197;mAh/g after 300 cycles at a current density of 200&#8197;mA/g) and outstanding rate performance. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and development of advanced anode materials with efficient potassium ion storage capabilities.

         <title>Carbamate&#8208;Functionalized NLOphores via a Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8208;Retroelectrocyclization Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces carbamate donor groups for activating click&#8208;type [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclizations, enabling tunable chromophores with &#955;max values of 363&#8211;692&#8197;nm. Positive solvatochromism, protonation experiments, and TD&#8208;DFT studies support the charge transfer characteristics of the chromophores. NLO properties were investigated via the EFISHG technique, with &#956;&#946; values ranging from 470&#215;10&#8722;48 to 5400&#215;10&#8722;48 esu.







Abstract
This study introduces a new donor group capable of activating click&#8208;type [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclizations, generally known for their limited scope. Target chromophores were synthesized using isocyanate&#8208;free urethane synthesis. The developed synthetic method allows for the tuning of the optical properties of the chromophores by modifying the donor groups, the acceptor units, and the side chains. The charge transfer (CT) bands of the chromophores exhibit &#955;max values ranging from 363 to 692&#8197;nm. The CT bands observed have been supported by solvatochromism and protonation experiments. The synthesized compounds exhibit positive solvatochromism. Due to their potential as NLOphore candidates, the stability of the synthesized compounds have been investigated both experimentally through TGA and theoretically by calculating parameters such as frontier orbital energy differences, electronegativity, and global hardness/softness. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were used to elucidate the nature of the electronic transitions, revealing that the bands correspond to CT arising from HOMO&#8208;to&#8208;LUMO excitations. The NLO properties of the chromophores were investigated theoretically by DFT methods and experimentally by the EFISHG technique. Both results are shown to be in agreement with HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy differences. The experimental &#956;&#946; values of the selected molecules range from 470&#215;10&#8722;48 to 5400&#215;10&#8722;48 esu.

         <dc:description>Phosphine&#8208; or carbene&#8208;based soft ligands are customarily used in Rh and other late transition metal catalyzed alkene and alkyne hydrosilylation and hydrogenation. We report here an aziridine and a 2&#8208;pyrrolidone with pyridyl sidearms, whose cationic Rh(I) complexes prove as excellent catalysts for hydrosilylating terminal olefins by Et3SiH giving anti&#8208;Markovnikov products selectively. To the best of our knowledge, the [(2&#8208;pyrrolidone)&#8208;Rh]+ seems to be the most active Rh catalyst recording a highest TOF of 24000 h&#8208;1. It works remarkably (TOF: 714 h&#8208;1) even at 10 ppm concentration! Terminal alkynes are hydrosilylated too to give b&#8208;(Z)&#8208;vinylsilanes selectively. Both catalysts also hydrogenate alkenes and doubly&#8208;hydrogenate alkynes, both terminal and internal, under ambient and benchtop conditions. But in hydrogenation, the [(aziridine)&#8208;Rh]+ catalyst works better. Both ligands and the Rh catalysts are air&#8208;stable.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione bearing a phenylene moiety and aliphatic tails was synthesized as an alternative self&#8208;assembling building block to barbiturate molecules, aiming to achieve enhanced hydrolysis resistance. The compound self&#8208;assembles in non&#8208;polar solvents to form linear supramolecular polymers via the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic hexamers (rosettes), a process confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis of the bulk material. Our results demonstrate that quinazoline&#8208;2,4(1H,3H)&#8208;dione serves as an effective hydrogen&#8208;bonding building block, suggesting its potential to form stable supramolecular polymers from versatile &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide/TiO2 Catalyzed Addition of Ethers, Alkylarenes and Aldehydes to Azodicarboxylates under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The addition of carbon&#8208;centered radicals to double bonds is one of the most atom&#8208;efficient approaches to the formation of new C&#8211;C or C&#8211;heteroatom bonds. Existing approaches for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals often require elevated temperatures, UV radiation or expensive transition metal catalysts. In this work, a photocatalytic system based on a heterogeneous TiO2 catalyst and a redox organocatalyst N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide is proposed for the generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals from C(sp3)&#8211;H substrates or aldehydes at room temperature under visible light irradiation. The developed approach was successfully applied to the coupling of ethers, alkylarenes and alhehydes with azodicarboxylates. Titanium oxide was used to initiate the organocatalytic process involving phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals in solution. Phthalimide&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl radicals act as photosensitizer and catalytically active species that cleave C&#8211;H bonds to form carbon&#8208;centered radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water&#8208;stable Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic framework (HOF) for Selective Sensing of Antibiotics in Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively used as fluorescent&#8208;based antibiotic sensors, newly developed hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are largely unexplored toward this direction. To realize this, the luminescent HOFs must be stable in water as the analytes are mostly found in water&#8208;based effluents in environments. In addition, HOFs should be equipped with specific recognition sites in order to direct the discrimination among the antibiotics. Herein, we report a 3D porous HOF, IITKGP&#8208;HOF&#8208;6, constructed from an aromatic&#8208;rich tetratopic carboxylic acid (H4L), which exhibits excellent hydro and prolonged open&#8208;air stability (7 and 15 days, respectively). IITKGP&#8208;HOF&#8208;6 was explored for the highly selective detection of nitrofurans (NFs) family of antibiotics in aqueous medium exhibiting a remarkably low detection limit of 0.75 &#181;M for nitrofurazone (NFZ) through luminescence quenching. Photoinduced electron transfer driven by the presence of low&#8208;lying charge&#8208;transfer excited state below to the [[EQUATION]] and Forster energy transfer between H4L donor and NFZ acceptor are confirmed to be responsible for observed quenching using detailed quantum&#8208;chemical studies. This work demonstrates the usage of HOFs as sensory materials toward antibiotics in aqueous medium along with a clear understanding into the sensing mechanism at the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Alexidine and Pentamidine Fold Inside the Bowl&#8208;Shaped Cavity of p&#8208;Sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the U&#8208;shaped folding of flexible guest molecules of medicinal interest upon their inclusion into macrocyclic cavity of p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene in aqueous media. Alexidine and pentamidine are FDA&#8208;approved drug compounds currently rediscovered as potent membrane&#8208;targeting antibiotic adjuvants helping restore antibiotic activity against multidrug resistant bacteria pathogens. We have adopted host&#8208;guest and crystal engineering approach to study these drugs with a view of potential supramolecular formulations and/or crystal forms. We focus on the host&#8208;guest conformational and structural behaviour of alexidine and pentamidine under macrocyclic confinement conditions benefitting from single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, self&#8208;assembly studies in solution by NMR spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy, and ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) analysis complemented by theoretical calculations. Our findings show that the simple bowl&#8208;shaped host promotes conformational fixing and crystallization of these guest molecules of high conformational freedom that are otherwise challenging to crystallize. The IM&#8208;MS structural studies of p&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;calix[4]arene complexes with pentamidine and alexidine revealed significant guest reorganization in the solution/gas phase, compared to the binding modes observed in the crystal structures. Despite these changes, the host&#8208;guest complexation remained consistent, with new interactions highlighting the increased role of electrostatic forces in the gas phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Metal Species as A Promoter to Enhance Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a focal point of research in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. This paper reviews the progress in the studies of single atoms as promoters in various catalytic reactions, elucidating their distinctive role in comparison to the dominant active sites. We provide a discussion on the application of single&#8208;atom promoters (SAP) within host&#8208;guest systems in various catalysts, including metal oxide supported catalysts, molybdenum carbide&#8208;based catalysts, bimetallic catalysts, and others. The behavior of SAP is diverse. They often promote the formation of oxygen vacancies for oxide support, leading to local site reconstruction that creates specific reaction route. Moreover, they can also precisely modify the electronic structure of hetero&#8208;metal atomic or nanoparticle sites, then regulating the adsorption of reactants or intermediates and catalytic performance. Finally, the potential for the development of SAP is outlined, proposing novel approach for the design of SACs with enhanced activity and stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitochondrial Localization of Antioxidant Nanodrug Suppresses Ocular Inflammation by Alleviating Oxidative Stress on Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugation of a polyphenolic antioxidant with a small peptide generates a self&#8208;assembled nanodrug, which suppresses ocular inflammation by attenuating oxidative stress in mitochondria after escaping from lysosome. As an investigation of anti&#8208;inflammation by the mitochondrial localization of antioxidant, this work establishes a foundation by regulating cellular redox balance for developing drug delivery systems in the treatment of ocular disorders.







Abstract
External environments (e.&#8201;g., pollutants, irritants, ultraviolet radiation, etc) probably activate oxidative stress on the ocular surface, further leading to inflammatory responses and cellular apoptosis. For treating ophthalmic diseases, one of the strategies is to regulate oxidative stress through antioxidants. Here we conjugate a polyphenolic antioxidant drug (i.&#8201;e., caffeic acid) with a small peptide of protein tag to generate a peptide&#8208;drug conjugate as a nanodrug. With a self&#8208;assembled ability to form nanoparticles, the nanodrug mainly enters human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) by caveolin&#8208;mediated endocytosis, succeeds lysosomal escape, and achieves mitochondrial localization of caffeic acid. Revealed by free radical scavenging experiments, the nanodrug shows considerable antioxidant capacities. In mouse leukemia cells of monocyte macrophage (RAW 264.7) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the nanodrug inhibits various pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines (e.&#8201;g., NO, IL&#8208;6, and TNF&#8208;&#945;) by up&#8208;regulating the expression of anti&#8208;apoptotic protein (e.&#8201;g., Bcl&#8208;2). As an investigation of alleviating oxidative stress by the mitochondrial localization of antioxidant, this work may establish an experimental foundation for the regulation of cellular redox balance, as well as provide different insights for the clinical development of antioxidant drug delivery systems in the treatment of ocular disease.

         <title>The Unusual Mesophases and Properties Exhibited by a Family of Glycosteroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article describes the synthesis and characterization of a family of &#8220;Janus&#8221; amphiphiles comprising disaccharide head groups and alkaloid units joined via a methylene linker, and bearing a lateral aliphatic chain. The condensed phases formed by self&#8208;organization of the products as a function of temperature were characterized by DSC, thermal POM, and SAXS, allied with computational modelling and simulations.







Abstract
In this article we describe research on the synthesis and characterization of a family of &#8220;Janus&#8221; amphiphiles composed of disaccharide head groups and alkaloid units joined together via a methylene linker, and bearing a lateral aliphatic chain of varying length. The condensed phases formed by self&#8208;organization of the products as a function of temperature were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, thermal polarized light microscopy, and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, allied with computational modelling and simulations. Structural studies on heating specimens from the solid showed that some homologues exhibited lamellar, columnar and bicontinuous mesophases, whereas the same homologues revealed different phase sequences on cooling from the amorphous liquid. We explore these unusual results, which are revealed via supercooling.

         <title>Creating Dual Active Sites in Ru&#8208;doped FeMn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three metals and two reactions: Trace&#8208;ruthenium&#8208;doped two&#8208;dimensional manganese&#8208;based MOFs have been demonstrated as highly active and stable bifunctional catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method.







Abstract
The design of well&#8208;engineered bifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial for achieving durable and efficient performance in overall water splitting. In this study, Ru&#8208;doped FeMn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 itself has Ru sites and generates FeMnOOH under catalytic conditions, forming dual active sites for overall water splitting. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Ru dopants exhibit optimized binding strength for H* and enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. Moreover, the Mn sites within FeMnOOH lower the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (from O* to OOH*), serving as the active centre for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The incorporation of Ru significantly improves the electron transfer properties of FeMn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and enhances its water adsorption capacity, synergistically boosting its bifunctional activity. This strategy of designing dual active sites provides new insights into the development of bifunctional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) for efficient overall water splitting.

         <title>Development of Off&#8208;On Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Probes for Sensitive In Vivo Imaging of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Species with Enhanced Pharmacokinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a novel A&#946; species&#8208;sensing NIR fluorescent probes NIR&#8208;1 with enhanced in&#8197;vivo pharmacokinetics and low non&#8208;specific interaction due to the introduction of water&#8208;soluble and biocompatible morpholine and PEG chain. NIR&#8208;1 was further demonstrated to be an effective fluorescent tool for the specific detection of soluble and insoluble A&#946; species in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
The fluorescent imaging of pathologically accumulated &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) proteins is of significant importance to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the paper, we prepare two new NIR probes, NIR&#8208;1 and NIR&#8208;2, through hydrophilic modification of introducing water&#8208;soluble bioactive groups such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) and morpholine to tune in&#8197;vivo pharmacokinetics for specific detection of soluble and insoluble A&#946; species. The in&#8197;vitro assessments confirm that both NIR&#8208;1 and NIR&#8208;2 display strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence (FL) enhancement upon interaction with A&#946;42 monomers, oligomers or aggregates (&#955;em&gt;670&#8197;nm) and show highly sensitive, rapid and selective response towards A&#946;42 species. After i.&#8201;v. injection, each probe showed fast blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) penetration and immediately produced intense FL signals in the brain of APP/PS1 AD model mice at 10&#8197;min. Moreover, compared with NIR&#8208;2, NIR&#8208;1 bearing a hydrophilic PEG chain displayed not only more rapid clearance but also lower background signal to efficiently distinguish APP/PS1 mice and wild&#8208;type mice with higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, which was further validated by ex vivo histological staining of brain tissues. Therefore, due to its excellent pharmacokinetics, NIR&#8208;1 shows great promise as an effective NIR probe for specific detection of A&#946; species.

         <title>A Practical Synthetic Route to Cinnolines: Application to the Design and Synthesis of RSV NNI Inhibitor JNJ&#8208;8003 Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical and efficient synthetic route was developed to access diverse cinnolines. The route obviates the use of diazonium intermediates. This methodology allowed faster synthesis of JNJ&#8208;8003 analogues via late&#8208;stage functionalization to find better Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) inhibitors.







Abstract
The manuscript describes the development of an efficient synthetic route to cinnolines, facilitating faster access to JNJ&#8208;8003 related Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) non&#8208;nucleoside (NNI) inhibitors. Starting from correctly functionalized aryl halides, a Sonogashira reaction followed by SNAr reaction with hydrazine 1,2&#8208;dicabroxylate reagents provided dihydrocinnolines directly via in&#8197;situ 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization. The dihydrocinnolines were conveniently transformed to corresponding cinnolines in one step. Notably, this three&#8208;step route to cinnolines is more practical and safer than traditional methods that involve hazardous diazo intermediates. The methodology demonstrated a broad substrate scope. Strategic selection of a readily available aryl halide enabled the synthesis of diverse cinnolines that served as JNJ&#8208;8003 analogues through late&#8208;stage functionalization. Furthermore, by capitalizing the inherent reactivity of aryl halides toward SNAr reactions, we explored the synthesis of various heteroaromatic cinnolines. Given the extensive biological properties exhibited by cinnolines, our approach is poised to inspire further investigations in this field.

         <title>Hysteresis Photomodulation within Photochromic Assemblies of [Dy(Tp2&#8722;py)F]+ Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets : Influence of the Supramolecular Magnetic Couplings.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several assemblies of Dysprosium based SMMs with photochromic ligands featuring full photoconversion of the ligands within single crystals are reported. Magnetic slow relaxation as well as magnetic hysteresis are observed and can be both modulated upon light irradiation. The supramolecular organization plays a major role in driving the nature of the observed hysteresis photomodulation.







Abstract
A 1D coordination compound made of a photochromic dithienylethene linker and [Dy(Tp2&#8722;py)F]+ units (with Tp2&#8722;py=tris(3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolyl)hydroborate) and having tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate counterions is reported. Full photoconversion from the closed isomer to the open isomer of the dithienylethene within single crystals allow for monitoring of the transformation by photocrystallography. Magnetic slow relaxation as well as magnetic hysteresis are observed and can be both modulated upon light irradiation. Comparison with previously published structures with similar components highlights the role of the supramolecular organization, and of dipolar couplings within these compounds, in driving the nature of the observed hysteresis photomodulation.

         <title>Dual Charge&#8208;Transfer Emission in Chalcone&#8208;based Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor System and The Modulation of Down&#8208;Conversion of Triplet Exciton with the Polarity of the Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has recently emerged as a promising process with significant potential to advance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) for display applications. The donor&#8208;acceptor system is a well&#8208;known molecular arrangement exhibiting TADF properties. However, our investigation into the chalcone&#8208;based donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) system (SKG1) reveals that the en&#8208;one bridging unit in chalcone plays a crucial role in the reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) process and may be responsible for the existence of two conformational isomers. In stark contrast with the conventional endothermic TADF process, the designed molecule follows a down&#8208;converted cold rISC pathway that also from a higher&#8208;lying triplet (Tn) state to the lowest singlet (S1) state (in toluene) with remarkably short delayed fluorescence lifetime of 350 ns. Additionally, this rISC process is found to be sensitive to the polarity of the medium. The UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR transient absorption spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) process within &lt;100ps and the involvement of higher lying triplet state in rISC process. This comprehensive research deepens the understanding of the rISC mechanism and paves the way for developing next&#8208;generation OLED materials using D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;based delayed emitters.</dc:description>

In stark contrast with the conventional endothermic TADF process, the designed molecule follows a down-converted cold rISC pathway that also from a higher-lying triplet (Tn) state to the lowest singlet (S1) state (in toluene) with remarkably short delayed fluorescence lifetime of 350 ns. Additionally, this rISC process is found to be sensitive to the polarity of the medium. The UV-vis-NIR transient absorption spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) process within &amp;lt;100ps and the involvement of higher lying triplet state in rISC process. This comprehensive research deepens the understanding of the rISC mechanism and paves the way for developing next-generation OLED materials using D-&#960;-A-based delayed emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substitution and Electron Transfer in Diborane&#8208;Quinone Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dual reactivity of boron compounds as Lewis acids and electron donors has spurred the development of a metallomimetic chemistry of boron compounds as a topical research theme. In this work we elaborate on the reaction of specially&#8208;designed diborane(4) compounds with quinones, as a prime example showing their dual (metallomimetic) chemistry as a Lewis acid and electron donor. The quinone is first coordinated to the diborane and then reduced by intramolecular electron transfer from the B&#8208;B bond to a quinone &#960;* orbital. A variety of substitution reactions of the catecholate&#8208;diborane reaction product was carried out, leading to new catecholato&#8208;diborane compounds and thereby shedding light on the likely mechanisms. Notably, the results disclose the importance of a facile coordination&#8208;mode change of the catecholato ligand (end&#8208;on to bridging) for substitution reactions and for the diborane&#8208;quinone reactions. The results contribute to the further advancement in the use of diboranes with dual reactivity for substrate binding and reduction.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of (L)MX (L = isocyanide; M = Cu(I) or Au(I); X = chloride or carboranyl) complexes have been prepared. The first examples of isocyanide Cu(I) chloride complexes with 1:1 stoichiometry between isocyanide and CuCl are reported and structurally characterised. The photophysical properties of (RNC)AuCl and (RNC)Au(&#951;1&#8208;carboranyl) complexes have been investigated. Complexes (RNC)Au(&#951;1&#8208;carboranyl) show no aurophilic Au&#8208;Au interactions and emit long&#8208;lived deep&#8208;blue phosphorescence up to 377 &#956;s. The radioluminescence of these gold complexes was studied to show a superior radioluminescence stability for the gold(carboranyl) complexes compared to gold chloride materials&#160;under constant high energy X&#8208;ray radiation of 350 keV.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence of Aqueous Assemblies Regulated by Integral Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water serves not only as a solvent but also as an integral component (interstitial water) in aqueous colloids self&#8208;assembled from POSS&#8208;NDI&#8208;POSS (POSS = polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes, NDI = naphthalene diimide). The interstitial water confined within these colloids is attributed to the steric hindrance of the bulky POSS groups, which dissipates energy and quenches the fluorescence (FL). Control experiments with NDI molecules bearing less steric side groups (propyl or octyl), namely C3&#8208;NDI&#8208;C3 and C8&#8208;NDI&#8208;C8, confirm this role of water in structural assembly and optical function. This discovery opens new possibilities for the innovation of aqueous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Blue Electroluminescence Based on A Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor with Pyrene Bridge: Weak Charge&#8208;transfer (CT) For High Luminescence and Considerable Exciton Utilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Blue emitters are crucial in the organic light emitting diode (OLED) industry and scientific field. In this work, we prepared a novel donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) molecular PCZ&#8208;P&#8208;PY using pyrene as a bridge to construct hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) state with weak charge&#8208;transfer (CT) property. This excited state design give rise to the high photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY), more importantly, it is also responsible for the high exciton utilization efficiency (EUE) by constructing efficient hot&#8208;exciton channel. As a result, exceeding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.7% is achieved in the non&#8208;doped OLED of PCZ&#8208;P&#8208;PY with exceeding EUE of up to 90%.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomatization reactions are among the most straightforward and efficient methods for creating sp3&#8208;rich cyclic systems from simple, readily available arenes. These reactions have been widely applied in the total synthesis of natural products, medicinal chemistry, and material sciences. The fruitful development of dearomatization strategies and methodologies targeting single aromatic substrate over the past decades has paved the way for more sophisticated multiple dearomatization processes, which offer greater advantages in constructing molecular complexity. Double dearomatization reactions have made significant pioneering strides in recent years. This review will provide an overview of the strategies and detailed examples of multiple dearomatization reactions involving various aromatic compounds, along with a discussion of the related mechanisms and the major challenges that remain in this intriguing yet formidable field.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Caesium Monensinate A: Crystallographic Evidence for the Formation of Dinuclear Coordination Species in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The polyether ionophore monensin A (MonH), applied as silver monensinate, reacts with caesium cations to form a dinuclear complex [Mon2Cs2] the structure of which has been solved by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Two Cs+ ions are located in the hydrophilic cage of two ligand anions, achieving coordination number eight. In addition, the metal cations are bridged by two functional groups of monensinate A, completing the inner tenfold coordination sphere. NMR studies show that the dinuclear complex dissociates to its mononuclear counterparts&#160;in methanol solutions. Further molecular dynamics theoretical modelling of the interaction of monensinate A with alkali metal ions reveals the effect of solvent polarity on the zipping ability of the ligand. Thus, in methanol, used as an explicit solvent, potassium and rubidium cations fully occupy the cavity of the ligand, whereas the sodium monensinate exists in an &#8220;open&#8221; form, with Na+ ions still interacting with the monodentate carboxylate group. The replacement of methanol by the less polar chloroform&#160;induces the folding of monensinate A and the formation of &#8220;closed&#8221; structures with all group 1 metal cations. The obtained data explain the specifics in the behaviour of monensinate A caused by the environment, e.g., physical state or solvent.</dc:description>

Further molecular dynamics theoretical modelling of the interaction of monensinate A with alkali metal ions reveals the effect of solvent polarity on the zipping ability of the ligand. Thus, in methanol, used as an explicit solvent, potassium and rubidium cations fully occupy the cavity of the ligand, whereas the sodium monensinate exists in an &#8220;open&#8221; form, with Na+ ions still interacting with the monodentate carboxylate group. The replacement of methanol by the less polar chloroform&#160;induces the folding of monensinate A and the formation of &#8220;closed&#8221; structures with all group 1 metal cations. The obtained data explain the specifics in the behaviour of monensinate A caused by the environment, e.g., physical state or solvent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective On&#8208;Surface Metalation and Uncommon Reordering of Self&#8208;Assembled Macrocyclic Biquinazoline Ligands on Ag(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The macrocyclic biquinazoline ligand, H&#8208;Mabiq, presents a central and a peripheral site for the coordination of metal ions, making the adsorption on solid surfaces promising for the creation of self&#8208;assembled bimetallic two&#8208;dimensional platforms. Here, we apply an on&#8208;surface metalation strategy under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions to guide the synthesis of metalated species and study sequential metalation patterns. We find that cobalt (as well as iron) metalation on the Ag(111) surface preferentially occurs at the macrocyclic centre without further metal coordination to the peripheral site. Nevertheless, starting from a densely packed, self&#8208;assembled H&#8208;Mabiq monolayer, the modification of the central cavity by Co is accompanied by an unusual, metalation&#8208;induced phase transformation which gives evidence of modified lateral / interfacial interactions. The selective metalation of one molecular site opens up an on&#8208;surface route to create bimetallic networks incorporating select metal ions at different locations.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrocyclopropanes as Valuable Building Blocks in Organic Synthesis and Biology: Exploring the Origin of the Nitro Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropane derivatives serve as important building blocks in organic synthesis, due to their three&#8208;membered stretched ring. Nitro&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes (NCPs) represent a special class of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) that contain a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nitro group as substituent on the cyclopropyl moiety. Due to the versatile nature of the nitro group, which can be converted into other functional azo groups or heterocyclic scaffolds, NCPs are considered important building blocks in the design of complex organic compounds. Herein, the present review is organized in two main sections focused on the synthesis and application of NCPs. The part containing the synthetic methodologies towards NCPs has been further divided into distinct sections based mainly on the nature of the starting materials, such as: a) from nitroalkenes, b) from nitro&#8208;bearing diazo compounds, c) from nitroalkanes in combination with alkenes, d) from aminocyclopropanes under oxidative conditions, and e) from various nitro compounds, through miscellaneous processes. In the part concerning the applications and uses of NCPs, the categorization includes three main subcategories, concerning their reduction to 1&#8208;aminocyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acids (ACC), the ring opening of NCPs leading to valuable open&#8208;chain heterocycles, and the ring expansion to larger cyclic and heterocyclic compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative Giese Addition Utilizing Thioxanthone or Thioxanthone&#8208;TfOH Complex as the Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic photochemistry is an alternative, green and sustainable approach in organic synthesis, offering the possibility for the discovery of novel reactivities. Carboxylic acids are abundant and widely used as suitable radical precursors for light&#8208;mediated processes, providing access to products that are not accessible via conventional methods. Herein, we report a green, cheap, metal&#8208;free, photochemical decarboxylative protocol for the 1,4&#8208;radical conjugate addition (Giese reaction) using thioxanthone, a commercially available organic molecule, or a thioxanthone&#8208;triflic acid (TfOH) complex, as the photocatalyst, under LED 427 nm irradiation. A wide range of carboxylic acids, amino acids and Michael acceptors has been tested, affording the desired products in good to high yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Surfactants via Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A borrowing hydrogen approach to produce bio&#8208;based surfactants is described. The process utilizes ubiquitous amino acids and common alcohols without protecting group manipulations. Surfactants are synthesized in a single step using a commercially available ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst in a waste&#8208;free manner with nearly ideal atom economy. The versatility of the products is shown by further derivatization resulting in novel Gemini surfactants and a related quaternary ammonia salt. The analysis of selected compounds shows remarkable properties as surfactants. Further studies show their potential biodegradability in nature, which enhances the broad application profile of the sustainable products prepared in this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Helicene&#8211;Fluorescein Hybrids: A Reversible Base&#8208;triggered (Chir)optical Switch with Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel circularly&#8208;polarized&#8208;luminescence (CPL) materials were designed and synthesized by integrating the intrinsic chirality of helicene with the acid/base&#8208;responsive properties of fluorescein. The synthesized helicene&#8211;fluorescein hybrids exhibit reversible switching between blue fluorescence under neutral conditions and red fluorescence under basic conditions. Furthermore, these hybrid compounds demonstrate unique chiroptical switching behavior with a rare base&#8208;triggered CPL sign inversion, where (P)&#8208;isomers show a negative CPL signal around 450 nm under neutral conditions and a positive signal around 620 nm under basic conditions, with three&#8208;fold enhanced dissymmetry factors (|glum|) under basic conditions. The structural basis for this switching was elucidated through TD&#8208;DFT calculations, revealing distinct angles between magnetic and electric transition dipole moments in closed versus open forms. Live&#8208;cell imaging experiments using HeLa cells revealed that the hybrid compounds exhibit intracellular red emission with minimal cytotoxicity, thus promising potential as chiral fluorescent probes for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hybrid BN&#8208;Doped Nanographene with Narrow Emission Bandwidths for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational screening, synthesis and characterization identified BN&#8208;containing candidate 1 as a promising narrow bandwidth chromophore. BN doped nanographene exhibits blue fluorescence at 441&#8197;nm with an extraordinarily narrow fluorescence peak with full width at half maximum (FWHM)=10&#8211;11&#8197;nm that outperforms narrow bandwidths of the incumbent references. Utility of the compound for long lifetime narrow bandwidth OLEDs has also been demonstrated







Abstract
We describe synthesis of BN&#8208;doped nanographene containing five phenylene units, boron and nitrogen atoms with alternating ortho&#8208;disposition, as well as direct B&#8722;N connections. Resulting BN doped nanographene exhibits blue fluorescence at 441&#8197;nm with an extraordinarily narrow fluorescence peak with a full width at half maximum (FWHM)=10&#8211;11&#8197;nm. Crystallography reveals supramolecular organization of this compound in the crystal phase. Initial organic light emitting device (OLED) data suggest that the presence of a directly connected B&#8722;N isostere can lead to devices with sufficiently long lifetime as well as narrow emission electro&#8208;luminescence peaks necessary for OLED applications.

         <title>Oligoethylene Phosphoramidate&#8208;Based Kinase Inhibitor Prodrugs &#8211; Solubility, Enzyme Inhibition, and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinase inhibitors are functionalized with oligoethylene glycol chains via a pH&#8208;labile linker, improving water solubility (optimal at n=3 &#8211; 4) while retaining enzyme inhibition and hydrolysis properties. This study highlights the impact of chain length on solubility, providing a versatile strategy for designing kinase inhibitor prodrugs.







Abstract
The efficiency of kinase inhibiting cancer therapeutics is often limited by their poor solubility in water. PEGylation is one possible strategy to improve the solubility of the drug, however, means to cleave off the PEG after reaching the target is important to make use of the therapeutic effects of the native drug. Moreover, the length of the PEG chains will have an effect on the solubility and binding. In this study, we want to extend our understanding of solubilizing oligo ethylene glycol (OEG) chains connected to kinase inhibitors using a pH labile phosphoramidate linker. We synthesize a library of drug&#8208;OEG conjugates for Ceritinib, Crizotinib, Palbociclib, and Ribocilib kinase inhibitors with n=2, 3, 4 and 8 OEG repeat units. We study the influence on water solubility, enzyme inhibition, and pH induced hydrolysis. A maximum in solubility is obtained for n=3 or 4. We show that small differences in chain length can strongly influence the water solubility, while all other properties remain relatively comparable.

         <title>Synthesis of a Transient Cationic Phosphaborene and its Trapping by Facile Aliphatic C&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstraction of bromide from a B&#8208;brominated phosphaborene stabilized by a cyclic alkylamino carbene results in the formation of a transient cationic phosphaborene, which undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;H activation to yield a phosphinoborenium cation. DFT calculations reveal a barrier of only 8&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for this transformation, emphasizing the high reactivity of cationic phosphaborenes







Abstract
The synthesis of a transient cationic phosphaborene [(Mes*)P=B(CAAC)]+ (Mes*=2,4,6,&#8211;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl, CAAC=cyclic alkylamino carbene) by halide abstraction from the B&#8208;brominated analogue is reported. This species was found to undergo rapid and selective intramolecular aliphatic C&#8722;H bond activation to yield a phosphinoborenium cation, which undergoes facile deprotonation to give a cyclic base&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene. Computational investigation of the mechanism of C&#8722;H activation indicates a boron&#8208;centred activation route with an exceptionally low barrier of 8&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, followed by a nearly barrierless hydride migration from boron to phosphorus. This underscores the enhanced reactivity of phosphaborenes compared to their lighter iminoborane analogues and indicates that steric stabilization alone is likely insufficient to isolate persistent cationic phosphaborenes, necessitating the use of alternative design strategies.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Long&#8208;Chain Hydrocarbons: Investigating the asymmetric C&#8208;C Coupling Mechanism on Pd3Au Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density hydrocarbons is pivotal for addressing energy and environmental challenges. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the conversion of CO2 to long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons is both crucial and complex. In this study, we employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the C&#8208;C coupling mechanisms responsible for the formation of C2&#8208;C4 products on Pd3Au catalysts. Our findings highlight the sequential formation of C2&#8208;C1 bonds via asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling as a critical pathway for generating C3 product, which is essential for controlling product selectivity. Detailed analysis of coupling reactions involving CCH2* and CCH3* intermediates with various C1 species indicates that these asymmetric coupling events are energetically favorable and play a decisive role in the selective assembly of carbon atoms into longer hydrocarbon chains. Moreover, we propose a mechanism wherein the asymmetric coupling of C1&#8208;C3 intermediate leads to a diverse array of C4 products. This process underscores the importance of CH2 group coupling with C3 intermediates in forming long&#8208;chain hydrocarbons. Our work provides valuable insights into optimizing catalyst design for improved selectivity towards higher hydrocarbons in CO2 reduction processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of pH&#8208;Responsive SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS Hydrogels via Michael Addition for Controlled Drug Release and Enhanced Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, thiolated sodium alginate (SA) and hydrophilic, polymerizable Janus&#8208;type polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (AS&#8208;POSS) are&#160;synthesized by introducing thiol and sulfonic acid groups, respectively.&#160;A series of pH&#8208;responsive SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS nanocomposite hydrogels are&#160;successfully prepared through Michael addition reactions between the thiol groups of thiolated sodium alginate and the double bonds in the molecular chains of AS&#8208;POSS and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA).&#160;This&#160;reaction proceeds rapidly under&#160;physiological conditions&#160;without requiring initiators or catalysts.&#160;As the content of AS&#8208;POSS increases, the pore size within the hydrogel decreases, and the network structure becomes denser, with significant improvements in mechanical properties. The hydrogel exhibits excellent pH sensitivity, showing lower swelling in acidic media compared to neutral media, and undergoing hydrolysis and losing stability in alkaline media. Moreover, the incorporation of AS&#8208;POSS significantly enhances the drug&#8208;loading capacity (85.7%) and encapsulation efficiency (72.1%) of doxorubicin (DOX). The drug is released faster in weakly acidic environments, with a cumulative release rate reaching 80.4%, demonstrating excellent targeting and controlled release properties. Cytotoxicity tests show that the SA/PEGDA/AS&#8208;POSS hydrogel has good biocompatibility and exhibits effective tumor&#8208;killing ability, indicating its great potential as a drug carrier with promising applications in biomedical materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A compounds, with fluorene and its heteroanalogs (carbazole, dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene) as the donor units and phenanthroimidazole as the acceptor, were designed and synthesized for non&#8208;volatile memory device applications. The effect of single&#8208;atom substitution on memory behavior was examined through optical, electrochemical, and computational studies. The photophysical studies confirm a significant intramolecular charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor unit, and the electrochemical analysis shows an irreversible anodic peak (0.99&#8208;1.21 V) with an optimal band gap ranging from 2.80 to 2.88 eV. All the compounds exhibited non&#8208;volatile binary WORM memory behaviour with an ON/OFF current ratio of 105 and 103. The devices also showed excellent stability over 100 cycles and maintained a retention time of 4000 s. Notably, the compound with carbazole substitution displayed a lower threshold voltage and a higher ON/OFF current ratio of 105. Density functional theory calculations confirmed that the combined effects of charge transfer and charge trapping mechanisms are crucial to the resistive switching mechanisms observed. This work highlights the potential of single atom substitution in D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A systems, providing valuable insights for designing high&#8208;performance data storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of Antisense DNA&#8208;Camptothecin Amphiphile into Glutathione&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticles for Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have witnessed the rapid growth of combination therapy for the treatment of cancer. Chemo and antisense DNA therapies are two clinically proven and efficient treatment modalities for cancer. However, direct delivery of both chemo and antisense oligonucleotides into the cancerous cells is challenging and hence there is a high demand for the development of new strategies that permit the direct delivery of chemo and antisense therapeutic agents in a targeted fashion. Herein, we show a supramolecular approach for the direct delivery of hydrophobic chemo drug and cell impermeable antisense oligonucleotide into a cancer cell in a targeted fashion. Synthesis of an amphiphile (DNA1&#8208;CPT) consist of hydrophobic camptothecin (CPT) conjugated to an antisense oligonucleotide (DNA1) via glutathione&#8208;responsive disulphide linker is reported. Self&#8208;assembly of DNA1&#8208;CPT results in the formation of GSH&#8208;responsive NPs with CPT as the hydrophobic core and DNA1 as the hydrophilic shell. Self&#8208;assembled NPs exhibits excellent cellular internalization via endocytosis pathway, and the high concentration of glutathione inside the cancer cells causes the cleavage of disulphide bond of the NPs and trigger the simultaneous release of CPT and DNA1a. Enhanced cytotoxicity is observed for the NPs due to the synergetic combination of chemo and antisense DNA therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;Controlled DNA Switching Circuits with Multi&#8208;State Responsiveness for Logic Computation and Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic control of DNA circuit functionality is essential for constructing chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that implement complex functions. The triplex has been utilized for dynamically regulating the diverse functionalities of DNA circuits due to its distinctive pH responsiveness. However, it is challenging for triplexes to independently regulate the functionality of DNA circuits, as various triplexes were often required for DNA circuits to function in complex environments, which adds complexity to the design and control of dynamic circuits. Here, we proposed a pH&#8208;controlled multi&#8208;state DNA switching circuit construction strategy to realize dynamic regulation among three states through conformational transitions of the triplex. In addition, by leveraging the regulatory role of multi&#8208;state DNA switching circuits on the toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction, we constructed switchable DNA circuits for logic computation and control of hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We confirmed that the designed DNA switching circuits exhibited multi&#8208;state responsiveness, allowing for different logical operations at varying pH levels and programmable control of the diverse reaction pathways in the HCR. Our strategy offers a convenient approach for the intelligent response and dynamic regulation of large&#8208;scale CRNs and DNA nanostructure self&#8208;assembly. It promises applications in biosensing, disease detection and drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Apoptosis of Cancer Cells Induced by a Kinase&#8208;Responsive Peptide Amphiphile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organelle targeting is a useful approach in drug development for cancer therapy. Peptide amphiphiles are good candidates for targeting specific organelles because they can be engineered into a wide range of molecular structures, enabling customization for specific functional needs. We have developed a peptide amphiphile, C16&#8208;(EY)3, that can respond to tyrosine kinase activity and undergo phosphorylation inside cancer cells. C16&#8208;(EY)3 selectively induced apoptosis in cancer cells that overexpressed tyrosine kinase. The peptide amphiphile self&#8208;assembled into nanofibers on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, reducing the ER membrane fluidity and triggering ER stress. The mechanism of the cancer cell death induced by C16&#8208;(EY)3 was shown to involve phosphorylation by tyrosine kinase, ER stress induction, and the subsequent activation of caspase&#8208;4, &#8208;12, and &#8208;9, which ultimately triggered apoptosis through the activation of caspase&#8208;3 and &#8208;7. In vivo studies further validated the antitumor efficacy of C16&#8208;(EY)3 as transcutaneous administration of the peptide amphiphile inhibited tumor growth in mice. This study elucidated the mechanism of apoptosis induced by the peptide amphiphile, indicating the potential of peptide amphiphiles as organelle&#8208;targeting cancer therapeutics and providing a novel strategy for the development of selective and potent anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Preorganization of Amine&#8208;functionalized Diacetylene Monomers in their Crystals Allows their Topochemical Polymerization to Polydiacetylenes Capable of CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized three different diacetylenes from ethynyl&#8208;anilines and the N&#8722;H&#8230;N hydrogen bonding in their crystals preorganized them for topochemical polymerization. Heat induced topochemical polymerization yielded three amino&#8208;functionalized PDAs, which were found to be mesoporous. These polymers exhibited CO2 physisorption as a function of their porosity.







Abstract
We designed and synthesized three diacetylene monomers M1&#8208;M3 having two NH2 groups. As anticipated, the NH2 groups aided the preorganization of these monomers by N&#8722;H&#8230;N hydrogen bonding. In the crystals of monomer M1 and M2, the intermolecular N&#8722;H&#8230;N hydrogen bonding preorganized the diyne units in an orientation suitable for their topochemical polymerization, but in the case of monomer M3, the distance was slightly larger than that recommended for the topochemical reaction. However, upon heating, all the three monomers underwent topochemical polymerization to yield polydiacetylenes P1&#8208;P3 respectively. All three polymers have been characterized using PXRD, Raman, MALDI&#8208;TOF and solid&#8208;state UV spectroscopy. Furthermore, we investigated the abilities of these amine&#8208;functionalized polymers to capture CO2 gas. Polymer P1, which had a larger surface area, demonstrated the highest CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.28&#8197;mmol g&#8722;1 at 273&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, compared to the other two polymers.

         <title>Helical Supramolecular Polymers Formed via Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Host&#8208;Guest Complexation of Chiral Bisporphyrin Monomers with Trinitrofluorenone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intermolecular host&#8208;guest complexation of a bisporphyrin&#8208;TNF head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomer possessing a chiral binaphthyl linker was employed to construct helically twisted supramolecular polymers. Atomic force microscopy revealed well&#8208;defined right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical morphologies, with the helicity governed by the axial chirality of the binaphthyl linker.







Abstract
The intermolecular host&#8208;guest complexation of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers consisting of cleft&#8208;shaped bisporphyrin and trinitrofluorenone units connected by a chiral binaphthyl linker was employed to construct helically twisted supramolecular polymers. Results from 1H NMR, diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy, and viscometry experiments revealed that the supramolecular polymerization of these monomers follows a ring&#8208;chain competition mechanism. The introduction of bulky substituents at the linker significantly suppressed the formation of macrocyclic oligomers, whereas smaller alkyl chains facilitated the formation of the cyclic form. The chirally twisted structures of the supramolecular polymers were confirmed using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;configurations of the binaphthyl linkers induced right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical structures, respectively, in the supramolecular polymer chains. The absence of cooperativity in the supramolecular copolymerization of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;1&#8201;a resulted in the formation of stereo&#8208;random supramolecular copolymers.

&lt;p&gt;The intermolecular host-guest complexation of a bisporphyrin-TNF head-to-tail monomer possessing a chiral binaphthyl linker was employed to construct helically twisted supramolecular polymers. Atomic force microscopy revealed well-defined right- and left-handed helical morphologies, with the helicity governed by the axial chirality of the binaphthyl linker.

         <title>Upgrade of Weak &#963;&#8208;Hole Bond Donors via Cr(CO)3 Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallographic studies and theoretical calculation prove that the &#951;6&#8208;coordination of the neutral Cr(CO)3 moiety by arenes is a general approach for activating the &#963;&#8208;hole donor ability of heteroatoms appended to the arene.







Abstract
Molecular recognition mediated by &#963;&#8208;hole interactions is enhanced as the electrostatic potential at the &#963;&#8208;hole becomes increasingly positive. Traditional methods to strengthen &#963;&#8208;hole donor ability of atoms such as halogens often involve covalent modifications, such as, introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (neutral or positively charged) or electrochemical oxidation. Metal coordination, a relatively underexplored approach, offers a promising alternative. In this study, &#951;6&#8208;coordination of Cr(CO)3 to haloarenes, a neutral system, is demonstrated to significantly increase the electrophilic character of halogen bond donors, enabling weak donors such as chloroanisole to form short and directional Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O halogen bonds. Structural characterization using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational analysis of a series of &#951;6&#8208;Cr(CO)3&#8208;coordinated haloarenes provides evidence for this enhancement. Furthermore, the effect is shown to extend to other heteroatomic substituents on the coordinated arene, e.&#8201;g., other halogen atoms as well as elements of groups 16, 15, and 14 of the periodic table, broadening the scope of this approach.

         <title>Comparative Study of Iminodibenzyl and Diphenylamine Derivatives as Hole Transport Materials in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces novel fluorene&#8208;based hole transport materials (HTMs) for perovskite solar cells (PSCs), integrating iminodibenzyl and diphenylamine moieties. These materials exhibit remarkable photostability, optical, and thermal properties. Among them, TDF&#8208;2 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38&#8201;%. The findings highlight iminodibenzyl's potential to address stability and cost challenges, paving the way for next&#8208;generation HTMs in PSCs.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently achieved over 26&#8201;% power conversion efficiency, challenging the dominance of silicon&#8208;based alternatives. This progress is significantly driven by innovations in hole transport materials (HTMs), which notably influence the efficiency and stability of PSCs. However, conventional organic HTMs like Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD and PTAA, although highly efficient, suffer from thermal degradation, moisture ingress, and high cost. This study explores the potential of iminodibenzyl, a moiety known for its strong electron&#8208;donating capabilities in pharmaceutical applications, as a novel HTM. A series of fluorene&#8208;based derivatives incorporating iminodibenzyl (TMF&#8208;2 and TDF&#8208;2) and diphenylamine (TMF&#8208;1 and TDF&#8208;1) units were synthesized and characterized. The new HTMs demonstrated commendable optical, electrochemical, and thermal properties, as well as enhanced photostability. Among them, TDF&#8208;2 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38&#8201;%, the highest of the new materials. Although these efficiencies are slightly lower than the benchmark PTAA (20.20&#8201;%), the study underscores the potential of iminodibenzyl to enhance photostability and increase HOMO levels, making it a promising candidate for future HTM development in PSCs.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles Derived from Chelating N&#8208;Donor Ligands: Historical Advances, Recent Highlights, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry of PN heterocycles is underexplored relative to systems based on main group atoms such as boron. However, strategies for their production have been developed. As a result, the application of PN heterocycles as functional molecular materials, in small molecule activation chemistry and catalysis, and bioimaging and therapeutics have emerged. Seminal examples, recent highlights, and future opportunities are discussed.







Abstract
The exploration of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles derived from chelating N&#8208;donor ligands is an area of research that has lagged behind the development of similar heterocycles based on other main group elements, most notably boron. The fact that phosphorus and nitrogen are both group 15 elements and that their compounds are most commonly viewed as Lewis bases likely contributes to this observation. However, through judicious ligand design and creative use of phosphorus sources that render phosphorus as Lewis acidic and/or electron poor, a variety of heterocyclic architectures are possible. In this article, we highlight selected examples of phosphorus adducts of bidentate, tridentate, and tetradentate N&#8208;donor ligands that have shown utility as functional molecular materials, in small molecule activation and catalysis, and as therapeutics and diagnostics in chemical biology. Finally, we look forward to the future of this emerging area and provide commentary on the unique opportunities available to researchers working within the field of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen heterocycle chemistry.

         <title>Carborane&#8208;Decorated Siloles with Highly Efficient Solid&#8208;State Emissions &#8211; What Drives the Photophysical Properties?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active units were combined to create new hybrids. The photophysical behaviour is dominated by the silole unit, while the solid&#8208;state emission can be tailored via the supramolecular structure influenced by the carborane moiety.







Abstract
New hybrids were synthesised by linking carboranes and siloles, both of which are known as aggregation&#8208;induced emission active units. Although most of the newly synthesised systems do not display notable quantum yield either in solution or in the aggregated state, they emit strongly in the solid&#8208;state, and a quantum yield of up to 100&#8201;% can be achieved. The tailorable quantum yield can be attributed to the packing of the molecules in the crystal lattice ruled by the carborane and phenyl moieties according to the SC&#8208;XRD data. Our experimental results, complemented by density functional theory calculations, show that the silole moiety primarily influences the photophysical properties. At the same time, the carborane serves as a steric building block without direct responsibility for the aggregation&#8208;induced emission property. The patterns of substituents can alter the absorption and emission properties.

         <title>Fisetin as a Blueprint for Senotherapeutic Agents &#8211; Elucidating Geroprotective and Senolytic Properties with Molecular Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptional senotherapeutic activity of fisetin, combining both geroprotective and senolytic effects, was validated using computational chemistry tools, establishing it as a cornerstone template for the development of novel agents.







Abstract
Targeting senescent cells and the factors that accelerate this pathological state has recently emerged as a novel field in medicinal chemistry. As attention shifts to synthetic substances, studies on natural agents are often overlooked. In this paper, we present a detailed computational modeling study that encompasses quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics to elucidate the senotherapeutic activity of fisetin, a natural flavonoid. The mitochondrial environment, serving as a proxy for senescence, received special attention. Throughout the study, fisetin's outstanding geroprotective properties&#8208;exhibiting significant potential against &#8901;OOH, O2&#8901;&#8722;, and &#8901;OH radicals, surpassing those of Trolox or ascorbate&#8208;were identified. Furthermore, fisetin demonstrated a high capacity to restore oxidatively damaged biomolecules to their pristine forms, thereby renewing the functionality of proteins and amino acids. The senolytic properties were examined in terms of Bcl&#8208;2 and Bcl&#8208;xL inhibition. The results indicated that fisetin not only binds effectively to these proteins but also, with appropriate modifications, may exhibit specific selectivity toward either target. This study highlights fisetin's remarkable activity in these areas and provides a molecular description of the underlying processes, paving the way for future research.

         <title>Characterization of the Titanium(III) Tris(alkyl) Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 and its Conversion to a Dimeric Alkyl&#8208;Bridged Titanium(IV) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The trigonal pyramidal titanium(III) trialkyl is synthesized in moderate, reproducible yield via the reaction of three equivalents of Li{CH(SiMe3)2} with TiCl3(NMe3)2 in hexanes. The use of the latter solvent is a key feature for the success of the synthetic route. Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 is characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, EPR and electronic spectroscopy.







Abstract
The reaction of three equivalents of LiCH(SiMe3)2 with TiCl3(NMe3)2 afforded the rare homoleptic Ti(III) alkyl Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 (1) which crystallized as blue needles in 32&#8201;% yield. Single crystal X&#8208;Ray data for 1 showed a trigonal pyramidal coordination geometry around titanium, which could be ascribed to weak interactions between the C&#8722;H bonds and the Ti(III) atom based on computational results. X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy gives spectral parameters consistent with the proposed Ti(III) formulation. Solutions of 1 are unstable at room temperature owing to intramolecular C&#8722;H activation that gave a dimeric Ti(IV) complex [{(Me3Si)2HC}Ti{&#956;&#8208;CHSiMe2CHSiMe3}]2 (2).

         <title>Chlorination&#8208;Supported Shrinkage of C60 Fullerene to Non&#8208;classical C58 Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to the memory of Prof. S. I. Troyanov.Carbon cage shrinkage of C60 to C58 was achieved via high&#8208;temperature chlorination with SbCl5/SbCl3 mixture. Two HPLC isolated and structurally characterized compounds, C58(NC1)Cl20 and C58(NC1)Cl24, contain one heptagon, two fused pentagon pairs, one pentagon triple, and one pentagon quartet in their non&#8208;classical carbon cages. Pathways of chlorination promoted skeletal cage transformations via C2 loss and Stone&#8208;Wales rearrangements are discussed in detail.







Abstract
We provide important novel insights into skeletal transformations of fullerene by reporting new cases of cage shrinkage in the most abundant C60 fullerene via a C2 loss. High&#8208;temperature (400&#8211;500&#8201;&#176;C) chlorination of IPR C60 with SbCl5 or SbCl5/SbCl3 mixtures predominantly gives non&#8208;IPR C60Cln compounds via Stone&#8208;Wales rearrangements, but the present study further reveals non&#8208;classical C58Cln chlorofullerenes as by&#8208;products. The new C58(NC1)Cl20 and C58(NC1)Cl24 chlorides have been isolated by air&#8208;free HPLC and structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their non&#8208;classical carbon cages feature one heptagon, two pairs of fused pentagons, one triple&#8208;pentagon junction, and one quartet of sequentially fused pentagons. However, the chlorination patterns and molecular shapes of C58(NC1)Cl20 and C58(NC1)Cl24 are essentially different. We propose the likely multistep transformation pathways toward the new compounds and further report the chlorination&#8208;promoted formation of chlorofullerenes with still smaller fullerene cages.

         <title>An Intelligent Electrochemical Multi&#8208;Enzyme Molecular Machine for Chiral Chemical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces the concept of an intelligent multi&#8208;enzyme molecular machine that integrates electrochemical strategies and enzymatic cascades with real&#8208;time monitoring and control. This system features a modular design and high biotransformation efficiency, streamlining complex synthesis processes and enabling automated, eco&#8208;friendly manufacturing without intermediate steps.







Abstract
In vitro multi&#8208;enzyme synthesis pathways harness the core elements of cellular synthesis while simplifying the complexities of cellular processes, facilitating the production of high&#8208;value chemicals. However, these in&#8197;vitro synthesis processes often operate like a &#8220;black box&#8221; with limited monitoring of each reaction step, leading to a low substrate conversion efficiency. In this study, we present an intelligent multi&#8208;enzyme molecular machine(iMEMM) as a model system for achieving the deracemization of D, L&#8208;phosphinothricin (D, L&#8208;PPT). The entire system leverages electrochemical power and enzyme&#8208;catalyzed (cascade) reactions to establish substrate channel and enhance efficiency. By modularizing each reaction step and using electrochemical real&#8208;time monitoring of the reaction process, a single&#8208;step electrobiotransformation efficiency of up to 98&#8201;% and a chiral target L&#8208;PPT synthesis efficiency exceeding 99&#8201;% have been achieved. This iMEMM eliminates the need for intermediate separation, enabling a &#8220;substrate in, product out&#8221; process. Our research paves the way for future green, intelligent, and automated biological manufacturing.

         <title>Organoselenium Ligand Enabled Selective Electron Tuning for Switchable Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the nickel selenoether electrocatalysts which show tunable reaction centers (nickel or ligand) for HER using mild weak acetic acid in DMF solvent. Synthesized nickel selenoether electrocatalysts (2) follow a ligand&#8208;centered pathway demonstrating remarkably high turnover frequency (kobs) up to 14000&#8197;s&#8722;1 with 93&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency (F.E.). Whereas nickel electrocatalysts (1; having N&#8208;donor ligands with selenoether ligands) follow a metal&#8208;centered HER and show a kobs value of 2110&#8197;s&#8722;1 with F.E. of 98&#8201;%.







Abstract
Unraveling the electronic structure of metal complexes can bring various catalytic possibilities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the electronic effect of metal and ligands modulating and switching the reaction center for HER has yet to be comprehensively analyzed. Herein, we report nickel selenoether electrocatalysts which show tunable reaction centers (nickel or ligand) for HER using mild weak acetic acid in less deprotonating DMF solvent. Synthesized nickel selenoether electrocatalysts which follow a ligand&#8208;centered pathway demonstrated remarkably high turnover frequency (kobs) upto 14000&#8197;s&#8722;1 with 93&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency (F.E.). Whereas Ni&#8208;electrocatalyst having N&#8208;donor and selenoether ligands follow a metal&#8208;centered HER and show kobs value of 2110&#8197;s&#8722;1 with F.E. of 98&#8201;%. A kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) study using CD3CO2D provides kH/kD=0.49 and 13.01 values for two types of catalysts suggestive of metal&#8208;centered and ligand&#8208;centered catalytic behavior, respectively.

Whereas nickel electrocatalysts (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;; having N-donor ligands with selenoether ligands) follow a metal-centered HER and show a k&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; value of 2110&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with F.E. of 98&#8201;%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unraveling the electronic structure of metal complexes can bring various catalytic possibilities for &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;ydrogen &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;volution &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;eaction (HER). However, the electronic effect of metal and ligands modulating and switching the reaction center for HER has yet to be comprehensively analyzed. Herein, we report nickel selenoether electrocatalysts which show tunable reaction centers (nickel or ligand) for HER using mild weak acetic acid in less deprotonating DMF solvent. Synthesized nickel selenoether electrocatalysts which follow a ligand-centered pathway demonstrated remarkably high turnover frequency (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) upto 14000&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 93&#8201;% Faradaic Efficiency (F.E.). Whereas Ni-electrocatalyst having &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-donor and selenoether ligands follow a metal-centered HER and show &lt;i&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; value of 2110&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with F.E. of 98&#8201;%. A kinetic isotopic effect (KIE) study using CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D provides k&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;/k&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;=0.49 and 13.01 values for two types of catalysts suggestive of metal-centered and ligand-centered catalytic behavior, respectively. Also, EPR studies revealed nickel-centered and ligand-centered radicals in two types of Ni-electrocatalysts. Mechanistically, the EPR, CV, and DFT computation studies suggest that the electron density of the selenoether ligand plays a crucial role by acting as an electron reservoir in deciding the reaction pathways, whether hydride formation occurs at metal-centered leading to Ni&#8722;H intermediate or ligand-centered pathways for HER.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
An efficient I2&#8208;promoted Povarov reaction procedure for the synthesis of N&#8208;heteroaromatic benzothiazole and 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;biquinolines was disclosed. This protocol was characterized by broad substrate scope (49 examples, 31&#8211;80&#8201;% yields), large&#8208;scale synthesis, and product downstream derivatization. Based on the rotatable C&#8722;C bond of such bisheterocyclic compounds, compound 4a was successfully developed as a viscosity probe.







Abstract
A straightforward I2&#8208;promoted Povarov multicomponent reaction strategy for the synthesis of N&#8208;heteroaromatic benzothiazoles and 2, 2&#8242;&#8208;biquinolines was described. This methodology involved a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step procedure, tandem iodination/Kornblum oxidation, and [4+2] condensation. This protocol was characterized by broad scope of substrates (49 examples, 31&#8211;80&#8201;% yields), applicable for large&#8208;scale preparation, and downstream derivatization of the products. Photophysical property of the two classes of bisheteroaryl compounds was investigated. Based on the rotatable C&#8722;C bond, 2&#8208;(6&#8208;methylquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[d]thiazole (4&#8201;a) was successfully developed as a viscosity probe, which opened up new hopes and prospects for biomedical applications.

         <title>Molecular Structural Control of the Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Balance in Solids: Structure&#8208;Phase Correlation in DADQs with Enhanced/Switchable Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fundamental correlation of the molecular/supramolecular structural factors that promote amorphous, crystalline and bi&#8208;stable states in molecular solids is derived through spectroscopic investigations, crystallographic analysis and thermal studies of a family of molecular solids based on alkoxyalkyl substituted diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes exhibiting strong and switchable fluorescence. The correlation is used to predict and demonstrate a new functional molecular phase change material.







Abstract
The amorphous/crystalline (A/C) assembly in molecular solids has a direct bearing on their attributes and applications, including mechanical, pharmaceutical, electronic and photophysical. A systematic analysis of the molecular features and interactions that determine the predilection towards the A, C or bi&#8208;stable A&#8208;C states is critical. This fundamental problem is addressed through an exhaustive investigation of a large family of alkoxyalkyl diaminodicyanoquinodimethanes (ROR&#8242;&#8208;DADQs); enhancement of their fluorescence from the solution, to the A, to the C state serves as an excellent signature of the phase preference and temporal stability. Their thermal characteristics and single crystal structure investigations coupled with Hirshfeld surface analysis of the intermolecular interactions, not only confirm the spectroscopic observations, but also reveal the significant impact of the molecular structural features, key interactions like H&#8208;bonds, and molecular orientations in the lattice, on the phase stability. These explorations lead to a basic structure&#8208;phase correlation; its predictive power is demonstrated by identifying the borderline systems as functional phase change materials, and the subsequent verification through the reversible cycles of fluorescence switching between the A/C states. The factors promoting the A or C forms of molecular solids can guide the design of novel materials exploiting such supramolecular structures and their interconversions.

         <dc:description>
The ability to release a molecule from a larger construct in a controlled manner is of great importance to produce effective prodrugs, antibody&#8208;drug conjugates, and chemical probes. Amides are ubiquitous functional groups, yet methods to utilise them as molecular release handles are seldom reported. This concept highlights advances made in amide release strategies and how these approaches have been utilised.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;frustrated metal&#8208;organic frameworks are an emerging class of materials due to their unique magnetic properties arising from the interplay between geometric and topological factors within the frameworks. This review highlights the fundamental aspects of spin frustration in metal&#8208;organic frameworks, synthetic protocols, structural characteristics, and potential applications.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a fascinating class of structured materials with diverse functionality originating from their distinctive physicochemical properties. This review focuses on the specific chemical design of geometrically frustrated MOFs along with the origin of the intriguing magnetic properties. We have discussed the arrangement of spin centres (metal and ligand) which are responsible for the unusual magnetic phenomena in MOFs. Both two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOFs with frustrated magnetism, their synthetic routes, and evaluation of magnetic properties are highlighted. Such spin&#8208;frustrated MOFs may find applications in the field of memory devices, transistors, sensors, and the development of unconventional superconductors.

CPs 1&#8211;3 all adopt similar two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ring&#8208;and&#8208;rod layer structures, described as topologically 4&#8208;connected 2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;65 nets where the Zn(II) centers act as 4&#8208;connected nodes. CPs 1 and 2 are a pair of solvent&#8208;mediated supramolecular isomers where the former shows a two&#8208;fold interlocked 2D &#8594;2D polyrotaxane&#8208;like entangled net and the latter reveals a four&#8208;fold interpenetrated 2D &#8594;3D polyrotaxane entanglement. CP 3 is structure analgue of 1. The formation of 1&#8211;3 implies the realization of interpenetration control and supramolecular isomerism in polyrotaxanes by fine&#8208;tuning the solvent compositions and ligand steric&#8208;modulation. CPs 1&#8211;3 all show high thermal stability approaching 400&#8201;&#176;C and good chemical stability in various solvents at room temperature for 24&#8197;h. Further, CPs 1&#8211;3 all are excellent turn&#8208;off sensors to recognize Fe3+ in water with high selectivity and sensitivity, great anti&#8208;inference ability, and low limit of detection (LOD). The sensing mechanisms are found to be competitive absorption of excitation wavelength energy and the occurrence of framework&#8211;Fe3+ interactions.

         <title>Near&#8208;neutral pH sensing by azoheteroarene dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We serendipitously discovered a novel series of azoheteroarene dyes capable of detecting pH variations in near&#8208;neutral solutions. These dyes feature thiazole, thiadiazole, triazole, pyrazole, or benzothiazole heteroaryls linked to hydroxyphenyl azo groups. They exhibit distinctive light absorption properties in aqueous solutions and show notable color changes in a narrow pH range, visible to the naked eye. Both experimental data and quantum calculations suggest a plausible mechanism for their function as pH indicators. Additionally, these azoheteroarene dyes effectively monitor pH in complex environments, and we show their use for detecting the pH change of culture medium containing growing cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Triphenylamine Derived Photosensitizers for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of new (donor)&#8322;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (D2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) and (acceptor)&#8322;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) organic photosensitizers based on the framework of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;cyano&#8208;3&#8208;(5&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acrylic acid have been synthesized and characterized. By incorporating groups with different electron&#8208;donating or withdrawing abilities, such as dibenzothiophene (DBT), dibenzofuran (DBF), and triazine (TA), into the triphenylamine segment, their photophysical properties have been regulated. &#160;Theoretical calculations were used to explore how various donor&#8208;acceptor combinations influence their hydrogen production performance. Notably, DBF&#8208;CN achieved the highest turnover number (TON) of 10,202 and an initial turnover frequency (TOFi) of 151.6 h&#8315;&#185; under green light irradiation, with an initial activity (Activityi) of 113,532 &#956;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185; and an apparent quantum yield (AQYi) of 0.76%. This dye&#8208;sensitized&#8208;TiO2&#8208;Pt system is recognized as one of the most efficient and durable systems for photocatalytic hydrogen production under green light irradiation, as described in the literature, when compared using TOF and TON values. Experimental results indicate that the D2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A system significantly enhances photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance more effectively than the A2&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A system, while also maintaining stability under prolonged light exposure.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Balances as Physical Organic Chemistry Tools to Quantify Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to be a comprehensive, authoritative, and critical overview of the recent progress made in the use of molecular balances (MBs) to quantify non&#8208;covalent interactions such as the well&#8208;known &#960;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, CH&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, halogen&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, heteroatom&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960; interactions but also, the most recent fullerene&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, chalcogen&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;chalcogen, and solvophobic interactions, highlighting limitations, advantages, and similarities under various experimental conditions.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions are present in numerous synthetic and biological systems, playing an essential role in vital life processes, such as the stabilization of proteins&#8217; structures or reversible binding in substrate&#8208;receptor complexes. Their study is relevant but faces challenges due to its inherent weak nature. In this context, molecular balances (MBs) are one of the most efficient physical organic chemistry tools to quantify non&#8208;covalent interactions, bringing beneficial knowledge regarding their nature and strength. Herein, we report an overview and critical discussion of recent studies related to various MBs in the quantification of a collection of non&#8208;covalent interactions, covering from the well&#8208;known aryl&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;aryl and CH&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;aryl interaction to the newest fullerene&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;aryl and chalcogen&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;chalcogen interactions.

&lt;p&gt;This review aims to be a comprehensive, authoritative, and critical overview of the recent progress made in the use of molecular balances (MBs) to quantify non-covalent interactions such as the well-known &#960;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, CH&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, halogen&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, heteroatom&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960; interactions but also, the most recent fullerene&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#960;, chalcogen&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;chalcogen, and solvophobic interactions, highlighting limitations, advantages, and similarities under various experimental conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-covalent interactions are present in numerous synthetic and biological systems, playing an essential role in vital life processes, such as the stabilization of proteins&#8217; structures or reversible binding in substrate-receptor complexes. Their study is relevant but faces challenges due to its inherent weak nature. In this context, molecular balances (MBs) are one of the most efficient physical organic chemistry tools to quantify non-covalent interactions, bringing beneficial knowledge regarding their nature and strength. Herein, we report an overview and critical discussion of recent studies related to various MBs in the quantification of a collection of non-covalent interactions, covering from the well-known aryl&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;aryl and CH&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;aryl interaction to the newest fullerene&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;aryl and chalcogen&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;chalcogen interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Me2Se and Me2Te: Their Structures and Synergistic Effects of Halogen/Chalcogen Bonding with C6F5Br and C6F5I</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
150&#8201;and 125&#8201;years after their first mention, the solid state structures of dimethyl selenide and telluride are reported. They are dominated by chalcogen bonding. Their combination with C6F5Br and C6F5I as halogen bond donors leads to different types of aggregates and extraordinarily short I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te bonding interactions. The analysis of occurrence, strength and directionality of intermolecular forces helps to understand the rules behind cocrystals formation.







Abstract
This work combines halogen and chalcogen bonding. Short, polarity directed C&#8722;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch (X=Br or I, Ch=Se or Te) contacts were prepared by in&#8197;situ low&#8208;temperature cocrystallization of liquid mixtures of neutral pentafluorohalogenobenzenes C6F5X and dimethyl chalcogenides Me2Ch. Solid&#8208;state structures of Me2Se and Me2Te were determined 150 and 125&#8197;years after their first description. Significant C&#8722;Ch&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts make Me2Se dimeric and Me2Te polymeric. The cocrystals comprise C6F5X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Me2Ch&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;XC6F5 aggregates, except the combination X/Ch=I/Te which shows polymeric C6F5I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Me2Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;TeMe2&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;IC6F5 aggregation. The observed C&#8722;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te interactions are the shortest of this type, and the C&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts are shorter than the corresponding C&#8722;Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch interactions. Heteromolecular C&#8722;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts are accompanied by F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/F and X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H contacts in the cocrystals. The analysis of packing and contacts in all (co)crystals was complemented by computational studies. They both show that short interactions can be designed and engineered with reasonable predictability.

         <title>Easily Accessible and Solution&#8208;Stable Ni(0) Precatalysts for High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several &#945;&#8208;diimine stabilized Ni(0) complexes are active precursors for in&#8197;situ catalyst formation, with particular applicability to high&#8208;throughput experimentation. These compounds are easily prepared and solution stable, and function well in several cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic applications of N,N&#8217;&#8208;diaryl diazabutadiene (DAB) Ni(0) complexes stabilized by alkene ligands. These complexes are soluble and stable in several organic solvents, making them ideal candidates for in&#8197;situ catalyst formation during high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE). We used HTE to evaluate these Ni(0) precatalysts in a variety of Suzuki and C&#8722;N coupling reactions, and they were found to have equal or better performance than the still&#8208;standard Ni(0) source, Ni(COD)2.

         <title>A Simple and Efficient Stereoselective Synthesis of a 2,3&#8208;Difluorosialic Acid&#8208;Based Influenza Virus Neuraminidase Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new simple approach for the exquisitely stereo&#8208;controlled introduction of the C&#8208;3 equatorial fluorine on neuraminic acid derivatives by incorporation of steric bulk at C&#8208;4. Through this size&#8208;controlled method, we have elaborated a novel synthetic route that exclusively produces the potent anti&#8208;influenza drug candidate; 2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;zanamivir analogue with C&#8208;3 eq fluoride.







Abstract
3&#8208;Fluoroneuraminosyl fluorides are invaluable probes for studying the catalytic mechanism of sialidases (neuraminidases), and as sialidase inhibitors. Significantly, when a C&#8208;3 equatorial fluorine is installed on a C&#8208;4 functionalised N&#8208;acylneuraminic acid (Neu)&#8208;based template, the compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of both influenza and parainfluenza sialidases, and of virus replication. Typically, the reported syntheses of 3&#8208;fluoroneuraminosyl fluorides involve either an enzymatic or a chemical synthesis that have uncontrolled stereoselectivity in the introduction of fluorine at C&#8208;3 of Neu and consequently yield a mixture of C&#8208;3 ax and C&#8208;3 eq fluoro derivatives. We now report a simple approach for the exquisitely stereo&#8208;controlled introduction of the C&#8208;3 equatorial fluorine on Neu by incorporation of steric bulk at C&#8208;4. Through this method, we have elaborated a novel synthetic route that exclusively produces the potent anti&#8208;influenza drug candidate; 2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;zanamivir analogue with C&#8208;3 eq fluoride.

         <title>Organic Luminescent Cocrystals Based on Benzotriazole Derivatives: Synthesis, Characterization, Crystal Structure and Fluorescence Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The involvement of benzotriazole derivatives in cocrystal formation is studied systematically for the first time. Two novel cocrystals with tunable photoluminescence behavior featuring directional hydrogen bonding through benzotriazole derivatives acting as different roles is presented and characterized for their crystal structure, self&#8208;assembling manner and optical properties which can be used for label anti&#8208;counterfeiting techniques and acid&#8208;alkali response.







Abstract
Organic cocrystals have garnered significant research attention owing to their distinctive properties and promising applications. However, challenges in molecular structure design and control of intermolecular interactions continue to impede further advancements. In this study, two novel cocrystals were successfully formed from a series of synthesized benzotriazole derivatives. The resulting cocrystals exhibit bright green and yellow fluorescence under 365&#8201;nm light. To elucidate the microstructure of the obtained cocrystals, systematic characterization techniques such as solid&#8208;state fluorescence emission spectroscopy, Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), Power X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and density functional theory (DFT) were performed. These benzotriazole&#8208;based cocrystals demonstrate distinct fluorescent responses to alkaline and acidic environments, respectively. Additionally, preliminary tests for fingerprint recognition yielded satisfactory results. These findings suggest that the two cocrystals hold potential applications in acid&#8208;alkali sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels, and smart material development, while also providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of solid&#8208;state luminescent materials.

         <title>Responsive Surfactant&#8208;Driven Morphology Transformation of Block Copolymer Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the impact of responsive surfactants on the morphology of BCP microparticles, focusing on how external stimuli such as temperature, pH, and light influence the interfacial interactions between surfactants and BCPs. In addition, the review also highlights the applications of shape&#8208;switchable BCP microparticles in the fields of smart displays, fluorescence modulation, MRI, drug release, and photonic crystals.







Abstract
Block copolymer (BCP) microparticles, which exhibit rapid change of morphology and physicochemical property in response to external stimuli, represent a promising avenue for the development of programmable smart materials. Among the methods available for generating BCP microparticles with adjustable morphologies, the confined assembly of BCPs within emulsions has emerged as a particularly facile and versatile approach. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the role of responsive surfactants in modulating interfacial interactions at the oil&#8208;water interface, which facilitates controlled BCP microparticle morphology. We elucidate how variations in the properties of responsive surfactants, activated by external stimuli, influence BCP chain arrangement and interfacial selectivity. Additionally, this review explores the applications of shape&#8208;switchable microparticles in advanced technologies such as smart display, fluorescence modulation, magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, and photonic crystal. Finally, the challenges and prospective future directions in this rapidly evolving field are discussed.

         <title>Rapid and Sustainable Electrochemical Pd Catalyst Generation from Bulk Metal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric current was used to generate a &#8220;cocktail&#8221;&#8208;type active Pd catalyst from a bulk metal electrode in an ionic liquid medium for the efficient cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides/bromides and boronic acids. According to mechanistic investigations, Pd metal was transferred to a solution as a Pd2+ complex with an ionic liquid. Then, the complex was reduced on a counterelectrode, generating Pd NPs, which catalyzed the cross&#8208;coupling reaction.







Abstract
Palladium catalysts constitute a cornerstone of modern chemistry with upmost scientific and industrial impact. Bulk palladium metal itself is chemically inert, and a sequence of chemical transformations has to be utilized to convert the metal into a Pd precatalyst covered by ligands. However, the &#8220;cocktail&#8221; concept of catalysis discovered recently has shown that Pd systems can efficiently operate in catalysis without the need for a complicated and expensive preinstalled ligand environment. Here, we point out on a green and sustainable process for the generation of Pd active species without the need for waste&#8208;abundant precatalyst&#8208;related chemistry. In this work, an electric current was used to generate an active Pd catalyst from a bulk metal in an ionic liquid medium for the efficient cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides/bromides and boronic acids. A synthetically important Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling was utilized as a representative test reaction to confirm the idea. Notably, an electric current is used only at the Pd dissolution stage. Afterwards, the electrodes are removed from the reaction mixture, and a standard reaction procedure can be followed. The reported catalyst preparation process via electrochemical dissolution is potentially compatible with several already existing catalytic methods.

         <title>Aqueous Binder with Self&#8208;Emulsifying Characteristics for Practical Si/C Anode in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous binder suitable for practical Si/C anodes was synthesized by utilizing the self&#8208;emulsifying characteristics of polyvinyl alcohol grafted poly(methyl methacrylate). Due to the high bonding strength and stabilizing effect on SEI, the rate performance and cycling stability of Si/C anodes using this binder are significantly improved.







Abstract
Silicon/carbon (Si/C) materials have achieved commercial applications as a solution to the problems of large volume expansion and short lifespan of silicon&#8208;based anodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the potential risk of structural fracture and localized differences in surface adsorption properties lead to difficulties in maintaining the structural integrity of Si/C anodes using conventional binders during repeated lithiation/delithiation. Herein, an aqueous binder (PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M) based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) grafted methacrylic acid (MAA) obtained by self&#8208;emulsifying emulsion polymerization is reported. The introduction of carboxyl groups of MAA enables PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M to form more hydrogen bonds, thereby enhancing both the cohesion of the binder film and its adhesion to silicon&#8208;based surface. Simultaneously, the methyl&#8208;containing segments of MAA can wet the carbon&#8208;based surface, thereby enhancing the adhesion of PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M to carbonaceous materials. In addition, the hydroxyl groups on both the PVA segments and the silicon surface can be esterified with the carboxyl groups during the heat treatment, thus further improving the bonding strength. As&#8208;prepared Si/C anodes with PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M binder can significantly inhibit the electrode volume expansion and maintain high structural integrity during cycling as well as form SEIs with high lithium fluoride content, showing excellent cycling stability (81.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 300 cycles).

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Dynamic Mechanism in V&#8208;Shaped Flexible Carbazole Aromatic Imides Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cofacial electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads exhibit through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) characteristics. In V&#8208;shaped flexible dyads, the formation of a pseudo&#8208;cofacial conformation in the excited state enhances charge&#8208;transfer coupling. Femtosecond spectroscopy reveals ultrafast TSCT dynamics, with rates significantly increase in concentrated solutions, explaining the emission enhancement in weakly coupled TSCT emitters transitioning from solution to aggregation states.







Abstract
Cofacial electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads exhibiting through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) characteristics are widely employed in the development of optoelectronic functional materials. The flexible molecular frameworks between the electron donor and acceptor components allow dynamic modulation of electronic coupling, influenced by excited&#8208;state structural relaxation or intermolecular interactions, thereby affecting the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) dynamics and the emission properties of TSCT states. In this work, we examine the TSCT dynamic processes of two electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, CzPhNI and CzPhPI formed by ortho&#8208;substitution of phenyl linkage with V&#8208;shaped flexible TSCT structures using carbazole as donor and naphthalimide or phthalimide as acceptor. A pseudo&#8208;cofacial TSCT conformation formed in the excited state effectively shortens the donor&#8208;acceptor distance and enhances CT coupling. Femtosecond spectroscopy reveals an ultrafast TSCT kinetics in the (200&#8197;fs)&#8722;1 timescale. Moreover, the intermolecular interaction&#8208;induced D&#8722;A stacking further strengthens the electronic coupling, accelerating the TSCT reaction rate from (2.07&#8197;ps)&#8722;1 to (174&#8197;fs)&#8722;1 as solution concentrations increases from 10&#8722;5 to 10&#8722;3&#8197;M. The results obtained in this work offers valuable physical insights into the TSCT dynamic mechanism, potentially explaining the widely observed emission enhancement in weakly&#8208;coupled, flexible TSCT emitters transitioning from solution to aggregation states.

         <title>Unilateral and Bilateral Disulfurating Reagents for the Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Polysulfides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unilateral or Bilateral disulfurating reagents offer an opportunity to build a series of functionalized unsymmetrical disulfide molecules from easily accessible starting materials. This concept summarizes the progress and current limitations of disulfide reagents. We also discussed future efforts to enlarge the disulfide reagent strategy into a valuable alternative for constructing unsymmetrical functional polysulfide molecules.







Abstract
Polysulfides play an essential role across various fields, including life sciences, pharmaceuticals, food science, and materials science. However, the controlled sequential installation of groups at both ends of an S&#8722;S motif poses enormous challenges due to the reversible nature of the covalent S&#8722;S bond. Utilizing unique disulfide reagents presents one of the most straightforward approaches for constructing diverse polysulfides. This concept highlights the initiatives and advancements in polysulfide synthesis facilitated by unilateral or bilateral disulfide reagents. Furthermore, ongoing research is focused on recently reported methodologies for synthesizing unsymmetrical disulfides.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Non&#8208;Heme &#956;&#8208;Oxodicobalt(IV) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of a CoIII complex of an N2O2 set of donor ligand assists the formation of an &#956;&#8208;oxodicobalt(IV) species, which was found stable at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. The intermediate species works as an oxidant for the C&#8722;H atom abstraction and oxygen atom transfer reactions.







Abstract
A mononuclear CoIII complex (1) of a bisamide&#8208;bisalkoxide donor ligand was synthesized and thoroughly characterized. The reaction of 1 with 0.5&#8197;equiv. of m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) in acetonitrile at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C resulted in the formation of a &#956;&#8208;oxodicobalt(IV) complex (2), which was characterized by an array of spectroscopic techniques, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy which revealed a short Co&#8722;Ooxo distance of 1.67&#8197;&#197;. Reactivity studies of 2 towards oxidation/oxygenation of hydrocarbon C&#8722;H bond and triphenylphosphine or thioanisole derivatives have been examined. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy studies showed the appearance of clear isosbestic points during the oxidation of substrates together with a neat transformation of 2 to 1. Detailed kinetic investigations established that 2 follows a Concerted Proton&#8208;Electron Transfer (CPET) mechanism for hydrocarbon oxidation and has a weak electrophilic character. Catalytic behavior of 1 was noted towards the oxygen atom transfer reactions. This study showcases the spectroscopic investigation and reactivity studies of a CoIV(&#956;&#8208;O)CoIV moiety. Although the FeIV analog of such a core has been described before, the study describes the first example with a CoIV center.

         <title>Improving the Long&#8208;term Enantioselectivity of a Silicon&#8208;Carbon Bond&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselectivity is a key advantage of enzymatic catalysis. Understanding the most important factors influencing enantioselectivity necessitates thorough investigation for each specific enzyme. In this study, we explore various approaches to optimize reaction conditions for organosilicon production using an immobilized Cytochrome C recently tailored via directed evolution. Over extended reactions, this enzyme experiences a loss of enantioselectivity. Mass spectrometry (MS) revealed covalent modifications on the enzyme, but mutating the respective amino acids did not restore enantioselectivity. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), along with a detailed comparison of the influence of reaction components such as cosolvents and reducing agents, indicated significant conformational changes in the presence of the diazo ester substrate. Additionally, we identified sodium ascorbate as a suitable and milder reducing agent compared to the previously used sodium dithionite, ensuring anaerobic conditions for silicon&#8208;carbon bond formation. Ultimately, maintaining a high enzyme&#8208;to&#8208;substrate ratio in the reaction was found to be crucial for achieving high enantiomeric purity of the organosilicon product over four days in sequential, repetitive batch reactions, thus improving the previously established reaction system. The methods and findings presented here are particularly valuable for addressing enantioselectivity issues in other enzymes that operate with diazo compounds as the substrates in carbene&#8208;transfer reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Translocation&#8208;Coupled Ligand&#8208;Binding/Release by Dinuclear Rhodium Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Switching the location of metal atoms or ions in a molecule has been of great interest as a behavior of molecular machines. We describe herein that the reversible metal translocation can be coupled with the ligand&#8208;binding/release of organometallic complexes. The two rhodium moieties sandwiched between arylpolyene ligands exhibit metal&#8208;assembly and disassembly through reversible migration between the arene site and the olefin site, in response to the association and dissociation of additional ligands. This occurs either with bridging or even non&#8208;bridging ligands, where the latter involves oxidative &#960;&#8208;addition of the unsaturated hydrocarbon binder to the metal moieties. The assembling&#8208; and disassembling states were characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Redox&#8208;driven Synthesis of Mono&#8208; and Diradical Iridium(III) Complexes: Insights into Molecular and Electronic Structure, Electrochemistry, and Spin&#8208;Communication</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two &#960;&#8208;radical complexes containing bisazo&#8208;aromatic&#8208;centered radical anion (1&#8226;&#8722;) were synthesized through in&#8208;situ electron transfer from metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand using [IrI] and 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Pyridylazo)azobenzene (1) in inert hydrocarbon solvent. These are characterized as diradical [IrIII(1&#8226;&#8722;)2]+[2]+ and monoradical [IrIII(1&#8226;&#8722;)Cl2(PPh3)] 3. In contrast, a rare metal&#8208;mediated hydrolytic cleavage of the C(sp2)&#8211;N bond occurred in protic solvent resulting in quaternary radical complex [IrIII(1&#8226;&#8722;)(1&#8242;)(PPh3)]+(4)+. This provides an easy way to synthesize stable unsubstituted pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;diazotate (1&#8242;), an otherwise unstable organic template. Theoretical scrutiny has been performed at (U)B3LYP/6&#8208;31G(d,p)/LANL2DZ level to explore the origin of redox and optical properties in radical complexes. Magnetic study of [2]+ reveals that a weak antiferromagnetic (AF) spin&#8208;communication (J = &#8722;4.39 cm&#8722;1) exists between two radicals, leading to an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state. Broken symmetry density functional theory (BS&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out to probe the nature of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the two radical centers in species [2]+. This method has been employed with different basis functionals (BP86, BLYP, OLYP, TPSS0, TPSSh, &#969;b97D and B3LYP) to comprehend the nature of the exchange in [2]+. The best result is obtained for pure functional OLYP with a J value &#8722;8.4 cm&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Sub&#8208;nano Channels of&#160;Amino Pillar[6]arene Inspired Biomimetic Porous Roots for Specific Remove&#160;of Imazamox</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The root ducts play an important role in the plant's transport of nutrients from the soil. Based on the selective transport characteristics of plant roots, amino pillar[6]arene bionic porous root sub&#8208;nano channel&#160;membrane were&#160;constructed to&#160;remove Imazamox. Imazamox (IM) is an effective imidazolinone herbicide frequently utilized in soybean fields to control a wide range of annual grasses and broad&#8208;leaved weeds.&#160;However, it is important to note that while IM is effective in controlling the growth of weeds, its residues can affect the plants that are later planted.&#160;Developing a material that can efficiently and selectively remove IM from the environment poses a significant challenge in the realm of agricultural residue removal.&#160;A&#160;layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer covalent assembly was formed&#160;through the reaction of amino pillar[6]arene with terephthalaldehyde using an aldehyde&#8208;amine Schiff&#8208;base reaction.&#160;The cavity of amino pillar[6]arenal is used to realize the host&#8208;guest interaction of IM. This enabled the development of a membrane with high selectivity for the extraction and removal of IM. The removal rate is 4.66&#8208;21.91 times higher than that of other pesticide chemicals. The successful development of the highly selective porous root bionic membrane provides a broad prospect for its application and development in agricultural production.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Self&#8208;assembly of Nanographdiynes Mediated by Molecular Dipoles Induced by Rotatory Asymmetric Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discrete &#960;&#8208; stacks of specific lengths and orientation is crucial for understanding the impact of intermolecular interactions on optical or electronic properties of nanographdiynes. We designed and synthesized nanographdiynes modified with bulky rotatable asymmetric substituents. The peripheral substituents with different push&#8208;pull electronic properties can induce molecular dipoles perpendicular to nanoGDY &#960; surface with different orientation. Mediated by directional dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, o&#8208;TBGDY substituted with electron&#8208;donating tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups cofacially dimerized with a twist angle, involving intermolecular interlocking of ortho&#8208;substituted tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups. In contrast, OTFGDY substituted with electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluorophenyl groups formed dimeric H&#8208;aggregates with an in&#8208;plane shift along one diyne linkage, in which the ortho&#8208;substituted trifluorophenyl groups point toward the outside of the interacting &#960;&#8208;plane. o&#8208;TBGDY can only exist as isolated H&#8208;dimer in the solid state, while OTFGDY can form a hybrid tetramer of H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregates. Our researches reveal a new method for preparing discrete &#960;&#8208;stacked dye assemblies with well&#8208;defined optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) to form nanostructures of various morphologies and controllable dimensions has been a very promising research area in nanotechnology in recent decades. This review mainly summarizes the recent advances in precise and controllable self&#8208;assembly of BCPs through a tailored nucleation&#8208;growth strategy to modulate the self&#8208;assembly behavior of the BCPs. These efforts have led to a better understanding of the self&#8208;assembly mechanisms and opened new possibilities for creating novel materials with designable properties. We hope that the review is more than a periodical summary of previous research work and can provide valuable inspiration for the research field.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Mechanochromic materials, known for their ability to change color in response to mechanical stimuli such as pressure, stretching, grinding, or rubbing, hold significant importance due to their diverse applications. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two novel pyridine&#8208;tethered imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine mechanoresponsive luminogens with appended tetraphenylethene, named GBY&#8208;10 and GBY&#8208;11. GBY&#8208;10 exhibited reversible mechanofluorochromism, while GBY&#8208;11 did not revert to its original color after solvent fuming. The photophysical properties of these luminogens were significantly influenced by the position of the terminal pyridine. Additionally, we created color&#8208;tunable mechanoresponsive molecular salts by co&#8208;grinding GBY&#8208;11 with various aryl acid derivatives. Co&#8208;grinding GBY&#8208;11 with pentafluorobenzoic acid resulted in a significant bathochromic shift of the emission maxima by 66 nm, compared to 37 nm and 12 nm shift for benzoic acid and para&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, respectively. This counter&#8208;ion&#8208;dependent luminescence suggests strong electronic interactions between the counter ions. These luminogens also demonstrated reversible pH&#8208;responsive behaviour, making them suitable for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. Furthermore, the pyridine&#8208;functionalized luminogen, GBY&#8208;10, showed metal ion detection (Mn&#178;&#8314;, Ag&#8314;, Fe&#179;&#8314;) ability in water, with detection limits as low as 0.0043, 0.015, and 0.0029 mM, respectively. This report opens new avenues for designing promising AIE&#8208;active materials for potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, optoelectronics, and biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Divergent Synthesis of Naphthalene&#8208; and Phenanthrene&#8208;Fused Azahelicenes by Turning Rearrangement On or Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;substituents of the carbazoles control the rearrangement in the Scholl reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(2&#8208;naphthyl)phenyl}carbazoles and 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(9&#8208;phenanthrenyl)phenyl}carbazoles, allowing for the selective synthesis of naphthalene&#8208; and phenanthrene&#8208;fused azahelicenes. The reaction mechanisms on the divergent reaction pathways were investigated by DFT calculations, which well supported the experimental results.







Abstract
The Scholl reaction has been used to synthesize a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, where 1,2&#8208;aryl shifts have sometimes occurred to yield unique rearrangement products. However, such 1,2&#8208;aryl shifts are often uncontrollable, and the selective and divergent synthesis with or without rearrangement is desired. Here, we achieved the control of the rearrangement in the Scholl reaction of carbazoles by changing the N&#8208;substituents. The Scholl reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(2&#8208;naphthyl)phenyl}carbazoles and 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(9&#8208;phenanthrenyl)phenyl}carbazoles with an N&#8208;benzyl group gave multiple azahelicenes via double rearrangement, while those with an N&#8208;benzoyl group gave aza[9]helicene and quadruple [4]helicene in the former and latter cases, respectively. The reaction mechanisms on the divergent reaction pathways were investigated by DFT calculations, which well supported the experimental results.

         <title>Fluorinated&#8208;Quinoxaline Based Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptors Enables Efficient As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) namely L19 and L21 were designed and synthesized. Near 11.5&#8201;% binary as&#8208;cast device and approching 18&#8201;% ternary device efficiencies were achieved with single&#8208;junction solar cells based on electron acceptor of fluorinated L21.







Abstract
Non&#8208;fused electron acceptors have obtained increasing curiosity in organic solar cells (OSCs) thanks to simple synthetic route and versatile chemical modification capabilities. However, non&#8208;fused acceptors with varying quinoxaline core and as&#8208;cast device have rarely been explored, and the molecular structure&#8208;photovoltaic performance relationship of such acceptors remains unclear. Herein, two non&#8208;fused acceptors L19 and L21 with thienyl substituted non&#8208;fluorinated/fluorinated quinoxaline core were developed via five&#8208;step synthesis. Compared with L19, L21 with F&#8208;containing quinoxaline exhibited higher molar extinction coefficient, boosted charge mobility, improved exciton dissociation, more ordered molecular stacking and optimized film morphology. Thereafter, a notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.45&#8201;% could be obtained for the as&#8208;cast PBDB&#8208;T&#8201;:&#8201;L21 &#8208;based device, which is significantly better than the device based on PBDB&#8208;T&#8201;:&#8201;L19 (8.68&#8201;%). Furthermore, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;L21&#8208;based ternary devices were fabricated and exhibited the highest PCE of 17.81&#8201;%. This work discloses that the introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated quinoxaline core and appropriate side&#8208;chain engineering can play an important role in improving the performance of as&#8208;cast solar cell devices.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Monosubstituted [n]Paracyclophane using a Desymmetrization/Kinetic Resolution Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective synthesis of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes enabled by Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond olefination of prochiral cyclophanes is discussed. The protocol combines desymmetrization and kinetic resolution, where desymmetrization is a key contributor to enantiocontrol and kinetic resolution enhances enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Optically pure monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes are promising candidates for material synthesis, asymmetric catalysis, and drug discovery. Thus far, only a few catalytic asymmetric synthesis processes have been reported for assessing these strained atropisomers. In this study, we describe a highly enantioselective synthesis of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes by combining desymmetrization and kinetic resolution. The proposed protocol involves Pd&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H bond olefination enabled by a monoprotected amino acid ligand, which affords a variety of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes with excellent enantioselectivity (&#8805;99&#8201;%ee). Thermodynamic experiments are conducted to investigate the racemization barrier. The synthesized monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes exhibit vivid fluorescence and impressive circularly polarized luminescence. Further, the emission color and dissymmetry factor can be tuned and controlled by switching the substituent on the benzene ring of the cyclophanes.

&lt;p&gt;A highly enantioselective synthesis of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes enabled by Pd-catalyzed C&#8722;H bond olefination of prochiral cyclophanes is discussed. The protocol combines desymmetrization and kinetic resolution, where desymmetrization is a key contributor to enantiocontrol and kinetic resolution enhances enantioselectivity.

         <title>Panchromatic Absorption of Unsymmetrical Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyes Based on a Meta&#8208;Conjugated 1,3,5&#8208;Heteroaryltriazine Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Little explored are 1,3,5&#8208;triazine cores that are substituted with three different heteroaromatic groups despite their distinct optical and electronic properties. 1,3,5&#8208;Triazines substituted with strong donor and acceptor thiophenes give rise to long wavelength absorption tails due to intramolecular charge transfer absorptions of the meta&#8208;conjugated donor and acceptor groups. Some derivatives display mesomorphism without the aid of flexible side&#8208;chains.







Abstract
Attachment of three different heterocycles with electron donor or acceptor character to a central 1,3,5&#8208;triazine core generates readily soluble side&#8208;chain free dyes with two displaying soft crystalline mesomorphism and one displaying a nematic liquid crystal phase as confirmed by polarized optical microscopy, calorimetry, gravimetric analysis, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. Equally intriguing is the dyes&#8217; relatively strong electronic communication between donor and acceptor subchromophores that are meta&#8208;conjugated to one another, which is experimentally observed as a broad intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer absorption that can extend over 100&#8197;nm past the most intense absorption event and is computationally confirmed through density functional theory (DFT) evaluations of the molecular ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state properties. This molecular design permits the preparation of dyes with panchromatic absorption not just based on the additive absorption of individual subchromophores.

         <title>Discovery of 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;5&#8208;one Derivative CJ1&#8208;34 as a Partial ATP Synthase Inhibitor for CNS Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ATP synthase dysregulation has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Whilst ATP synthase&#8208;targeting compounds have been reported, most are large or polar compounds and lack appropriate properties for a CNS drug. We designed, synthesised, and evaluated a novel series of ATP synthase targeting compounds, resulting in a 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;5&#8208;one scaffold with improved physiochemical properties. In vitro evaluation of our library led to the discovery of CJ1 34 as a partial ATP synthase inhibitor with a determined IC50 of 394 nM in isolated bovine mitochondria. Molecular docking experiments demonstrated that calculated docking scores aligned with the observed in vitro pharmacology and supports the F1 region of the ATP synthase as the potential binding site. Overall, this provides the foundation to further investigate CJ1&#8208;34 as a potential CNS drug for diseases where mitochondria are implicated, including Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;molecule Magnet Properties of Silole&#8208; and Stannole&#8208;ligated Erbium Cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl Sandwich Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>The synthesis, structures and magnetic properties of an &#951;5&#8208;silole complex and an &#951;5&#8208;stannole complex of erbium are reported. The sandwich complex anions [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSi)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; and [(&#951;5&#8208;CpSn)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211;, where CpSi is [SiC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Ph2]2&#8211; (1Si), CpSn is [SnC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8211; (1Sn) and COT = cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl, were obtained as their [K(2.2.2&#8208;cryptand)]+ salts and found to be isostructural, with remarkably similar bond lengths and angles, differing only in the lengths of the Er&#8211;E interactions (E = Si, Sn). The parallels in the molecular structures of 1Si and 1Sn are reflected in their dynamic magnetic properties, which show single&#8208;molecule magnet behaviour in zero applied field, with effective energy barriers of 115 &#177; 7 and 125 &#177; 3 cm&#8211;1, respectively, along with comparable magnetic relaxation times. Analysis of the two complexes using ab initio calculations reveals differences at a quantitative level, but overall similar electronic structures, with the thermally activated relaxation likely to proceed via the first&#8208;excited Kramers doublet. Comparing 1Si and 1Sn with the previously reported germanium analogue 1Ge reveals that swapping one heavier group 14 element for another in complexes of the type [(&#951;5&#8208;CpE)Er(&#951;8&#8208;COT)]&#8211; has a minimal impact on the SMM behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Global and Local Shielding/Deshielding Variation in C60 and C70 Fullerenes Upon Reduction: Evaluation of Aromaticity, 13C&#8208;NMR and Anisotropy Patterns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fullerenes are statically pleasant species featuring symmetric cages, which can be modified upon reduction. Here, we theoretically account for the variation of 13C&#8208;NMR patterns in C60 and C70 upon six&#8208;fold reduction and the overall variation of the enabled shielding/deshielding regions induced by &#960; and &#963; electrons according to different orientations of the external field and the related anisotropy. Our results show a significant modification of the chemical shift given by the main variation of the &#963;33 (or &#948;33) shielding component under the principal axis system (PAS) of the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) at the representative carbon nucleus. For C606&#8208; a shielding cone property is enabled from any orientation, accounting for a significant spherical aromatic character. In contrast, in C706&#8209;, a shielding cone is reserved only for an axial&#8208;oriented field, with a deshielding cone behavior obtained from the complementary equatorial orientations. The overall anisotropy shows an inner isotropic region for C60 and C606&#8208;, with a continuous anisotropic outer contour for the latter. In contrast, C70 and C706&#8208; both show larger anisotropies, given the lesser spherical shape in addition to the modified &#960;&#8208;surface. Such information is useful for further rationalizing the implementation of magnetic anisotropic molecular devices into fullerene&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Homogeneous Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in a Binuclear Bio&#8208;inspired Ni&#8208;Ni Complex Bearing Phenanthroline and Sulfidophenolate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prominence of binuclear&#160;catalysts underlines the need for the design and development of diverse bifunctional ligand frameworks that exhibit tunable electronic and structural properties. Such strategies enable metal&#8208;metal and ligand&#8208;metal cooperation towards catalytic applications, improve catalytic activity, and are essential for advancing multi&#8208;electron transfers for catalytic application. Hereby, we present the synthesis, crystal structure, and photocatalytic properties of a binuclear Ni(II) complex, [Ni2(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)2(2&#8208;sulfidophenolate)2] (1), which&#160;crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic system (P&#8208;1) showing extensive intra&#8208; and inter&#8208; non&#8208;coordinated interactions.&#160; The&#160; catalytic efficiency of 1 in a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;driven system using fluorescein as photosensitizer and triethanolamine as the electron donor, reaches TON 2900, threefold the efficiency of the corresponding homoleptic mononuclear complex [Ni(2&#8208;sulfidophenolate)2]. Efficiency rises up to 9000 TONs when thioglycolic&#8208;coated CdTe quantum dots are used as photosensitizers in the presence of ascorbic acid at pH 4.5.&#160;UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, DLS techniques, and Hg&#8208;poisoning measurements reveal that 1 maintains its molecular structure during catalysis. Electrochemical studies in DMF with TFA as the proton source were also performed for the elucidation of the mechanism of its catalytic action and its stability, suggesting that the proximity of two nickel ions plays a part in the increased catalytic activity, facilitating hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

Hereby, we present the synthesis, crystal structure, and photocatalytic properties of a binuclear Ni(II) complex, [Ni2(1,10-phenanthroline)2(2-sulfidophenolate)2] (1), which&#160;crystallizes in the centrosymmetric triclinic system (P-1) showing extensive intra- and inter- non-coordinated interactions.&#160; The&#160; catalytic efficiency of 1 in a noble-metal-free photo-driven system using fluorescein as photosensitizer and triethanolamine as the electron donor, reaches TON 2900, threefold the efficiency of the corresponding homoleptic mononuclear complex [Ni(2-sulfidophenolate)2]. Efficiency rises up to 9000 TONs when thioglycolic-coated CdTe quantum dots are used as photosensitizers in the presence of ascorbic acid at pH 4.5.&#160;UV-Vis spectroscopy, DLS techniques, and Hg-poisoning measurements reveal that 1 maintains its molecular structure during catalysis. Electrochemical studies in DMF with TFA as the proton source were also performed for the elucidation of the mechanism of its catalytic action and its stability, suggesting that the proximity of two nickel ions plays a part in the increased catalytic activity, facilitating hydrogen evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric de novo Synthesis of Chiral Pyrroles through Desymmetrizing Oxidative [3+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition and the Van Leusen Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Central chirality in heteroarene derivatives arising from unsymmetrically substituted heteroarene rings is an intriguing but underexplored topic. Herein, we reported the first catalytic enantioselective de novo construction of centrally chiral pyrroles through desymmetrizing oxidative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition by employing silver catalysis. This judicious desymmetrization can produce at least four continuous stereogenic centers without creating any additional stereocenter. Furthermore, to introduce a more diverse set of substituents, we developed the first catalytic asymmetric Van Leusen reaction with &#945;&#8211;substituted TosMIC for the synthesis of centrally chiral pyrroles. A wide range of polycyclic 2&#8208;substituted, 3,4&#8208;fused pyrroles were obtained in high yields and with good to high enantioselectivities. This report includes the elaboration of methanobenzo[f]isoindole to synthetically challenging building block chiral isoindole compounds, which are synthesized enantioselectively for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Sheets Copper&#8208;Cobalt Graphitic Carbon Nitride Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for the Epoxidation of Styrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneered a one&#8208;step synthesis of sheets S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4 dual single&#8208;atom by employing folding fan&#8208;shaped aluminum foil as a template, wherein Cu and Co single atoms were stabilized on g&#8208;C3N4 via N coordination. Subsequently, it was verified that the as&#8208;synthesized S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1:1 exhibited an excellent catalytic effect in the epoxidation of styrene.







Abstract
Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts have attracted considerable research interest due to their higher metal atom loading and more flexible active sites compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). We pioneered the one&#8208;step synthesis of sheets copper&#8208;cobalt graphitic carbon nitride dual single&#8208;atom (S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4) using folding fan&#8208;shaped aluminum foil as a template, and used them as catalysts in the epoxidation of styrene respectively. Through XAFS (X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure) and other characterizations, it is found that Cu and Co single atoms are stabilized separately on g&#8208;C3N4 via coordination with nitrogen (N), hindered the ordered growth of sheets, and formed more pore structures, which not only increased more catalytically active sites, but also effectively prevented the flakes re&#8208;aggregate during the catalytic process. And the synergistic effect between Cu and Co changes the energy band structure of the material and facilitates electron transfer during catalysis, hence an excellent catalytic effect of 89&#8201;% styrene conversion and 85&#8201;% styrene oxide selectivity was achieved when S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 was applied in the epoxidation of styrene. Furthermore, the mechanisms of the epoxidation of styrene with S&#8722;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 was probed by the density functional theory (DFT) based on the slab model.

         <title>Two Consecutive Pathways Competing for Supramolecular Polymerization of Naphthalene&#8208;diimide Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The final outcomes of supramolecular assembly are determined by the pathways and the formation of intermediates during the assembly process. We studied pathway complexity involving two consecutive pathways in supramolecular polymerization of naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) derivative molecule. Depending on preparation methods anisotropic aggregates of J&#8208;type nanorods (Agg I) or more flexible H&#8208;type nanofibers (Agg II) are obtained from the identical initial state in solution of methyl cyclohexane (MCH) or MCH/CHCl3 mixtures. More interestingly intermediate aggregates driven by intra&#8208;molecular hydrogen&#8208;bonds are observed by spectroscopy and imaging techniques for both pathways. Thermodynamic model&#8208;fitting suggest that both pathways are consecutive ones with intermediate aggregates. Combining density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, we propose the molecular packing of Agg I and II. Our results reveal comprehensive pathway complexity in self&#8208;assembly of molecules as simple as NDI.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays a pivotal role in regulating biological processes within living systems, with modified nucleosides serving as critical modulators of various aspects of biological functions. Therefore, the development of efficient methodologies for late&#8208;stage, site&#8208;selective RNA modification is of considerable interest, as it facilitates the functional exploration of RNA chemical modifications and their implications for therapeutic applications. Precise RNA modification holds significant promise for the treatment of genetic diseases by enabling the correction of mutated nucleobases to their wild&#8208;type forms. Additionally, the site&#8208;selective incorporation of synthetic labeling groups into RNA provides invaluable tools for structural and functional studies, thereby uncovering previously hidden dimensions of RNA's role in biological systems. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of three principal approaches to site&#8208;selective, late&#8208;stage RNA modifications: enzyme&#8208;mediated strategies, catalytic nucleic acid&#8208;based techniques, and chemical methodologies. These approaches predominantly target the nucleobase or the 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyl (2&#8217;&#8208;OH) group of RNA nucleosides. We evaluate the advantages and limitations of each strategy and discuss future directions for advancing this field of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent progress of mechanofluorochromism and mechanoluminescence for phenothiazine derivatives and analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanofluorochromism (MFC) and mechanoluminescence (ML) materials have garnered significant attention from researchers due to their potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, optical recording, photodynamic therapy, bioimaging, stress sensing, display technology, and ink&#8208;free printing paper. Among the various building blocks utilized in these materials, phenothiazine (PTZ) has emerged as a widely employed fundamental component owing to its distinctive electronic and optical properties as well as its facile modification capabilities. Summarizing the recent progress of PTZ derivatives and analogues in this field holds practical significance.

         <title>Alternative and Sustainable Route to Explore a New Class of Amidines by Photochemical Synergistic Effect of Copper/Nitroxyl Radical Catalysis via Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amidines are a vital class of bioactive compounds and often necessitate multiple components for their synthesis. Therefore, exploring efficient and sustainable methodologies for their synthesis is indispensable. Herein, we disclose an alternative and greener method for synthesizing an unexplored new class of amidines through the photochemical synergistic effect of copper/nitroxyl radical catalysis. This approach facilitates site&#8208;selective radical amination of unactivated imine C(sp2)&#8208;H bond in C,N,N&#8208;cyclic imines over favored selectivity via halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT). This greener method ticks 11 out of 12 green chemistry metrics (GCM), effectively sidestepping the need for oxidants, bases, ligands, multistep processes, and harsh conditions, distinguishing it from conventional methods described in previous studies. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational tools have been employed to elucidate the synergistic effect of Cu/nitroxyl radical, the role of light, XAT, the influence of substituents, and the order of the reaction in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;healing behavior of metallopolymers in complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This current study focusses on the investigation of the self&#8208;healing abilities of metallopolymers containing different kinds of metal complexes, which were processed by direct digital light processing (DLP) based three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing. For this purpose, 2&#8209;phenoxyethyl acrylate is mixed with ligand&#8208;containing monomers either based on triphenylmethyl(trt)&#8208;histidine or terpyridine, respectively. Either zinc(II) or nickel(II) salts are successfully applied for a complexation of the ligand monomers in solution and, subsequently, photopolymerization is performed. The thermo&#8208;mechanical properties of the obtained metallopolymers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as well as&#160;dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Multiple damages with defined forces ranging from 20 to 1500 mN were introduced into the 3D&#8208;structures and successfully healed within 24&#160;h at 70&#160;&#176;C or 120&#160;&#176;C, respectively without losing the structural integrity of the overall 3D&#8208;structures. Herein, excellent healing efficiencies up to 97% were determined. Consequently, these hollow structures not only feature very good self&#8208;healing abilities but also excellent retention of the 3D&#8208;structure at and above the healing temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Fused Phosphepines: Synthesis by Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydroarylation and Ring Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation of dialkynyl(biaryl)phosphine oxides provided versatile benzo&#8208;fused phosphepine oxides. O&#8208;exo adducts were obtained as the major product, and O&#8208;endo adducts were the minor product. O&#8208;exo and O&#8208;endo indicate the position of an oxygen atom with respect to the central phosphepine framework. The isomers of dibenzo[b,d]phosphepine oxides with methyl and phenyl groups in an adjacent position (shown as 2a and 3a in the main text) were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. O&#8208;exo and O&#8208;endo adducts are diastereomers owing to the central chirality of the phosphorus atom and the planar chirality of phosphepine, and they are interconverted through a ring inversion of phosphepine via a transition state with a planar structure. The inversion barrier, fully estimated through theoretical calculations, drastically&#160;varied depending on the substituents in the phosphepine framework and/or the fusion of benzene and thiophene rings. Furthermore, the kinetics of the thermal isomerization of less stable O&#8208;endo product 3a into O&#8208;exo product 2a was examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Functionalized Bulky&#8208;Cyclopentadiene Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of significantly bulky mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted cyclic alkyl&#8208;amino carbene (cAAC)&#8208; functionalized cyclopentadiene ring (Cp) compounds were synthesized. The functionalization of the Cp ring with cAAC ligands makes them significantly bulkier, while retaining their ligation properties. These compounds display interesting fluorescence properties. In these compounds, intra&#8208;molecular charge transfer is observed from electron&#8208;rich carbene to electron&#8208;deficient cyclopentadiene unit. These high yielding compounds have been characterized by X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction and their emission properties have been studied. Rotational conformers (via C&#8722;C bond rotation) play a pivotal role with possible different extent of intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) from carbene to cyclopentadiene ring. Variable temperature&#8208;dependent NMR studies were performed along with NOSY, COSY and different 2D NMR techniques to estimate the energy barriers and 1,5&#8208;Hydrogen shift.</dc:description>

         <title>Tolane&#8208;Based Phosphino&#8208; and Arsino&#8208;Ruthenium Complexes in Three Different Oxidation States: Ru(I), Ru(II) and Ru(III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium(II) complexes featuring iPr2P&#8208; and iPr2As&#8208;functionalized diphenylacetylene scaffolds were examined with respect to 1e&#8722; reduction and oxidation. An octahedral ruthenium(III) complexes was obtained for the iPr2As&#8208;functionalized ligand and a square&#8208;planar ruthenium(I) complex was isolated for the phospha&#8208;derivative. The latter ruthenium(I) complex was found to react with TlPF6 to produce a trinuclear species containing a nearly linear Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru moiety.







Abstract
Targeting Ru(III) and Ru(I) &#951;2&#8208;alkyne species, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;(iPr2E)2&#8208;substituted diphenylacetylenes (1&#8208;E, E=P, As) were employed for the preparation of [ECCE]&#8208;coordinated ruthenium complexes. The reactions between 1&#8208;E and cis&#8208;(MeCN)2(COD)RuCl2 led to the required Ru(II) starting materials cis&#8208;[ECCE]RuCl2(MeCN) (3&#8208;E). Upon oxidation of 3&#8208;E with PhICl2, the Ru(III) target complexes [ECCE]RuCl3 (7&#8208;E) were detectable for E=P and E=As, but only the arsa&#8208;derivative 7&#8208;As was obtained in a pure form, namely via oxidation of cis&#8208;[AsCCAs]RuCl2(THT) (THT=tetrahydrothiophene). Upon reduction of compounds 3&#8208;E, a hitherto unprecedented Ru(I) &#951;2&#8208;alkyne complex, [PCCP]RuCl (9), was obtained for E=P. The former square planar Ru(I) complex (9) was characterized comprehensively and examined in detail by means of DFT and CASSCF calculation. Upon treatment of 9 with TlPF6, a diamagnetic &#956;&#8208;Tl&#8208;bridged compound (10) with a nearly linear Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru array was formed and isolated in high yields. Careful analysis of the bonding situation suggested that the Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru moiety in 10 is best interpreted in terms of a 3c&#8211;4e&#8722; bond.

         <title>Tetrylenes are Able to Discern between Isomeric Structures of Unsaturated Osmium(IV) Polyhydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexahydride OsH6(PiPr3)2 releases H2 to form two isomers of general formula OsH4(PiPr3)2, which are selectively trapped with the tetrylenes Ge{N(SiMe3)2}2 and Sn{N(SiMe3)2}2, there being a direct relationship between the size of the ligand donor atom (Ge vs Sn) and the trapped isomer. Ge{N(SiMe3)2}2 generates OsH4{Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 which has a piano stool geometry, while Sn{N(SiMe3)2}2 gives OsH4{Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 with a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry.







Abstract
Hexahydride OsH6(PiPr3)2 (1) releases H2 to form the isomeric tetrahydrides 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b of general formula OsH4(PiPr3)2. Tetrylenes E{N(SiMe3)2}2 (E=Ge, Sn) are able to selectively trap these isomers distinguishing between them. Tetrylene Ge{N(SiMe3)2}2 catches 2&#8201;b to generate OsH4{Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 (3), which has a piano stool geometry, while Sn{N(SiMe3)2}2 captures 2&#8201;a to give OsH4{Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2}(PiPr3)2 (4) with the donor atoms defining a pentagonal bipyramid around the osmium center.

         <title>Structures and Properties of Axially Chiral (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;Nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;Tetraenoate Derivatives Highly Substituted by Aryl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We found that unique (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetraenoate derivatives highly substituted by aryl groups had axial chirality. Although racemization of an enantiomer of a representative compound was observed even at a low temperature, a cyclic dimer synthesized by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail transesterification of a modified analog showed stable axial chirality. Those compounds showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), and the chiral cyclic dimer exhibits solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).







Abstract
Unprecedented (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetraenoate derivatives highly substituted by aryl groups have been synthesized by the reaction of rhodium complexes having aryl&#8208;substituted hexa&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trienyl ligands with acrylates. These compounds have potential axial chirality, and their enantiomers are isolable by the chiral HPLC technique. Although the racemization barrier of isolated enantiomers was not high, it was found that a cyclic dimer synthesized by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail transesterification of a modified analog has quite a stable axial chirality even at a high temperature. From a structural analogy with tetraphenylethene, those compounds are emissive in the solid state, and the chiral cyclic dimer exhibits solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.

         <title>Methylaluminoxane Reactivities and Anionic Structures: From Small Oligomers to Large Sheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure and reactivity of small methylaluminoxane (MAO) species (MeAlO)n(Me3Al)m (n = 1&#8208;8) have been investigated using DFT (M06&#8208;2X), MP2, and CCSD(T) calculations. This hierarchy of methods reveals that DFT artificially stabilizes structures containing 4&#8208;coordinate oxygen atoms while higher&#8208;level calculations demonstrate a clear preference for structures with 3&#8208;coordinate oxygen and 4&#8208;coordinate aluminum centers. Analysis of ionization pathways shows these neutral MAO molecules form anions through either methide or Me2Al+ abstraction, with the latter mechanism dominant for sheet structures (n = 5&#8208;8). Smaller species (n = 1&#8208;4, m &#8805; n) show minimal reactivity toward either ionization pathway. The resulting anions consistently adopt sheet structures with 3&#8208;coordinate oxygen and 4&#8208;coordinate aluminum at all levels of theory. We introduce a comprehensive stability metric incorporating both ionization energies and neutral precursor stability, which successfully explains the distribution of anions observed in ESI&#8208;MS spectra during Me3Al hydrolysis. Extension of this analysis to larger species, including the recently isolated and characterized sheet (MeAlO)26(Me3Al)9 (Luo et al., Science, 2024, 384, 1424&#8208;1428), reveals unexpected trends in reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Amino&#8208;substituted Azoxybenzenes as Potential Redox&#8208;Active Catholyte Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl diazenes, particularly azobenzenes (AB), represent a versatile class of compounds with significant historical and practical relevance, ranging from dyes to molecular machines, solar thermal and electrochemical storage. Their oxygen&#8208;substituted counterparts, azoxybenzenes (AOB), share structural similarities but have been less explored, especially in energy storage applications. This study investigates the redox properties of AOB, comparing them to AB, and evaluates their potential as redox&#8208;active materials for energy storage systems. Through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and spectro&#8208;electrochemical analyses, we demonstrate that AOBs exhibit a distinct redox behaviour, influenced by the solvent and electrolyte environment, with a reversible oxidation process. Despite their promising redox characteristics, AOBs suffer from capacity decay during galvanostatic cycling, likely due to the instability of the radical cation intermediate. These findings suggest that while AOBs offer intriguing redox properties, further investigation into stabilization strategies are needed for their application in energy storage.</dc:description>
