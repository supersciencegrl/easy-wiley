         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuteration of Aromatic Carbonyl Compounds with a Catalytic Transient Directing Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Looking for applications of previously in our group developed cyclometalated ruthenium complexes in the field of deuteration, we started using transient directing groups to access weakly coordinating substrates. During optimization, it turned out that a simple commercially available ruthenium precursor is actually the most efficient catalyst for this reaction.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Halogen Exchange of Trifluoromethyl Arenes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The production of synthetically valuable ArCF2X and ArCX3 compounds from ArCF3 using catalytic iron(III)halides is described, which constitutes the first iron&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange of non&#8208;aromatic C&#8722;F bonds. Theoretical calculations suggest direct activation of C&#8722;F bonds by iron coordination. To optimize for mono&#8208;exchange, a statistical analysis called Design of Experiments was used. Optimized parameters were successfully applied to both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient aromatic substrates, and to the late&#8208;stage diversification of flufenoxuron, a commercial insecticide.







Abstract
The facile production of ArCF2X and ArCX3 from ArCF3 using catalytic iron(III)halides is reported, which constitutes the first iron&#8208;catalyzed halogen exchange for non&#8208;aromatic C&#8722;F bonds. Theoretical calculations suggest direct activation of C&#8722;F bonds by iron coordination. ArCX3 and ArCF2X products of the reaction are synthetically valuable due to their diversification potential. In particular, chloro&#8208; and bromodifluoromethyl arenes (ArCF2Cl, ArCF2Br respectively) provide access to a myriad of difluoromethyl arene derivatives (ArCF2R). To optimize for mono&#8208;halogen exchange, a statistical method called Design of Experiments was used. Optimized parameters were successfully applied to electron rich and electron deficient aromatic substrates, and to the late stage diversification of flufenoxuron, a commercial insecticide. These methods are highly practical, being run at convenient temperatures and using inexpensive common reagents.

         <title>Acylhydrazone Sub&#8208;Units as a Proton Cargo Delivery System in 7&#8208;Hydroxyquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reimagined concept of long&#8208;range tautomeric proton transfer using crane sub&#8208;units has been presented by designing and synthesising two new acylhydrazones containing 7&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (7&#8208;OHQ) platform. The acylhydrazone sub&#8208;units attached to the 7&#8208;OHQ at 8th position act as a crane arm for proton cargo delivery to the quinoline nitrogen. Light&#8208;induced tautomerization to their keto tautomers leads to Z/E isomerization of the C=C axle bond, followed by proton delivery to the quinoline nitrogen by covalent or hydrogen bond formation. The axle being either imine or ketimine bond is the structural difference between the studied compounds. The &#8208;CH3 group in the latter provides steric strain, resulting in different proton transport pathway. Both compounds show long thermal stability in the switched state, which creates a tunable action of bidirectional proton cargo transport by using different wavelengths of irradiation. Upon addition of acid, the quinoline nitrogen is protonated, which results in E/Z configurational switching of the acylhydrazone sub&#8208;units. This was proven by single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis and NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterodinuclear Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III) with Na(I) Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide and Cyclohexene Oxide Ring Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series heterodinuclear catalysts, operating without co&#8208;catalyst, show good performances for the ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide. The complexes feature a macrocyclic ligand designed to coordinate metals such as Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III), in a Schiff base &#8216;pocket&#8217;, and Na(I) in a modified crown&#8208;ether binding &#8216;pocket&#8217;. The 11 new catalysts are used to explore the influences of the metal combinations and ligand backbones over catalytic activity and selectivity. The highest performance catalyst features the Co(III)Na(I) combination, [N, N'&#8208;bis(3,3&#8217;&#8208;triethylene glycol salicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethylenediamino cobalt(III) di(acetate)]sodium (7), and it shows both excellent activity and selectivity at 1 bar carbon dioxide pressure (TOF = 1590 h&#8208;1, &gt;99% polymer selectivity, 1:10: 4000, 100 &#186;C), as well as high activity at higher carbon dioxide pressure (TOF = 4343 h&#8208;1, 20 bar, 1:10:25000). Its rate law shows a first order dependence on both catalyst and cyclohexene oxide concentrations and a zeroth order for carbon dioxide pressure, over the range 10&#8208;40 bar. These new catalysts eliminate any need for ionic or Lewis base co&#8208;catalyst rather earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive Na(I) adjacent to a second metal delivers efficient catalysis. They highlight the potential for well&#8208;designed ancillary ligands and inexpensive Group 1 metals to deliver high performance heterodinuclear catalysts for carbon dioxide copolymerizations and, in future, these catalysts may also show promise in other alternating copolymerization and carbon dioxide utilizations.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208;Carbopentafluorophenylation of Alkynes: The Metallomimetic Pull&#8208;Push Reactivity of Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8822-8831, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel three&#8208;component coupling of an allylsilane, an arylacetylene, and a C6F5 group from tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] is enabled by the pull&#8208;push reactivity of B(C6F5)3. Tetrafluoronaphthalenes can be prepared from the resultant C6F5&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes by a photochemical 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization. The reaction using a 2&#8208;substituted furan or a silyl enolate instead of an allylsilane also affords a novel three&#8208;component coupling product.







Abstract
We report the novel single&#8208;step 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of an arylacetylene with an allylsilane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] involving C&#8722;C bond formation with C&#8722;H bond scission at the &#946;&#8208;position to the silicon atom of an allylsilane and B&#8594;C migration of a C6F5 group. The 1,2&#8208;carbopentafluorophenylation occurs smoothly without the requirement for a catalyst or heating. Mechanistic studies suggest that the metallomimetic &#8220;pull&#8208;push&#8221; reactivity of B(C6F5)3 imparts consecutive electrophilic and nucleophilic characteristics to the benzylic carbon of the arylacetylene. Subsequent photochemical 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization affords tetrafluoronaphthalenes, which are important in the pharmaceutical and materials sciences. Owing to the unique reactivity of B(C6F5)3, the 1,2&#8208;carbopentafluorophenylation using 2&#8208;substituted furan proceeded with ring opening, and the reaction using silyl enolates formed a C&#8722;C bond with C&#8722;O bond scission at the silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbon.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The novel three-component coupling&lt;/b&gt; of an allylsilane, an arylacetylene, and a C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; group from tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] is enabled by the pull-push reactivity of B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Tetrafluoronaphthalenes can be prepared from the resultant C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-substituted 1,3-dienes by a photochemical 6&#960;-electrocyclization. The reaction using a 2-substituted furan or a silyl enolate instead of an allylsilane also affords a novel three-component coupling product.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the novel single-step 1,2-dicarbofunctionalization of an arylacetylene with an allylsilane and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] involving C&#8722;C bond formation with C&#8722;H bond scission at the &#946;-position to the silicon atom of an allylsilane and B&#8594;C migration of a C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; group. The 1,2-carbopentafluorophenylation occurs smoothly without the requirement for a catalyst or heating. Mechanistic studies suggest that the metallomimetic &#8220;pull-push&#8221; reactivity of B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; imparts consecutive electrophilic and nucleophilic characteristics to the benzylic carbon of the arylacetylene. Subsequent photochemical 6&#960;-electrocyclization affords tetrafluoronaphthalenes, which are important in the pharmaceutical and materials sciences. Owing to the unique reactivity of B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the 1,2-carbopentafluorophenylation using 2-substituted furan proceeded with ring opening, and the reaction using silyl enolates formed a C&#8722;C bond with C&#8722;O bond scission at the silyloxy-substituted carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

Under control: From a single starting material, three different products can be prepared with excellent chemoselectivity in the presence of a rhodium precatalyst. Conditions for the synthesis of vinylated pyridones, tetrasubstituted alkenes, and annulated pyridone derivatives are advanced using 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones. Through careful choice of co&#8208;catalysts and additives, the reaction paths can be successfully manipulated to provide products that are difficult to access by other methods. Experimental and DFT studies provide insight into the diverse reaction pathways.

Cp*Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;assisted direct C&#8722;H bond functionalization of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones with internal alkynes that can be controlled to give three different products in good yields has been realized. Depending on the reaction conditions, solvents and additives, the reaction pathway can be switched between alkenylation, alkenylation/directing group migration and rollover annulation. These reaction manifolds allow divergent access to a variety of valuable C6&#8208;alkenylated 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones, (Z)&#8208;6&#8208;(1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)vinyl)pyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones and 10H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a][1,8]naphthyridin&#8208;10&#8208;ones from the same starting materials. These protocols exhibit excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and good tolerance of functional groups. A combination of experimental and computational approaches have been employed to uncover the key mechanistic features of these reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Tetrahedranes Containing the Unique Bridging Hetero&#8208;Dipnictogen Ligand EE&#8242; (E &#8800; E&#8242;=P, As, Sb, Bi)</title>

New synthetic pathway towards organometallic tetrahedrane derivatives [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;EE&#8242;)] (E&#8800;E&#8242;=P, As, Sb, Bi) involving a hetero&#8208;dipnictogen ligand is reported, leading to dramatic yield enhancements for already known compounds, the reduction of reaction steps and access to so far unknown AsSb, AsBi and SbBi ligand complexes, which feature unseen covalent bonds between two different heavy group 15 elements without organic substituents.







Abstract
In order to improve and extend the rare class of tetrahedral mixed main group transition metal compounds, a new synthetic route for the complexes [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;PE)] (E=As (1), Sb (2)) is described leading to higher yields and a decrease in reaction steps. Via this route, also the so far unknown heavier analogues containing AsSb (3&#8201;a), AsBi (4) and SbBi (5) ligands, respectively, are accessible. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments and DFT calculations reveal that they represent very rare examples of compounds comprising covalent bonds between two different heavy pnictogen atoms, which show multiple bond character and are stabilised without any organic substituents. A simple one&#8208;pot reaction of [CpMo(CO)2]2 with ME(SiMe3)2 (M=Li, K; E=P, As, Sb, Bi) and the subsequent addition of PCl3, AsCl3, SbCl3 or BiCl3, respectively, give the complexes 1&#8211;5. This synthesis is also transferable to the already known homo&#8208;dipnictogen complexes [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;E2)] (E=P, As, Sb, Bi) resulting in higher yields comparable to those in the literature reported procedures and allows the introduction of the bulkier and better soluble Cp&#8242; (Cp&#8242;=tert butylcyclopentadienyl) ligand.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Acceptor Propensity of Different Fluorine Atom Types: An Analysis of Experimentally and Computationally Derived Parameters</title>

Ab initio computed parameters and experimental 19F&#8197;NMR chemical shifts are used to assess the differential hydrogen bond acceptor propensity of various types of fluorine atoms with a particular emphasis for the different types of alkyl fluorides. Although weak, the hydrogen bond complexes formed by organic fluorine have important implications.







Abstract
The propensity of organic fluorine acting as a weak hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) in intermolecular and intramolecular interactions has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies often reaching different conclusions. Over the last few years, new and stronger evidences have emerged for the direct involvement of fluorine in weak hydrogen bond (HB) formation. However, not all the fluorine atom types can act as weak HBA. In this work, the differential HBA propensity of various types of fluorine atoms was analyzed with a particular emphasis for the different types of alkyl fluorides. This was carried out by evaluating ab initio computed parameters, experimental 19F&#8197;NMR chemical shifts and small molecule crystallographic structures (extracted from the CSD database). According to this analysis, shielded (with reference to the 19F&#8197;NMR chemical shift) alkyl mono&#8208;fluorinated motifs display the highest HBA propensity in agreement with solution studies. Although much weaker than other well&#8208;characterized HB complexes, the fragile HBs formed by these fluorinated motifs have important implications for the chemical&#8208;physical and structural properties of the molecules, chemical reactions, and protein&#8211;ligand recognition.

Opening the therapeutic window wider: An in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated DNA&#8208;scaffolded disulfide redox network (DdiSRN) can be used as a smart drug&#8208;delivery system. Drug release can be controlled and drug&#8208;delivery kinetics programmed by using DNA scaffolds for precise control over the position and number of disulfide bonds. As a therapeutic platform, this DdiSRN shows greatly enhanced therapeutic efficacy in cancer therapy.







Abstract
In response to specific stimuli, dynamic covalent materials enable the generation of new structures by reversibly forming/breaking chemical bonds, thus showing great potential for application in controlled drug release. However, using dynamic covalent chemistry to program drug&#8208;delivery kinetics remains challenging. Herein, an in&#8197;situ polymerization&#8208;generated DNA&#8208;scaffolded disulfide redox network (DdiSRN) is reported in which nucleic acids are used as a scaffold for dynamic disulfide bonds. The constructed DdiSRN allows selective release of loading cargos inside cancer cells in response to redox stimuli. Moreover, the density of disulfide bonds in network can be tuned by precise control over their position and number on DNA scaffolds. As a result, drug&#8208;delivery kinetics can be programmed with a half&#8208;life, t1/2, decreasing from 8.3 to 4.4&#8197;h, thus facilitating keeping an adequate drug concentration within the therapeutic window. Both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies confirm that co&#8208;delivery of DOX and siRNA in combination with fast drug release inside cells using this DdiSRN enhances the therapeutic effect on multidrug&#8208;resistant cancer. This nontrivial therapeutic platform enabling kinetic control provides a good paradigm for precision cancer medicine.

         <title>Aryne Multicomponent Reactions by Directed C&#8722;H Activation</title>

Arynes are known to undergo multicomponent reactions in non C&#8722;H active variants. The present article provides the application of in&#8208;situ generated arynes in multicomponent C&#8722;H activation reactions catalyzed by palladium and assisted by a combination of the additives sodium pivalate and potassium triflate. Unlike the earlier versions, phenanthridinones (heterocycles) were not observed in the 2&#8208;component fashion.







Abstract
Arylation via ortho C&#8722;H activation by the aid of directing groups has been explored recently by many researchers. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation using 8&#8208;aminoquinoline as a bidentate directing group has been developed. The reaction furnishes only C&#8722;H arylation, unlike previous methods where cyclization to corresponding isoquinolones is observed. More interestingly, sequential C&#8722;H functionalization was observed when methylacrylate and acrylonitrile was added; this led to C&#8722;H olefination with the aryl group, which was installed from the aryne precursor.

         <title>Spectroscopic Studies of Synthetic Methylaluminoxane: Structure of Methylaluminoxane Activators</title>

Hydrolysis of Me6Al2 using hydrated salts, or reaction of Me6Al2 with trimethylboroxine affords methylaluminoxane (MAO) with different ESI&#8208;MS spectra, NMR spectra and residual Me3Al content. Unlike commercial MAO, which upon treatment with donors, consists mainly of a single anionic species [(MeAlO)16(Me3Al)6Me]&#8722;=[16,6]&#8722;, synthetic MAO can differ significantly in its ion&#8208;pair speciation. Theory suggests the ion&#8208;pair precursors have sheet structures.







Abstract
Hydrolysis of trimethylaluminum (Me3Al) in polar solvents can be monitored by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) using the donor additive octamethyltrisiloxane [(Me3SiO)2SiMe2, OMTS]. Using hydrated salts, hydrolytic methylaluminoxane (h&#8208;MAO) features different anion distributions, depending on the conditions of synthesis, and different activator contents as measured by NMR spectroscopy. Non&#8208;hydrolytic MAO was prepared using trimethylboroxine. The properties of this material, which contains incorporated boron, differ significantly from h&#8208;MAO. In the case of MAO prepared by direct hydrolysis, oligomeric anions are observed to rapidly form, and then more slowly evolve into a mixture dominated by an anion with m/z 1375 with formula [(MeAlO)16(Me3Al)6Me]&#8722;. Theoretical calculations predict that sheet structures with composition (MeAlO)n(Me3Al)m are favoured over other motifs for MAO in the size range suggested by the ESI&#8208;MS experiments. A possible precursor to the m/z 1375 anion is a local minimum based on the free energy released upon hydrolysis of Me3Al.

         <title>Electrostatic Perturbations from the Protein Affect C&#8722;H Bond Strengths of the Substrate and Enable Negative Catalysis in the TmpA Biosynthesis Enzyme</title>

         <dc:description>
Density functional theory studies on large active site cluster models of the nonheme iron dioxygenase TmpA elucidated the origin of its chemoselectivity and identify it as negative catalysis, where an otherwise favorable channel is blocked. The enzyme succeeds in this thanks to charged residues in the substrate binding pocket, which produce a local electric dipole moment (&#956;D) and electric field and these electrostatic perturbations guide the reaction to a selective reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The nonheme iron dioxygenase 2&#8208;(trimethylammonio)&#8208;ethylphosphonate dioxygenase (TmpA) is an enzyme involved in the regio&#8208; and chemoselective hydroxylation at the C1&#8208;position of the substrate as part of the biosynthesis of glycine betaine in bacteria and carnitine in humans. To understand how the enzyme avoids breaking the weak C2&#8722;H bond in favor of C1&#8208;hydroxylation, we set up a cluster model of 242 atoms representing the first and second coordination sphere of the metal center and substrate binding pocket, and investigated possible reaction mechanisms of substrate activation by an iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species by density functional theory methods. In agreement with experimental product distributions, the calculations predict a favorable C1&#8208;hydroxylation pathway. The calculations show that the selectivity is guided through electrostatic perturbations inside the protein from charged residues, external electric fields and electric dipole moments. In particular, charged residues influence and perturb the homolytic bond strength of the C1&#8722;H and C2&#8722;H bonds of the substrate, and strongly strengthens the C2&#8722;H bond in the substrate&#8208;bound orientation.

         <title>Phenyl Silicates with Substituted Catecholate Ligands: Synthesis, Structural Studies and Reactivity</title>

A pathway less travelled: A general study of phenyl silicates bearing substituted catecholate ligands has been achieved. The silicates have been fully characterized and their reactivity under photooxidative conditions has been explored. Substitution of the catecholate moiety, notably with a 4&#8208;cyanocatecholato ligand, allowed the phenyl radical to be generated and trapped. Computational studies provided a rationale for these findings.







Abstract
While the generation of aryl radicals by photoredox catalysis under reductive conditions is well documented, it has remained challenging under an oxidative pathway. Because of the easy photo&#8208;oxidation of alkyl bis&#8208;catecholato silicates, a general study of phenyl silicates bearing substituted catecholate ligands has been achieved. The newly synthesized phenyl silicates have been fully characterized, and their reactivity has been explored. It was found that, thanks to the substitution of the catecholate moiety, notably with the 4&#8208;cyanocatecholato ligand, the phenyl radical could be generated and trapped. Computational studies provided a rationale for these findings.

The silicates have been fully characterized and their reactivity under photooxidative conditions has been explored. Substitution of the catecholate moiety, notably with a 4-cyanocatecholato ligand, allowed the phenyl radical to be generated and trapped. Computational studies provided a rationale for these findings.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the generation of aryl radicals by photoredox catalysis under reductive conditions is well documented, it has remained challenging under an oxidative pathway. Because of the easy photo-oxidation of alkyl bis-catecholato silicates, a general study of phenyl silicates bearing substituted catecholate ligands has been achieved. The newly synthesized phenyl silicates have been fully characterized, and their reactivity has been explored. It was found that, thanks to the substitution of the catecholate moiety, notably with the 4-cyanocatecholato ligand, the phenyl radical could be generated and trapped. Computational studies provided a rationale for these findings.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Forever Young: Structural Stability of Telomeric Guanine Quadruplexes in the Presence of Oxidative DNA Lesions**

The structural stability of guanine quadruplexes in the presence of oxidative lesions is revealed using molecular dynamics simulations, CD spectroscopy and immunofluorescence.







Abstract
Human telomeric DNA, in G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) conformation, is characterized by a remarkable structural stability that confers it the capacity to resist to oxidative stress producing one or even clustered 8&#8208;oxoguanine (8oxoG) lesions. We present a combined experimental/computational investigation, by using circular dichroism in aqueous solutions, cellular immunofluorescence assays and molecular dynamics simulations, that identifies the crucial role of the stability of G4s to oxidative lesions, related also to their biological role as inhibitors of telomerase, an enzyme overexpressed in most cancers associated to oxidative stress.

         <title>Simple Amides and Amines for the Synergistic Recovery of Rhodium from Hydrochloric Acid by Solvent Extraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8714-8722, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic combination of a simple primary amine (LA) and a simple primary amide (L1) is shown to extract rhodium from hydrochloric acid. A range of experimental and computational techniques are used to elucidate the structures of two different complexes in the organic phase; the ion&#8208;pair [HLA]3[RhCl6] and the amide complex [HLA]2[RhCl5(L1)]. In the latter complex, the amide is tautomerized to its enol form and coordinated through the nitrogen atom.







Abstract
The separation and isolation of many of the platinum group metals (PGMs) is currently achieved commercially using solvent extraction processes. The extraction of rhodium is problematic however, as a variety of complexes of the form [RhCln(H2O)6&#8208;n](n&#8722;3)&#8722; are found in hydrochloric acid, making it difficult to design a reagent that can extract all the rhodium. In this work, the synergistic combination of a primary amine (2&#8208;ethylhexylamine, LA) with a primary amide (3,5,5&#8208;trimethylhexanamide, L1) is shown to extract over 85&#8201;% of rhodium from 4&#8197;M hydrochloric acid. Two rhodium complexes are shown to reside in the organic phase, the ion&#8208;pair [HLA]3[RhCl6] and the amide complex [HLA]2[RhCl5(L1)]; in the latter complex, the amide is tautomerized to its enol form and coordinated to the rhodium centre through the nitrogen atom. This insight highlights the need for ligands that target specific metal complexes in the aqueous phase and provides an efficient synergistic solution for the solvent extraction of rhodium.

         <title>Self&#8208;Foaming Metal&#8208;Organic Gels Based on Phytic Acid and Their Mechanical, Moldable, and Load&#8208;Bearing Properties.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8791-8798, June 16, 2021. </description>

A series of metal&#8208;organic gels with various morphologies are synthesized successfully from phytic acid (PA), a natural phosphorus resource. Interestingly, PA&#8722;Fe&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;4 forms a self&#8208;foaming gel. The PA&#8722;Fe&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;4 foaming gel shows reversible thermal stimulus responsiveness, and the gel network is unusually weakened at room temperature. The PA&#8722;Fe&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;4 gel has moldable and load&#8208;bearing properties. It presents a novel strategy to develop supramolecular foaming gel materials based on naturally abundant resources.







Abstract
A catalogue of metal&#8208;organic gels are synthesized from phytic acid (PA) and a diversity of metal ions (Fe3+, Cr3+, Al3+, Ce3+, Y3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Mg2+) upon heating at 80&#8201;&#176;C. PA&#8722;M gels have various morphologies, including irregular granular (PA&#8722;Fe, PA&#8722;Al, PA&#8722;Ce, PA&#8722;Cr, PA&#8722;Ni, PA&#8722;Co), spongy (PA&#8722;Y), and hollow tremella&#8208;like (PA&#8722;Cu) morphologies. Interestingly for PA&#8722;Fe&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;4 (PA:Fe3+=1&#8201;:&#8201;4) a large amount of gas is generated during the gelation process leading to a self&#8208;foaming gel. The PA&#8722;Fe&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;4 self&#8208;foaming gel shows reversible gel&#8208;sol phase transition. The gel is unusually weakened and transformed into a sol at room temperature, and the sol is reversed to gelation when heated again at 80&#8201;&#176;C. PA&#8722;Fe&#8208;1&#8201;:&#8201;4 gel also shows shapeable and load&#8208;bearing properties, and it can bear up to 200 times of its weight, depending on the gas amount fixed in the foam gel and the aging time. This work provides a catalogue of self&#8208;foaming supramolecular gels with tunable properties based on naturally abundant resources.

         <title>Activation of a Copper Biscarbene Mechano&#8208;Catalyst Using Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy Supported by Quantum Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8723-8729, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Point break: A latent copper&#8208;biscarbene mechanocatalyst becomes active when a ligand is forcefully removed. Pulling with around 2&#8197;nN breaks the copper&#8208;carbon bond, as measured by single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy. To be able to assign the bond rupture event to the Cu&#8722;C bond, mechanophores with two different lengths of safety&#8208;line were specifically synthesized for use in this AFM experiment.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy allows investigation of the effect of mechanical force on individual bonds. By determining the forces necessary to sufficiently activate bonds to trigger dissociation, it is possible to predict the behavior of mechanophores. The force necessary to activate a copper biscarbene mechano&#8208;catalyst intended for self&#8208;healing materials was measured. By using a safety line bypassing the mechanophore, it was possible to pinpoint the dissociation of the investigated bond and determine rupture forces to range from 1.6 to 2.6&#8197;nN at room temperature in dimethyl sulfoxide. The average length&#8208;increase upon rupture of the Cu&#8722;C bond, due to the stretching of the safety line, agrees with quantum chemical calculations, but the values exhibit an unusual scattering. This scattering was assigned to the conformational flexibility of the mechanophore, which includes formation of a threaded structure and recoiling of the safety line.

         <title>Hydrophobic POM Electrocatalyst Achieves Low Voltage &#8220;Charge&#8221; in Zn&#8208;Air Battery Coupled with Bisphenol A Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8774-8781, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn&#8208;air battery was assembled with hydrophobic polyoxometalates (POM) as cathode material. Compared with common Zn&#8208;air battery, the &#8220;charge&#8221; voltage of this battery decreases very clearly.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;air batteriesare a perspective power source for grid&#8208;storage. But, after they are discharged at1.1 to 1.2&#8197;V, large overpotential is required for their charging (usually 2.5&#8197;V). This is due to a sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Incorporating organic pollutants into the cathode electrolyte is a feasible strategy for lowering the required charging potential. In the discharge process, the related oxygen reduction reaction, hydrophobic electrocatalysts are more popular than hydrophilic ones. Here, a hydrophobic bifunctional polyoxometalate electrocatalyst is synthesized by precise structural design. It shows excellent activities in both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions. In bisphenol A containing electrolyte, to achieve 100&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, its potential is only 1.32&#8197;V, which is 0.34&#8197;V lower than oxygen evolution reaction. In the oxygen reduction reaction, this electrocatalyst follows the four&#8208;electron mechanism. In both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions, it shows excellent stability. With this electrocatalyst as cathode material and bisphenol A containing KOH as electrolyte, a Zn&#8208;air battery was assembled. When &#8220;charged&#8221; at 85&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, it only requires 1.98&#8197;V. Peak power density of this Zn&#8208;air battery reaches 120.5&#8197;mW&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, in the &#8220;charge&#8221; process, bisphenol A is degraded, which achieves energy saving and pollutant removal simultaneously in one Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of NiLDH@YZ Hybrid and Mechanochemical Agitation on Glaser Homocoupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8875-8885, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the present study, NiLDH, YZ and amalgamated NiLDH@YZ catalysts were tested for the Glaser homocoupling reaction. The catalyst 0.5NiLDH@0.5YZ showed superior catalytic efficiency under mechanochemical agitation. This robust catalyst used for four times provides a new strategy in C&#8722;C coupling reactions by using mechanochemistry.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of nickel&#8208;layered double hydroxide amalgamated Y&#8208;zeolite (NiLDH@YZ) hybrids and the evaluation of the synergistic effect of various NiLDH@YZ catalysts and mechanochemical agitation on Glaser homocoupling reactions. Nitrogen adsorption&#8208;desorption experiments were carried out to estimate the surface area and porosity of NiLDH@YZ hybrids. The basicity and acidity of these hybrids were determined by CO2&#8208;TPD and NH3&#8208;TPD experiments respectively and this portrayed good acid&#8208;base bifunctional feature of the catalysts. The NiLDH@YZ&#8208;catalyzed mechanochemical Glaser coupling reaction achieved best yield of 83&#8201;% for the 0.5NiLDH@0.5YZ hybrid after 60&#8197;min of agitation, which revealed the highest acid&#8208;base bifunctional feature compared to all the investigated catalysts. The developed catalyst has proven itself as a robust and effective candidate that can successfully be employed up to four catalytic cycles without significant loss in catalytic activity, under optimized reaction conditions. This work demonstrated a new strategy for C&#8722;C bond formation enabled by the synergy between mechanochemistry and heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Plant&#8208;Derived Stilbenoids as DNA&#8208;Binding Agents: From Monomers to Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8832-8845, June 16, 2021. </description>

The stilbenoid (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin, deriving from trans&#8208;resveratrol dimerization, binds to minor and major grooves of B&#8208;DNA, and to 3&#8217;&#8208; and 5&#8217;&#8208;ends of G&#8208;quadruplex DNA by stacking on the outer quartets accompanied by rearrangement of flanking residues. Consistent with the ability to tightly interact with different DNA secondary structures, (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin shows DNA damaging activity.







Abstract
Stilbenoids are natural compounds endowed with several biological activities, including cardioprotection and cancer prevention. Among them, (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin, deriving from trans&#8208;resveratrol dimerization, was investigated in its ability to target DNA duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex structures by exploiting NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking. (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;Viniferin proved to bind both the minor and major grooves of duplexes, whereas it bound the 3&#8217;&#8208; and 5&#8217;&#8208;ends of a G&#8208;quadruplex by stacking on the outer quartets, accompanied by rearrangement of flanking residues. Specifically, (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin demonstrated higher affinity for the investigated DNA targets than its monomeric counterpart. Additionally, the methoxylated derivatives of (&#177;)&#8208;trans&#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin and trans&#8208;resveratrol, i.&#8201;e. (&#177;)&#8208;pterostilbene&#8208;trans&#8208;dihydrodimer and trans&#8208;pterostilbene, respectively, were evaluated, revealing similar binding modes, affinities and stoichiometries with the DNA targets as their parent analogues. All tested compounds were cytotoxic at &#956;M concentration on several cancer cell lines, showing DNA damaging activity consistent with their ability to tightly interact with duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex structures.

         <title>[10]CPP&#8208;Based Inclusion Complexes of Charged Fulleropyrrolidines. Effect of the Charge Location on the Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8737-8744, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Positive charge on fullerene unit stabilizes the charge separated excited states of [10]CPP&#8208;fulleropyrrolidine inclusion complexes. The electron transfer occurs from [10]CPP to fullerene moiety on a nanosecond to picosecond time scale. The CT band of the charged complexes demonstrates the hypsochromic (or blue) shift with increasing solvent polarity.







Abstract
A number of non&#8208;covalently bound donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, consisting of C60 as the electron acceptor and cycloparaphenylene (CPP) as the electron donor, have been reported. A hypsochromic shift of the charge transfer (CT) band in polar medium has been found in [10]CPP&#8835;Li+@C60. To explore this anomalous effect, we study inclusion complexes [10]CPP&#8835;Li+@C60&#8208;MP, [10]CPP&#8835;C60&#8208;MPH+, and [10]CPP&#8835;C60&#8208;PPyMe+ formed by fulleropyrrolidine derivatives and [10]CPP using the DFT/TDDFT approach. We show that the introduction of a positively charged fragment into fullerene stabilizes CT states that become the lowest&#8208;lying excited states. These charge&#8208;separated states can be generated by the decay of locally excited states on a nanosecond to picosecond time scale. The distance of the charged fragment to the center of the fullerenic cage and its accessibility to the solvent determine the strength of the hypsochromic shift.

The distance of the charged fragment to the center of the fullerenic cage and its accessibility to the solvent determine the strength of the hypsochromic shift.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Triggered Structural Dynamics of Non&#8208;Coordinating Guest Moieties in a Fluorescent Actinide Polyrotaxane Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8730-8736, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorescent uranyl&#8208;coordination polyrotaxane only connected by macrocyclic host has been constructed. The non&#8208;coordinating guest (C7BPy) in the obtained polyrotaxane shows thermal displacement and dynamic conformational variations with temperature increasing from 150 to 300&#8197;K. Meanwhile, this polyrotaxene can selectively detect Fe3+ over other eight competing cations in aqueous solution, with the limit of Fe3+ detection as low as 4.4&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;ppm.







Abstract
We present here the synthesis of a novel fluorescent actinide polyrotaxane compound URCP1 through the utilization of an end&#8208;cutting pseudorotaxane precursor with only the cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) macrocyclic components acting as linking struts. The non&#8208;coordinating guest motif in the obtained polyrotaxane, with increased freedom and structural flexibility, can display intriguing temperature&#8208;triggered conformational variations inside the cavity of CB[6], which was clearly evidenced by crystallographic snapshots at different temperatures. Notably, this observation of temperature&#8208;triggered structural dynamics in URCP1 represents the first report of actinide polyrotaxane with such feature in solid&#8208;state. Moreover, URCP1 has a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 49.8&#8201;%, comparable to other luminescent uranyl compounds, and can work as a fluorescent probe to selectively detect Fe3+ over other eight competing cations in aqueous solution, with the limit of detection being as low as 4.4&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;ppm.

         <title>Benzenedisulfonic Acid as an ALD/MLD Building Block for Crystalline Metal&#8208;Organic Thin Films**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8799-8803, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new organic linker for atomic/molecular layer depositions (ALD/MLD) was demonstrated with copper and lithium metal nodes. The films are crystalline with and without water of crystallization. The applicability of dilithium&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedisulfonate as a solid polymer ion conductor is assessed.







Abstract
Two new atomic/molecular layer deposition processes for depositing crystalline metal&#8208;organic thin films, built from 1,4&#8208;benzenedisulfonate (BDS) as the organic linker and Cu or Li as the metal node, are reported. The processes yield in&#8208;situ crystalline but hydrated Cu&#8208;BDS and Li&#8208;BDS films; in the former case, the crystal structure is of a previously known metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;like structure, while in the latter case not known from previous studies. Both hydrated materials can be readily dried to obtain the crystalline unhydrated phases. The stability and the ionic conductivity of the unhydrated Li&#8208;BDS films were characterized to assess their applicability as a thin film solid polymer Li&#8208;ion conductor.

Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance, since they can be used in several chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. The synthesis of these compounds is addressed from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods. For more information, see the Minireview by L.&#8197;L. Baldassari and D.&#8197;S. L&#252;dtke on page&#8197;8656&#8197;ff.

Receptorflix would ideally enable researchers to visualize any already&#8208;targeted transmembrane receptor at the cell's surface. Tailor&#8208;made fluorescent ligands accessed by coupling pharmacophores to organic fluorescent dyes are successfully employed to image GPCRs, LGICs, and VGICs. Recent advances in fluorescence microscopy and progress in dye synthesis enable their use in distinct techniques and model organisms. Read more about the literature of the last 25&#8197;years on the topic, including fluorescent ligand design and subsequent use in fluorescence imaging techniques to study the three most common classes of transmembrane receptors in the Review by S. Munck and E. Ismalaj et&#8197;al. on 8605 ff.

         <title>Cover Feature: Temperature&#8208;Triggered Structural Dynamics of Non&#8208;Coordinating Guest Moieties in a Fluorescent Actinide Polyrotaxane Framework (Chem. Eur. J. 34/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8603-8603, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An actinide polyrotaxane compound URCP1 with characteristic green fluorescence from uranyl centers was prepared through the utilization of an end&#8208;cutting pseudorotaxane precursor with only the cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) macrocyclic components acting as linking struts. The non&#8208;coordinating guest motif in URCP1 has increased freedom and structural flexibility, and displays intriguing temperature&#8208;triggered dynamic conformational variations inside the cavity of CB[6]. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. Mei et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100614).

         <title>Cover Feature: Simple Amides and Amines for the Synergistic Recovery of Rhodium from Hydrochloric Acid by Solvent Extraction (Chem. Eur. J. 34/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8601-8601, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple primary amides and amines have been shown to operate in tandem to synergistically transport both inner&#8208; and outer&#8208;sphere rhodium chloridometalate complexes from aqueous hydrochloric acid into an organic phase in solvent extraction experiments. The complexes have been identified using a range of analytical, spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational techniques. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8197;A. Morrison, J.&#8197;B. Love, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100630).

         <title>Front Cover: Cooperative Ligands in Dissolution of Gold (Chem. Eur. J. 34/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8600-8600, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissolution of elemental gold occurs promptly with two different thiol ligands that act in a cooperative manner. The reaction benefits from the dynamic coordination sphere of AuI species that enables the dissolution to proceed via ligand&#8208;exchange reactions. The dissolution proceeds from left to right and the birds represent the different Au species that form during the dissolution. Pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;thiol serves as the initiating ligand and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole ligands stabilize the formed AuI cations in the dissolution. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Repo et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101028).

Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy was used to activate a copper biscarbene (NHC) mechano&#8208;catalyst intended for self&#8208;healing materials. By using a safety line, bypassing the mechanophore, we were able to pinpoint the dissociation of the investigated bond and determine rupture forces of the Cu&#8722;NHC bond to range from 1.6 to 2.6&#8197;nN at room temperature in dimethyl sulfoxide. Quantum chemical calculations support the experimental results. More information can be found in the Full Paper by W.&#8197;H.&#8197;Binder, M.&#8197;K.&#8197;Beyer et&#8197;al.

         <title>Conjugated Molecular Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8642-8655, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic efforts to bend aromatic surfaces have had a remarkable evolution during the last dozen years. Conjugated nanorings and nanobelts are among the most well&#8208;known examples. However, this progress has also led to the synthesis of molecular compounds with permanent tubular shapes with radial and axial &#960; surfaces, which are the highlight of this Minireview.







Abstract
Molecular compounds with permanent tubular architectures displaying radial &#960;&#8208;conjugation are exceedingly rare. Their radial and axial delocalization presents them with unique optical and electronic properties, such as remarkable tuning of their Stokes shifts, and redox switching between global and local aromaticity. Although these tubular compounds display large internal void spaces, these attributes have not been extensively explored, thus presenting future opportunities in the development of materials. By using cutting&#8208;edge synthetic methodologies to bend aromatic surfaces, large opportunities in synthesis, property discovery, and applications are expected in new members of this family of conjugated molecular nanotubes.

Selenoesters are an important class of compounds that have wide possibilities for chemical transformations, being considered excellent building blocks for the synthesis of more complex molecules. In this review, an overview of the available methods for the synthesis of selenoesters will be presented. This overview is hoped to serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new strategies for the synthesis of this type of compound, as well as for their use as building blocks in synthesis.







Abstract
Selenoesters are compounds of great synthetic relevance since they can be used in several types of chemical transformations and mainly due to their great capacity in the formation of acyl radicals. Therefore, the scientific community has been developing several methods for the synthesis of this class of molecules. This review will address the synthesis of these compounds from different starting materials, such as carboxylic acids derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides), aldehydes, selenoacetylenes and miscellaneous methods.

         <title>Lighting Up the Plasma Membrane: Development and Applications of Fluorescent Ligands for Transmembrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8605-8641, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we overview progress made during the last two decades in small&#8208;molecule fluorescent ligand design and their applications as tools using different fluorescence microscopy techniques. After a brief introduction on their drawbacks and advantages, we particularly focus on their use as versatile tools to study transmembrane proteins including the superfamilies of G&#160;protein&#8208;coupled receptor, ligand&#8208; and voltage&#8208;gated ion channels.







Abstract
Despite the fact that transmembrane proteins represent the main therapeutic targets for decades, complete and in&#8208;depth knowledge about their biochemical and pharmacological profiling is not fully available. In this regard, target&#8208;tailored small&#8208;molecule fluorescent ligands are a viable approach to fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle. Such tools, coupled with the ability of high&#8208;precision optical techniques to image with an unprecedented resolution at a single&#8208;molecule level, helped unraveling many of the conundrums related to plasma proteins&#8217; life&#8208;cycle and druggability. Herein, we review the recent progress made during the last two decades in fluorescent ligand design and potential applications in fluorescence microscopy of voltage&#8208;gated ion channels, ligand&#8208;gated ion channels and G&#8208;coupled protein receptors.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of 11C&#8208;Labelled Primary Benzamides via Intermediate [11C]Aroyl Dimethylaminopyridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8689-8693, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and efficient method for radiolabeling of primary amides with the positron emitting radionuclide carbon&#8208;11 was developed. The method relies on intermediate electrophilic 11C&#8208;labelled aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium salts, prepared via carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with [11C]carbon monoxide.







Abstract
Electrophilic 11C&#8208;labelled aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium salts, obtained by carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with [11C]carbon monoxide, were prepared for the first time and shown to be valuable intermediates in the synthesis of primary [11C]benzamides. The methodology furnished a set of benzamide model compounds, including the two poly (ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors niraparib and veliparib, in moderate to excellent radiochemical yields. In addition to providing a convenient and practical route to primary [11C]benzamides, the current method paves the way for future application of [11C]aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium halide salts in positron emission tomography (PET) tracer synthesis.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light Synthesis of Arylsulfonyl Fluorides: Scope and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8704-8708, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key to success in the new metal&#8208;free visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of arylsulfonyl fluorides was using cyanoarene PC3 as organo&#8208;photocatalyst. A variety of arene diazonium slats were smoothly converted to the corresponding product. Mechanistic investigations including luminescence, EPR spectroscopy as well as DFT calculation allowed us to identify several key intermediates and propose a plausible mechanism.







Abstract
The first metal&#8208;free procedure for the synthesis of arylsulfonyl fluorides is reported. Under organo&#8208;photoredox conditions, aryl diazonium salts react with a readily available SO2 source (DABSO) to afford the desired product through simple nucleophilic fluorination. The reaction tolerates the presence of both electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;poor aryls and demonstrated a broad functional group tolerance. To shed the light on the reaction mechanism, several experimental techniques were combined, including fluorescence, NMR, and EPR spectroscopy as well as DFT calculations.

         <title>Porous Organic Phenanthroline&#8208;Based Polymer as an Efficient Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalyst for Direct Aromatic C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8684-8688, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed and constructed a porous phenanthroline&#8208;based polymer (namely POP&#8208;Phen) via free radical polymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized phenanthroline monomers. The resultant POP&#8208;Phen has a high surface area, abundant and permanent porosity, is excellently thermal and has a high concentration of organic ligands. POP&#8208;Phen shows excellent catalytic performance in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation, even better than the corresponding homogeneous catalyst. This is mainly attributed to the high density of catalytically active sites in the heterogeneous catalyst.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H bond transformation has been regarded as one of the most important areas in organic synthesis in both academia and industry. However, the heterogeneous transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysis of direct C&#8722;H bond transformation has remained a contemporary challenge. To tackle this challenge, we designed and constructed a porous phenanthroline&#8208;based polymer (namely POP&#8208;Phen) via free radical polymerization of vinyl&#8208;functionalized phenanthroline monomers. POP&#8208;Phen shows excellent catalytic performances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation, even better than those of the corresponding homogeneous catalyst, which is mainly attributed to the high density of catalytically active sites in the heterogeneous catalyst. Kinetic isotope experiments and spectral characterizations demonstrate the electron&#8208;transfer between the heterogeneous catalyst and the base (t&#8208;BuOK), a key step for C&#8722;H activation. We believe that this porous organic phenanthroline polymer could open a new door for the design of novel heterogeneous transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts for direct C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Covalent 2D Patterning, Local Electronic Structure and Polarization Switching of Graphene at the Nanometer Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8709-8713, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale patterning and tailoring of graphene was realized by a very facile and highly efficient approach, which includes a first&#8208;step patterned fluorination with a very high degree of functionalization, realized by laser writing, and a subsequent nucleophilic substitution of the attached fluorine atoms with thiophene groups.







Abstract
A very facile and efficient protocol for the covalent patterning and properties tuning of graphene is reported. Highly reactive fluorine radicals were added to confined regions of graphene directed by laser writing on graphene coated with 1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethylbenziodoxole. This process allows for the realization of exquisite patterns on graphene with resolutions down to 200&#8197;nm. The degree of functionalization, ranging from the unfunctionalized graphene to extremely high functionalized graphene, can be precisely tuned by controlling the laser irradiation time. Subsequent substitution of the initially patterned fluorine atoms afforded an unprecedented graphene nanostructure bearing thiophene groups. This substitution led to a complete switch of both the electronic structure and the polarization within the patterned graphene regions. This approach paves the way towards the precise modulation of the structure and properties of nanostructured graphene.

This substitution led to a complete switch of both the electronic structure and the polarization within the patterned graphene regions. This approach paves the way towards the precise modulation of the structure and properties of nanostructured graphene.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Nanosheet&#8208;Stacked Hierarchical &#8220;Honey Stick&#8208;like&#8221; MFI Zeolites by an Aromatic Heterocyclic Dual&#8208;Functional Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>

Between the sheets: A nanosheet&#8208;stacked hierarchical MFI zeolite (NSHM) has been synthesized by using a triply branched s&#8208;triazine&#8208;based surfactant as a bifunctional soft template, and a mechanism for its formation is proposed. The NSHM had abundant mesopores created by the stacked nanosheets and a high surface area (430&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, superior catalytic performance in the oxidation of cyclohexane is shown by NSHM with palladium loading.







Abstract
Soft template designing is the most promising strategy for the synthesis of zeolite nanosheets. MFI nanosheets directed by soft templates (containing long&#8208;chain alkyl groups or aromatic groups as hydrophobic component) can be found frequently; however, so far, MFI nanosheets synthesized by soft templates with aromatic heterocycle groups (e.&#8201;g., s&#8208;triazine groups) are rare. Herein, a nanosheet&#8208;stacked hierarchical MFI zeolite (NSHM) has been synthesized by using a triply branched s&#8208;triazine&#8208;based surfactant as a bifunctional organic structure&#8208;directing agent. On the basis of a geometrical match relationship, a formation model has been proposed. Synthesized NSHM had abundant mesopores stacked by nanosheets and exhibited a high surface area (430&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1). The 1&#8197;wt% Pd/NSHM attained a significant increase in yield of cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone mixture (from 66 to 85&#8201;%) in the oxidation of cyclohexane compared with Silicalite&#8208;1 and SBA&#8208;15 as supports.

         <title>Environmentally Friendly, Photochemical Access to [
]AuIII Pincer Complexes By Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 34, Page 8673-8677, June 16, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first selective general procedure for the rarely investigated [NCN]AuIII complex class was developed. In a photochemical step, different gold(III) complexes can be easily synthesized, offering a fast entry to highly valued scaffolds for OLEDs, gas&#8208;sensors or anticancer drugs, respectively. Both (DMS)gold chloride complexes or (DMS)gold organometallic compounds can be used as starting materials introducing the gold center (DMS=dimethylsulfide), which further expands the synthetic possibilities.







Abstract
Starting from commercially available DMSAuCl and diazonium salts, cationic [
]AuIII complexes were synthesized in a selective, photosensitizer&#8208;free, photochemical reaction by irradiation with blue LED light. This new protocol represents the first easy synthesis of these types of pincer complexes in moderate to excellent yield starting from a readily available gold(I) precursor with nitrogen as the only by&#8208;product. Owing to the disadvantages of known protocols, especially the toxicity in the case of a transmetalation with mercury or the necessity for a mostly twofold excess of a gold precursor, this method offers an attractive alternative towards this kind of gold(III) complexes. In addition, the first arylated [
]Au(III) pincer complex was synthesized by using this technology.

Excitation, delocalization, emission: Molecules of crystallographically asymmetric anti&#8208;[2.2](1,4)(4,1)fluorenophane (K2C&#8208;2) aggregate to form one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular chain structures through effective intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlapping.

Abstract
A series of new [2,2]fluorenophanes has been synthesized and characterized; among them, molecules of crystallographically asymmetric anti&#8208;[2.2](1,4)(4,1)fluorenophane (K2C&#8208;2) aggregate to form one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular chain structures through effective intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlapping. This, in combination with the synergistic intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, leads to prominent dual emission mediated by charge transfer (CT) exciton delocalization. Support of this new insight is given by mapping the transition density along the &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing direction where the intramolecular excitation and intermolecular CT coexist in K2C&#8208;2.

         <title>Cooperative Ligands in Dissolution of Gold</title>

Dissolution of elemental gold: Gold is dissolved promptly with a combination of two different thiol ligands by ligand&#8208;exchange reaction. Pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;thiol serves as the initiating ligand and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole ligands stabilize the formed AuI cations in the dissolution.







Abstract
Development of new, environmentally benign dissolution methods for metallic gold is driven by needs in the circular economy. Gold is widely used in consumer electronics, but sustainable and selective dissolution methods for Au are scarce. Herein, we describe a quantitative dissolution of gold in organic solution under mild conditions by using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. In the dissolution reaction, two thiol ligands, pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;thiol and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole, work in a cooperative manner. The mechanistic investigations suggest that two pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;thiol molecules form a complex with Au0 that can be oxidized, whereas the role of inexpensive 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole is to stabilize the formed AuI species through a ligand exchange process. Under optimized conditions, the reaction proceeds vigorously and gold dissolves quantitatively in two hours. The demonstrated ligand&#8208;exchange mechanism with two thiols allows to drastically reduce the thiol consumption and may lead to even more effective gold dissolution methods in the future.

The layered configuration in SBBO crystals gives them excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties. Here, four new alumino&#8208;/galloborates with the general formula RbMT3(BO3)2O3 (M=Ba, Sr; T=Al, Ga) have been synthesized by using a high&#8208;temperature solution method. They have SBBO&#8208;like structures formed by the [BO3] triangles and [TO4] tetrahedra.







Abstract
Four new alumino&#8208;/galloborates RbMT3(BO3)2O3 (M=Ba, Sr; T=Al, Ga) have been synthesized for the first time by using a high&#8208;temperature solution method. All the title compounds have Sr2Be2B2O7&#8208;like structures, in which the [BO3] triangles and [TO4] tetrahedra form the final double&#8208;layered configurations with the M&#8208; and Rb&#8208;site atoms located between and in the double layer, respectively. The structure evolution from Sr2Be2B2O7 to RbMT3(BO3)2O3 series is discussed. The broader energy bandgaps in Al&#8208;based borates when compared with Ga&#8208;based ones can be entirely attributed to the location of Al/Ga s orbitals near the Fermi surface. Both experimental and computational approaches were used to study their structure&#8208;property relationships.

&#8220;Gold is a valuable component in electronic waste, but a major barrier towards its efficient recycling is the inability to selectively dissolve gold under mild and benign conditions. In this respect, our gold dissolution research is driven by the world's megatrends, such as resource scarcity and waste management challenges. Dissolution and recycling of noble metals is in the core of a circular economy and the challenge that our topic thiol&#8208;assisted dissolution of gold aspires to solve.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;8668&#8197;ff.

         <title>Chiral Perylene Bisimide Dyes by Interlocked Arene Substituents in the Bay Area</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of perylene bisimide (PBI) dyes bearing various aryl substituents in 1,6,7,12 bay positions has been synthesized by Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction. These molecules exhibit an exceptionally large and conformationally fixed twist angle of the PBI  &#960;&#8208;  core due to the high steric congestion imparted by the aryl substituents in bay positions. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses of phenyl&#8208;, naphthyl&#8208; and pyrenyl&#8208;functionalized PBIs reveal interlocked  &#960;&#8209;&#960;  &#8209;stacking motifs, leading to conformational chirality and the possibility for the isolation of enantiopure atropoisomers by semipreparative HPLC chromatography. The interlocked arrangement endows these molecules with substantial racemization barriers of about 120&#160;kJ&#160;mol  &#8209;1  for the tetraphenyl&#8208; and tetra&#8208;2&#8209;naphthyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, which is among the highest racemization barriers for axially chiral PBIs. Variable temperature NMR studies reveal the presence of a multitude of up to fourteen conformational isomers in solution that are interconverted via smaller activation barriers of about 65 kJ&#160;mol  &#8209;1  . The redox and optical properties of these core&#8208;twisted PBIs have been characterized by cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis/NIR and fluorescence spectroscopy and their respective atropoenantiomers were further characterized by circular dichroism (CD) and circular polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Native Chemical Ligation&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes for Cysteine and Aminopeptidase N using meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>meso&#8208;Carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY responds to small electronic changes resulting from acyl substitution reactions with a marked change in fluorescence. Herein, the minute changes that accompany the thioester to amide conversion encountered in native chemical ligation (NCL) are exploited in the construction of fluorescent &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; probes. Two fluorogenic probes, 1a and 4, derived from a meso&#8208;thioester&#8208;BODIPY scaffold, were designed for the selective detection of cysteine (1a) and aminopeptidase N (4), respectively. The aromatic (1a) and aliphatic (4) thioesters of meso&#8208;carboxyl&#8208;BODIPY are nonfluorescent. However, specific analyte&#8208;induced conversion to the meso&#8208;amide derivative caused significant spectral changes and a dramatic fluorescence enhancement. Probe 1a exhibited a large fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response with high selectivity toward cysteine via a tandem NCL reaction. Probe 4 was successfully applied to the monitoring and imaging of endogenous aminopeptidase N in live cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer (PCET) with 1,4&#8208;Bisguanidino&#8208;Benzene Derivatives: Comparative Study and Use in Acid&#8208;Initiated C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is of key importance in modern synthetic chemistry. Redox&#8208;active guanidines were established by our group as valuable alternatives to toxic high&#8208;potential benzoquinones in a variety of different PCET reactions. In this work, we evaluate the PCET reactivity of a series of 1,4&#8208;bisguanidino&#8208;benzenes varying in their redox potentials and proton affinities. The relevant redox and protonation states are fully characterized and the compounds sorted with respect to their PCET reactivity by comparative PCET experiments supplemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Depending on the studied reactions, the driving force is either electron transfer or proton transfer; thereby the influence of both processes on the overall reactivity could be assessed. Then, two of the PCET reagents are applied in representative oxidative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reactions, namely the intramolecular coupling of 3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;tetramethoxy&#8208;  o  &#8208;terphenyl to give the corresponding triphenylene, the intermolecular coupling of  N  &#8208;ethylcarbazole to give  N  ,  N  &#8217;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;bicarbazole, and in the oxidative lactonization of 2&#8208;&#8203;[(4&#8208;&#8203;methoxyphenyl)&#8203;methyl]&#8203;&#8208;benzoic acid. Under mild conditions, the reactions proceed fast and efficient. Only small amounts of acid are needed, in clear contrast to the corresponding coupling reactions with traditional high&#8208;potential benzoquinones such as DDQ or chloranil requiring a large excess of a strong acid.</dc:description>

Redox-active guanidines were established by our group as valuable alternatives to toxic high-potential benzoquinones in a variety of different PCET reactions.

The relevant redox and protonation states are fully characterized and the compounds sorted with respect to their PCET reactivity by comparative PCET experiments supplemented by quantum-chemical calculations. Depending on the studied reactions, the driving force is either electron transfer or proton transfer; thereby the influence of both processes on the overall reactivity could be assessed.

         <dc:description>This review highlights the major efforts devoted to the development of molecular gears over the past forty years, from the pioneering covalent bis&#8208;triptycyl systems undergoing intramolecular correlated rotation in solution, to the most recent examples of gearing systems anchored on a surface, allowing for intermolecular transmission of mechanical power. Emphasis is laid on the different strategies devised progressively to control the architectures of molecular bevel and spur gears, as intramolecular systems in solution or intermolecular systems on surfaces, while aiming at increased efficiency, complexity and functionality.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloaddition reactions, in particular Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, have attracted a lot of attention from organic chemists since they represent one of the most powerful methodologies for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. In particular, inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions have been an important breakthrough for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds. Among all their variants, the organocatalytic enantioselective version has been widely explored since the asymmetric construction of diversely functionalized scaffolds under reaction conditions encompassed within the green chemistry field is of great interest. In this review, a profound revision on the latest advances on the organocatalytic asymmetric inverse&#8208;electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction is shown.</dc:description>

         <title>Labeling and Probing the Silica Surface Using Mechanochemistry and 17O NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing cost&#8208;efficient, fast, and user&#8208;friendly  17  O enrichment protocols to help understand the structure and reactivity of materials using  17  O NMR. Here, we show for the first time how ball milling (BM) can be used to selectively and efficiently enrich the surface of fumed silica, which is widely used at the industrial scale. Short milling times (up to 15 min) allowed modulation of the enrichment level (up to ca. 5%) without significantly changing the nature of the material. High&#8208;precision  17  O&#8208;compositions were measured at different milling times using&#160;large&#8208;geometry secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry&#160; LG&#8208;SIMS. High&#8208;resolution  17  O NMR analyses (including at 35.2 T) allowed clear identification of the signals from siloxane (Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si) and silanols (Si&#8208;OH), while DNP analyses, performed using direct  17  O polarization and indirect  17  O{  1  H} CP excitation, agreed with selective labeling of the surface. Information on the distribution of Si&#8208;OH environments at the surface was obtained from 2D  1  H&#8208;  17  O D&#8208;HMQC correlations. Finally, the surface&#8208;labeled silica was reacted with titania and using  17  O DNP, their common interface was probed and Si&#8208;O&#8208;Ti bonds identified.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrasubstituted Peropyrenes Formed by Reductive Aromatization: Synthesis, Functionalization and Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3,8,10&#8208;Tetrasubstituted peropyrenes were synthesized via a reductive aromatization and functionalization strategy. Finetuning of their optoelectronic properties was monitored by UV&#8208;Vis, PL, XRD, CV, and DFT methods.







Abstract
The chromophore class of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrasubstituted peropyrenes was effectively synthesized from peropyrenequinone via a Zn&#8208;mediated reductive aromatization approach. In one step, a symmetric functionalization of the peropyrene backbone introducing silylethers (2,3), pivaloyl (4), triflyl (5) and also phosphinite (6) groups was established. Furthermore, the potential of using 4 and 5 in transition metal catalysed cross couplings was explored leading to 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetraaryl (8&#8208;11) and tetraalkynyl (7) peropyrenes. The influence of various substituents on the optoelectronic properties of these &#960;&#8208;system extended peropyrenes was investigated in solid state by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, in solution by means of UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and by their redox properties studied via cyclic voltammetry. By comparison with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, it could be elucidated that introduction of a broad variety of substituents in such versatile one or two step procedures leads to peropyrenes with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies ranging in a gap window of 0.8 eV. The frontier molecular orbital energies identify the target molecules as promising candidates for hole transporting semiconductors.

         <title>Study of Ground State Interactions of Enantiopure Chiral Quaternary Ammonium Salts and Amides, Nitroalkanes, Nitroalkenes, Esters, Heterocycles, Ketones and Fluoroamides</title>

         <dc:description>
1H&#8197;NMR titration experiments were carried out on Cinchona and Maruoka type quaternary ammonium salts, by using neutral ligands. The data clarified the principal interactions involved between catalyst and reactants, showed the binding of halides and non&#8208;coordinating anion BArF to chiral ammonium species, and provided a guide to understanding the enantioselective processes mediated by this class of organocatalysts.







Abstract
Chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalysis provides high level of enantiocontrol, however no experimental data showed the interaction of catalysts and substrates. 1H&#8197;NMR titration was carried out on Cinchona and Maruoka ammonium bromides vs. nitro, carbonyl, heterocycles, and N&#8722;F containing compounds. It was found that neutral organic species and quaternary ammonium salts interacted via an ensemble of catalyst +N&#8722;C&#8722;H and (sp2)C&#8722;H, specific for each substrate studied. The correspondent BArF salts interacted with carbonyls via a diverse set of +N&#8722;C&#8722;H and (sp2)C&#8722;H compared to bromides. This data suggests that BArF ammonium salts may display a different enantioselectivity profile. Although not providing quantitative data for the affinity constants, the data reported proofs that chiral ammonium salts coordinate with substrates, prior to transition state, through specific C&#8722;H positions in their structures, providing a new rational to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity in their catalyses.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometric structural and functional design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been demonstrated as a powerful tool to construct various COFs with tailor&#8208;made properties. Regular arrangements of donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties in D&#8722;A COFs render the formation of segregated D&#8722;A stacks, thus provides abundant pathways and channels for effective charge carriers transport. This review highlights the significant progress on D&#8722;A COFs over the past decade with emphasis on the design principles, growing structural diversities, and promising application potentials.







Abstract
Intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect has been widely studied in both small molecules and linear polymers. Covalently&#8208;bonded donor&#8208;acceptor pairs with tunable bandgaps and photoelectric properties endow these materials with potential applications in optoelectronics, fluorescent bioimaging, and sensors, etc. However, owing to the lack of charge transfer pathway or effective separation of charge carriers, unfavorable charge recombination gives rise to inevitable energy loss. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be mediated with various geometry&#8208; and property&#8208;tailored building blocks, where donor (D) and acceptor (A) segments are connected by covalent bonds and can be finely arranged to form highly ordered networks (namely D&#8722;A COFs). The unique structural features of D&#8722;A COFs render the formation of segregated D&#8722;A stacks, thus provides pathways and channels for effective charge carriers transport. This review highlights the significant progress on D&#8722;A COFs over the past decade with emphasis on design principles, growing structural diversities, and promising application potentials.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Deoxygenation of Chiral Nitroalkanes: An Easy Entry to &#945;&#8208;Substituted Enantiomerically Enriched Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoselective divergent methodology for the reduction of aliphatic nitro compounds into nitriles and amines has been developed. The protocol efficiently affords optically active nitriles starting from chiral nitroalkanes. In the reaction inexpensive bulk chemicals are employed and the use of heavy metals is precluded, thereby excluding potential contamination of the product by metal impurities.







Abstract
A metal&#8208;free, mild and chemodivergent transformation involving nitroalkanes has been developed. Under optimized reaction conditions, in the presence of trichlorosilane and a tertiary amine, aliphatic nitroalkanes were selectively converted into amines or nitriles. Furthermore, when chiral &#946;&#8208;substituted nitro compounds were reacted, the stereochemical integrity of the stereocenter was maintained and &#945;&#8208;functionalized nitriles were obtained with no loss of enantiomeric excess. The methodology was successfully applied to the synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;cyano esters, &#945;&#8208;aryl alkylnitriles, and TBS&#8208;protected cyanohydrins, including direct precursors of four active pharmaceutical ingredients (ibuprofen, tembamide, aegeline and denopamine).

         <title>Oxyphosphonium Enolate Equilibria in a (4+1)&#8208;Cycloaddition Approach toward Quaternary C3&#8208;Spirooxindole Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected balancing act! The efficient phosphorus&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot formal (4+1)&#8208;cycloaddition between an in&#8197;situ generated oxyphosphonium enolate and an ortho&#8208;quinone methide provides spirooxindole benzofurans in appreciable yields and diastereoselectivity despite a delicate balance of intermediate equilibria.







Abstract
An efficient and convergent (4+1)&#8208;cycloaddition strategy toward the construction of spirooxindole benzofurans that involves the intermediacy of an isatin&#8208;derived oxyphosphonium enolate is presented. Mechanistic investigations employing in&#8197;situ NMR analysis of the reaction mixture revealed a correlation between phosphonium enolate structure and product distribution that was heavily influenced by the solvent and reaction temperature.

&#8220;DNA Aptaomics&#8221; is reported in this work for finding functional DNA aptamers by a semi&#8208;comprehensive and quantitative single&#8208;round selection using capillary electrophoresis and next generation sequencing according to a selection rule based on analogous sequences. By mining sequence data obtained from sub&#8208;libraries with different DNA conformations, structure&#8208;induced (FRET type) aptamers for thrombin were reasonably selected for the first time.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuteration of Aromatic Carbonyl Compounds with a Catalytic Transient Directing Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a joint endeavor, a ruthenium catalyst and a catalytic amine enable the deuteration of aromatic aldehydes and ketones using cheap and convenient D2O as deuterium source. The amine serves as a transient directing group, forming imines in situ and thus facilitating coordination of the ruthenium catalyst to the substrates. The practical applicability of this novel methodology is demonstrated by the successful deuteration of a range of (hetero)aromatic carbonyl compounds as well as pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Towards DNA&#8208;Encoded Micellar Chemistry: DNA&#8208;Micelle Association and Environment Sensitivity of Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of DNA&#8208;compatible reactions is central to advance DNA&#8208;encoded library technology. Amphiphilic block copolymer micelles functionalized with sulfonic acid moieties assemble in water to micelles and localize the catalyst in them. DNA&#8208;aldehyde conjugates were reacted to target heterocycles by micelle&#8208;promoted Povarov&#8208; and Biginelli&#8208;reaction with minimal DNA damage. Strikingly, DNA&#8208;conjugates accumulated effectively in the micellar compartments as a prerequisite for compound synthesis. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Weberskirch, A. Brunschweiger, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100980).

         <title>Stabilization of Bicontinuous Cubic Phase and Its Two&#8208;Sided Nature Produced by Use of Siloxane Tails and Introduction of Molecular Nonsymmetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;two&#8208;sided nature&#8221; of the Ia3d gyroid&#8208;type bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline (Cubbi LC) phase of a nonsymmetric core molecule is depicted in the cover image. Two core assembly modes specific to each symmetric molecule with larger naphthalene or smaller benzene cores appear to form the three&#8208;dimensional helical network, depending on temperature and thermal cycle. The finding reveals that the core symmetry can control the core packing and stability of the network structure. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Kutsumizu et&#8197;al.

         <title>A Fluorescence Sensor Array Based on Zinc(II)&#8208;carboxyamidoquinolines: Toward Quantitative Detection of ATP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The newly prepared fluorescent carboxyamidoquinolines (  1  &#8211;  3  ) and their Zn(II) complexes (  Zn@1  &#8211;  Zn@3  ) were used to bind and sense various phosphate anions utilizing a relay mechanism, in which the Zn(II) ion migrates from the  Zn@1  &#8211;  Zn@3  complexes to the phosphate, namely adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) and pyrophosphate (PPi), a process accompanied by a dramatic change in fluorescence.  Zn@1  &#8211;  Zn@3  assemblies bind adenine nucleotide phosphates while displaying an analyte&#8208;specific response. This process was investigated using UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy. It is shown that the different binding selectivity and the corresponding fluorescence response enables differentiation of adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;diphosphate (ADP), pyrophosphate (PPi) and phosphate (Pi). The cross&#8208;reactive nature of the carboxyamidoquinolines&#8208;Zn(II) sensors in conjunction with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was utilized in a simple fluorescence chemosensor array that allows for the identification of ATP, ADP, PPi, and Pi from 8 other anions including adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP) with 100% correct classification. Furthermore, the support vector machine algorithm, a machine learning method, allowed for highly accurate quantitation of ATP in the range 5&#8208;100 &#181;M concentration in unknown samples with error &lt; 2.5%.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Modulation of Pt&#8208;group Metals and Electrocatalysis Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable development orientation of de&#8208;fossil resources has stimulated a blossoming interest in the design of advanced electrocatalysts for clean energy conversion. The anion modulated strategy for Pt&#8208;group metals (PGMs) by means of anion engineering possesses high flexibility to regulate the electronic structure, providing a promising prospect for constructing electrocatalysts with superior activity and stability to satisfy the future green electrochemical energy conversion system. Based on the previous work of our group and others, in this review, we summarize the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress on anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds (such as RuP2, IrP2, PtP2, RuB2, Ru2B3, RuS2, etc.) in energy&#8208;related electrocatalysis from activity origin and synthetic strategies to electrochemical applications including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), N2 reduction reaction (NRR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In the end, the key problems, countermeasures and future development orientations of anion&#8208;modulated PGM compounds toward electrocatalytic applications are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering the Hidden Landscape of Tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) Ligands: Topological Complexity Derived from the Bridgehead</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular main group chemistry is a developing field which parallels the conventional domain of metallo&#8208;organic chemistry. Little explored building blocks in this area are main group metal&#8208;based ligands which have the appropriate donor symmetry to build desired molecular or extended arrangements. Tris(pyridyl) main group ligands (E(py) 3 , E = main group metal) are potentially highly versatile building blocks since shifting the N&#8208;donor arms from the 2&#8208; to the 3&#8208;positions and 4&#8208;positions provides a very simple way of changing the ligand character from mononuclear/chelating to multidentate/metal&#8208;bridging. Here we explore the coordination behaviour of the first main group metal tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) ligands, E(4&#8208;py) 3 (E = Sb, Bi, Sn), and their ability to build metal organic frameworks (MOFs). The complicated topology of these MOFs shows a marked influence on the counter anion and on the ability of the E(4&#8208;py) 3 ligands to switch coordination mode, depending on the steric and donor character of the bridgehead. This structure&#8208;directing influence of the bridgehead provides a potential building strategy for future molecular and MOF design in this area.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategies of Si/C Composite Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon&#8208;based materials that have higher theoretical specific capacity than other conventional anodes, such as carbon materials, Li  2  TiO  3  materials and Sn&#8208;based materials, becomes a hot topic in research of lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB). However, the low conductivity and large volume expansion of silicon&#8208;based materials hinders the commercialization of silicon&#8208;based materials. Until recent years, these issues are alleviated by the combination of carbon based materials. In this review, the preparation of Si/C materials by different synthetic methods in the past decade is reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, the research progress of Si/C materials formed by silicon and different carbon based materials is researched, where the influences of carbons on the property modulation of silicon are emphasized.

However, the low conductivity and large volume expansion of silicon-based materials hinders the commercialization of silicon-based materials. Until recent years, these issues are alleviated by the combination of carbon based materials. In this review, the preparation of Si/C materials by different synthetic methods in the past decade is reviewed along with their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, the research progress of Si/C materials formed by silicon and different carbon based materials is researched, where the influences of carbons on the property modulation of silicon are emphasized. Lastly, future research direction in the material design and optimization of Si/C materials is proposed to fill the current gap in the development of efficient Si/C anode for LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A CeCoOx Core/Nb2O5@TiO2 Double&#8208;Shell Nanocage Catalyst Demonstrates High Activity and Water Resistance for Catalytic Combustion of o&#8208;Dichlorobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Putting another coat on: CeCoOx catalysts with different core&#8208;shell compositions and structures have been prepared for o&#8208;DCB catalytic combustion. Coating the catalysts with Nb2O5 could greatly improve their activity. Moreover, TiO2 protected the Ce from inactivation by Cl deposition. This gave them good thermal and hydrothermal stabilities in addition to their catalytic activity.







Abstract
A series of catalysts with different core&#8208;shell structures has been successfully prepared by a hydrothermal method. They consisted of CeCoOx@TiO2 (single shell), CeCoOx@Nb2O5 (single shell) and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 (double shell) core&#8208;shell nanocages and CeCoOx nanocages, in which CeCoOx was the core and TiO2 and Nb2O5 were shells. The influence of the core&#8208;shell structure on the catalytic performance of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene was investigated by activity, water&#8208;resistance, and thermal stability tests as well as catalyst characterization. The temperatures corresponding to 90&#8201;% conversion of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene (T90) of CeCoOx, CeCoOx@TiO2, CeCoOx@Nb2O5, and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts were 415, 383, 362 and 367&#8201;&#176;C, respectively. CeCoOx@Nb2O5 exhibited excellent catalytic activity, mainly owing to the special core&#8208;shell structure, large specific surface area, abundant activity of Co3+, Ce3+, Nb5+, strong reducibility, and more active oxygen vacancies. It can be seen that the Nb2O5 coating can greatly improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst. In addition, due to the protective effect of the TiO2 shell on CeCoOx, CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts exhibited outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability for 20&#8197;hours. The T90 of CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 was slightly lower than that of CeCoOx@Nb2O5, but it had higher stability and hydrothermal stability. Furthermore, possible reaction pathways involving the Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen (MvK) and Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood (L&#8722;H) models were deduced based on studies of the temperature&#8208;programmed desorption of O2 (O2&#8208;TPD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and in&#8197;situ diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy (DRIFTS) characterization.

         <title>Highly Active Halogen Bonding and Chalcogen Bonding Chloride Transporters with Non&#8208;Protonophoric Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving highly selective chloride over proton or hydroxide transport is crucial for the development of supramolecular anionophores for medical applications, where competing dissipation of pH gradients is undesired. Halogen and chalcogen bonding anionophores with record nanomolar activity are reported, and high selectivity for chloride over hydroxide is demonstrated to be achievable using these sigma&#8208;hole interactions.







Abstract
Synthetic anion transporters show much promise as potential anti&#8208;cancer agents and therapeutics for diseases associated with mis&#8208;regulation of protein anion channels. In such applications high activity and anion selectivity are crucial to overcome competing proton or hydroxide transport which dissipates cellular pH gradients. Here, highly active bidentate halogen bonding and chalcogen bonding anion carriers based on electron deficient iodo&#8208; and telluromethyl&#8722;triazole derivatives are reported. Anion transport experiments in lipid bilayer vesicles reveal record nanomolar chloride transport activity for the bidentate halogen bonding anion carrier, and remarkably high chloride over proton/hydroxide selectivity for the chalcogen bonding anionophore. Computational studies provide further insight into the role of sigma&#8208;hole mediated anion recognition and desolvation at the membrane interface. Comparison with hydrogen bonding analogues demonstrates the importance of employing sigma&#8208;hole donor motifs in synthetic anionophores for achieving both high transport activity and selectivity.

         <title>N&#8208;Enriched Porous Carbon/SiO2 Composites Derived from Biomass Rice Husks for Boosting Li&#8208;Ion Storage: Insight into the Effect of N&#8208;Doping</title>

         <dc:description>
Biomass to battery: By using facile ball milling, N&#8208;enriched porous carbon/silica composites have been prepared from biomass rice husks as a high&#8208;performance anode material for lithium ion batteries. A uniform distribution between silica nanoparticles and carbon matrix, and a high level of N&#8208;incorporation are simultaneously achieved. The Li&#8208;storage mechanism of active silica in composites is available to improve the discharging capacity, and the increased capacitive behavior of electrode material provides fast electrochemical dynamics.







Abstract
A N&#8208;enriched porous carbon/SiO2 (SiO2/NC) composite from rice husks was prepared by ball milling and tested as a stable anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), in which the homogeneous dispersion of SiO2 nanoparticles and carbon matrix, and high level of N&#8208;doping can be realized simultaneously. The influence of N&#8208;doping on a series of SiO2/NCs was systematically studied; this proved that the porosity, N&#8208;doping content, and electronic conductivity of SiO2/NC can be controlled by adjusting common nitrogen sources (urea and melamine) and doping routes, including dry and wet milling, to reach a desirable balance of high capacity, long&#8208;term cyclability, and rate property. The optimized SiO2/NC composite delivers a stably reversible capacity of 581&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the high current load of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the 1000th cycle. The novel Li&#8208;storage mechanism of active silica in a composite was first proposed after observation of the N&#8208;doping effect that the redox reaction between SiO2 and Li+ is accelerated to transform into an alloying reaction of generated Si and Li+, thus enhancing the reversible capacity. Moreover, kinetics analysis confirms that there is a combined Li&#8208;storage mechanism of battery&#8208;capacitive pattern in composite that contributes to fast charge transfer and ion diffusion during cycle.

         <title>Building an Iron Chromophore Incorporating Prussian Blue Analogue for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the quest for low&#8208;cost and scalable dye&#8208;sensitized water splitting cells, the implementation of iron chromophores to the catalytic component has been one of the main challenges. Herein, an extendable chemistry toolbox based on Prussian blue structures is adopted not only to offer an excited state lifetime exceeding 1 ns but also to demonstrate the 1st iron&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical water oxidation device. The cover image was designed by Kubra Nur Ozvural. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E.&#8197;Ozbay, F.&#8197;Karadas et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100654).

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuteration of Aromatic Carbonyl Compounds with a Catalytic Transient Directing Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Everything is transient: The combination of a ruthenium catalyst with amines enables the C&#8722;H activation and deuteration of aromatic carbonyl compounds in a general manner. Using D2O as a convenient source of deuterium, high deuteration levels were achieved and the application of this methodology for the preparation of deuterated pharmaceuticals was demonstrated.







Abstract
A novel ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation methodology for hydrogen isotope exchange of aromatic carbonyl compounds is presented. In the presence of catalytic amounts of specific amine additives, a transient directing group is formed in&#8197;situ, which directs selective deuteration. A high degree of deuteration is achieved for &#945;&#8208;carbonyl and aromatic ortho&#8208;positions. In addition, appropriate choice of conditions allows for exclusive labeling of the &#945;&#8208;carbonyl position while a procedure for the preparation of merely ortho&#8208;deuterated compounds is also reported. This methodology proceeds with good functional group tolerance and can be also applied for deuteration of pharmaceutical drugs. Mechanistic studies reveal a kinetic isotope effect of 2.2, showing that the C&#8722;H activation is likely the rate&#8208;determining step of the catalytic cycle. Using deuterium oxide as a cheap and convenient source of deuterium, the methodology presents a cost&#8208;efficient alternative to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art iridium&#8208;catalyzed procedures.

Any colour will do: The synthesised high&#8208;surface&#8208;area, enriched, heterogeneous heptazine&#8208;based microporous polymeric network HMP&#8208;TAPA shows remarkable dual photo(catalytic) behaviour for efficient organic transformation reactions, that is, coupling reactions of benzylamine under visible light radiation and base&#8208;catalysed Knoevenagel condensation at room temperature. The engineered electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor moieties in the polymeric network allow the absorption of a broad range of visible light.







Abstract
A heptazine&#8208;based microporous polymeric network, HMP&#8208;TAPA was synthesised by direct coupling of trichloroheptazine and tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine (TAPA). A high surface area of 424&#8197;m2/g was achieved, which is the highest surface area among heptazine&#8208;based polymeric networks (HMPs). The tailored electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor units in HMP&#8208;TAPA give broad visible&#8208;light absorption. HMP&#8208;TAPA was employed as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for oxidative coupling of amines to imines under visible light irradiation with 98&#8201;% selectivity. Furthermore, the surface basicity of HMP&#8208;TAPA was used to achieve metal&#8208;free heterogeneous base catalysis for Knoevenagel condensation under base&#8208;free conditions with &gt;99&#8201;% conversion. In addition, HMP&#8208;TAPA showed extreme robustness over a wide pH range (1&#8211;14). The versatility and flexibility of the current material design is beneficial for understanding its photoactivity and surface basicity so as to design dual active (photo)catalyst materials for specific applications.

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Meta&#8208;Halophenols by Anion&#8208;Accelerated 2&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclic Ring Opening</title>

Opening the way to densely functionalized natural products: We report the first anion&#8208;accelerated, thermally allowed, 2&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring opening as a novel route to substituted phenols 6&#8201;a&#8211;r and prove its efficacy in the total synthesis of the densely functionalized phenolic natural product caramboxin (isolated as the lactam dehydrate).







Abstract
Disrotatory &#8211; thermally allowed &#8211; 2&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reactions require high temperatures to proceed. Herein, we report the first anion&#8208;accelerated 2&#960;&#8208;electrocyclic ring opening of 6,6&#8208;dihalobicyclo[3.1.0]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones at low temperature to give the corresponding meta&#8208;halophenols in good to high yields (18 examples, 29&#8211;92&#8201;% yield, average: 65&#8201;%). Many of the phenols have unconventional substitution patterns and are reported here for the first time. Furthermore, the strength of the methodology was shown by the total synthesis of the densely functionalized phenolic natural product caramboxin (isolated as the lactam dehydrate). The reaction mechanism underlying the anion&#8208;acceleration was investigated in an ab initio study, which concluded that base&#8208;mediated proton abstraction anti to the concurrently departing endo&#8208;bromine was the initiating step in an overall concerted reaction mechanism leading directly to the meta&#8208;halophenol.

Herein, we report the first anion-accelerated 2&#960;-electrocyclic ring opening of 6,6-dihalobicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-ones at low temperature to give the corresponding &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-halophenols in good to high yields (18 examples, 29&#8211;92&#8201;% yield, average: 65&#8201;%). Many of the phenols have unconventional substitution patterns and are reported here for the first time. Furthermore, the strength of the methodology was shown by the total synthesis of the densely functionalized phenolic natural product caramboxin (isolated as the lactam dehydrate). The reaction mechanism underlying the anion-acceleration was investigated in an ab initio study, which concluded that base-mediated proton abstraction &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt; to the concurrently departing &lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-bromine was the initiating step in an overall concerted reaction mechanism leading directly to the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-halophenol.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Phosphetes via Transition Metal Free Ring Closure &#8211; Taking the Proper Turn at a Thermodynamic Crossing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenge of &#8220;guiding&#8221; the molecular reactants in the reaction flask on the proper reaction path through the mountainous potential energy surface leading either to phosphetes or phospholes via phosphaallylic intermediates, which themselves may be trapped upon protonation, is depicted in the cover image. The design was composed by Zsolt Kelemen with contributions by Rudolf Pietschnig at the Universities of Budapest and Kassel. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z. Kelemen, R. Pietschnig, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101298).

         <title>Dipyrrolyldiketone PtII Complexes: Ion&#8208;Pairing &#960;&#8208;Electronic Systems with Various Anion&#8208;Binding Modes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of dipyrrolyldiketone PtII complexes, as phosphorescence anion&#8208;responsive &#960;&#8208;electronic molecules, was motivated by the chemistry of previously investigated boron complexes. The PtII complexes displayed solid&#8208;state ion&#8208;pairing assemblies, exhibiting various anion&#8208;binding modes, derived from pyrrole&#8208;inverted and pyrrole&#8208;non&#8208;inverted conformations, and packing structures, with the contribution of charge&#8208;by&#8208;charge assemblies.

Lesser is better: Multilayered heterostructures comprising of In2O3, SnO2, and one or two atomic layers of Al2O3 were studied for their application in thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT). The cover image centers around the fabrication of a multilayer thin film oxide aggregate which works as semiconductor in a transistor device. It is composed of different layers of SnO2, In2O3 and Al2O3 fabricated using atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique which employs the reaction of suitable organometallic precursors with water, all of which originate from the gas phase from an individual molecular source (left upper side). The rainbow reflects the stability of the material against illumination. The background depicts the universal binary 0/1 code representing the every&#8208;day use of transistors in our modern society. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;J. Schneider et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101126).

New superheroes in town: Fluorescent Indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines fight against T. gondii. Indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines are a novel type of multifunctional heterocycle. They are tunable luminophores and highly biologically active. Furthermore, their photophysical characteristics correlate with Hammett &#963;p+ substituent parameters allowing finetuning of excited state properties such as emission maxima, Stokes shifts, and fluorescence quantum yields, by the remote para&#8208;aryl substitution. Best of all, they are highly active at low concentration against medically relevant pathogens such as the Apicomplexa parasite Toxoplasma gondii with IC50 up to 0.67&#177;0.13&#956;M. Therefore, these heterocyclic superheroes are promising bug fighters in novel anti&#8208;parasitic therapies. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T.&#8197;J.&#8197;J. M&#252;ller et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101391).

         <title>Quadruple Role of Pd Catalyst in Domino Reaction Involving Aryl to Alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd Migration to Access 1,9&#8208;Bridged Triptycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 1,8,13&#8208;tribromo&#8208;9&#8208;methoxytriptycenes is reported. Under conventional Suzuki coupling conditions, the triptycenes underwent multiple transformations to give 1,9&#8208;bridged triptycenes. Based on mechanistic investigations, a single Pd catalyst functions as Pd  0  , Pd  II  and Pd  IV  species to catalyze four distinct processes: (1) aryl to alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd migration, (2) intramolecular arylation, (3) homocoupling of phenylboronic acid and (4) Suzuki coupling. DFT calculations revealed that 1,5&#8208;Pd migration likely proceeds via both concerted Pd  II  and stepwise Pd  IV  routes. Asymmetric synthesis of the chiral triptycenes, as well as optical resolution, and further transformation are also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Cationic Polypeptide Supramolecular Nanogels for Intracellular DNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular nanogels are an emerging class of polymer nanocarriers for intracellular delivery, owing to their straightforward preparation, biocompatibility, and capability to spontaneously encapsulate biologically active components such as DNA. A completely biodegradable three component cationic supramolecular nanogel was designed exploiting the multivalent host&#8208;guest interaction of cyclodextrin and adamantane attached to a polypeptide backbone. While cyclodextrin was conjugated to linear poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, adamantane was grafted to linear as well as star shaped poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine. Size control of nanogels was obtained with the increase in the length of the host and guest polymer. Moreover, smaller nanogels were obtained using the star shaped polymers because of the compact nature of star polymers compared to linear ones. Nanogels were loaded with anionic model cargoes, pyranine and carboxyfluorescein, and their enzyme responsive release was studied using protease trypsin. Confocal microscopy revealed successful transfection of mammalian HeLa cells and intracellular release of pyranine and plasmid DNA, as quantified using a luciferase assay, showing that supramolecular polypeptide nanogels have significant potential in gene therapy applications.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular nanogels are an emerging class of polymer nanocarriers for intracellular delivery, owing to their straightforward preparation, biocompatibility, and capability to spontaneously encapsulate biologically active components such as DNA. A completely biodegradable three component cationic supramolecular nanogel was designed exploiting the multivalent host-guest interaction of cyclodextrin and adamantane attached to a polypeptide backbone. While cyclodextrin was conjugated to linear poly-L-lysine, adamantane was grafted to linear as well as star shaped poly-L-lysine. Size control of nanogels was obtained with the increase in the length of the host and guest polymer. Moreover, smaller nanogels were obtained using the star shaped polymers because of the compact nature of star polymers compared to linear ones. Nanogels were loaded with anionic model cargoes, pyranine and carboxyfluorescein, and their enzyme responsive release was studied using protease trypsin. Confocal microscopy revealed successful transfection of mammalian HeLa cells and intracellular release of pyranine and plasmid DNA, as quantified using a luciferase assay, showing that supramolecular polypeptide nanogels have significant potential in gene therapy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A diversity of coordination patterns is observed in the solid state for both homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes, with coordination numbers ranging between 2 and 4. The identity of the bridging ligand in heteroleptic dimers [Ba(&#956;2&#8208;X1)(X2)] depends largely on the given pair of ligands X1  and X2  .

         <title>Pathways of the Extremely Reactive Iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complexes with Tetradentate Bispidine Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>The nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex  trans&#8208;  N3&#8208;[(L  1  )Fe  IV  =O(Cl)]  +  , where L  1  is a derivative of the tetradentate bispidine 2,4&#8208;di(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane&#8208;1&#8208;one, is known to have an  S  = 1 electronic ground state and to be an extremely reactive oxidant for oxygen atom transfer (OAT) and hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) processes. Here we show that, in spite of this ferryl oxidant having the &#8220;wrong&#8221; spin ground state, it is the most reactive nonheme iron model system known so far and of a similar order of reactivity as nonheme iron enzymes (C&#8208;H abstraction of cyclohexane, &#8208; 90 &#176;C (propionitrile),  t  1/2  = 3.5 sec). Discussed are spectroscopic and kinetic data, supported by a DFT&#8208;based theoretical analysis, which indicate that substrate oxidation is significantly faster than self&#8208;decay processes due to an intramolecular demethylation pathway and formation of an oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) intermediate. It is also shown that the iron(III)&#8208;hydroxido / cyclohexyl radical intermediate, resulting from C&#8208;H abstraction, selectively produces chlorocyclohexane in a rebound process. However, the life&#8208;time of the intermediate is so long that other reaction channels (known as cage escape) become important, and much of the C&#8208;H abstraction therefore is unproductive. In bulk reactions at ambient temperature and at longer time scales, there is formation of significant amounts of oxidation product &#8211; specifically of chlorocyclohexane, and it is shown that this originates from oxidation of the oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state.</dc:description>

         <title>Radiochromic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) were explored as radiochromic materials responsive to X&#8208;ray irradiation, opening a new avenue for their application. The HOFs reported here have the same building block yet different radiochromic behaviors: one is sensitive to both X&#8208;ray and UV light, while the other one is specifically responsive to X&#8208;ray light. These phenomena provide a precious chance to understand the vital factors that account for the detection specificity of radiochromic materials.







Abstract
Porous materials have been investigated as efficient photochromic platforms for detecting hazardous radiation, while the utilization of hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) in this field has remained intact. Herein, two HOFs were synthesized through self&#8208;assembly of tetratopic viologen ligand and formic acid (PFC&#8208;25, PFC&#8208;26), as a new class of &#8220;all&#8208;organic&#8221; radiochromic smart material, opening a gate for HOFs in this field. PFC&#8208;26 is active upon both X&#8208;ray and UV irradiation, while PFC&#8208;25 is only active upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. The same building block yet different radiochromic behaviors of PFC&#8208;25 and PFC&#8208;26 allow us to gain a deep mechanistic understanding of the factors that control the detection specificity. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of viologen ligand is highly related to the threshold energy of triggering a charge transfer, therefore being a vital factor for the particularity of radiochromic materials. Thanks to its convenient processibility, nanoparticle size, and UV silence, PFC&#8208;25 can be further fabricated into a portable naked&#8208;eye sensor for X&#8208;ray detection, which shows obvious color change with the merits of high transmittance contrast, good sensitivity (reproducible dose threshold of 3.5&#8197;Gy), and excellent stability. The work exhibits the promising practical potentials of HOF materials in photochromic technology.

&lt;p&gt;Porous materials have been investigated as efficient photochromic platforms for detecting hazardous radiation, while the utilization of hydrogen bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) in this field has remained intact. Herein, two HOFs were synthesized through self-assembly of tetratopic viologen ligand and formic acid (PFC-25, PFC-26), as a new class of &#8220;all-organic&#8221; radiochromic smart material, opening a gate for HOFs in this field. PFC-26 is active upon both X-ray and UV irradiation, while PFC-25 is only active upon X-ray irradiation. The same building block yet different radiochromic behaviors of PFC-25 and PFC-26 allow us to gain a deep mechanistic understanding of the factors that control the detection specificity. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the degree of &#960;-conjugation of viologen ligand is highly related to the threshold energy of triggering a charge transfer, therefore being a vital factor for the particularity of radiochromic materials. Thanks to its convenient processibility, nanoparticle size, and UV silence, PFC-25 can be further fabricated into a portable naked-eye sensor for X-ray detection, which shows obvious color change with the merits of high transmittance contrast, good sensitivity (reproducible dose threshold of 3.5&#8197;Gy), and excellent stability.

         <title>Cell&#8208;penetrating Mitochondria&#8208;targeting Ligands for Universal Delivery of Small Molecules, Proteins and Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondria are key organelles that perform vital cellular functions such as cell survival and death. Targeted delivery of different types of cargos to mitochondria is a well&#8208;established strategy to study mitochondrial biology and diseases. Of various existing mitochondria&#8208;transporting vehicles, most of them suffered from poor cytosolic entry, low delivery efficiency, limited cargo types, and cumbersome preparation protocols, and none was known to be universally applicable for mitochondrial delivery of different types of cargos (small molecules, proteins and nanomaterials). Herein, we disclose two new cell&#8208;penetrating mitochondria&#8208;targeting ligands (named MitoLigand), as well as their corresponding chemoselective conjugation chemistry, that are capable of effectively &#8220;tagging&#8221; small&#8208; molecule drugs, native proteins and nanomaterials. Upon successful cellular delivery and rapid endosome escape, the released native cargos were found to be predominantly localized inside mitochondria. Finally, by successfully delivering doxorubicin, a well&#8208;known anticancer drug, to the mitochondria of HeLa cells, we showed the released drug possessed potent cell cytotoxicity, caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and finally led to cell apoptosis. Our strategy thus paves the way for future mitochondria&#8208;targeted therapy with a variety of biologically active agents.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine substituents in transition metal catalysts are of significantly great importance in olefin polymerization catalysis; however, the comprehensive effect of fluorine substituents is elusive in seminal late transition metal a&#8208;diimine catalytic system. In this contribution, fluorine substituents at various positions (  ortho  &#8208;,  meta  &#8208;, and  para  &#8208;F) and with different numbers (F  n  ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5) were installed into the well&#8208;defined  N  &#8208;terphenyl amine and thus were studied for the first time in the nickel &#945;&#8208;diimine promoted ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar monomers. The position of the fluorine substituent was particularly crucial in these polymerization reactions in terms of catalytic activity, polymer molecular weight, branching density, and incorporation of polar monomer, and thus a picture on the fluorine effect was given. As a notable result, the  ortho  &#8208;F substituted &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalyst produced highly linear polyethylenes with an extremely high molecular weight (  M  w  = 8,703 kDa) and a significantly low degree of branching of 1.4/1000 C; however, the  meta  &#8208;F and/or  para  &#8208;F substituted &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts generated highly branched (up to 80.2/1000 C) polyethylenes with significantly low molecular weights (  M  w  = 20&#8208;50 kDa).</dc:description>

         <title>RNA Ligation for Mono and Dually Labeled RNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Labeled RNAs are invaluable probes for investigation of RNA function and localization. However, mRNA labeling remains challenging. Here, we developed an improved method for 3&#8242;&#8208;end labeling of in vitro transcribed RNAs. We synthesized novel adenosine 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;bisphosphate analogs modified at the N6 or C2 position of adenosine with an azide&#8208;containing linker, fluorescent label, or biotin and assessed these constructs as substrates for RNA labeling directly by T4 ligase or via postenzymatic strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). All analogs were substrates for T4 RNA ligase. Analogs containing bulky fluorescent labels or biotin showed better overall labeling yields than postenzymatic SPAAC. We successfully labeled uncapped RNAs, NAD&#8208;capped RNAs, and 5&#8242;&#8208;fluorescently labeled m 7 Gp 3 A m &#8208;capped mRNAs. The obtained highly homogenous dually labeled mRNA was translationally active and enabled fluorescence&#8208;based monitoring of decapping. This method will facilitate the use of various functionalized mRNA&#8208;based probes.</dc:description>

         <title>PtM/MxBy (M=Ni, Co, Fe) Heterostructured Nanobundles as Advanced Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optimizing the electronic and synergistic effect of hybrid electrocatalysts based on Pt and Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts is of tremendous importance towards a superior  hydrogen evolution  performance under both acidic and alkaline conditions. However, developing an ideal Pt&#8208;based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst with moderated electronic structure as well as strong synergistic effect is still a challenge. Herein, we fabricated boron (B)&#8208;doped PtNi nanobundles by a two&#8208;step method using NaBH  4  as the boron resource to obtain PtNi/Ni  4  B  3  heterostructures with well&#8208;defined nanointerfaces between PtNi and Ni  4  B  3  , achieving an enhanced catalytic HER performance. Specially, the PtNi/Ni  4  B  3  nanobundles (PtNi/Ni  4  B  3  NBs) can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  at the overpotential of 14.6 and 26.5 mV under alkaline and acidic media, respectively, as well as outstanding electrochemical stability over 40 h at the current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  . Remarkably, this approach is also universal for the syntheses of PtCo/Co  3  B and PtFe/Fe  49  B with outstanding electroatalytic HER performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Pore Size and Defects on the Selective Adsorption of Acetylene in Alkyne&#8208;Functionalized Nickel(II)&#8208;Pyrazolate&#8208;Based MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation is a highly challenging process as a consequence of their similar physicochemical properties. In this work we have explored, by static and dynamic gas sorption techniques and computational modelling, the suitability of a series of two isoreticular robust Ni(II)pyrazolate&#8208;based MOFs, bearing alkyne moieties on the ligand backbones, for C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation. The results are consistent with high adsorption capacity and selectivity of the essayed systems towards C  2  H  2  molecules. Furthermore, a post&#8208;synthetic treatment with KOH ethanolic solution give rise to linker vacancy defects and incorporation of extraframework potassium ions. Creation of defects is responsible for increased adsorption capacity for both gases, however, strong interactions of the cluster basic sites and extraframework potassium cations with CO  2  molecules are responsible for a lowering of C  2  H  2  over CO  2  selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Taming the Antiferromagnetic Beast: Computational Design of Ultrashort Mn&#8211;Mn Bonds Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of complexes featuring low&#8208;valent, multiply bonded metal centers is an exciting field with several potential applications. In this work, we describe the design principles and perform an extensive computational investigation of new organometallic platforms featuring the elusive manganese  &#8211;  manganese bond stabilized by experimentally&#8208;realized&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). By using DFT computations benchmarked against multireference calculations, as well as MO&#8208; and VB&#8208;based bonding analyses, we could disentangle the various electronic and structural effects contributing to the thermodynamic and kinetic stability, as well as the experimental feasibility, of the systems. Particularly, we explore the nature of the metal  &#8211;  carbene interaction and the role of the ancillary&#160;&#951;&#8310; coordination to the generation of Mn&#8322; systems featuring ultrashort metal  &#8211;  metal bonds, closed&#8208;shell singlet multiplicities, and positive adiabatic singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Our analysis identifies two distinct classes of viable synthetic targets, whose electrostructural properties are thoroughly investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Subphthalocyaninato Boron (III) Hydride: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Subphthalocyanines (SubPcs) chemistry has been limited so far by their high sensitivity toward strong nucleophiles. In particular, the substitution of the axial chlorine atom by a nucleophilic group in the case of less reactive SubPcs, such as those bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing peripheral substituents, presents some limitations and requires harsh conditions. Taking advantage of the electrophilic character of DIBAL&#8208;H, we have been able to prepare for the first time SubPc&#8208;hydride derivatives, which exhibit high reactivity as hydroboration reagents of aldehydes. This hydride transfer reaction requires using a typical carbonyl activator (trimethylsilyl triflate) and only one equivalent of aldehyde, yielding SubPcs with an axial benzyloxy group in good yield. This transformation has proven to be a useful alternative method for the axial functionalization of dodecafluoroSubPc, a paradigmatic SubPc derivative, using electrophiles for the first time. Considering the increasing interest of SubPcs as electron&#8208;acceptor semiconductors with remarkable absorption in the visible range to replace fullerene in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, it is of outmost importance to develop new synthetic methodologies for their axial functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Early Oxidative Transformations During the Biosynthesis of Terrein and Related Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mycotoxin terrein is derived from the C  10  &#8208;precursor 6&#8208;hydroxymellein (6&#8208;HM)  via  an oxidative ring contraction. Although the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) has been identified, details of the enzymatic oxidative transformations are lacking. Combining heterologous expression and  in vitro  studies we show that the flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenase (FMO) TerC catalyzes the initial oxidative decarboxylation of 6&#8208;HM. The reactive intermediate is further hydroxylated by the second FMO TerD to yield a highly oxygenated aromatic species, but further reconstitution of the pathway was hampered. A related BGC was identified in the marine&#8208;derived  Roussoella sp  . DLM33 and confirmed by heterologous expression. Our studies demonstrate that the biosynthetic pathways of terrein and related (polychlorinated) congeners diverge after oxidative decarboxylation of the lactone precursor that is catalyzed by a conserved FMO and further indicate that early dehydration of the side chain is an essential step.</dc:description>

         <title>Macrocyclic Complexes Derived from Four cis&#8208;L2Pt Corners and Four Butadiynediyl Linkers; Syntheses, Electronic Structures, and Square versus Skew Rhombus Geometries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes with cyclic Pt4C16 cores comprised of platinum(II) corners and butadiynediyl edges were synthesized, and their geometric and electronic structures as well as spectroscopic and redox properties closely examined.







Abstract
The dialkyl malonate derived 1,3&#8208;diphosphines R2C(CH2PPh2)2 (R=a, Me; b, Et; c, n&#8208;Bu; d, n&#8208;Dec; e, Bn; f, p&#8208;tolCH2) are combined with (p&#8208;tol3P)2PtCl2 or trans&#8208;(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt((C&#8801;C)2H)2 to give the chelates cis&#8208;(R2C(CH2PPh2)2)PtCl2 (2&#8201;a&#8211;f, 94&#8211;69&#8201;%) or cis&#8208;(R2C(CH2PPh2)2)Pt((C&#8801;C)2H)2 (3&#8201;a&#8211;f, 97&#8211;54&#8201;%). Complexes 3&#8201;a&#8211;d are also available from 2&#8201;a&#8211;d and excess 1,3&#8208;butadiyne in the presence of CuI (cat.) and excess HNEt2 (87&#8211;65&#8201;%). Under similar conditions, 2 and 3 react to give the title compounds [(R2C(CH2PPh2)2)[Pt(C&#8801;C)2]4 (4&#8201;a&#8211;f; 89&#8211;14&#8201;% (64&#8201;% avg)), from which ammonium salts such as the co&#8208;product [H2NEt2]+ Cl&#8722; are challenging to remove. Crystal structures of 4&#8201;a,b show skew rhombus as opposed to square Pt4 geometries. The NMR and IR properties of 4&#8201;a&#8211;f are similar to those of mono&#8208; or diplatinum model compounds. However, cyclic voltammetry gives only irreversible oxidations. As compared to mono&#8208;platinum or Pt(C&#8801;C)2Pt species, the UV&#8208;visible spectra show much more intense and red&#8208;shifted bands. Time dependent DFT calculations define the transitions and principal orbitals involved. Electrostatic potential surface maps reveal strongly negative Pt4C16 cores that likely facilitate ammonium cation binding. Analogous electronic properties of Pt3C12 and Pt5C20 homologs and selected equilibria are explored computationally.

Complexes &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt; are also available from &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt; and excess 1,3-butadiyne in the presence of CuI (cat.) and excess HNEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (87&#8211;65&#8201;%). Under similar conditions, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; react to give the title compounds [(R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)[Pt(C&#8801;C)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt;; 89&#8211;14&#8201;% (64&#8201;% avg)), from which ammonium salts such as the co-product [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; are challenging to remove. Crystal structures of &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; show skew rhombus as opposed to square Pt&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; geometries. The NMR and IR properties of &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt; are similar to those of mono- or diplatinum model compounds. However, cyclic voltammetry gives only irreversible oxidations. As compared to mono-platinum or Pt(C&#8801;C)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pt species, the UV-visible spectra show much more intense and red-shifted bands. Time dependent DFT calculations define the transitions and principal orbitals involved. Electrostatic potential surface maps reveal strongly negative Pt&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; cores that likely facilitate ammonium cation binding. Analogous electronic properties of Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and Pt&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; homologs and selected equilibria are explored computationally.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stabilization of Bicontinuous Cubic Phase and Its Two&#8208;Sided Nature Produced by Use of Siloxane Tails and Introduction of Molecular Nonsymmetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline (Cubbi LC) phase of Ia3d gyroid&#8208;type given by a nonsymmetric core molecule exhibits a two&#8208;sided nature by showing two core assembly modes specific to symmetric molecules with large cores or small cores, depending on temperature and thermal cycle. As another effect of the core nonsymmetry, the cubic phase is maintained at room temperature for more than 100&#8197;days with slight distortion.







Abstract
A recent intriguing finding that a helical network arrangement forms the bicontinuous cubic phase is attracting great attention for the possibility of new routes to asymmetric synthesis by achiral molecules. However, the design of the molecular structure for the cubic phase is still unrevealed. In this work, a nonsymmetric core molecule with larger naphthalene and smaller benzene moieties at each side of the central linkage and the same disiloxanyldecyloxy terminal at both terminals is shown to be the first example of molecule forming both single&#8208;layered and double&#8208;layered core assembly modes in the Ia3d phase as a single molecule system. The molecule forms the former mode at high temperatures as a thermodynamically stable phase, similarly to the symmetric naphthalene core system, whereas, on cooling below a temperature (&#8764;350&#8197;K), a metastable Ia3d phase forms a double&#8208;layered core state down to room temperature, which is common to the benzene core system. As another effect of the nonsymmetric core, the cubic phase is maintained at room temperature for more than 100&#8197;days with slight distortion. Infrared spectral studies and quantum chemical calculations suggested the easy transformation between the two core assembly modes. The core nonsymmetry can be a versatile fine&#8208;tuning of the core assembly mode and phase stability for the cubic phase molecules.

         <dc:description>
&#8220;All current dye&#8208;sensitized water oxidation electrodes rely on molecular ruthenium components, which suffer from high cost and low stability. Iron is the ideal candidate to replace ruthenium since they are in the same group. Herein, we show the first example of an iron&#8208;sensitized water oxidation photoanode by incorporating an iron chromophore into a Prussian blue network. This study indicates that the excited state lifetime of an iron chromophore could be extended by connecting it to a donor metal site in close proximity (Cover design: Kubra N. Ozvural).&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100654).

         <title>Comprehensive Characterization of the Self&#8208;Folding Cavitand Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex dynamic behavior of a self&#8208;folding cavitand receptor has been thoroughly characterized employing molecular dynamics simulations and 1H EXSY experiments. The exchange barriers extracted from accelerated molecular dynamics simulations are in very good agreement with experimentally determined values. Overall, the presented approach emerges as a useful tool for the rational design of dynamic host&#8208;guest systems.







Abstract
The conformational equilibria and guest exchange process of a resorcin[4]arene derived self&#8208;folding cavitand receptor have been characterized in detail by molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and 1H EXSY NMR experiments. A multi&#8208;timescale strategy for exploring the fluxional behaviour of this system has been constructed, exploiting conventional MD and accelerated MD (aMD) techniques. The use of aMD allows the reconstruction of the folding/unfolding process of the receptor by sampling high&#8208;energy barrier processes unattainable by conventional MD simulations. We obtained MD trajectories sampling events occurring at different timescales from ns to s: 1) rearrangement of the directional hydrogen bond seam stabilizing the receptor, 2) folding/unfolding of the structure transiting partially open intermediates, and 3) guest departure from different folding stages. Most remarkably, reweighing of the biased aMD simulations provided kinetic barriers that are in very good agreement with those determined experimentally by 1H NMR. These results constitute the first comprehensive characterization of the complex dynamic features of cavitand receptors. Our approach emerges as a valuable rational design tool for synthetic host&#8208;guest systems

         <title>Hierarchical Architectures Based on Ru Nanoparticles/Oxygen&#8208;Rich&#8208;Carbon Nanotubes for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen at high or low pH: Hierarchical oxygen&#8208;rich carbon nanotube architectures strongly trap Ru nanoparticles, and a Ru&#8722;O&#8722;C bond is formed from the strong interaction at Ru/OCNT interfaces. The obtained catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and stability for the HER in both alkaline and acid electrolytes, and the high activity of the catalyst is further confirmed by density functional theory.







Abstract
Highly active and durable electrocatalysts are essential for producing hydrogen fuel through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a uniform deposition of Ru nanoparticles strongly interacting with oxygen&#8208;rich carbon nanotube architectures (Ru&#8208;OCNT) through ozonation and hydrothermal approaches has been designed. The hierarchical structure of Ru&#8208;OCNT is made by self&#8208;assembly of oxygen functionalities of OCNT. Ru nanoparticles interact strongly with OCNT at the Ru/OCNT interface to give excellent catalytic activity and stability of the Ru&#8208;OCNT, as further confirmed by density functional theory. Owing to the hierarchical structure and adjusted surface chemistry, Ru&#8208;OCNT has an overpotential of 34&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Tafel slope of 27.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M KOH, and an overpotential of 55&#8197;mV with Tafel slope of 33&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4. The smaller Tafel slope of Ru&#8208;OCNT than Ru&#8208;CNT and commercial Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes indicates high catalytic activity and fast charge transfer kinetics. The as&#8208;proposed chemistry provides the rational design of hierarchically structured CNT/nanoparticle electrocatalysts for HER to produce hydrogen fuel.

The obtained catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity and stability for the HER in both alkaline and acid electrolytes, and the high activity of the catalyst is further confirmed by density functional theory.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly active and durable electrocatalysts are essential for producing hydrogen fuel through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a uniform deposition of Ru nanoparticles strongly interacting with oxygen-rich carbon nanotube architectures (Ru-OCNT) through ozonation and hydrothermal approaches has been designed. The hierarchical structure of Ru-OCNT is made by self-assembly of oxygen functionalities of OCNT. Ru nanoparticles interact strongly with OCNT at the Ru/OCNT interface to give excellent catalytic activity and stability of the Ru-OCNT, as further confirmed by density functional theory. Owing to the hierarchical structure and adjusted surface chemistry, Ru-OCNT has an overpotential of 34&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a Tafel slope of 27.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 1&#8197;M KOH, and an overpotential of 55&#8197;mV with Tafel slope of 33&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 0.5&#8197;M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The smaller Tafel slope of Ru-OCNT than Ru-CNT and commercial Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes indicates high catalytic activity and fast charge transfer kinetics. The as-proposed chemistry provides the rational design of hierarchically structured CNT/nanoparticle electrocatalysts for HER to produce hydrogen fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Managing Experimental 3D Structures in the Beyond&#8208;Rule&#8208;of&#8208;5 Chemical Space: The Case of Rifampicin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bRo5 space includes large and flexible drug candidates which may assume different privileged conformations and exhibit chameleonic properties. We characterized the conformational ensembles of rifampicin in polar and nonpolar solvents and in the solid state. We performed NMR experiments, analyzed CSD structures and calculated a polarity descriptor. Results show that rifampicin is not a chameleon and its conformational behavior in solution and in the solid state is not superposable.







Abstract
The beyond&#8208;Rule&#8208;of&#8208;5 (bRo5) chemical space is a source of new oral drugs and includes large and flexible compounds. Because of their size and conformational variability, bRo5 molecules assume different privileged conformations in the compartments of human body, i.&#8201;e., they can exhibit chameleonic properties. The elucidation of the ensemble of 3D structures explored by such molecules under different conditions is therefore critical to check the role played by chameleonicity to modulate cell permeability. Here we characterized the conformational ensembles of rifampicin, a bRo5 drug, in polar and nonpolar solvents and in the solid state. We performed NMR experiments, analyzed their results with a novel algorithm and set&#8208;up a pool of ad hoc in silico strategies to investigate crystallographic structures retrieved from the CSD. Moreover, a polarity descriptor often related to permeability (SA&#8208;3D&#8208;PSA) was calculated for all the conformers and its variation with the environment analyzed. Results showed that the conformational behavior of rifampicin in solution and in the solid state is not superposable. The identification of dynamic intramolecular hydrogen bonds can be assessed by NMR spectroscopy but not by X&#8208;ray structures. Moreover, SA&#8208;3D&#8208;PSA revealed that dynamic IMHBs do not provide rifampicin with chameleonic properties. Overall, this study highlights that the peculiarity of rifampicin, which is cell permeable probably because of the presence of static IMHBs but is devoid of any chameleonic behavior, can be assessed by a proper analysis of experimental 3D structures.

Set&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;silver C: The base pair stability of anomeric (&#945;/&#946;&#8208;d) and enantiomeric (&#946;&#8208;l/&#946;&#8208;d) 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine mispair combinations in duplex DNA was studied in the absence and presence of silver ions. Stable duplexes with Ag+&#8208;mediated cytosine&#8211;cytosine pairs were formed by all anomeric and enantiomeric combinations. The Ag+&#8208;mediated base pair of anomeric &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;dC (&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine) with enantiomeric &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;dC (&#946;&#8208;l&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine) is superior to the well&#8208;noted &#946;&#8208;d/&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;dC pair in view of stability and Tm increase.







Abstract
Dodecamer duplex DNA containing anomeric (&#945;/&#946;&#8208;d) and enantiomeric (&#946;&#8208;l/&#946;&#8208;d) 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine mismatches was studied with respect to base pair stability in the absence and presence of silver ions. Stable duplexes with silver&#8208;mediated cytosine&#8211;cytosine pairs were formed by all anomeric and enantiomeric combinations. Stability changes were observed depending on the composition of the mismatches. Most strikingly, the new silver&#8208;mediated base pair of anomeric &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;dC with enantiomeric &#946;&#8208;l&#8208;dC is superior to the well&#8208;noted &#946;&#8208;d/&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;dC pair in terms of stability. CD spectra were used to follow global helical changes of DNA structure.

         <title>C=C Bond Oxidative Cleavage of BODIPY Photocages by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocages for protection and controlled release of bioactive compounds have been widely investigated. However, the vast majority of these photocages have employed the cleavage of single bonds and high&#8208;energy ultraviolet light. The construction of a photoactivation system that uses a visible light to cleave unsaturated bonds still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a regioselective oxidative cleavage of C=C bond from a boron&#8208;dipyrrolemethene (BODIPY) based photocage by the illumination at 630 nm, resulting in a free aldehyde and a thiol fluorescent probe. This strategy was demonstrated in living HeLa cells and the generated &#945;&#8208;formyl&#8208;BODIPY allowed the real&#8208;time monitoring aldehyde release in the cells. In particular, we showed a mannose functionalized photocage can target HepG2 cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Both one&#8208;pot catalytic conversion of furfural (FAL) to isopropyl levulinate (PL) and carbonization of by&#8208;product (humins) for electromagnetic wave absorption are discussed, which provides inspiration that humins can be applied to electromagnetic wave absorption. In the former, phosphotungstic acid (PW) is employed as a homogeneous catalyst to convert FAL to PL via a tandem reaction in one pot, with the formation of a vast amount of humins. With FAL and various intermediates as substrates, it was found that humins was a polymerization product of FAL, furfuryl alcohol (FOL) and furfuryl ester (FE) with furan rings. In addition, the  in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR&#8208;IR) spectra  also provided a basis for the proposed reaction route.

The minimum reflection loss (RL  min  ) value is &#8208;47.3 dB at 13.0 GHz with a thickness of 2.0 mm and the effective absorption bandwidth reaches 4.5 GHz (11.2 &#8211; 5.7 GHz).</dc:description>

         <title>Co3O4&#8722;CeO2 Nanocomposites for Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co3O4&#8722;CeO2 nanocomposites with three different morphologies, that is, CeO2&#8208;supported Co3O4 layers, intermixed oxides, and homogeneously dispersed Co, were used for CO oxidation. Both CO&#8208;TPR and CO oxidation kinetics indicated that the layered structure exhibited the best performance for the same Co3O4 loading of 10.4&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The CO oxidation activity increased for higher Co3O4 amount, approaching activity comparable to Pt/CeO2.







Abstract
In an effort to combine the favorable catalytic properties of Co3O4 and CeO2, nanocomposites with different phase distribution and Co3O4 loading were prepared and employed for CO oxidation. Synthesizing Co3O4&#8208;modified CeO2 via three different sol&#8208;gel based routes, each with 10.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% Co3O4 loading, yielded three different nanocomposite morphologies: CeO2&#8208;supported Co3O4 layers, intermixed oxides, and homogeneously dispersed Co. The reactivity of the resulting surface oxygen species towards CO were examined by temperature programmed reduction (CO&#8208;TPR) and flow reactor kinetic tests. The first morphology exhibited the best performance due to its active Co3O4 surface layer, reducing the light&#8208;off temperature of CeO2 by about 200 &#176;C. In contrast, intermixed oxides and Co&#8208;doped CeO2 suffered from lower dispersion and organic residues, respectively. The performance of Co3O4&#8208;CeO2 nanocomposites was optimized by varying the Co3O4 loading, characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and N2 sorption (BET). The 16&#8211;65&#8197;wt&#8201;% Co3O4&#8722;CeO2 catalysts approached the conversion of 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt/CeO2, rendering them interesting candidates for low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation.

Both CO-TPR and CO oxidation kinetics indicated that the layered structure exhibited the best performance for the same Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; loading of 10.4&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The CO oxidation activity increased for higher Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; amount, approaching activity comparable to Pt/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

         <title>Single&#8208;Round DNA Aptamer Selection by Combined Use of Capillary Electrophoresis and Next Generation Sequencing: An Aptaomics Approach for Identifying Unique Functional Protein&#8208;Binding DNA Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA Aptaomics is proposed for finding functional DNA aptamers by a semi&#8208;comprehensive and quantitative single&#8208;round selection using capillary electrophoresis and next generation sequencing according to a selection rule based on analogous sequences. By mining sequence data obtained from sub&#8208;libraries with different DNA conformations, structure&#8208;induced (FRET type) aptamers for thrombin were reasonably selected for the first time.







Abstract
In DNA aptamer selection, existing methods do not discriminate aptamer sequences based on their binding affinity and function and the reproducibility of the selection is often poor, even for the selection of well&#8208;known aptamers like those that bind the commonly used model protein thrombin. In the present study, a novel single&#8208;round selection method (SR&#8208;CE selection) was developed by combining capillary electrophoresis (CE) with next generation sequencing. Using SR&#8208;CE selection, a successful semi&#8208;quantitative and semi&#8208;comprehensive aptamer selection for thrombin was demonstrated with high reproducibility for the first time. Selection rules based on dissociation equilibria and kinetics were devised to obtain families of analogous sequences. Selected sequences of the same family were shown to bind thrombin with high affinity. Furthermore, data acquired from SR&#8208;CE selection was mined by creating sub&#8208;libraries that were categorized by the functionality of the aptamers (e.&#8201;g., pre&#8208;organized aptamers versus structure&#8208;induced aptamers). Using this approach, a novel fluorescent molecular recognition sensor for thrombin with nanomolar detection limits was discovered. Thus, in this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept report, we have demonstrated the potential of a &#8220;DNA Aptaomics&#8221; approach to systematically design functional aptamers as well as to obtain high affinity aptamers.

         <title>Isolation of a Uranium(III)&#8208;Carbon Multiple Bond Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
U(III)=C double bond: The first authentic isolable mononuclear U(III)&#8722;C double bond complex and a U(IV) analogue have been synthesized and fully characterized. Single&#8208;crystal structure analysis revealed that the U(III)=C bond is elongated by ca. 0.18&#8197;&#197; when compared to the U(IV)=C bond. DFT calculations revealed that the tridentate carbodiphosphorane (CDP) ligand served as a double donor towards uranium, forming polarized &#963; and &#960; dative bonds.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent uranium&#8208;element multiple bond complexes remain scarce, though there is burgeoning interest regarding to their bonding and reactivity. Herein, isolation of a uranium(III)&#8208;carbon double bond complex [(Cp*)2U(CDP)](BPh4) (1) comprising a tridentate carbodiphosphorane (CDP) was reported for the first time. Oxidation of 1 afforded the corresponding U(IV) complex [(Cp*)2U(CDP)](BPh4)2 (2). The distance between U and C in 2 is 2.481&#8197;&#197;, indicating the existence of a typical U=C double bond, which is further confirmed by quantum chemical calculations. Bonding analysis suggested that the CDP also serves as both &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donor in complex 1, though a longer U&#8722;C bond (2.666(3)&#8197;&#197;) is observed. It implies that 1 is the first isolable mononuclear uranium(III) carbene complex. Moreover, these results suggest that CDPs are promising ligands to establish other low&#8208;valent f&#8208;block metal&#8208;carbon multiple bond complexes.

         <title>Large Scale Synthesis of Three&#8208;dimensional Hierarchical Porous Framework with High Conductivity and its Application in Lithium Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tremella is utilized as the precursor, a new process method (high&#8208;shear, freeze&#8208;drying and chemical activation are used in turn) is proposed, and an in&#8208;situ doped hierarchical porous biochar materials with adjustable 3D macro&#8208;meso&#8208;micropore is prepared successfully. Due to its unique physical structure, prepared cathode can still reach a reversible discharge capacity of 616&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a rate of 5&#8197;C. After 400 charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 1&#8197;C, the reversible capacity is maintained at 510.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Quick capacity loss due to the polysulfide shuttle effects and poor rate performance caused by low conductivity of sulfur have always been obstacles to the commercial application of lithium sulfur batteries. Herein, an in&#8208;situ doped hierarchical porous biochar materials with high electron&#8208;ion conductivity and adjustable three&#8208;dimensional (3D) macro&#8208;meso&#8208;micropore is prepared successfully. Due to its unique physical structure, the resulting material has a specific surface area of 2124.9&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a cumulative pore volume of 1.19&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. The presence of micropores can effectively physically adsorb polysulfides and mesopores ensure the accessibility of lithium ions and active sites and give the porous carbon material a high specific surface area. The large pores provide channels for the storage of electrolyte and the transmission of ions on the surface of the substrate. The combined effect of these three kinds of pores and the N doping formed in&#8208;situ can effectively promote the cycle and rate performance of the battery. Therefore, prepared cathode can still reach a reversible discharge capacity of 616&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a rate of 5&#8197;C. After 400 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 1&#8197;C, the reversible capacity is maintained at 510.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. This new strategy has provided a new approach to the research and industrial&#8208;scale production of adjustable hierarchical porous biochar materials.

         <title>Access to Indole&#8208;Fused Benzannulated Medium&#8208;Sized Rings through Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of Azido&#8208;Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Because benzannulated and indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208;sized rings are found in many bioactive compounds, the combination of these fragments may lead to unexplored areas of biologically relevant and uncovered chemical space. Here we show that &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene chemistry can play an important role in solving the difficulty in the formation of medium&#8208;sized rings. Namely, phenylene&#8208;tethered azido&#8208;alkynes undergo arylative cyclization through the formation of a gold carbene intermediate to afford benzannulated indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208;sized tetracycles. The reactions allow a range of different aryl substitution patterns and efficient access to these otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;obtain medium&#8208;sized rings. This study also demonstrates the feasibility of the semihollow&#8208;shaped C&#8208;dtbm ligand for the construction of a nine&#8208;membered ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylindolines and 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Indolines by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;arylindolines (2,3&#8208;dihydroindoles) was achieved by treatment of their  N  &#8208;  tert  &#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) derivatives with  n  &#8208;butyllithium and sparteine in toluene at &#8211;78 &#176;C followed by electrophilic quench. The unreacted starting materials together with the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products could be isolated with high enantiomer ratios. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy showed that the rate of Boc rotation was fast (&#916;G  &#8225;  &#8776; 57 kJ/mol at 195 K). This was corroborated by DFT studies and by  in situ  ReactIR spectroscopy. The enantioenriched  N  &#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;arylindolines were converted to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products without significant loss in enantiopurity. Hence either enantiomer of the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products could be obtained with high selectivity from the same enantiomer of the chiral ligand sparteine (one from the kinetic resolution and the other from subsequent lithiation&#8211;trapping of the recovered starting material). Secondary amine products were prepared by removing the Boc group with acid to provide a way to access highly enantioenriched 2&#8208;aryl and 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolines.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Anionic Co(II) Metal&#8208;Organic Framework, with a High Density of Amino Groups, as a Superior Luminescent Sensor for Turn&#8208;on Al(III) Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accumulation of high concentrations of Al(III) in body has a direct impact on health and therefore, the trace detection of Al(III) has been a matter for substantial concern. An anionic metal organic framework ({[Me2NH2]0.5[Co(DATRz)0.5(NH2BDC)]&#8226;xG}n; 1; HDATRz = 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, H2NH2&#8208;BDC = 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid, G = guest molecule) composed of two types of secondary building units and channels of varying sizes is synthesized by employing a rational design mixed ligand synthesis approach. Free &#8211;NH2 groups on both the ligands are immobilized onto the pore surface of the MOF which acts as a superior luminescent sensor for turn&#8208;on Al(III) detection. Furthermore, the large channels could allow the counter&#8208;ions to pass through and get exchanged to selectively detect Al(III) in presence of other seventeen metal ions with magnificent luminescence enhancement. The observed limit of detection is as low as 17.5 ppb, which is the lowest among the MOF&#8208;based sensors achieved so far. To make this detection approach simple, portable and economic, we demonstrate MOF filter paper test for real time naked eye observation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cu&#8208;modified Nickel Oxide Nanocrystals and Their Applications as Hole&#8208;injection layers for Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution&#8208;processed NiO  x  thin films have been applied as hole&#8208;injection layers (HILs) in quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). The commonly used NiO  x  HILs are prepared by the precursor&#8208;based route, which requires high annealing temperatures of over 275&#8451;&#160;to in&#8208;situ convert the precursors into oxide films. Such high processing temperatures of NiO  x  HILs hinder their applications in flexible devices. Herein, we report a low&#8208;temperature approach based on Cu&#8208;modified NiO  x  (NiO  x  &#8208;Cu) nanocrystals to prepare HILs. A simple post&#8208;synthetic surface&#8208;modification step, which anchors the copper agents onto the surfaces of oxide nanocrystals, is developed to improve the electrical conductivity of the low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed (135&#8451;) oxide&#8208;nanocrystal thin films. In consequence, QLEDs based on the NiO  x  &#8208;Cu HILs exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 17.5% and a T  95  operational lifetime of ~2,800 hours at an initial brightness of 1,000 cd m  &#8722;2  , meeting the commercialization requirements for display applications. The results shed light on the potential of using NiO  x  &#8208;Cu HILs for realizing high&#8208;performance flexible QLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Differentiation of Epoxide Enantiomers in the Confined Spaces of an Homochiral Cu(II) MOF by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>TAMOF&#8208;1  , a homochiral metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) constructed from an amino acid derivative and Cu(II), was investigated as a heterogeneous catalyst in kinetic resolutions involving the ring opening of styrene oxide with a set of anilines. The branched products generated from the ring opening of styrene oxide with anilines and the unreacted epoxide were obtained with moderately high enantiomeric excesses. The linear product arising from the attack on the non&#8208;benzylic position of styrene oxide underwent a second kinetic resolution by reacting with the epoxide, resulting in an amplification of its final enantiomeric excess and a concomitant formation of an array of isomeric aminodiols. Computational studies confirmed the experimental results, providing a deep understanding of the whole process involving the two successive kinetic resolutions. Furthermore,  TAMOF&#8208;1  activity was conserved after several catalytic cycles. The ring opening of a  meso  &#8208;epoxide with aniline catalyzed by  TAMOF&#8208;1  was also studied and moderate enantioselectivities were obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;guest Interaction in Ethylene and Ethane Separation on Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks as Revealed by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of ethane/ethylene mixture using MOFs as adsorbents is strongly associated with the pore size&#8208;sieving effect and the adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interaction. Herein, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is utilized to explore the host&#8208;guest interaction and ethane/ethylene separation mechanism on zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Preferential access to the ZIF&#8208;8 and ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;90 frameworks by ethane compared to ethylene is directly visualized from two&#8208;dimensional 1 H&#8208; 1 H spin diffusion MAS NMR spectroscopy and further verified by computational density distributions. The 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy provides an alternative for straightforwardly extracting the adsorption selectivity of ethane/ethylene mixture at 1.1~9.6 bar in ZIFs, which is consistent with the IAST predictions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluoride&#8208;promoted, stepwise nucleophilic aromatic substitution of silicon&#8208;based aryl pronucleophiles decorated with sensitive functional groups and polyfluorinated arenes enables the synthesis of partially fluorinated biaryls. The mild transformation operates at room temperature, requiring less than one hour for completion. Hence, the functional&#8208;group compatibility is superb, and regioselectivities are improved compared to known couplings.







Abstract
A chemoselective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling of sufficiently electron&#8208;deficient fluorinated arenes and functionalized N&#8208;aryl&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;silyldiazenes as masked aryl nucleophiles is reported. The fluoride&#8208;promoted transformation involves the in&#8197;situ generation of the aryl nucleophile decorated with various sensitive functional groups followed by a stepwise nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr). These reactions typically proceed at room temperature within minutes. This catalytic process allows for the functionalization of both coupling partners, furnishing highly fluorinated biaryls in good yields.

         <title>A Smart Access to the Dinitramide Anion &#8211; The Use of Dinitraminic Acid for the Preparation of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Energetic Copper(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dinitramide anion was made accessible for complexation through the use of dinitraminic acid and basic copper(II) carbonate. The in&#8197;situ prepared copper dinitramide was complexed by 13 different highly endothermic tri&#8208; and tetrazole ligands. By the choice of ligand, complexes were obtained that possess thermal stability exceeding 200&#8197;degrees Celsius, one even capable of initiating pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). The examined compounds were successfully ignited in laser experiments, with one complex even detonating.







Abstract
Dinitraminic acid (HN(NO2)2, HDN) was prepared by ion exchange chromatography and acid&#8208;base reaction with basic copper(II) carbonate allowed the in&#8197;situ preparation of copper(II) dinitramide, which was reacted with twelve nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands, for example, 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;5H&#8208;tetrazole, di(5H&#8208;tetrazolyl)&#8208;methane/&#8208;ethane/&#8208;propane/&#8208;butane. Nine of the complexes were investigated by low&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, all compounds were investigated by infrared spectroscopy (IR), differential thermal analysis (DTA), elemental analysis (EA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for selected compounds. Furthermore, investigations of the materials were carried out regarding their sensitivity toward impact (IS), friction (FS), ball drop impact (BDIS) and electrostatic discharge (ESD). In addition, hot plate and hot needle tests were performed. Complex [Cu(AMT)4(H2O)](DN)2, based on 1&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;methyltetrazole (AMT), is most outstanding for its detonative behavior and thus also capable of initiating PETN in classical initiation experiments. Laser ignition experiments at a wavelength of 915&#8197;nm were performed for all substances and solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;Vis spectra were recorded to apprehend the ignition mechanism.

         <title>Extended Enolates: Versatile Intermediates for Asymmetric C&#8208;H Functionalization via Noncovalent Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extend and divert. Extended enolates may be generated by deprotonation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208; or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds smoothly, to react with a variety of electrophiles in&#8197;situ. Easier to form than the parent simple enolates, di&#8208; and trienolates present, however, two nucleophilic carbons (typically C&#945; and C&#947;) potentially leading to regioisomeric products. In recent years, methods based on both metallic and organic chiral catalysts have been developed able to address some of these site&#8208; and stereoselectivity issues, enabling direct asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization of carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;controlled functionalization of unmodified carbonyl compounds is a relevant operation in organic synthesis, especially when high levels of site&#8208; and stereoselectivity can be attained. This objective is now within reach for some subsets of enolizable substrates using various types of activation mechanisms. Recent contributions to this area include enantioselective transformations that proceed via transiently generated noncovalent di(tri)enolate&#8208;catalyst coordination species. While relatively easier to form than simple enolate congeners, di(tri)enolates are ambifunctional in nature and so control of the reaction regioselectivity becomes an issue. This Minireview discusses in some detail this and other problems, and how noncovalent activation approaches based on metallic and metal free catalysts have been developed to advance the field.

         <title>Rb[Li5Si2O7] &#8208; A Latecomer in the Family of Alkali Lithosilicates Hiding a Green&#8208;Emitting Lithosilicate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to expand the field of alkali lithosilicates, a new representative of the substance class with a previously unknown structure type was found based on solid&#8208;state synthesis. The novel compound with the sum formula Rb[Li  5  Si  2  O  7  ] crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group  Pbcm  (no. 57) with  a  = 7.6269(3),  b  = 9.5415(4), and  c  = 9.4095(3) &#197; by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The structure consists of a highly condensed lithosilicate framework, built up of corner&#8208; and edge&#8208;linked [LiO  4  ]&#8208;tetrahedra and [Si  2  O  7  ]&#8208;units, and the rubidium ions aligned in channels. Suitable crystals of the material were obtained using sealed tantalum ampoules as reaction tube at a temperature of 750 &#176;C. The new compound was further characterized via powder diffraction, Rietveld analysis, and EDX measurements. At first glance, Eu  2+  &#8208;doped Rb[Li  5  Si  2  O  7  ] reveals an intense green luminescence. In&#8208;depth crystal analysis shows that a core&#8208;shell formation is present even for apparently high quality single&#8208;crystals. As a minority phase, the known green phosphor RbLi[Li  3  SiO  4  ]  2  :Eu  2+  is the origin of the luminescence, representing a tiny core inside of the particles surrounded by a large matrix of transparent Rb[Li  5  Si  2  O  7  ] dominating the single&#8208;crystal diffraction pattern.</dc:description>

         <title>Inclusion Complexes of Gold(I)&#8208;Dithiocarbamates with &#223;&#8208;Cyclodextrin: A Journey from Drug Repurposing towards Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We identified the gold(I)&#8208;dithiocarbamate (dtc) complex [Au(N,N&#8208;diethyl)dtc]2 as the active cytotoxic agent in the combination treatment of sodium aurothiomalate and disulfiram on a panel of cancer cell lines. In addition to demonstrating pronounced differential cytotoxicity to these cell lines, the gold complex showed no cross&#8208;resistance in therapy&#8208;surviving cancer cells. In the course of a medicinal chemistry campaign on this class of poorly soluble gold(I)&#8208;dtc complexes, we synthesized &gt;35 derivatives and used x&#8208;ray crystallography to examine structural aspects of the dtc moiety. A group of hydroxy&#8208;substituted complexes has an improved solubility profile, and we found that these complexes form 2:1 host&#8211;guest inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD), exhibiting a rarely observed &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; arrangement of the CD cones. Formulation of a hydroxy&#8208;substituted gold(I)&#8208;dtc complex with excess sulfobutylether&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD prevents the induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which is a major burden in the development of metallodrugs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation pioneered by Heck in 1969 has dominated medicinal chemistry development for the ensuing fifty years. As the demand for more complex three&#8208;dimensional active pharmaceuticals continues to increase, preparative enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly, by virtue of its exquisite selectivity and sustainable nature, is poised to provide a practical and affordable alternative for accessing such compounds. In this minireview, we summarize recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in practical enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly of carbocycles. When appropriate, background information on the enzymatic transformation is provided and challenges and/or limitations are also highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Molten Salt Assisted Annealing for Making Colloidal ZnGa2O4:Cr Nanocrystals with High Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Persistent luminescent nanocrystals (PLNCs) in sub&#8208;10 nm domain are considered most fascinating inventions in lighting technology owing to their excellent performance in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, luminous paints, bioimaging, security applications, etc.  Further improvement of persistent luminescence (PersL) intensity and lifetime is needed to achieve the desired success while keeping uniform sub&#8208;10 nm size of PLNCs.  In this work, we have introduced the concept of molten salt confinement to thermally anneal as&#8208;synthesized ZnGa  2  O  4  :Cr  3+  (ZGOC) colloidal NCs (CNCs) in a molten salt media at 650  o  C for the first time. This method led to significantly monodispersed and few agglomerated NCs with much improved photoluminescence (PL) and PersL intensity without much size growth of the pristine CNCs. Other strategies, such as: (i) thermal annealing, (ii) overcoating, and (iii) core&#8208;shell strategy, have also been tried to improve PL and PersL but we could not achieve improvement in their PL and PersL simultaneously. Moreover, directly annealing of the CNCs in air without the molten salt assistance could significantly improve both PL and PersL but lead to particle heterogeneity and aggregation, which are highly unsuitable for in vivo imaging. We believe this work provides a novel strategy to design PLNCs with high PL intensity and long PersL duration without losing their nanostructural characteristics, water dispersibility and biocompatibility.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel Lewis acids derived from bipyridinium and phenanthrolinium dications is reported. Calculations of Hydride Ion Affinity (HIA) values indicate high carbon&#8208;based Lewis acidity at the  ortho  and  para  positions. This arises in part from extensive LUMO delocalization across the aromatic backbones. Species [C  10  H  6  R  2  N  2  CH  2  CH  2  ]  2+  (R = H  [1a]  2+  , Me  [1f]  2+  ,  t  Bu  [1g]  2+  ), and [C  12  H  4  R  4  N  2  CH  2  CH  2  ]  2+  (R = H  [2a]  2+  , Me  [2b]  2+  ) were prepared and evaluated for use in the initiation of hydrodefluorination (HDF) catalysis. Compound  [2a]  2+  proved highly effective towards generating catalytically active silylium cations via Lewis acid&#8208;mediated hydride abstraction from silane. This enabled the HDF of a range of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208; substituted sp  3  (C&#8208;F) bonds under mild conditions. The protocol was also adapted to effect the deuterodefluorination of  cis  &#8208;2,4,6&#8208;(CF  3  )  3  C  6  H  9  . The dications are shown to act as hydride acceptors with the isolation of neutral species C  16  H  14  N  2  (  3a  ) and C  16  H  10  Me  4  N  2  (  3b  ) and monocationic species [C  14  H  13  N  2  ]  +  (  [4a]  +  ) and [C  18  H  21  N  2  ]+ (  [4b]  +  ).

         <title>Novel WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 Hierarchical Nanosphere as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hierarchical nanospheres were prepared via a one&#8208;pot synthetic route, with great hydrogen evolution reaction activities. The unique plate of WS2 and the complex solid&#8208;phase structure of Fe0.95S1.05 exposes more active sites for the HER reaction, which helps to improve the accessibility and diffusibility of the electrolyte, and hence the WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalysts display favorable catalytic for HER.







Abstract
Fe0.95S1.05 with high reactivity and stability was incorporated into WS2 nanosheets via a one&#8208;step solvothermal method for the first time. The resulted hybrid catalyst has much higher catalytic activity than WS2 and Fe0.95S1.05 alone, and the optimal WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalyst was found by adjusting the feed ratio. The addition of Fe0.95S1.05 was proven to be able to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of WS2, and vice versa. At the same time, it was found that the catalytic effect of the hybrid catalyst was the best when the feed ratio was W&#8201;:&#8201;Fe=2&#8201;:&#8201;1. In other words, we confirmed that there is a synergistic effect between W&#8208; and Fe&#8208;based sulfide hybrid catalysts, and validated that the reason for the improved HER performance is the strong interaction between the two in the middle sulfur. WS2/Fe0.95S1.05&#8208;2 hybrid catalyst leads to enhanced HER activity, which shows a low overpotential of &#8764;0.172&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, low Tafel slope of &#8764;53.47&#8197;mV/decade. This study supplies innovative synthesis of a highly active WS2/Fe0.95S1.05 hybrid catalyst for HER.

         <title>Stable and Storable N(CF3)2 Transfer Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable storage solutions: Copper(I) and silver(I) complexes with the bis(trifluoromethyl)amido ligand stabilized by pyridine and phosphane ligands have become accessible. These complexes are thermally stable and can be stored under inert conditions; in contrast to the behavior of other metal salts such as M{N(CF3)2} (M=Cu, Ag). The complexes were found to be convenient reagents for nucleophilic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions, thereby providing access to a series of organic substrates with the bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group.







Abstract
Fluorinated groups are essential for drug design, agrochemicals, and materials science. The bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group is an example of a stable group that has a high potential. While the number of molecules containing perfluoroalkyl, perfluoroalkoxy, and other fluorinated groups is steadily increasing, examples with the N(CF3)2 group are rare. One reason is that transfer reagents are scarce and metal&#8208;based storable reagents are unknown. Herein, a set of CuI and AgI bis(trifluoromethyl)amido complexes stabilized by N&#8208; and P&#8208;donor ligands with unprecedented stability are presented. The complexes are stable solids that can even be manipulated in air for a short time. They are bis(trifluoromethyl)amination reagents as shown by nucleophilic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions. In addition to a series of benzylbis(trifluoromethyl)amines, 2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)amino acetate was obtained, which, upon hydrolysis, gives the fluorinated amino acid N,N&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)glycine.

         <title>Catalytic Transfer Deuteration and Hydrodeuteration: Emerging Techniques to Selectively Transform Alkenes and Alkynes to Deuterated Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, catalytic transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration techniques are emerging as powerful methods for the selective installation of deuterium into small molecules. In this minireview, recent advances for the application of these reactions in the selective deuteration of alkenes and alkynes are discussed.







Abstract
Increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled organic molecules has spurred a renewed interest in selective methods for deuterium installation. Catalytic transfer deuteration and transfer hydrodeuteration are emerging as powerful techniques for the selective incorporation of deuterium into small molecules. These reactions not only obviate the use of D2 gas and pressurized reaction setups but provide new opportunities for selectively installing deuterium into small molecules. Commercial or readily synthesized deuterium donors are typically employed as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagents for transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration reactions. In this minireview, recent advances in the catalytic transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration of alkenes and alkynes for the selective synthesis of deuterated alkanes will be discussed.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Resorcin[4]arene&#8208;Based Inorganic&#8208;Organic Complexes: Metal Ion Effects on the Electrochemical Performance of Lithium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New resources from resorcin: Three polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8211;organic materials (1&#8211;3) with different metal ions have been synthesized. Their composites 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO were created by anchoring 1&#8211;3 on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to enhance the conductivities. These composites show different electrochemical performances for lithium ion batteries.







Abstract
With their adjustable structures and diverse functions, polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8211;organic complexes are a kind of potential multifunctional material. They have potential applications for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, the relationship between different coordinated metal ions and electrochemical performance has rarely been investigated. Here, three functionalized POM&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8211;organic materials, [Co2(TMR4&#8197;A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#8901;2&#8201;EtOH&#8901;4.5&#8201;H2O (1), [Ni2(TMR4&#8197;A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#8901;4&#8201;EtOH&#8901;13&#8201;H2O (2), and [Zn2(TMR4&#8197;A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#8901;2&#8201;EtOH&#8901;2&#8201;H2O (3), have been synthesized. Furthermore, to enhance the conductivities of these compounds, 1&#8211;3 were doped with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to give composites 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO, respectively. As anode materials for LIBs, 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO can deliver very high discharge capacities (1445.9, 1285.0 and 1095.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively) in the initial run, and show discharge capacities of 898, 665 and 651&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, at a current density of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 100 runs. More importantly, the discharge capacities of 319, 283 and 329&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 were maintained for 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO even after 400 cycles at large current density (1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Spotlight on the Effect of Electrolyte Composition on the Potential of Maximum Entropy: Supporting Electrolytes Are Not Always Inert</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold standards: By determining the potential of maximum entropy (PME) with the laser&#8208;induced current transient technique, the influence of the electrolyte composition on polycrystalline gold has been systematically investigated. Increasing the electrolyte pH and purging O2 shift the PME to more positive potentials. The electric double&#8208;layer structure for Aupc in solutions containing Na+ and K+ ions is vastly different when electrolyte pH reaches six or higher. This method enables another approach for the interpretation of interfacial electrocatalytic processes.







Abstract
The influence of electrolyte pH, the presence of alkali metal cations (Na+, K+), and the presence of O2 on the interfacial water structure of polycrystalline gold electrodes has been experimentally studied in detail. The potential of maximum entropy (PME) was determined by the laser&#8208;induced current transient (LICT) technique. Our results demonstrate that increasing the electrolyte pH and introducing O2 shift the PME to more positive potentials. Interestingly, the PME exhibits a higher sensitivity to the pH change in the presence of K+ than Na+. Altering the pH of the K2SO4 solution from 4 to 6 can cause a drastic shift in the PME. These findings reveal that, for example, K2SO4 and Na2SO4 cannot be considered as equal supporting electrolytes: it is not a viable assumption. This can likely be extrapolated to other common &#8220;inert&#8221; supporting electrolytes. Beyond this, knowledge about the near&#8208;ideal electrolyte composition can be used to optimize electrochemical devices such as electrolyzers, fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors.

         <title>Competing Effects of Chlorination on the Strength of Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O Chalcogen Bonds Select the Structure of Mixed Supramolecular Macrocyclic Aggregates of Iso&#8208;Tellurazole N&#8208;Oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorination of tellurium has opposing effects on the formation of chalcogen bonds (ChBs) by iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxides, enhancing their strength as ChB donors but weakening their role as ChB acceptors. The net effect is that the fully chlorinated tetramer is barely more stable than the non&#8208;halogenated macrocycle. In contrast, partial halogenation results in a more stable alternating structure.







Abstract
Chlorination of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;tellurazole&#8208;2&#8208;oxide yielded the &#955;4Te dichloro derivative. Its crystal structure demonstrates that the heterocycle retains its ability to autoassociate by chalcogen bonding (ChB) forming macrocyclic tetramers. The corresponding Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O ChB distances are 2.062&#8197;&#197;, the shortest observed to date in aggregates of this type. DFT&#8722;D3 calculations indicate that while the halogenated molecule is stronger as a ChB donor it also is a weaker ChB acceptor; the overall effect is that the ChBs in the chlorinated homotetramer are not significantly stronger. However, partial halogenation or scrambling selectively yield the 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 heterotetramer with alternating &#955;4Te and &#955;2Te centers, which calculations identified as the thermodynamically preferred arrangement.

         <title>(Automated) Synthesis of Well&#8208;defined Staphylococcus Aureus Wall Teichoic Acid Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using tailor&#8208;made teichoic acid building blocks, a library of glycosylated ribitol phosphate Staphylococcus aureus wall teichoic acids (WTA) has been assembled, ranging in length, and varying in N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine substitution pattern. The library of well&#8208;defined WTAs has been used to develop a magnetic bead binding assay to interrogate monoclonal antibody binding, revealing the preference of the various antibodies for different glycosylation patterns.







Abstract
Wall teichoic acids (WTAs) are important components of the cell wall of the opportunistic Gram&#8208;positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. WTAs are composed of repeating ribitol phosphate (RboP) residues that are decorated with d&#8208;alanine and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) modifications, in a seemingly random manner. These WTA&#8208;modifications play an important role in shaping the interactions of WTA with the host immune system. Due to the structural heterogeneity of WTAs, it is impossible to isolate pure and well&#8208;defined WTA molecules from bacterial sources. Therefore, here synthetic chemistry to assemble a broad library of WTA&#8208;fragments, incorporating all possible glycosylation modifications (&#945;&#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C4; &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C4; &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc at the RboP C3) described for S. aureus WTAs, is reported. DNA&#8208;type chemistry, employing ribitol phosphoramidite building blocks, protected with a dimethoxy trityl group, was used to efficiently generate a library of WTA&#8208;hexamers. Automated solid phase syntheses were used to assemble a WTA&#8208;dodecamer and glycosylated WTA&#8208;hexamer. The synthetic fragments have been fully characterized and diagnostic signals were identified to discriminate the different glycosylation patterns. The different glycosylated WTA&#8208;fragments were used to probe binding of monoclonal antibodies using WTA&#8208;functionalized magnetic beads, revealing the binding specificity of these WTA&#8208;specific antibodies and the importance of the specific location of the GlcNAc modifications on the WTA&#8208;chains.

         <title>Easily Available, Amphiphilic Diiron Cyclopentadienyl Complexes Exhibit in Vitro Anticancer Activity in 2D and 3D Human Cancer Cells through Redox Modulation Triggered by CO Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of cationic diiron complexes containing a variable bridging iminium ligand displays promising antiproliferative activity towards a panel of 2D and 3D cancer cell lines, and a selectivity not correlated to a different degree of uptake in cancerous and noncancerous cells. The mode of action appears to be mainly related to the interference with cell redox processes (ROS production, inhibition of TrxR), initiated by intracellular CO release.







Abstract
A straightforward two&#8208;step procedure via single CO removal allows the conversion of commercial [Fe2Cp2(CO)4] into a range of amphiphilic and robust ionic complexes based on a hybrid aminocarbyne/iminium ligand, [Fe2Cp2(CO)3{CN(R)(R&#8217;)}]X (R, R&#8217;=alkyl or aryl; X=CF3SO3 or BF4), on up to multigram scales. Their physicochemical properties can be modulated by an appropriate choice of N&#8208;substituents and counteranion. Tested against a panel of human cancer cell lines, the complexes were shown to possess promising antiproliferative activity and to circumvent multidrug resistance. Interestingly, most derivatives also retained a significant cytotoxic activity against human cancer 3D cell cultures. Among them, the complex with R=4&#8208;C6H4OMe and R&#8217;=Me emerged as the best performer of the series, being on average about six times more active against cancer cells than a noncancerous cell line, and displayed IC50 values comparable to those of cisplatin in 3D cell cultures. Mechanistic studies revealed the ability of the complexes to release carbon monoxide and to act as oxidative stress inducers in cancer cells.

         <title>Synthesis of Difluoroglycine Derivatives from Amines, Difluorocarbene, and CO2: Computational Design, Scope, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Artificial Force Induced Reaction (AFIR) on a super computer has led to a new three&#8208;component reaction (3CR) of amines, difluorocarbene, and the inexpensive and non&#8208;toxic C1 source CO2. This reaction produces a broad range of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroglycine derivatives that are bioisosteres of natural glycine. The versatility of these products is very broad; i.e., they can be used as new difluorocarbene sources, substrates for radical substitution reactions, and precursors for new NHC ligands. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Maeda, T. Mita et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100812).

Purely organic materials exhibiting room temperature phosphorescence in the red to near&#8208;infrared region were obtained by using simple naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapochromic luminescent crystal consisting of boron diiminate has been discovered. The emission color is changed by absorption of solvent vapor, such as dichloromethane and recovered by desorption of encapsulated molecules through fuming with another solvent vapor, such as cyclohexane. The alteration of molecular conformation between planar and twisted structures is responsible for luminochromism. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Tanaka et&#8197;al.

Phytoglandins from the reaction flask enable their identification in Nature. Hypothetical plant&#8208;based prostaglandin analogs were obtained by a 15&#8208;step asymmetric total synthesis. They were applied as an analytical standard in a detailed LC&#8208;MS/MS study confirming phytoglandin formation in autoxidized linolenic acid and in various edible vegetable oils in sizeable quantities. More information can be found in the Full Paper by U. Jahn et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100872).

         <title>A Nazarov&#8208;Ene Tandem Reaction for the Stereoselective Construction of Spiro Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem Nazarov/ene reaction in trienones was found to be initiated by tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPPB) and resulted in spiro compounds as single diastereoisomers. The reaction was applied to a set of substrates with different chain lengths and functionalities, and investigations on the mechanism were conducted. This novel diastereoselective reaction extends the application of interrupted Nazarov cyclizations as tools for the synthesis of natural products. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Kalesse et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101041).

         <title>Exploiting Transient Radical Cations as Br&#248;nsted Acids for Allylic C&#8211;H Heteroarylation of Enol Silyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction pathways of transient radical species are difficult to control, like the soap bubbles in the wind depicted in the cover image. Yet, these short&#8208;lived intermediates, when one encounters another, readily assemble into a united structure, as two bubbles fuse into a bigger single bubble. The enol silyl ether&#8208;derived radical cations with a highly acidic allylic proton facilitates the single&#8208;electron reduction of cyanopyridines via protonation. The resulting two radical intermediates successively engage in the radical&#8722;radical coupling to produce heteroarylated enol silyl ethers. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Ooi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101352).

         <title>Photoresponsive Binding Dynamics in High&#8208;Affinity Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Dithienylethene Host&#8208;Guest Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive binding kinetics was achieved in cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;dithienylethene host&#8208;guest complexes. This work demonstrates that, in the presence of a competitor guest (in purple), the host&#8208;guest dissociation kinetics is approximately 100&#8208;fold slower for the closed (green) than for the open (yellow) dithienylethene isomers (t 1/2=107 hours vs. t 1/2=1.2 hours), allowing control over the dissociation rate with red/NIR light. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Jorge&#8197;Parola, N. Bas&#237;lio, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100974).

         <title>Modulation of Src Kinase Activity by Selective Substrate Recognition with Pseudopeptidic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modulation of the activity of tyrosine kinases (TK) is an appealing topic of current research. This work presents new pseudopeptidic cages that protect the substrates from the action of the TK enzyme, precluding the corresponding Tyr phosphorylation, with a very good correlation between the Tyr caging and the kinase inhibition. The results illustrate how TK signaling can be efficiently and selectively modulated with supramolecular complexes. More information can be found in the Full Paper by W.&#8197;T. Miller, I. Alfonso, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100990).

         <title>Iminosugar&#8208;C&#8208;glycosides work as pharmacological chaperones of NAGLU, a glycosidase involved in MPS IIIB rare disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB is a devastating neurological disease caused by a lack of the lysosomal enzyme,&#160; &#945; &#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), leading to a toxic accumulation of heparan sulfate. Herein we explored a pharmacological chaperone approach to enhance the residual activity of NAGLU in patient fibroblasts. Capitalizing on the three&#8208;dimensional structures of two modest homoiminosugar&#8208;based NAGLU inhibitors in complex with bacterial homolog of NAGLU, CpGH89, we have synthesized a library of 17 six&#8208;membered iminosugar&#8208;  C  &#8208;glycosides mimicking&#160;  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine and bearing various pseudo&#8208;anomeric substituents of both&#160; &#945; &#8208; and&#160; &#946; &#8208;configuration. Elaboration with the aglycon moiety results in low micromolar selective inhibitors of human recombinant NAGLU, but surprisingly it is the non&#8208;functionalized and wrongly configured&#160; &#946; &#8208;homoiminosugar that was proved to act as the most promising pharmacological chaperone, promoting a 2.4 fold activity enhancement of mutant NAGLU at its optimal concentration</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Reactivity of Phosphanylalumane (&gt;P&#8211;Al&lt;): Reversible Addition of a Saturated Interelement Bond to Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reversible addition reactions of olefins with a phosphanylalumane, P&#8211;Al single bond species, were investigated. The P&#8211;Al bond added to ethylene and relatively small terminal alkenes (propylene and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene) at room temperature to give the corresponding alkene&#8208;adducts. Heating of the terminal alkene&#8208;adducts released the corresponding alkenes and regenerated the P&#8211;Al bond, but no release of ethylene was observed even under vacuum conditions. The reactivity of ethylene&#8208;adduct as a new saturated C2&#8208;vicinal P/Al&#8208;based FLP was also investigated. The ethylene&#8208;adduct was found to undergo complexation with nitriles to give the corresponding nitrile adducts to the Al center, which retained the ethylene&#8208;tether as in the case of the corresponding P/B&#8208;based FLP. However, the reactivity of ethylene&#8208;adduct toward CO2 and benzaldehyde differed from that of the P/B&#8208;system giving the corresponding adducts.</dc:description>

         <title>Competitive Coordination of Chloride and Fluoride Anions Towards Trivalent Lanthanide Cations (La3+ and Nd3+) in Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molten salt electrolysis is a vital technique to produce high&#8208;purity lanthanide metals and alloys. However, the coordination environments of lanthanides in molten salts, which heavily affect the related redox potential and electrochemical properties, have not been well elucidated. Here we explore the      competitive coordination of chloride and fluoride anions towards lanthanide cations (La  3+  and Nd  3+  )     in    molten  LiCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;LiF&#8208;LnCl  3  salts   by using electrochemical,  spectroscopic  , and computational approaches. Electrochemical analyses show that significant negative shifts in the reduction potential of Ln  3+  occur when F  &#8208;  concentration increases, indicating that the F  &#8208;  anions interact with Ln  3+  via substituting the coordinated Cl  &#8208;  anions, and confirm [LnCl  x  F  y  ]  3&#8208;x&#8208;y  (y  max  =3) complexes are prevailing in molten salts.  Spectroscopic and computational results on solution structures further reveal the competition between Cl  &#8208;  and F  &#8208;  anions, which leads to the formation of  four distinct Ln(III) species: [LnCl  6  ]  3&#8208;  ,  [LnCl  5  F]  3&#8208;  , [LnCl  4  F  2  ]  3&#8208;  and [LnCl  4  F  3  ]  4&#8208;  . Among them, the seven&#8208;coordinated [LnCl  4  F  3  ]  4&#8208;  complex possesses a low&#8208;symmetry structure evidenced by the pattern change of Raman spectra. After comparing the polarizing power (Z/r) among different metal cations, we conclude that Ln&#8208;F interaction is weaker than that between transition metal and F  &#8208;  ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of a Strategy for the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cornexistin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a full account on the evolution of the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cornexistin. Our initial efforts were based on masking the reactive maleic anhydride moiety as a 3,4&#8208;substituted furan and on forming the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle via an intramolecular Conia&#8208;ene or&#160; Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction. Those strategies suffered from low yields and were jeopardized by a late&#8208;stage installation of the&#160;  Z  &#8208;alkene, as well as the stereocenters along the eastern periphery. We addressed those issues by employing a chiral&#8208;pool strategy that involved construction of the crucial stereocenters at C2, C3 and C8 at an early stage with installation of the maleic anhydride as late as possible. The successful approach featured an intermolecular NHK coupling to install the&#160;  Z  &#8209;alkene, a&#160;  syn  &#8208;Evans&#8208;aldol reaction to forge the stereocenters along the eastern periphery, an intramolecular allylic alkylation to close the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle and a challenging stepwise hydrolysis of a&#160; &#946; &#8208;keto nitrile to furnish the maleic anhydride.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the &#960;&#8208;Accepting Properties of Mesoionic Carbenes: A Combined Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoionic imidazolylidenes are recognized as excellent electron&#8208;donating ligands in organometallic and main group chemistry. However, these carbene ligands typically show poor &#960;&#8208;accepting properties. We have performed a computational analysis of 71 mesoionic imidazolylidenes having different aryl or heteroaryl substituents in C2 position. The study has revealed that a diphenyltriazinyl (Dpt) substituent renders the corresponding carbene particularly &#960;&#8208;acidic. The computational results could be corroborated experimentally. A mesoionic imidazolylidene with a Dpt substituent was found to be a better &#963;&#8208;donor and a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor compared to an Arduengo&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. To demonstrate the utility of the new carbene, we have used the ligand to stabilize a low&#8208;valent paramagnetic tin(II) compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Stiffening and Non&#8208;Cell Adhesive Properties of Amphiphilic Peptides with Central Alkylene Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber&#8208;forming peptides are of high interest for potential biomedical applications. This work presents the unexpected effects of central alkylene chains in peptides on their self&#8208;assembly and biological properties. Insertion of the alkylene chain at the center of the peptide allowed for strengthening of &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds, formation of hydrogels with increased stiffness, thermal responses and significant decrease in the cell adhesive property. This study offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological properties of peptide materials by conformational flexibility.

         <title>Trapping of Terminal Platinapolyynes by Copper(I) Catalyzed Click&#160;Cycloadditions; Probes of Labile Intermediates in Syntheses of Complexes with Extended sp Carbon Chains, and Crystallographic Studies</title>

         <dc:description>The silylated hexatriynyl complex  trans&#8208;(C6F5)(p  &#8208;tol3P)2  Pt(C&#8801;C)3SiEt3  (PtC6TES) is converted in situ to&#160;  PtC6H  (wet  n&#8208;Bu4  N+&#160;F&#8211;,THF) and cross coupled with the diyne H(C&#8801;C)2SiEt3  (HC4TES; CuCl/TMEDA, O2) to give  PtC10TES  (71%). This sequence is repeated twice to afford  PtC14TES  (65%) and then  PtC18TES  (27%). An analogous series of reactions starting with  PtC8TES  gives  PtC12TES  (60%), then  PtC16TES  (43%), and then  PtC20TES  (17%). Simil&#173;ar cross couplings with H(C&#8801;C)2Si(i&#8208;Pr)3  (HC4TIPS  ) give  PtC12TIPS  (68%),  PtC14TIPS  (68%), and  PtC16TIPS  (34%). The trialkylsilyl species (up to  PtC18TES) are converted to 3+2 "click" cycloadducts or 1,4&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles  trans&#8208;(C6F5)(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt(C&#8801;C)n  &#8211;1C=CHN(CH2C6H5)N=N (29&#8208;92% after workups). The most general procedure involves generating the terminal polyynes  PtCxH  (wet  n&#8208;Bu4  N+&#160;F&#8211;, THF) in the presence of benzyl azide in DMF and aqueous CuSO  4  /ascorbic acid.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The silylated hexatriynyl complex  trans-(C6F5)(p  -tol3P)2  Pt(C&#8801;C)3SiEt3  (PtC6TES) is converted in situ to&#160;  PtC6H  (wet  n-Bu4  N+&#160;F&#8211;,THF) and cross coupled with the diyne H(C&#8801;C)2SiEt3  (HC4TES; CuCl/TMEDA, O2) to give  PtC10TES  (71%). This sequence is repeated twice to afford  PtC14TES  (65%) and then  PtC18TES  (27%). An analogous series of reactions starting with  PtC8TES  gives  PtC12TES  (60%), then  PtC16TES  (43%), and then  PtC20TES  (17%). Simil&#173;ar cross couplings with H(C&#8801;C)2Si(i-Pr)3  (HC4TIPS  ) give  PtC12TIPS  (68%),  PtC14TIPS  (68%), and  PtC16TIPS  (34%). The trialkylsilyl species (up to  PtC18TES) are converted to 3+2 "click" cycloadducts or 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles  trans-(C6F5)(p-tol3P)2Pt(C&#8801;C)n  &#8211;1C=CHN(CH2C6H5)N=N (29-92% after workups). The most general procedure involves generating the terminal polyynes  PtCxH  (wet  n-Bu4  N+&#160;F&#8211;, THF) in the presence of benzyl azide in DMF and aqueous CuSO  4  /ascorbic acid. All of the preceding complexes are crystallographically characterized and the structural and spectroscopic properties analyzed as a function of chain length. Two pseudopo&#173;lymorphs of  PtC20TES  are obtained, both of which feature molecules with parallel sp carbon chains in a pairwise head/tail packing motif with extensive sp/sp van der Waals contacts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Re&#8208;entrant Photoinduced Morphological Transformation and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Kinetic Products of a Rectangular Amphiphilic Diarylethene Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different temperature, different assembly: An amphiphilic rectangular&#8208;shaped photochromic diarylethene showed photoinduced morphological transformation upon irradiation with UV and visible light in water. A re&#8208;entrant transformation was observed, which was interpreted by the V&#8208;shaped phase diagram of the LCST transition. Moreover, by changing the cooling temperature, different kinetic products of supramolecular assembly were obtained.







Abstract
An amphiphilic rectangular&#8208;shaped photochromic diarylethene bearing two hydrophobic alkyl chains and two hydrophilic tri(ethylene glycol) chains was synthesized, and its photoinduced morphological transformation in water was investigated. Two unexpected phenomena were revealed in the course of the experiments: a re&#8208;entrant photoinduced macroscopic morphological transformation and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic products of supramolecular assembly. When the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was dispersed in water, a re&#8208;entrant photoinduced morphological transformation, that is, a photoinduced transition from the hydrated phase to the dehydrated phase and then back to the hydrated phase, was observed by optical microscopy upon irradiation with green light at 20&#8201;&#176;C; this was interpreted by the V&#8208;shaped phase diagram of the LCST transition. The aqueous assembly of the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was controlled by changing the temperature; specifically, rapid cooling to 15 and 5&#8201;&#176;C gave J and H aggregates, respectively, as the kinetic products. The thermodynamic product at both temperatures was a mixture of mostly H aggregate with a small amount of J aggregate. This behavior was rationalized by the temperature&#8208;dependent potential energy surface of the supramolecular assembly.

         <title>Comparative Investigation into the Complexation and Extraction Properties of Tridentate and Tetradentate Phosphine Oxide&#8208;Functionalized 1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline Ligands toward Lanthanides and Actinides</title>

The same, but different: Two phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands, the tetradentate 2,9&#8208;bis(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (L1) and tridentate 2&#8208;(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (L2), have been synthesized and studied comparatively for coordination and extraction with trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Although quite different extraction properties toward AmIII and EuIII were found between L1 and L2 due to their different hydrophobicity in nitrate media, they showed comparable affinity to trivalent f&#8208;block elements, as revealed by UV/vis titration, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT calculation.







Abstract
Two new phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands, tetradentate 2,9&#8208;bis(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;BPPhen, L1) and tridentate 2&#8208;(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;MPPhen, L2), were synthesized and studied comparatively for their coordination with trivalent actinides and lanthanides. The complexation mechanisms of these two ligands toward trivalent f&#8208;block elements were thoroughly elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, UV/vis spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectrometry, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solvent extraction, and theoretical calculation methods. NMR titration results demonstrated that 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 (metal to ligand) lanthanides complexes formed for L1, whereas 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 and 1&#8201;:&#8201;3 lanthanide complexes formed for L2 in methanol. The formation of these species was validated by fluorescence spectrometry, and the corresponding stability constants for the complexes of NdIII with L1 and L2 were determined by using UV/vis spectrophotometry. Structures of the 10&#8208;coordinated 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;type complexes of EuL1(NO3)3 and [EuL2(NO3)3(H2O)] Et2O in the solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In solvent&#8208;extraction experiments, L1 exhibited extremely strong extraction ability for both AmIII and EuIII, whereas L2 showed nearly no extraction toward AmIII or EuIII due to its high hydrophilicity. Finally, the structures and bonding natures of the complex species formed between AmIII/EuIII and L1/L2 were analyzed in DFT calculations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of the redox reactivity, magnetic and optical properties of the different redox states of complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands permits their rational use in catalysis and materials science. The redox&#8208;chemistry of octahedrally&#8208;coordinated high&#8208;spin Co  II  complexes (three unpaired electrons) with one redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand and two acetylacetonato (acac) co&#8208;ligands is completely changed by replacing the acac by hexafluoro&#8208;acetylacetonato (hfacac) co&#8208;ligands. The first one&#8208;electron oxidation is metal&#8208;centered in the case of the complexes with acac co&#8208;ligands, giving diamagnetic Co  III  complexes. By contrast, in the case of the less Lewis&#8208;basic hfacac co&#8208;ligands, the first one&#8208;electron oxidation becomes ligand&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin Co  II  complexes with a radical monocationic guanidine ligand unit (four unpaired electrons). Ferromagnetic coupling between the spins on the metal and the organic radical in solution is evidenced by temperature&#8208;dependent paramagnetic NMR studies, allowing to estimate the isotropic exchange coupling constant in solution. Second one&#8208;electron oxidation leads to high&#8208;spin Co  II  complexes with dicationic guanidine ligand units (three unpaired electrons) in the presence of hfacac co&#8208;ligands, but to low&#8208;spin Co  III  complexes with radical monocationic, peralkylated guanidine ligand (one unpaired electron) in the presence of acac co&#8208;ligands. The analysis of the electronic structures is complemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on the spin density distributions and relative energies of the possible redox isomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Tracking Electrocatalytic Activity of a Single Palladium Nanoparticle for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nanoparticle&#8208;based electrocatalysts&#8217; performance is directly related to the working conditions. In general, a number of nanoparticles are uncontrollably fixed on a millimetre&#8208;sized electrode for electrochemical measurements. However, it cannot reveal the maximum electrocatalytic activity owing to the aggregation and detachment of nanoparticles on the electrode surface. To amend this drawback, here, we take the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyzed by palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) as a model system to track the electrocatalytic activity of single Pd NPs by stochastic collision electrochemistry and ensemble electrochemistry, respectively. Comparing with the fix working condition, Pd NPs in the diffusion working condition perform a 2&#8208;5 orders magnitude enhancements of electrocatalytic activity for HER at various biased potential. Stochastic collision electrochemistry with high temporal resolution gives further insights into the accurate study of NPs&#8217; electrocatalytic performance, enabling to dramatically enhance electrocatalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Absorption Properties of Long Acenoacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes, polyaromatic hydrocarbons composed of linearly fused benzene rings have received immense attention due to their performance as semiconductors in organic optoelectronic applications. Their appealing physicochemical properties, such as extended delocalization, high charge carrier mobilities, narrow HOMO&#8208;LOMO gaps and partially radical character in the ground state make them very attractive targets for many potential applications. However, the intrinsic synthetic challenges of unsubstituted members such as high reactivity and poor solubility are still limiting factors for their wider exploitation. Herein, we report a simple general synthesis of a new family of angularly fused acenoacenes with improved stability compared to their isoelectronic linear counterparts. The synthesis and comprehensive characterization of pentacenopentacene, pentacenohexacene and hexacenohexacene, with lengths between decacene and dodecacene, are disclosed.</dc:description>

         <title>Poloxometalates&#8208;based Semi&#8208;flexible Metal&#8208;semiconductor Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Low Frequency and Small Amplitude Mechanical Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost durable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is essential for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. Many organic polymer friction materials used widely have  thermal stability  problems  , which makes TENGs with semiconductors  as friction materials stand out. Here, we report a semi&#8208;flexible TENG based on metal and TiO 2  modified by polyoxometalates (POMs) as pure inorganic friction materials. Six different POMs are firstly selected to modify the friction materials of TENGs, and the output performance of TENGs with different POMs&#8208;modified semiconductors and different metals as friction materials are tested. Compared with the unmodified TENGs, the open&#8208;circuit voltage ( V OC  ) of the optimal Ag&#8208;K 6  P 2  Mo 18  O 62  (P 2  Mo 18  )/TiO 2  TENG device is increased by more than 4 times,  which is mainly attributed to the strong electron&#8208;accepting and storage capabilities of POMs.  This study has demonstrated that TENGs modified by POMs have potential application prospects and provided a new method for increasing the electrical output of TENGs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Dimeric Capsules with Appended Spiropyran Units: Towards Controlled Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of unprecedented tetra&#8208;urea derivatives of calix[4]arene and calix[4]pyrrole containing four spiropyran (SP) units at their upper rim. We investigate the photo&#8208; and acid&#8208;induced isomerization of the monomeric and homo&#8208;dimeric tetra&#8208;ureas derivatives using UV&#8208;Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopies. At micromolar concentration, irradiation of the samples with 365 nm light induces changes in their absorption spectra that are consistent with SP&#8594; merocyanine (MC) isomerization. However, analogous experiments at millimolar concentration do not produce noticeable changes in the 1H NMR spectra. The addition of triflic acid to micromolar and millimolar solutions of the tetra&#8208;ureas produces the quantitative isomerization of the SP units to the protonated merocyanine form (E&#8208;MCH+) and the simultaneous disassembly of the capsular dimers to form ill&#8208;defined aggregates. The neutralization of the acid solutions resets the SP form. Under these acid/base treatment conditions, the controlled release of the included guest and the reassembly of the all&#8208;SP tetra&#8208;urea dimers occurs at different extents depending on its calix[4]arene or calix[4]pyrrole scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Polymerization Mechanism in pH&#8208;regulated Supramolecular Fibers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amine functionalized C  3  &#8208;symmetric benzotrithiophene (BTT) monomer has been designed and synthetized in order to form pH responsive one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers in aqueous media. While most of the reported studies looked at the effect of pH on the size of the aggregates, herein we report a detailed mechanistic study carried out upon modifying the pH, triggering the formation of positively charged ammonium groups. A dramatic and reversible change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed and ascribed to the combination of Coulombic repulsive forces and higher monomer solubility. Furthermore, the induced frustrated growth of the fibers is further employed to finely control the one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerisation and copolymerization processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Erogorgiaene and the Pseudopterosin A&#8208;F Aglycone via Enantioselective Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrovinylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to their pronounced bioactivity and limited availability from natural resources, metabolites of the soft coral Pseudo&#172;pterogorgia elisabethae, such as erogorgiaene and the pseudo&#8211;pterosines, represent important target molecules for chemical synthesis. We have now developed a particularly short and efficient route towards these marine diterpenes exploiting an operationally convenient enantioselective cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydrovinylation as the chirogenic step. Other noteworthy C&#8208;C bond forming transformations include diastereoselective Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cyclizations, a Suzuki coupling and a carbonyl ene reaction. Starting from 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;styrene the anti&#8208;tubercular agent (+)&#8208;erogorgiaene (&gt;98% ee) was prepared in only 7 steps with 46% overall yield. In addition, the synthesis of the pseudopterosin A aglycone was achieved in 12 steps with 30% overall yield and, surprisingly, was found to exhibit a similar anti&#8208;inflammatory activity (inhibition of LPS&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B activation) as a natural mixture of pseudopterosins A&#8208;D or iso&#8208;pseudopterosin A, prepared by &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;xylosylation of the synthetic aglycone</dc:description>

         <title>Ready access to anhydrous anionic lanthanide acetates using imidazolium acetate ionic liquids as the reaction medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The access to lanthanide acetate coordination compounds is challenged by the tendency of lanthanides to coordinate water and the plethora of acetate coordination modes. We developed a straightforward, reproducible synthetic procedure by reaction of lanthanide chloride hydrates with defined ratios of the ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate ([C  2  mim][OAc]). This reaction pathway leads to two isostructural crystalline anhydrous coordination complexes, the polymeric [C  2  mim]  n  [{Ln  2  (OAc)  7  }  n  ] and the dimeric [C  2  mim]  2  [Ln  2  (OAc)  8  ], based on the ion size and the ratio of IL used. A reaction with an IL:Ln&#8208;salt ratio of 5:1 where Ln = Nd, Sm, and Gd led exclusively to the polymeric, whilst for the heaviest lanthanides (Dy&#8208;Lu) dimeric was observed. Reaction with Eu and Tb resulted in a mixture of both polymeric and dimeric forms. By increasing the amount of IL and/or the size of the cation, the reaction led to only the dimeric compound for all the lanthanide series. Crystallographic analyses of the resulting salts revealed three different types of metal&#8208;acetate coordination modes where  &#951;  2  &#956;&#954;  2  is the most represented both structure types.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical C&#8208;H Trifluoromethoxylation of (Hetero)arenes with Bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoromethoxylated (hetero)arenes are of great interest for several disciplines, especially in agro&#8208; and medicinal chemistry. Radical C&#8208;H trifluoromethoxylation of (hetero)arenes represents an attractive approach to prepare such compounds but the high cost and low atom economy of existing &#8226;OCF 3 radical sources makes them unsuitable for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of trifluoromethoxylated building blocks. Herein, we introduce bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP, CF 3 OOCF 3 ) as a practical and efficient trifluoromethoxylating reagent that is easily accessible from inexpensive bulk chemicals. Using either visible light photoredox or TEMPO catalysis, trifluoromethoxylated arenes could be prepared in good yields under mild conditions directly from unactivated aromatics. Moreover, TEMPO catalysis allowed for the one&#8208;step synthesis of valuable pyridine derivatives, which have been previously prepared via multi&#8208;step approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;conventional Behavior of a 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The titled 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole (  1  ) (i.e. ArP, where Ar = 2&#8208;(DippN=CH)C  6  H  4  , Dipp = 2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ) showed a spectacular reactivity behaving both as a reactive heterodiene in hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactions or as a hidden phosphinidene in the coordination toward selected transition metals (TMs). Thus,  1  reacts with electron&#8208;deficient alkynes RC&#8801;CR (R = CO  2  Me, C  5  F  4  N) giving 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;iminonaphthalenes  2  and  3  , that undergo hydrogen migration producing 1&#8208;phosphanaphthalenes  4  and  5  . Compound  1  is also able to activate the C=C double bond in selected  N  &#8208;alkyl/aryl&#8208;maleimides RN(C(O)CH)  2  (R = Me,  t  Bu, Ph) resulting in the addition products  7  &#8208;  9  with bridged bicyclic [2.2.1] structures. The binding of the maleimides to  1  is semi&#8208;reversible upon heating. By contrast, when  1  was treated with selected TM complexes, it serves as a 4  e  donor bridging two TMs thus producing complexes [  &#956;  &#8208;ArP(AuCl)  2  ] (  10  ), [(  &#956;  &#8208;ArP)  4  Ag  4  ][X]  4  (X = BF  4  (  11  ), OTf (  12  )) and [  &#956;  &#8208;ArP(Co  2  (CO)  6  )] (  13  ). The structure and electron distribution of the starting material  1  as well as of other compounds were also studied from the theoretical point of view.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihydroazulene&#8208;Azobenzene&#8208;Dihydroazulene Triad Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitch triads comprised of two dihydroazulene (DHA) units in conjugation to a central  trans&#8208;  azobenzene (AZB) unit were prepared in stepwise protocols starting from  meta  &#8208; and  para  &#8208;disubstituted azobenzenes. The  para  &#8208;connected triad had significantly altered optical properties and lacked the photoactivity of the separate photochromes. Instead, for the  meta  &#8208;connected triad all three photochromes could be photoisomerized to generate an isomer with two vinylheptafulvene (VHF) units and a  cis&#8208;  azobenzene unit. The photoisomerizations were studied by ultrafast spectroscopy, revealing a fast DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerization and a slower  trans  &#8208;to&#8208;  cis  AZB photoisomerization. This  meta  triad underwent thermal VHF&#8208;to&#8208;DHA back&#8208;conversions with a similar rate of all VHFs, independent of the identity of the neighboring units, and in parallel thermal  cis  &#8208;to&#8208;  trans  AZB conversion. The experimental observations were supported by computations (excitation spectra and orbital analysis of the transitions).</dc:description>

         <title>Contributions of Internal Atoms of Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters to Catalytic Performances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Every atom of a heterogeneous catalyst can play a direct or indirect role in its overall catalytic properties. However, it is extremely challenging to determine explicitly which atom(s) of a catalyst can dominantly contribute to its catalytic performance, because the observed performance usually reflects an ensemble average from all the atoms in the catalyst. The emergence of atomically precise metal nanoclusters brings unprecedented opportunities to address the above central issues, since the crystal structures of such nanoclusters have been solved and hence very fundamental understanding of nanocatalysis can be attained at an atomic level. This review focuses on recent efforts to reveal the contributions of the internal atoms or vacancies of the nanocluster catalysts to the catalytic processes, including that the catalytic activity can be dramatically changed by the central doping of a foreign atom; the catalytic activation and inactivation can be reversibly switched by shuttling the central atom into and out of nanoclusters; the evolution in catalytic activity can be driven by structural periodicity in the inner kernels of the nanoclusters. We anticipate that the progress in this research area could represent a novel conceptual framework for understanding the crucial roles of internal atoms of the catalysts in tuning the catalytic properties.</dc:description>
