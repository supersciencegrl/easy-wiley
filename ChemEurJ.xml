         <title>Dipole&#8208;Transmissive 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions for the Rapid Construction of Polycyclic N&#8208;Heterocycles: Synthetic and Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The investigation of distinctive dipole&#8208;transmissive dipolar cycloaddition (DTDC) methodology and the formalisation of this concept is reported. A DTDC procedure was able to be developed by taking advantage of the structural complementarity of azide and diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipoles. Intramolecular azide&#8208;alkene 1,3&#8208;DCs followed by spontaneous dipole transmission upon work&#8208;up furnished intermediate a&#8208;diazoisoindole and a&#8208;diazoisoquinoline substrates bearing the key secondary diazoalkane 1,3&#8208;dipole. N&#8208;Derivatisation of the intermediate a&#8208;diazoisoindole and a&#8208;diazoisoquinolines with a tethered secondary dipolarophile followed by a subsequent 1,3&#8208;DC allowed for rapid construction of a range of functionalised polycyclic N&#8208;heterocycles. Integrated experimental and theoretical studies established requirements for product formation and revealed the likely mechanistic basis of divergent reactivity observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Temperature&#8208;Gating and Ion Conductivity Control of Grafted Anodic Aluminum Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past few decades, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials have been widely applied to porous surfaces. Permeability and conductivity control of ions confined in nanochannels modified with stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, however, have been less investigated. In this work, we demonstrate the permeability and conductivity control of ions confined in nanochannels of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates modified with thermo&#8208;responsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes. By surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP), PNIPAM brushes are successfully grafted onto the hexagonally packed cylindrical nanopores of AAO templates. The surface hydrophilicities of the membranes can be reversibly altered because of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior of the PNIPAM polymer brushes. From electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, the temperature&#8208;gating behaviors of the AAO&#8208;g&#8208;PNIPAM membranes exhibit larger impedance changes than those of the pure AAO membranes at higher temperatures because of the aggregation of the grafted PNIPAM chains. The reversible surface properties caused by the extended and collapsed states of the polymer chains are also demonstrated by dye release tests. The smart thermo&#8208;gated and ion&#8208;controlled nanoporous membranes are suitable for future smart membrane applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfide&#8208;Directed Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Vinylic sp2 and Benzylic sp3&#8197;C&#8722;H Activation for the Construction of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Medium&#8208;Ring System</title>

         <dc:description>
Thio&#8208;directed sp2 and sp3&#8197;C&#8722;H activation is a new strategy for the construction of a sulfur&#8208;containing medium&#8208;ring system. Cationic Ir&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation to alkynes gave dihydrobenzothiepines and dibenzo[b,f]thiepines.







Abstract
Ir&#8208;catalyzed transformations initiated by sulfur&#8208;directed vinylic sp2 and benzylic sp3&#8197;C&#8722;H activation are disclosed that achieve the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered systems. Allyl 2&#8208;alkynylphenyl sulfides were transformed into dihydrobenzothiepines in 30&#8211;95&#8201;% yield, and 2&#8208;alkynylaryl 2&#8208;tolyl sulfides were converted into dibenzo[b,f]thiepines in 57&#8211;95&#8201;% yield along with double bond isomerization. In both reactions, the combination of Ir catalyst and sulfide moiety was a key to the facile cyclization.

         <title>Azide&#8208;Substituted 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolium Salts as Useful Synthetic Synthons: Access to Triazenyl Radicals and Staudinger Type Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azide&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts are useful synthetic synthons for a range of follow&#8208;up chemistry including the synthesis of triazenyl&#8208;based radicals. Mesoionic carbenes play a crucial role in the stabilization of these radicals.







Abstract
Mesoionic carbenes (MIC) are a popular class of compound that are heavily investigated at the moment. The access to cationic MICs, and the ability of MICs to stabilize radicals are two highly attractive fields that have hardly been explored until now. Here the synthesis and characterisation of three different cationic azide&#8208;substituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazolium salts, used as building blocks for studying their reactivity towards triphenylphosphine are reported, where the reactivity is dependent on the nature of the starting triazolium salt. Furthermore, the cationic triazolium salts were used to develop a series of unsymmetrical MIC&#8208;triazene&#8208;NHC/MIC&#8217; compounds, which can be readily converted to the radical form either by electrochemical or chemical methods. These radicals, which display NIR electrochromism, were investigated using a battery of techniques such as electrochemistry, UV/Vis/NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry, and theoretical calculations. Interestingly, the MIC plays an important role in the stabilization of the triazenyl radical, particularly in a competitive role vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis their NHC counterparts. These results shed new light on the ability of MICs to stabilize radicals, and possibly also on their &#960;&#8208;accepting ability.

         <title>Stability of Catalytic Centres in Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution by Di&#8208; and Oligonuclear Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic water reduction: This review is focused on the catalytically active metal centre for photocatalytic water reduction and summarizes the main decomposition pathways turning a molecular photocatalyst into a heterogeneous, colloid&#8208;based catalytic system. Moreover, strategies to obtain molecularly operating oligonuclear photocatalysts are presented.







Abstract
A review. In recent decades, mimicking natural photosynthesis by artificial photocatalysis represented a major research direction with the ultimate goal of reducing fossil fuel consumption through efficient solar energy harvesting. To transfer molecular photocatalysis from the lab scale to an industrially relevant process, it is important to overcome instability problems of the catalysts during light&#8208;driven operation. As it is well&#8208;known that many of the typically utilized noble metal&#8208;based catalytic centres (e.&#8201;g. Pt and Pd) undergo particle formation during (photo)catalysis and thus switch the whole process from a homogeneous into a heterogeneous one, an understanding of the factors governing particle formation is crucially needed. The review therefore focuses on di&#8208; and oligonuclear photocatalysts bearing a range of different bridging ligand architectures for drawing structure&#8208;catalyst&#8208;stability relationships in light&#8208;driven intramolecular reductive catalysis. In addition, ligand effects at the catalytic centre and their implications for catalytic activity in intermolecular systems will be discussed, as will important insights into the future design of operationally stable catalysts.

         <title>Accelerated Solid Phase Glycan Synthesis: ASGS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and efficient: High shear stirring accelerates glycan synthesis on solid support and enables efficient and fast glycosylation that competes even with glycosyl donor hydrolysis in an open vessel.







Abstract
Solid phase synthesis is the most dominant approach for the preparation of biological oligomers as it enables the introduction of monomers iteratively. Accelerated solid phase synthesis of biological oligomers is crucial for chemical biology, but its application to the synthesis of oligosaccharides is not trivial. Solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide assembly is a slow process performed in a variety of conditions and temperatures, requires an inert gas atmosphere, and demands high excess of glycosyl donors. The process is done in special synthesizers and poor mixing of the solid support increases the risk of diffusion&#8208;independent hydrolysis of the activated donors. High shear stirring is a new way to accelerate solid phase synthesis. The efficient mixing ensures that reactive intermediates can diffuse faster to the solid support thereby increasing the kinetics of the reactions. We report here a stirring&#8208;based accelerated solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide synthesis. We harnessed high shear mixing to perform diffusion&#8208;dependent glycosylation in a short reaction time. We minimized the use of glycosyl donors and the need to use an inert atmosphere. We showed that by tailoring the deprotection and glycosylation conditions to the same temperature, assembly steps are performed continuously, and full glycosylation cycles are completed in minutes.

         <title>Construction of Ternary Bismuth&#8208;Based Heterojunction by Using (BiO)2CO3 as Electron Bridge for Highly Efficient Degradation of Phenol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;scheme Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction was fabricated. It exhibited excellent photocatalytic performances for phenol degradation, which was ascribed to the formation of a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction, and the presence of (BiO)2CO3 that performed as an electron bridge to enable the migration distance of photogenerated electron from ECB of Bi2O3 to EVB of Bi2MoO6 to be shortened, greatly promoting the efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs.







Abstract
Inspired by nature, it has been considered an effective approach to design artificial photosynthetic system by fabricating Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts to eliminate environmental issues and alleviate the global energy crisis. However, the development of low cost, environment&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;efficient photocatalysts by utilizing solar energy still confronts huge challenge. Herein, we constructed a Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6 ternary heterojunction via a facile solvothermal method and calcination approach and used it as a photocatalyst for the degradation of phenol. The optimized Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction delivers a considerable activity for phenol photodegradation with an impressive removal efficiency of 98.8&#8201;% and about total organic carbon (TOC) of 68&#8201;% within 180&#8197;min under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The excellent photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the formation of a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction, more importantly, the presence of (BiO)2CO3 as an electron bridge greatly shortens the migration distance of photogenerated electron from ECB of Bi2O3 to EVB of Bi2MoO6, thus prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated electrons, which is verified by trapping experiments, electron spin&#8208;resonance spectroscopy (ESR) results, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a potential strategy to fabricate highly efficient Bi&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts with wide application prospects in solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion and environmental protection.

         <title>Cyanine&#8208; and Rhodamine&#8208;Derived Alkynes for the Selective Targeting of Cancerous Mitochondria via Radical Thiol&#8208;Yne Coupling in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite their long history and their synthetic potential underlined by various recent advances, radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling reactions have so far only rarely been exploited for the functionalization of biomolecules, and no examples yet exist for their application in live cells &#8208; although natural thiols show widespread occurrence therein. By taking advantage of the particular cellular conditions of mitochondria in cancer cells, we herein demonstrate that radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling represents a powerful reaction principle for the selective targeting of these organelles. Within our studies, fluorescently labelled reactive alkyne probes were investigated, whereat the fluorescent moiety was chosen to enable both mitochondria accumulation as well as highly sensitive detection. After preliminary studies under cell&#8208;free conditions the most promising alkyne&#8208;dye conjugates were evaluated in various cellular experiments comprising analysis by flow cytometry and microscopy. All in all, these results pave the way for improved future therapeutic strategies relying on live&#8208;cell compatibility and selectivity among cellular compartments.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Small yet brightly emitting fluorophores should find fundamental and practical applications in both academic and industrial settings. Herein, we report tetrahydrobenzodifuran as the core architecture to create novel single&#8208;benzene fluorophores. The key for realizing unique and powerful photophysical properties is the combination of the construction of symmetrical push&#8208;pull motifs and the restriction of bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause non&#8208;radiative transitions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 family of proteins is central to the regulation of signaling pathways driven by serine/threonine kinases. In humans, 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 consists of seven highly conserved isoforms, yet the function of each isoform remains to be fully elucidated. Synthetic agents capable of isoform&#8208;specific fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 would provide a useful tool for studying in depth the biological roles of isoforms. In this study, we focused on the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3sigma isoform, which possesses a unique Cys38, and designed a natural product&#8208;based fluorescent labeling agent by introducing an acrylamide group and a fluorescent dye to fusicoccin (FC). In vitro evaluation demonstrated that 12&#8208;hydroxy 1 and 2 exhibit 4&#8208;3&#8208;3sigma&#160;selective labeling activity over 14&#8208;3&#8208;3z in the presence of a mode&#8208;3 phospholigand. Furthermore, 2 was shown to label 14&#8208;3&#8208;3sigma&#160;in cell lysate in the presence of a C&#8208;terminal mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide derived from ERalpha, with no apparent nonspecific labeling. These results indicate that 2 is capable of selective fluorescent detection of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3sigma upon binding to mode&#8208;3 phospholigand under biologically relevant conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) based on pillar[n]arene are widely studied and it&#8217;s known evolution from linear polymers to SPNs occurs as a progressive process, which is of importance to monitor the detailed morphology throughout the process.

Herein, we introduced a fluorescent group of the pyrene benzohydrazonate&#8208;based (PBHZ&#8208;based) derivative into the pillar[5]arene based SPNs gained from host&#8208;guest recognition, enabling the visual monitoring during the formation of SPNs. The whole visual detection was based on the fluorescence color transition ranging from blue to green relying on the gradual aggregated PBHZ molecules upon the increasing cross&#8208;linking degree. Besides, the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of this SPNs was confirmed that increasing the temperature or adding a reducing agent would reduce the cross&#8208;linking degree.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanopore Deciphering Single Digital Polymers Towards High&#8208;Density Data Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging nanopore techniques have been validated as the promising low&#8208;cost analytical and sequencing methods towards practical applications of high&#8208;density polymer data storage. This concept discusses the nanopore&#8208;based data storage systems based on polymer sequences and DNA nanostructures, and highlights the advances in nanopore processing and decoding of information stored in man&#8208;made polymers containing unnatural monomer units.







Abstract
Sequence&#8208;defined polymer is one of the most promising alternative media for high&#8208;density data storage. It could be used to alleviate the problem of insufficient storage capacity of conventional silicon&#8208;based devices for the explosively increasing data. To fulfil the goal of polymer data storage, suitable methods should be developed to accurately read and decode the information&#8208;containing polymers, especially for those composed by a combination of the natural and unnatural monomers. Nanopore&#8208;based approaches have become one of the most competitive analysis and sequencing techniques, which are expected to read both natural and synthetic polymers with single&#8208;molecule precision and monomeric resolution. Herein, this work emphasizes the advances being made in nanopore reading and decoding of information stored in the man&#8208;made polymers and DNA nanostructures, and discusses the challenges and opportunities towards the development and realization of high&#8208;density data storage.

         <title>Progress of Azametallacyclopentadienes in the New Century</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article summarizes the progress of azametallacyclopentadienes towards their generated methods, structural characterization, intrinsic reactivity, and application in the heterocyclic synthesis since the new century.







Abstract
As the key intermediates in metal&#8208;promoted/catalyzed C&#8722;C bond coupling reactions of nitriles and alkynes, azametallacyclopentadienes, M(N=CR1&#8722;CR2=CR3), are an important class of azametallacycles. Although the first authentic azametallacyclopentadienes were documented in 1986, their chemistry towards solid&#8208;state structures, intrinsic reactivity, and synthetic application was rarely investigated for a long time. At the beginning of this century, seminal works about the applications of azametallacyclopentadienes in the synthesis of heterocycles, including multi&#8208;substituted pyridines, isoquinolines, furans, and pyrroles were reported. Subsequently, a series of new complexes with this motif, namely the Group 4, aluminum, actinide, and rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes were isolated and structurally characterized. Among them, the rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadiene expresses high reactivity towards unsaturated molecules, such as nitriles, isocyanides, and Mo(CO)6 to provide novel fused metallacycles. In this Concept, we reviewed the advances in the preparation, reactivity, and synthetic application of azametallacyclopentadienes in the past twenty years.

         <title>Pro&#8208;aromaticity Enabled Dealkenylative Functionalizations via Photo&#8208;Excitation and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>

Dealkenylative Giese&#8208;type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci&#8208;type alkylation, copper&#8208;catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, have been achieved on olefin&#8208;containing substrates in a one&#8208;pot and highly modular fashion.







Abstract
A general and practical approach for diverse dealkenylative functionalization of olefin&#8208;containing substrates has been developed through the one&#8208;pot formation and utilization of pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines using tetrazine as the key cycloaddition reagent. Triggered by either excitation or oxidation, the targeted C&#8722;C bonds in the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazine intermediates could be readily cleaved to generate alkyl radicals for subsequent transformations. Diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bond forming protocols, including Giese&#8208;type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci&#8208;type alkylation, copper&#8208;catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, are achieved in a highly modular fashion.

         <title>Fully Tin&#8208;Coated Coinage Metal Ions: A Pincer&#8208;Type Bis&#8208;stannylene Ligand for Exclusive Tetrahedral Complexation</title>

Tin shines better with gold or silver: A luminescent pincer&#8208;type bis&#8208;stannylene ligand for exclusive tetrahedral coordination of the coinage metals was designed, and photoluminescence investigations as well as extensive quantum chemical calculations were carried out.







Abstract
The synthesis of a novel bis&#8208;stannylene pincer ligand and its complexation with coinage metals (CuI, AgI and AuI) are described. All coinage metal centres are in tetrahedral coordination environments in the solid state and are exclusively coordinated by four neutral SnII donors. 119Sn NMR provided information about the behaviour in solution. All of the isolated compounds have photoluminescent properties, and these were investigated at low and elevated temperatures. Compared to the free bis&#8208;stannylene ligand, coordination to coinage metals led to an increase in the luminescence intensity. The new compounds were investigated in detail through all&#8208;electron relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;triggered Disassembly of Organic Cationic Nanorods Produces a Cysteine Protease Mimic (Miravet et&#8197;al.)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triggered disassembly of nanorods produces an effective enzyme mimic, a process related to complex biological systems as cyclic AMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase. An insoluble cysteine protease mimic precursor is incorporated into soluble cationic rods in the presence of cationic surfactants. Reduction of the disulfide unit provokes rod disassembly and generation of a cysteine protease mimic, producing an extraordinary acceleration of PNPA hydrolysis.







Abstract
The emergence of catalytic activity associated with a disassembly process is reported, reminiscent of complex biological systems. A cystine derivative with pendant imidazole groups self&#8208;assembles into cationic nanorods in the presence of the cationic surfactants cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Disulfide reduction triggers nanorod disassembly and the generation of a simple cysteine protease mimic, which shows a dramatically improved catalytic efficiency in the hydrolysis of p&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA).

         <title>A Novel Electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 for Ultrasensitive Detection of Chloramphenicol: Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 was designed and synthesized for chloramphenicol (CAP) detection. An ultra&#8208;low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2&#8197;nM was achieved by Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 and its loading mechanism was investigated in theory and experiment.







Abstract
Ultrasensitive electrochemical detection on hazardous substances like antibiotics and pesticides is essential but still challenging in rapid test technology. Herein, the first electrode using highly conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HCMOFs) for electrochemical detection of chloramphenicol is proposed. The design of electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 with ultra&#8208;sensitivity in detection of chloramphenicol is demonstrated by loading Pd onto HCMOFs. An ultra&#8208;low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2&#8197;nM (64.6&#8197;pg/mL) was observed for these materials, which is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude lower than the other reported materials for chromatographic detection. Moreover, the proposed HCMOFs showed long&#8208;time stability over 24&#8197;h. The superior detection sensitivity can be attributed to the high conductivity of Ni3(HITP)2, and the large Pd loading. The experimental characterizations and computational investigation determined the Pd loading mechanism in Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2, revealing PdCl2 adsorption on the abundant adsorption sites of Ni3(HITP)2. The proposed electrochemical sensor design using HCMOFs was demonstrated to be both effective and efficient, showing that the adoption of HCMOFs decorated with other effective electrocatalysts, which combine high conductivity and high catalytic activity, is of great advantage for ultrasensitive detection.

We have reported discovered pentafluorophenol to be an effective catalyst for the Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction, which synthesizes to synthesize (spirocyclic) tetrahydro &#946; carbolines. This simple catalytic methodology uses features mild conditions to generate high yields of indole alkaloids to produce indole alkaloids in high yield with remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage modifications. This strategy demonstrates a practical approach for synthesizing to the synthesis of the natural alkaloid Komavine on a gram&#8208;scale, as well as the synthesis of the commercial drug Tadalafil.

Herein, we have disclosed pentafluorophenol as an operative catalyst for synthesizing (spirocyclic) tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines via the Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. This straightforward catalytic protocol works under mild conditions resulting indole alkaloids in excellent yield with remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage modifications. This transformation demonstrates a practical and adaptable approach to produce a highly effective gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the natural alkaloid Komavine and enables the synthesis of the commercial drug Tadalafil.

A fluorinated DSA derivative with two crystalline polymorphs and a nanocrystal were developed to explore the tricolor luminescence switching properties. One of the polymorphs exhibits rarely seen F&#8230;F interactions in its crystalline arrangement. On solvent fuming, the ground polymorphic crystals restored to a much more blue&#8208;shifted thermodynamically stable state, nearly identical to the nanocrystals developed at aggregating conditions.







Abstract
A fluorinated distyrylanthracene (DSA) derivative, 9, 10&#8208;bis((E)&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styryl)anthracene abbreviated as 4FDSA with two crystalline polymorphs (4FDSA&#8208;G (green emission) and 4FDSA&#8208;O (orange emission)), showing remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission and mechanofluorochromic characteristics, was developed. One of the polymorphs in its crystalline arrangement exhibits the hardly seen F&#8230;F interactions. It questions the conventional belief of the non&#8208;polarisable nature of fluorine atoms in forming the halogen bond. The twisted molecular conformation facilitated by the various supramolecular interactions resulted in the formation of another intensely emissive bluer nanocrystal (4FDSA&#8208;NC) at aggregating conditions. Even though, the both polymorphs show distinct tricolor luminescence switching on the action of mechanical force, fumigation of ground crystals with solvent vapor resulted in the formation of a more thermodynamically favorable 4FDSA&#8208;NC form. The work demonstrates the effect of supramolecular interactions assisted conformational changes in tuning the unique mechanofluorochromic characteristics of the polymorphic crystals.

         <title>Detection of Large Genomic RNA via DNAzyme&#8208;Mediated RNA Cleavage and Rolling Circle Amplification: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8201;as a Model</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double screening: A new method is reported for rapid, amplified detection of large genomic RNA using SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as a model. The double screening method first parses a large set of DNAzymes to those that mediate efficient RNA cleavage and then screens the best DNAzymes for effective coupling to rolling circle amplification.







Abstract
A new method for the detection of genomic RNA combines RNA cleavage by the 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme and use of the cleavage fragments as primers to initiate rolling circle amplification (RCA). 230 different 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme variants were screened to identify those that target accessible RNA sites within the highly structured RNA transcripts of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. A total of 28 DNAzymes were identified with &gt;20&#8201;% cleavage, 5 with &gt;40&#8201;% cleavage and one with &gt;60&#8201;% in 10&#8197;min. The cleavage fragments from these reactions were then screened for coupling to an RCA reaction, leading to the identification of several cleavage fragments that could efficiently initiate RCA. Using a newly developed quasi&#8208;exponential RCA method with a detection limit of 500 aM of RNA, 14 RT&#8208;PCR positive and 15 RT&#8208;PCR negative patient saliva samples were evaluated for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA, achieving a clinical sensitivity of 86&#8201;% and specificity of 100&#8201;% for detection of the virus in &lt;2.5&#8197;h.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Double screening&lt;/b&gt;: A new method is reported for rapid, amplified detection of large genomic RNA using SARS-CoV-2 as a model. The double screening method first parses a large set of DNAzymes to those that mediate efficient RNA cleavage and then screens the best DNAzymes for effective coupling to rolling circle amplification.

         <title>Structurally Ordered PtNi Intermetallic Nanoparticles as Efficient and Stable Cathode Catalysts for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered intermetallic PtNi nanoparticles loaded on graphited carbon were synthesized using a facile method. The ORR performance can be significantly improved via turning the element distribution of PtNi intermetallic compounds catalysts into ordered structure by high temperature annealing. Benefiting from a highly graphitized carbon support with excellent corrosion resistance, the obtained ordered catalysts with Pt loading of 27.6&#8201;% exhibit higher activity and better durability toward ORR than commercial Pt/C, which have been verified in both RDE test and single cell test.







Abstract
Exploring oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts with superior electrochemical performance and long&#8208;term stability is crucial to the development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, graphited carbon with high specific surface area was obtained under relatively low temperature using Ni catalyst, then ordered nanoparticles (NPs) PtNi catalysts attaching to graphited carbon were synthesized via polyol reduction and thermal treatment. Benefiting from graphitized carbon support and appropriate order degree, PtNi/GC&#8208;700 NPs catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic ORR performance with specific and mass activities as high as 2.8&#8208;fold and 3.7&#8208;fold of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. Besides, the as&#8208;prepared PtNi/GC&#8208;700 catalyst exhibits superior stability with negligible degradation after 10000 potential cycles, due to its ordered chemical structure. The work described herein highlights the potential of structurally ordered electrocatalysts for efficient and durable fuel cell cathodic catalysts.

         <title>Mechanism and Origins of Site&#8208;Selectivity of Template&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Insertion of Quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not so simple: Modern computational chemistry (DFT on reaction coordinates, extensive conformational searches, multiple means of treating entropy) has been used to probe the mechanism of a complex organometallic reaction &#8211; template&#8208;directed C&#8722;H insertion of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters into quinoline &#8211; providing a deep dive into the origins of site selectivity and demonstrating that previous simple models are not sufficient.







Abstract
The template&#8208;directed C&#8722;H insertion of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters into quinoline was interrogated by using computational quantum chemistry. An energetically viable mechanism for this complex multistep transformation was elucidated, with attention paid throughout to conformational flexibility and alternative ligand binding modes. The selectivity was found to correlate with distortion from a tetrahedral geometry for the carbon atom involved in C&#8722;H insertion, a parameter that can be applied to future template design.

         <title>Marigold Flower&#8208;Shaped Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Supported Manganese Vanadium Oxide Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reactions in an Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Marigold flower&#8208;shaped metal&#8211;organic framework assisted manganese vanadium oxide was synthesized using a facile hydrothermal approach and employed as electrocatalysts for electrochemical water oxidation. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of MOF MnV oxide microflower toward O2 evolution processes are superior. Water electrolyzers based on MOF MnV oxide microflower catalyst are comparable to those based on commercial IrO2 catalysts.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process in many renewable energy systems. The development of low&#8208;cost, long&#8208;lasting alternatives to precious&#8208;metal catalysts, particularly functional electrocatalysts with high activity for OER processes, is crucial for reducing the operating expense and complexity of renewable energy generating systems. This work describes a concise method for generating marigold flower&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) aided manganese vanadium oxide via a hydrothermal procedure for increased OER activity. As synthesized MOF MnV oxide has a higher surface area due to the 3D flower&#8208;like structure, which is reinvented with enhanced electrocatalytic active sites. These distinctive structural features result in remarkable catalytic activity for MOF MnV oxide microflowers towards OER with a low overpotential of 310&#8197;mV at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope with only 51.4&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in alkaline conditions. This study provides a concise method for developing an optimized catalytic material with greater morphology and beneficial features for potential energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Comprehensive Investigation of Anion Species in Crystalline Li+ ion Conductor Li27&#8722;x[P4O7+xN9&#8722;x]O3 (x&#8776;1.9(3))</title>

         <dc:description>
The structure of the crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li27&#8722;x[P4O7+xN9&#8722;x]O3 contains three different anions, namely [PO2N2]5&#8722;, [PO3N]4&#8722;, and O2&#8722;. It was comprehensively investigated by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron powder diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. A total ionic conductivity of 6.6&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which is similar to that of amorphous a&#8208;LiPON was determined with impedance spectroscopy.







Abstract
The Li+ ion conductor Li27&#8722;x[P4O7+xN9&#8722;x]O3 (x&#8776;1.9) has been synthesized from P3N5, Li3N and Li2O in a Ta ampoule at 800&#8201;&#176;C under Ar atmosphere. The cubic compound crystallizes in space group 
 with a=12.0106(14) &#197; and Z=4. It contains both non&#8208;condensed [PO2N2]5&#8722; and [PO3N]4&#8722; tetrahedra as well as O2&#8722; ions, surrounded by Li+ ions. Charge neutrality is achieved by partial occupancy of Li positions, which was refined with neutron powder diffraction data. Measurements of the partial ionic and electronic conductivity show a total ionic conductivity of 6.6&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with an activation energy of 0.46&#177;0.02&#8197;eV and a bulk ionic conductivity of 4&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, which is close to the ionic conductivity of amorphous lithium nitridophosphate. This makes Li27&#8722;x[P4O7+xN9&#8722;x]O3 an interesting candidate for investigation of structural factors affecting ionic conductivity in lithium oxonitridophosphates.

&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;9&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#8776;1.9) has been synthesized from P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in a Ta ampoule at 800&#8201;&#176;C under Ar atmosphere. The cubic compound crystallizes in space group 
 with &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;=12.0106(14) &#197; and Z=4. It contains both non-condensed [PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;5&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedra as well as O&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions, surrounded by Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Charge neutrality is achieved by partial occupancy of Li positions, which was refined with neutron powder diffraction data. Measurements of the partial ionic and electronic conductivity show a total ionic conductivity of 6.6&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an activation energy of 0.46&#177;0.02&#8197;eV and a bulk ionic conductivity of 4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#8201;&#176;C, which is close to the ionic conductivity of amorphous lithium nitridophosphate. This makes Li&lt;sub&gt;27&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;[P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;9&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; an interesting candidate for investigation of structural factors affecting ionic conductivity in lithium oxonitridophosphates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of a Diverse Range of Boron Heterocycles via Ring Expansion of a Carboranyl&#8208;Substituted 9&#8208;Borafluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring expansion of a carboranyl&#8208;substituted 9&#8208;borafluorene with unsaturated substrates provides easy access to a range of boraheterocyclic products containing six&#8208;, seven&#8208;, and eight&#8208;membered rings. Compared to known aryl&#8208; and halogen&#8208;substituted borafluorene derivatives, the study shows that the electron&#8208;withdrawing carboranyl substituent leads to more facile and more selective insertion reactions.







Abstract
Direct insertion of unsaturated substrates into a five&#8208;membered borole ring is a useful method to obtain valuable heterocycles containing one or more three&#8208;coordinate boron atoms. A highly Lewis acidic 9&#8208;o&#8208;carboranyl&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene, in which the o&#8208;carboranyl substituent is connected via one of the cluster carbon atoms to the boron atom of the 9&#8208;borafluorene unit, was found to react with a vast array of unsaturated molecules, such as alkynes, aldehydes and various organic azides, to form larger boraheterocyclic products. The ring expansion reactions of the central borole ring proceed rapidly at room temperature, cementing the role of the o&#8208;carboranyl substituent in enhancing the insertion reactivity of 9&#8208;borafluorenes.

         <title>Isomerization of DASA Molecules in the Nanopores of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: What Determines Its Reversibility?
</title>

         <dc:description>
Isomerization reversibility of visible&#8208;light responsive donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts in nanopores of metal&#8211;organic frameworks is strongly dependent on the polarity of their pore environment. In low polar MIL&#8208;53(Al), proton conductivity as high as 0.013 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and at least 30 switching cycles are achieved under visible light at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% RH.







Abstract
In recent years, light&#8208;responsive molecules have been incorporated in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to fabricate light&#8208;responsive intelligent devices, where reversible isomerization of the guest molecules in the nanopores is crucial. However, how to design a porous environment of MOFs to achieve a reversible isomerization remains unknown until now. In this work, donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs), a new kind of visible light responsive compound, were confined in the nanopores of different MOFs to study their isomerization upon visible&#8208;light irradiation/mild heating. We found that the polarity of the pore environment is the key to control the reversibility of isomerization of such guest molecules. Under the guidance of this principle, MIL&#8208;53(Al) was screened to investigate the proton conductivity and switching performance of the DASA&#8208;confined MOF. The proton conductance was up to 0.013 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% RH, and at least 30 switching cycles were achieved thanks to the Grotthuss&#8208;type mechanism and the low polarity of MIL&#8208;53(Al) pore environment.

         <title>Benzopyrano&#8208;Fused Phenanthridine&#8208;Based Columnar Mesogens: Synthesis, Self&#8208;organization and Charge&#8208;Transport Properties</title>

Novel heteroaromatic, elliptical dimers self&#8208;assembling into rarely observed columnar oblique mesophase have been synthesized. The derivatives were found to exhibit good ambipolar charge transport properties and the dimers are highly fluorescent, displaying interesting optical properties.







Abstract
Columnar mesogens constitute a fascinating class of supramolecular nano&#8208;architectures owing to the exceptional properties induced by their self&#8208;assembling behavior. Extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugated core in such systems by incorporating heteroatoms extensively influences their mesomorphic, photophysical properties, etc., presenting them as potential candidates for optoelectronic applications. In the present work, a series of novel nitrogen and oxygen&#8208;incorporated chromenonaphthophenanthridine&#8208;based elliptical dimers have been synthesized through tandem Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization followed by ipso&#8208;aromatic substitution in one&#8208;pot. Mesophase characterization has been carried out by employing POM, DSC, and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Photophysical properties were investigated using UV&#8208;vis and emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, the charge transport properties were analyzed by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight measurements, and the observed ambipolar mobilities were found to be of the order of 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The high solubility, excellent thermal stability, self&#8208;organizing properties, and ambipolar charge transport characteristics make them promising candidates for applications in organic electronics.

Perovskite&#8208;like: A new MA3Bi2I9 photo&#8208;catalyst for the production of hydrogen using photo&#8208;catalysis is described. The MA3Bi2I9 photo&#8208;catalyst is eco&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;effective for the production of hydrogen. The structural properties of the MA3Bi2I9 photo&#8208;catalyst were determined by XRD and SEM. The MA3Bi2I9 photo&#8208;catalyst showed excellent photo&#8208;catalytic properties for the generation of hydrogen.







Abstract
In this study, a highly air stable and eco&#8208;friendly methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9) perovskite&#8208;like material has been prepared. After physiochemical characterizations, the synthesized MA3Bi2I9 was utilized as photo&#8208;catalyst towards hydrogen production. It is important to design and synthesize lead (Pb)&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;like material (MA3Bi2I9) for photo&#8208;catalytic hydrogen&#8208;production applications. The synthesized MA3Bi2I9 exhibits excellent photo&#8208;catalytic hydrogen generation with a production rate of 11.43&#8197;&#956;molg&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. In the presence of a platinum co&#8208;catalyst, the hydrogen production rate further increases to 172.44&#8197;&#956;molg&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The MA3Bi2I9 photo&#8208;catalyst also demonstrates excellent cyclic stability.

The MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; photo-catalyst showed excellent photo-catalytic properties for the generation of hydrogen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, a highly air stable and eco-friendly methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskite-like material has been prepared. After physiochemical characterizations, the synthesized MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; was utilized as photo-catalyst towards hydrogen production. It is important to design and synthesize lead (Pb)-free perovskite-like material (MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;) for photo-catalytic hydrogen-production applications. The synthesized MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits excellent photo-catalytic hydrogen generation with a production rate of 11.43&#8197;&#956;molg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In the presence of a platinum co-catalyst, the hydrogen production rate further increases to 172.44&#8197;&#956;molg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; photo-catalyst also demonstrates excellent cyclic stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Lewis Pairs Yield Diradicaloids and Enable Modular Control of the Diradical Character</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diradicaloid silicon oxolene salts are accessed through Lewis acid&#8208;base pairing of bis(catecholato)silanes with salts of dihydroxybenzoquinone. The features of the catecholates and the dihydroxybenzoquinone linker (electron donor or acceptor ability) control the diradical character of the adducts in a rational way.







Abstract
Stable metal&#8208;free diradicaloids are fascinating compounds, typically based on covalent polycyclic or nitrogen&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated frameworks. Unfortunately, their preparation and the modulation of their diradical character require substantial synthetic efforts. The present work introduces a synthetic approach to diradicaloids by the ease and modularity of Lewis pair formation. Binding redox&#8208;active bis(catecholato)silane Lewis acids to ditopic tetraoxolene Lewis bases yields adducts with varying spin ground states. Computational analyses disclose that the diradical character increases with the electron donor ability of the catechols and the electron accepting ability of the tetraoxolene. Hence, this protocol grants access to diradicaloids with rationally adjustable diradical character of high potential for numerous applications in a single step.

         <title>Control over Dethreading Kinetics Allows Evaluating the Entropy Stored in an Interlocked Molecular Machine Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium
</title>

         <dc:description>
A minimal model of an acid&#8208;base powered molecular machine is studied, gaining control on its dethreading kinetics by engineering its components. Leveraging solvent properties, we could monitor the relaxation of the molecular machine from a high energy state to equilibrium. By measuring the heat exchanged in this process, we could confirm experimentally that such systems have a significant entropy content.







Abstract
The operation of nanomachines is fundamentally different from that of their macroscopic counterparts. In particular, the role of solvent is critical yet rarely associated with machine functionality. Here, we study a minimal model of one of the most advanced molecular machines to gain control of its operation by engineering components and the employed solvent. Operation kinetics were changed over more than four orders of magnitude and could be modulated by solvent. Leveraging solvent properties, it was possible to monitor the relaxation of the molecular machine towards equilibrium and measure the heat exchanged in the process. Our work expands the capabilities of acid&#8208;base powered molecular machines, confirming experimentally that such systems have a dominant entropy content.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Induced Bathochromic Emission in Columnar Discotic Liquid Crystals Realized by Intramolecular Planarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission is achieved in columnar discotic liquid crystals realized by intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores during the phase transition from hexagonal columnar to isotropic phases.







Abstract
Most organic thermochromic fluorescent materials exhibit thermo&#8208;induced hypsochromic emission due to the formation of excimers in ordered molecular solids; however, it is still a challenge to endow them with bathochromic emission despite its significance in making up the field of thermochromism. Here, a thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission in columnar discotic liquid crystals is reported realized by intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores. A three&#8208;armed discotic molecule of dialkylamino&#8208;tricyanotristyrylbenzene was synthesized, which preferred to twist out of the core plane to accommodate ordered molecular stacking in hexagonal columnar mesophases, giving rise to bright green monomer emission. However, intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores occurred in isotropic liquid increasing the conjugation length, and as a result led to thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission from green to yellow light. This work reports a new concept in the thermochromic field and provides a novel strategy to achieve fluorescence tuning from intramolecular actions.

Catalytic depolymerization of ionic liquid&#8208;based biorefinery lignin over robust zirconium phosphate supported palladium catalyst.







Abstract
The efficient utilization of lignin, the direct source of renewable aromatics, into value&#8208;added renewable chemicals is an important step towards sustainable biorefinery practices. Nevertheless, owing to the random heterogeneous structure and limited solubility, lignin utilization has been primarily limited to burning for energy. The catalytic depolymerization of lignin has been proposed and demonstrated as a viable route to sustainable biorefinery, however, low yields and poor selectivity of products, high char formation, and limited to no recycling of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalyst involved in lignin depolymerization demands attention to enable practical&#8208;scale lignocellulosic biorefineries. In this study, we demonstrate the catalytic depolymerization of ionic liquid&#8208;based biorefinery poplar lignin into guaiacols over a reusable zirconium phosphate supported palladium catalyst. The essence of the study lies in the high conversion (&gt;80&#8201;%), minimum char formation (7&#8211;16&#8201;%), high yields of guaiacols (up to 200&#8197;mg / g of lignin), and catalyst reusability. Both solid residue, liquid stream, and gaseous products were thoroughly characterized using ICP&#8208;OES, PXRD, CHN analysis, GC&#8208;MS, GPC, and 2D&#8197;NMR to understand the hydrogenolysis pathway.

         <title>Precise Control of Dissipative Self&#8208;assembly by Light and Electricity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using light and electricity as two clean and spatiotemporally addressable fuels, we can precisely control dissipative self&#8208;assembly into various morphologies including asymmetric forms without altering the solution composition. Such precise control over supramolecular assemblies may find future applications in programming complex active materials as well as formulating pharmaceutical reagents with desired morphologies.







Abstract
Nature&#8208;inspired synthetic dissipative self&#8208;assemblies have attracted much attention recently. However, it remains a major challenge to achieve precise control over dissipative supramolecular assembly structures and functions of self&#8208;contained systems. Here we combine light and electricity as two clean, and spatiotemporally addressable fuels to provide precise control over the morphology for dissipative self&#8208;assembly of a perylene bisimide glycine (PBIg) building block in a self&#8208;contained solution. In this design, electrochemical oxidation provides the positive fuel to activate PBIg self&#8208;assembly while photoreduction supplies the negative fuel to deactivate the system for disassembly.

In addition, by exerting light and electrical dual fuels simultaneously, we could create an active homeostasis exhibiting dynamic instability, leading to morphological change to asymmetric assemblies with curvatures. Such precise control over self&#8208;assembly of self&#8208;contained systems may find future applications in programming complex active materials as well as formulating pharmaceutical reagents with desired morphologies.

&lt;p&gt;Nature-inspired synthetic dissipative self-assemblies have attracted much attention recently.

         <title>Design of Aurone&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;State Emissive (DSE) Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aurone derivatives were introduced as easily accessible dual&#8208;state emissive (DSE) fluorophores along with the description of molecular design principles. Facile one&#8208;step synthesis in combination with biological activities make DSE aurones unique tool for biomedical applications.







Abstract
The development of dual&#8208;state emissive (DSE) fluorophores, i.&#8201;e. organic molecules showing balanced emission in both solution and as molecular solids, has recently become an emerging approach in material science, biology, sensing, and optoelectronics. However, the majority of existing DSE fluorophores represents structural modifications of the scaffolds known for their aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, e.&#8201;g., tetraphenylethylenes (TFE), triphenylamines (TFA), and others. In this study, we introduce aurones as an easily accessible scaffold for the construction of DSE fluorophores and describe the main design principles allowing to achieve the balanced emission in both solution and solid state. Herein, we present the solid&#8208;state fluorescence in a systematic series of aurone derivatives for the first time. We propose that the newly found DSE properties of aurones in combination with their established biological activity can be applied efficiently in biomedical studies and diagnostic tools.

         <title>Highly E&#8208;Selective Olefin Synthesis Catalysed by Novel Quinoxalinone Photocatalyst under Visible Light Conditions</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient method for the synthesis of highly E&#8208;selective olefins directly utilizing alkyl boronic acids as radical precursors was developed, catalysed by novel quinoxalinone&#8208;type catalyst.







Abstract
In photo&#8208;induced olefin synthesis, the photocatalysts with high triplet energy could cause the isomerization of olefins. This study demonstrates a new quinoxalinone photocatalytic system for highly stereoselective alkenes preparation from alkenyl sulfones and alkyl boronic acids. Our photocatalyst could not convert the thermodynamically favored E&#8208;olefin to Z&#8208;olefin, guaranteeing the high E&#8208;configuration selectivity of the reaction. There is weak interaction between boronic acids and quinoxalinone according to NMR experiments, probably decreasing the oxidation potential of boronic acids. This system can be further extended to the allyl and alkynyl sulfones to give corresponding alkenes and alkynes.

         <title>Orbital Nature of Carboionic Monoradicals Made from Diradicals</title>

         <dc:description>
Monoradical cations and anions made by redox electron transfer on neutral diradicals and both with different sign charges stabilized in an identical &#960;&#8208;conjugated platform are understood from a dual perspective as provided by molecular orbital theory and valence bond theory. Their solid&#8208;state structures and optical properties as well as their validity for ambipolar charge transport are discussed.







Abstract
The electronic, optical, and solid state properties of a series of monoradicals, anions and cations obtained from starting neutral diradicals have been studied. Diradicals based on s&#8208;indacene and indenoacenes, with benzothiophenes fused and in different orientations, feature a varying degree of diradical character in the neutral state, which is here related with the properties of the radical redox forms. The analysis of their optical features in the polymethine monoradicals has been carried out in the framework of the molecular orbital and valence bond theories. Electronic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, X&#8208;ray solid&#8208;state diffraction and quantum chemical calculations have been carried out. Studies of the different positive&#8208;/negative&#8208;charged species, both residing in the same skeletal &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, are rare for organic molecules. The key factor for the dual stabilization is the presence of the starting diradical character that enables to indistinctively accommodate a pseudo&#8208;hole and a pseudo&#8208;electron defect with certainly small reorganization energies for ambipolar charge transport.

Deracemization of a solid solution: The deracemization of a racemic&#8208;compound&#8208;forming system by using the possibility of syncrystallization, that is the formation of solid solution, with a chemically related conglomerate&#8208;forming system has been demonstrated. Based on phase diagram study, three model compounds crystallizing as racemic compounds were deracemized this way giving the evidence of the concept.







Abstract
Deracemization extended to racemic&#8208;compound&#8208;forming systems is demonstrated. We present here the first results of an alternative for the resolution of systems that exhibit a stable racemic compound but also a closely related conglomerate&#8208;forming system. If the couples of enantiomers forming the racemic compound and the enantiomers of the stable conglomerate can syncrystallize in mirror&#8208;related partial solid solutions, it is possible to deracemize the racemic mixture of mixed crystals to access to a single handedness. The evidence for this possibility is given in three examples by using temperature&#8208;cycling&#8208;induced deracemization.

         <title>Enantioselective Transformations from Nitriles to NH2&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalytic strategy from commercial nitriles to high enantioselective &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines in up to 90&#8201;% yield and 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess was developed. This approach goes through twice addition processes in one pot. Specifically, organolithium reagents were added to nitriles to form the imine intermediates in&#8197;situ which were further transformed by a catalytic asymmetric addition of Cu&#8208;allyl to afford the &#945;&#8208;tertiary homoallylic NH2&#8208;amines.







Abstract
Organic molecules, containing one or more amine chiral centers, are very common to see in natural products and medicines. Although a large number of methods have been developed to afford enantiopure amines, most of the known approaches are limited with various reasons. For example, many methodologies start from nitrogen protected and activated substrates, which usually need multistep operations and seriously decrease the atom economy. Here we disclose a new catalytic strategy from commercial nitriles to high enantioselective &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines in up to 90&#8201;% yield and 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. This transformation firstly undergoes an addition process of organolithium reagents to nitriles to generate the imine intermediates in&#8197;situ. Subsequently, the most challenging step is by employing copper catalytic enantioselective addition of AllylBpin to the imine intermediates to form the final amines in one pot.

     alt="Enantioselective Transformations from Nitriles to NH2-&#945;-Tertiary Amines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new catalytic strategy&lt;/b&gt; from commercial nitriles to high enantioselective &#945;-tertiary primary amines in up to 90&#8201;% yield and 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess was developed. This approach goes through twice addition processes in one pot. Specifically, organolithium reagents were added to nitriles to form the imine intermediates in&#8197;situ which were further transformed by a catalytic asymmetric addition of Cu-allyl to afford the &#945;-tertiary homoallylic NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-amines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic molecules, containing one or more amine chiral centers, are very common to see in natural products and medicines. Although a large number of methods have been developed to afford enantiopure amines, most of the known approaches are limited with various reasons. For example, many methodologies start from nitrogen protected and activated substrates, which usually need multistep operations and seriously decrease the atom economy. Here we disclose a new catalytic strategy from commercial nitriles to high enantioselective &#945;-tertiary primary amines in up to 90&#8201;% yield and 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. This transformation firstly undergoes an addition process of organolithium reagents to nitriles to generate the imine intermediates in&#8197;situ. Subsequently, the most challenging step is by employing copper catalytic enantioselective addition of AllylBpin to the imine intermediates to form the final amines in one pot.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Progress in Predicting Ionic Cocrystal Formation: The Case of Ammonium Nitrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cocrystal design strategies are rapidly evolving to enhance predictive capabilities and improve the efficiency of coformer screening. However, many of the molecular descriptors associated with successful cocrystallization are ambiguous for salts, complicating coformer selection when designing ionic cocrystals. Herein, a study of ammonium nitrate ionic cocrystals reveals packing coefficient as a promising indicator for coformer success.







Abstract
In contrast to the mature predictive frameworks applied to neutral cocrystals, ionic cocrystals, those including an ion pair, are difficult to design. Furthermore, they are generally excluded categorically from studies which correlate specific molecular properties to cocrystal formation, leaving the prospective ionic cocrystal engineer with few clear avenues to success. Herein ammonium nitrate, an energetic oxidizing salt, is targeted for cocrystallization in a potential coformer group selected based on likely interactions with the nitrate ion as revealed in the Cambridge Structural Database; six novel ionic cocrystals were discovered. Molecular descriptors previously identified as being related to neutral cocrystal formation were examined across the screening group but showed no relationship with ionic cocrystal formation. High packing coefficient is shown to be a constant among the successful coformers in the set and is utilized to directly target two more successful coformers, bypassing the need for a large screening group.

         <title>Molecular Hinges by Fusion of Pyrrole and Dithiin: Synthesis, Structure, Redox Chemistry and Host&#8211;Guest Complexation of Dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 27, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel hinge&#8208;like molecules, namely dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins, were prepared via fusion of pyrroles with 1,4&#8208;dithiin. Their hinged structure, excellent redox&#8208;activity, and adaptive host&#8211;guest chemistry have provided great potentials for developing redox&#8208;switchable host&#8211;guest systems and materials.







Abstract
A series of novel hinge&#8208;like molecules, namely dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins (PDs), were prepared and fully characterized by NMR, UV/vis, cyclic voltammogram, ESR, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The lateral fusion of pyrroles with 1,4&#8208;dithiins has led to not only retained key features of a dithiin, but also enhanced redox&#8208;activity with increased susceptibility to radical cations via redox or chemical oxidation. Stabilization of their radicals are observed for the N,N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl or N,N&#8208;triphenylmethyl PD as evidenced by ESR measurements. DFT calculations and SCXRD analysis revealed PDs are extremely flexible with adaptive molecular geometries that can be mechanically regulated via crystal packing or host&#8211;guest complexation. The excellent donor nature of PDs renders inclusion complexes with the cyclophane bluebox (cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene)), featuring association constants up to 104&#8197;M&#8722;1. Additionally, a planarized transition intermediate associated with inversion dynamics of a PD has been preserved in the pseudorotaxane structure with assistances of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The hinged structure, excellent redox&#8208;activity, and adaptive nature of PDs could further enable accesses to exotic redox switchable host&#8211;guest chemistry and functional materials.

This Reply addresses the questions raised around our recent publication (Chem. Eur. J. 2022, 28, e202104341) in a Correspondence by Prof. P. Crowley (chem.202201110, which is also linked to the original article). We discuss electrostatic self&#8208;assembly of protein cages and clarify the role of key experiments presented in the original article.







Abstract
Our recent publication in Chem. Eur. J. 2022, 28, e202104341 has inspired Prof. Peter&#8197;B. Crowley (P.C.) to write a Correspondence questioning the presented concept of electrostatic self&#8208;assembly. The offered criticism is twofold: 1) the role of the cationic pillar[5]arene macrocycle to act as molecular glue in the formation of electrostatically driven protein assemblies is questioned by arguing that the pillararene is not incorporated into the frameworks. 2) Later, P.C. speculates that when the frameworks form, the role of electrostatic interactions is not firmly established and cation&#8208;pi bonding is the more plausible interaction. In this response, the raised comments are addressed. We present direct experimental NMR evidence showing that the pillar[5]arene is incorporated into the frameworks. Furthermore, we discuss the electrostatic self&#8208;assembly and our ferritin&#8208;related research line more broadly and clarify the role of key experiments.

Starting from a deracemizable conglomerate (blue and red cubes), it is possible to substitute in the solid&#8208;state part of the blue and red enantiomers with chemically related enantiomers (green and yellow cubes) that crystallize as a racemic compound. The mirror&#8208;image solid solutions (enriched mixed crystals) could be deracemized by temperature cycling (deracemized mixed crystals). More information can be found in the Research Article by G.

         <dc:description>
Atropisomeric heterobiaryls have become a burgeoning research topic in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Many catalytic enantioselective constructions of axially chiral heterobiaryls have been documented, and the strategy of ring formation has become a powerful tool toward this goal. In this Review, we summarize the atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;containing heterobiaryls with five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered heterocycles by using ring formation strategy, including transition metal&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition, cyclization, and chirality conversion reactions. Read more in the article by J. Chen, L. Zhou et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300183).

Axially chiral heterobiaryls have wide applications in chiral ligands, catalysts, and bioactive compounds, which have aroused great interest in the chemistry community. This review provides a summary of the recent atroposelective synthesis strategies of heterobiaryls via ring&#8208;formation approaches involving transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis.







Abstract
Atropisomeric heterobiaryls play a vital role in natural products, chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and other research fields, which have aroused great interest from chemists in recent years. Until now, a growing number of optically active heterobiaryls based on indole, quinoline, isoquinoline, pyridine, pyrrole, azole, and benzofuran skeletons have been successfully synthesized through metal or organic catalytic cross&#8208;coupling, functionalization of prochiral or racemic heterobiaryls, and ring formation. Among different strategies for the atroposelective synthesis of heterobiaryls, the strategy of ring formation has become a vital tool toward this goal. In this review, we summarize the enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral heterobiaryls through ring formation approaches, such as cycloaddition, cyclization, and chirality conversion. Meanwhile, the reaction mechanism and the corresponding applications of the chiral heterobiaryls are also discussed.

         <title>Fast visualized conformational transition of polyphenylacetylenes with stepwise tunable circularly polarized luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel poly(3,5&#8208;diamide substituted phenylacetylene)s bearing L&#8208; or D&#8208;alanine residues with a long alkyl chain were synthesized. In low polar or apolar solvents, the polymers adopted contracted cis&#8208;cisoid helix showing strong yellow fluorescence, which was transferred to stretched cis&#8208;transoid helix by adding polar solvents or decreasing temperature, accompanied with the disappearance of fluorescence. The critical conformational transition temperature could be readily tuned in a wide range by altering the content of polar solvent, and the conformational variation at molecular level could be directly read out via the change in fluorescent property. The synergistical participation of amide and ester groups in the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds accelerated the conformational transition rate, resulting in remarkable reduction of hysteresis. Moreover, the polymers displayed switchable CPL performance and the luminescent dissymmetry factor could be stepwise amplified by forming chiral aggregates or liquid crystalline structure. This study may open a new avenue for the development of controllable helical structure&#8208;based smart CPL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Pressure Sensitive Piezochromic Fluorescence Switching of Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Anthraquinone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensing of low&#8208;pressure signals is of great importance for cutting&#8208;edge technologies. Organic piezochromic molecules offer a promising library of pressure sensitive materials which can be tailor&#8208;designed toward specific requirements. However, very few examples of low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescent molecules can be obtained till date, and the underlying mechanisms are still in its fancy. Herein, we report highly sensitive piezochromic fluorescent switching under low&#8208;pressure regimes (~60 kPa) of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;anthraquinone (TPE&#8208;AQ) based on the controlled molecular design and polymorphic crystal strategy. The influence of both intramolecular conformation effect and variations of intermolecular stacking modes on the piezochromic property of TPE&#8208;AQ is investigated. The underlying mechanism of the low&#8208;pressure sensitive piezochromic fluorescence switching is demonstrated to be closely related to the loosely packed molecular orientation, as confirmed by the X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements combined with simulations. This work would provide a way to the design of highly efficient pressure sensors based on organic molecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;Bridged Bisbutatrienes as Models for Longer Cumulenes: Various Transformations for the Constructions of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cumulenes have attracted considerable attention due to their unique structural and electronic properties. Despite their high potential for constructing condensed &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, the synthetic utility of longer cumulenes remains to be established owing to their inherently high reactivity. We focused on conjugated bisbutatrienes having two cumulene moieties linked by a spacer as a mimic of a longer cumulene. Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;bridged bisbutatrienes. These bisbutatrienes underwent various cyclizations, to construct the unique &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks inaccessible by other methodologies. Our bisbutatrienes were converted into fulvenes, pentalene, germacycle, and benzocyclobutene under various conditions. Furthermore, cyclooctatetraene derivative was synthesized via a one&#8208;step dimerization of the bisbutatriene.</dc:description>

         <title>From Proton to Boron: The Lewis Analogs of Protonated Br&#248;nsted Super Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry of borylated sulfate, triflimidate and triflate anions were scouted in details with the aim of synthesizing the unique analogs of protonated Br&#248;nsted superacids. Those complexes were formed by successive borylation with a 9&#8208;boratriptycene derived Lewis super acid paired with a weakly coordinated anion, characterized in solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
Isolation and characterization of highly reactive intermediates are crucial to understand the nature of chemical reactivity. Accordingly, the reactivity of weakly coordinating anions (WCA), usually used to stabilized cationic super electrophiles are of fundamental interest. When a variety of WCA are known to form stable &#963;&#8208;complexes with a proton, inducing Br&#248;nsted super acidity, bis&#8208;coordinated weak&#8208;coordinated anions are much more elusive and considered as long&#8208;sought reactive species. In this work, the chemistry of borylated sulfate, triflimidate and triflate anions were scouted in details with the aim of synthetizing the unique analogs of protonated Br&#248;nsted superacids. Those complexes were formed by successive borylation with a 9&#8208;boratriptycene derived Lewis super acid paired with a weak coordinated anion, characterized in solution and in the solid state and exhibit unique structures and reactivities.

         <title>Massively Parallel Double&#8208;Selection Workflow for the Evolution of Molecular Switches Based on Surface&#8208;Display in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Lpp&#8208;ompA surface&#8208;display system is used for the selection of riboswitches in E. coli. Cells are either selected through their ability to bind to magnetic beads or counter&#8208;selected by the deleterious effects of the surface&#8208;display system overexpression. This dual selection system is massively parallel and allows accelerating the screening process required for the evolution of molecular switches from vast libraries.







Abstract
Microbial surface display of proteins is a versatile method for a wide range of biotechnological applications. Herein, the use of a surface display system in E. coli for the evolution of a riboswitch from an RNA aptamer is presented. To this end, a streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide (SBP) is displayed at the bacterial surface, which can be used for massively parallel selection using a magnetic separation system. Coupling gene expression from a riboswitch library to the display of SBP hence allows selection of library members that express strongly in the presence of a ligand. As excessive SBP expression leads to bacterial growth inhibition, it can be used to negatively select against leaky riboswitches expressing in the absence of ligand. Based on this principle, we devise a double selection workflow that enables quick selection of functional riboswitches with a comparatively low screening workload. The efficiency of our protocol by re&#8208;discovering a previously isolated theophylline riboswitch from a library was demonstrated, as well as a new riboswitch that is similar in performance, but slightly more responsive at low theophylline concentrations. Our workflow is massively parallel and can be applied to the screening or pre&#8208;screening of large molecular libraries.

         <title>Enabling Ultrahigh Surface Area of Covalently&#8208;linked Organic Framework for Boosted CO2 Capture: An Air Liquid Interfacial Plasma as Post&#8208;furnishing Protocol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The underlining features of the presented work focuses on development of a covalently&#8208;linked organic framework (COF) following a simple time&#8208;competent hydrothermal procedure. Successively, a facile, economical and scalable post&#8208;modification approach, i.&#8201;e., air liquid interfacial plasma (ALIP) induced protocol is adopted to explicitly amplifies the surface area to a higher value of 2051&#8197;m2/g which concurrently advances the CO2 uptake performance up to 67&#8201;%.







Abstract
The cognitive intent of a highly ordered and robust adsorbent is extremely sensible and, in this context, Covalent Organic Framework (COF) materials have significantly burgeoned their scope in diverse applications. Herein, a simple time&#8208;competent hydrothermal procedure is presented to construct a covalent framework with an ultrahigh surface area of 1428&#8197;m2/g that shows active adsorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) at variable temperature ranges. Moreover, a facile scalably controlled post&#8208;synthetic air liquid interfacial plasma (ALIP) induced protocol is substantiated that explicitly amplifies the surface area of the pristine framework even to a higher value of 2051&#8197;m2/g. The post&#8208;synthetic plasma approach presented here led to the rapid enhancement of the surface area of the pristine COF by 43&#8201;%, which concurrently advances the CO2 uptake up to 67&#8201;%. Hence, the current study may open up a new frontier in the design as well as fine&#8208;tune the properties of the covalent framework that unfolds the advanced outlook in addressing the challenges of CO2 capture.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cognitive intent of a highly ordered and robust adsorbent is extremely sensible and, in this context, Covalent Organic Framework (COF) materials have significantly burgeoned their scope in diverse applications. Herein, a simple time-competent hydrothermal procedure is presented to construct a covalent framework with an ultrahigh surface area of 1428&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g that shows active adsorption of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at variable temperature ranges. Moreover, a facile scalably controlled post-synthetic air liquid interfacial plasma (ALIP) induced protocol is substantiated that explicitly amplifies the surface area of the pristine framework even to a higher value of 2051&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g. The post-synthetic plasma approach presented here led to the rapid enhancement of the surface area of the pristine COF by 43&#8201;%, which concurrently advances the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake up to 67&#8201;%. Hence, the current study may open up a new frontier in the design as well as fine-tune the properties of the covalent framework that unfolds the advanced outlook in addressing the challenges of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Closing the Shell: Gas&#8208;Phase Solvation of Halides by 1,3&#8208;Butadiene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectron spectra for X&#8722;&#8943;(C4H6)n (X=Cl, Br, I and n=1&#8211;3, 1&#8211;3 and 1&#8211;7 respectively are presented. For all complexes, the calculated structures indicate that butadiene is bound in a bidentate fashion through H&#8208;bonding, with the Cl complex showing the greatest degree of stabilisation of the internal C&#8722;C rotation of cis&#8208;butadiene. These results have implications for gas&#8208;phase clustering in atmospheric and extraterrestrial environments.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;phase solvation of halides by 1,3&#8208;butadiene has been studied via a combination of photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory. Photoelectron spectra for X&#8722;&#8943;(C4H6)n (X=Cl, Br, I where n=1&#8208;3, 1&#8211;3 and 1&#8211;7 respectively) are presented. For all complexes, the calculated structures indicate that butadiene is bound in a bidentate fashion through hydrogen&#8208;bonding, with the chloride complex showing the greatest degree of stabilisation of the internal C&#8722;C rotation of cis&#8208;butadiene. In both Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; complexes, the first solvation shell is shown to be at least 
 from the vertical detachment energies (VDEs), however for I&#8722;, increases in the VDE may suggest a metastable, partially filled, first solvation shell for 
 and a complete shell at

Cyclization: A mild, room temperature oxidative cyclization of 2&#8208;substituted anilines that accesses a broad range of medium&#8208;ring N&#8208;heterocycles via radical intermediates is reported.







Abstract
The development of an efficient process that produces bioactive medium&#8208;sized N&#8208;heterocyclic scaffolds from 2&#8208;substituted anilines using either iodosobenzene or (bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)&#8208;benzene is reported. The tether between the sulfonamide and the aryl group can be varied to access dihydroacridine&#8208;, dibenzazepine&#8208;, or dibenzazocine scaffolds. While substitution on the aniline portion is limited to electron&#8208;neutral&#8208; or electron&#8208;poor groups, a broader range of functional groups are tolerated on the ortho&#8208;aryl substituent and site selective C&#8722;NAr bond formation can be achieved. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that medium&#8208;ring formation occurs via radical reactive intermediates.

Single&#8208;molecule magnets: The first examples of germole&#8208;ligated lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets are reported, with markedly different properties found for the dysprosium and erbium versions.







Abstract
The first germole&#8208;ligated single&#8208;molecule magnets are reported, with contrasting properties found for the near&#8208;linear sandwich complexes [(&#951;8&#8208;COT)Ln(&#951;5&#8208;CpGe]&#8722;, where Ln=Dy (1Dy) or Er (1Er), COT is cyclo&#8208;octatetraenyl and CpGe is [GeC4&#8208;2,5&#8208;(SiMe3)2&#8208;3,4&#8208;Me2]2&#8722;. Whereas 1Er has an energy barrier of 120(1)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 in zero applied field and open hysteresis loops up to 10&#8197;K, the relaxation in 1Dy is characterized by quantum tunneling within the ground state.

         <title>Wettability&#8208;Regulated Synthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Array with Subnanochannels Enables Efficient Separation of Mono&#8208;/Multivalent Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOF array membranes with subnanochannels were prepared by using confined interfacial reaction for selective separation of mono&#8208;/multivalent metal ions. The key is regulating the location of oil/water interfaces though reducing the difference of contact angle of oil and water. Due to the diversity of porous materials, the presented strategy is expected to provide new possibilities for the development of advanced membranes with subnanochannels for practical applications.







Abstract
Achieving efficient separation of mono&#8208;/multivalent metal ions is essential in various fields, yet it remains a significant challenge. In this work, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) array with subnanochannels that exhibit high selectivity and ion permeability in the sieving of mono&#8208;/multivalent metal ion was developed. Specifically, we used confined interfacial reaction at room temperature to synthesis the MOF array inside the micrometer through&#8208;pores of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane. The location of the oil/water interface was regulated by adjusting the surface wettability of the PET membrane. By taking advantage of size sieving effect of the subnanochannels of MOF crystals, we were able to effectively separate monovalent metal ions from multivalent metal ions with selectivity reaching up to 3930&#177;373 (e.g., Li+/Zr4+). The fluxes of Li+ ions were observed to be as high as 1.97&#8197;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. The MOF array&#8208;based membrane with subnanochannels that we have developed exhibits great promise for applications in wastewater treatment, lithium extraction from salt&#8208;lake brines, and other related fields.

&lt;p&gt;Achieving efficient separation of mono-/multivalent metal ions is essential in various fields, yet it remains a significant challenge. In this work, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) array with subnanochannels that exhibit high selectivity and ion permeability in the sieving of mono-/multivalent metal ion was developed. Specifically, we used confined interfacial reaction at room temperature to synthesis the MOF array inside the micrometer through-pores of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane. The location of the oil/water interface was regulated by adjusting the surface wettability of the PET membrane. By taking advantage of size sieving effect of the subnanochannels of MOF crystals, we were able to effectively separate monovalent metal ions from multivalent metal ions with selectivity reaching up to 3930&#177;373 (e.g., Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;). The fluxes of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions were observed to be as high as 1.97&#8197;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The MOF array-based membrane with subnanochannels that we have developed exhibits great promise for applications in wastewater treatment, lithium extraction from salt-lake brines, and other related fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>New Hypothesis Insight of Structural Properties on Four Tau Peptide Fragments in Alzheimer's Disease: Origin from the Histidine Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural properties and aggregation tendency of four Tau peptide fragments are subject to significant modulation by histidine behaviors, including its tautomeric and protonation states. Notably, the R1, R2, and R4 fragments exhibit a preference for unstable and flexible structural features, whereas only R3(&#1013;&#948;) displays a propensity for stable three &#946;&#8208;strand structures.







Abstract
During protein folding and misfolding, structural properties and aggregation tendency can be significantly influenced by histidine behaviors (tautomeric behaviors and protonation behaviors). The original reasons were derived from the net charge changes and the various N/N&#8722;H orientation on imidazole rings. In the current study, total 18 independent REMD simulations were performed to investigate the histidine behaviors on four Tau peptide fragments (MBD, including R1, R2, R3, and R4 fragments). We found that, compared to R1, R2, R3 except (&#1013;&#948;), and R4 systems with flexible structural features, only R3(&#1013;&#948;) has dominating conformational structure (possibility of 81.3&#8201;%) with three &#946;&#8208;strand structures in parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structures at I4&#8208;K6 and I24&#8208;H26, as well as antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at G19&#8208;L21. Importantly, the H25 and H26 residues (in R3(&#1013;&#948;) system) are directly involved in the sheet structure formations and strong H&#8208;bonded interactions (possibility range of 31.3&#8201;%&#8211;44.7&#8201;%). Furthermore, the donors and acceptors analysis confirmed that only R3(&#1013;&#948;) shows faraway amino acids interaction features in both H25 and H26 residues, and such cooperation effects of two histidine residues contribute to current structural features. The current study will be helpful to further enrichment of the histidine behavior hypothesis, it provides new insight for understanding protein folding and misfolding.

         <title>Steric Effects on the Chelation of Mn2+ and Zn2+ by Hexadentate Polyimidazole Ligands: Modeling Metal Binding by Calprotectin Site 2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective binding of manganese(II) ions is a challenging problem with potential biomedical applications. We have designed a series of bioinspired hexadentate chelating ligands that allow for systematic, sterically&#8208;controlled tuning of the ligand cavity size in order to explore the feasibility of size&#8208;based selectivity for Mn2+ binding over other first&#8208;row divalent transition metal ions.







Abstract
Recently, there has been increasing interest in the design of ligands that bind Mn2+ with high affinity and selectivity, but this remains a difficult challenge. It has been proposed that the cavity size of the binding pocket is a critical factor in most synthetic and biological examples of selective Mn2+ binding. Here, we use a bioinspired approach adapted from the hexahistidine binding site of the manganese&#8208;sequestering protein calprotectin to systematically study the effect of cavity size on Mn2+ and Zn2+ binding. We have designed a hexadentate, trisimidazole ligand whose cavity size can be tuned through peripheral modification of the steric bulk of the imidazole substituents. Conformational dynamics and redox potentials of the complexes are dependent on ligand steric bulk. Stability constants are consistent with the hypothesis that larger ligand cavities are relatively favorable for Mn2+ over Zn2+, but this effect alone may not be sufficient to achieve Mn2+ selectivity.

         <title>Shape morphing liquid crystal polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystal polymers are a type of representative material combining the order&#8208;disorder transition of liquid crystals and the superior properties of polymers. The phase transition from the liquid crystal phase to the isotropic state of mesogens causes large, controllable, and reversible deformation of polymers; thus, liquid crystal polymers have emerged as one of the most valuable candidates for shape morphing materials. Much research effort is dedicated to liquid crystal polymers for shape morphing that are designed to develop more novel applications. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the recent development of shape morphing materials based on liquid crystal polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>3&#8208;Ligated Phenothiazinyl&#8208;terephthalonitrile Dyads and Triads &#8211; Synthesis, Electronic Properties, Delayed Fluorescence and Electronic Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bromine&#8208;lithium exchange&#8208;borylation&#8208;Suzuki sequence efficiently furnishes phenothiazine&#8208;terephthalonitrile donor&#8208;acceptor dyads and triads in high yields. In contrast to most phenothiazine&#8208;acceptor conjugates the title compounds are ligated in p&#8208;position to the phenothiazine nitrogen atom. Moreover, the acceptors are either directed linked or ligated by an arylene bridge and p&#8208;anisyl N&#8208;substituents on the phenothiazine are chosen to lock the tricycle into an intra&#8208;configuration. Cyclic voltammetry reveals effects of bridging and ligation and N&#8208;substituent. Optical spectroscopy likewise displays similar band gaps, large Stokes shifts and substantial to high quantum yields in solution, in the solid state and in PMMA matrix. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy indicates quite long fluorescence decay times in solution and emission components in the microsecond time range. TADF properties are further assessed by fluorescence increase in deoxygenated solution, gated emission spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;dependent determination of phosphorescence. The nature of the electronically excited states is investigated by DFT/MRCI. While for the directly ligated dyad a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap  [[EQUATION]] of 0.24 eV can be estimated and is consistently confirmed by quantum chemical calculations on the lowest energy conformer, even lower  [[EQUATION]] of 0.029 and 0.008 eV are estimated for the investigated dyads and the triad in the solid state and in PMMA matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>A pyramidal metal organic frameworks&#8208;derived FeP@CoP aluminium&#8208;ion battery cathode displaying low&#8208;temperature tolerance and fast electron transfer kinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Engineering appropriate cathode materials is significant for the development of high&#8208;performance aluminum&#8208;ion (Al&#8208;ion) batteries. Here, a pyramidal metal organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;derived FeP@CoP composite is developed as cathode, which exhibits good stability and high capacity. FeP@CoP cathode remains a high capacity of 168 mAh g&#8208;1 after 200 cycles, and displays a stable rate&#8208;performance at both room and low temperatures of &#8210;10 &#176;C. After three rounds of rate&#8208;performance cycling, the FeP@CoP composite recovers 178.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.3 A g&#8208;1. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify improved electron&#8208;transfer kinetics with narrowed band gap and enhanced density of states. Those findings would inspire a broad set of studies on MOFs&#8208;derived composites for high&#8208;performance secondary batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Photothermal Perylene Bisimide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, perylene bisimide gels are prepared that can exhibit the photothermal effect. This can be used for example to heat a solution above the gel.







Abstract
Gels formed using a perylene bisimide (PBI) as a low molecular weight gelator can show the photothermal effect. Formation of the PBI radical anion results in new absorption bands forming, meaning that subsequent irradiation with a wavelength of light overlapping with the new absorption band leads to heating of the gel. This approach can be used to heat the gel, as well as the surrounding milieu. We show how we can use electrochemical methods as well as multicomponent systems to form the radical anion without the need for UV light, and how we can use the photothermal effect to induce phase transitions in the solutions above the gels by exploiting photothermal behavior.

         <title>Deciphering the Differences in Ambident Reactivity between the Cyanate, Thiocyanate Ions, and their P&#8208; and As&#8208;Containing Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the ambident nature of the [NCX]&#8722; (X&#8201;:&#8201;O, S, Se) anions is well known, the analogous heavier P&#8208; or As&#8208;containing species are lesser explored. This computational study explores the ambident SN2 reactivities of all existing [ECX]&#8722; (E: N, P, As; X: O, S, Se) anions. The results conceptualise reactivity patterns and offer explanations on the trends so that the accessibility of unprecedented low&#8208;coordinate organopnictogen species can be proposed.







Abstract
Although the cyanate and thiocyanate anions belong to the most known textbook examples of ambident nucleophiles, the electronic factors that determine their markedly differing reactivities are still unclear. The recently discovered P&#8208; and As&#8208;containing [PCX]&#8722; and [AsCX]&#8722; analogues (X: O, S, Se), whose ambident nature is practically unexplored, may serve as ideal basis for comparison to clarify these differences. This study presents comprehensive theoretical investigations on the nucleophilic behaviours of the whole set of so far known [ECX]&#8722; (E: N, P, As, X: O, S, Se) anions, aiming for a systematic understanding of the reactivity patterns and identifying the factors that govern the nucleophilic substitutions. The results indicate that the SN2 reactions of the O&#8208;containing [ECO]&#8722; ions are thermodynamically preferred at the pnictogen centres E, while the kinetic contributions are only substantial for the N&#8208;containing [NCX]&#8722; anions. The ambident reactivities of the congeners that contain N or O significantly differ from those with P, As, S, or Se heteroatoms, in line with the inert s&#8208;orbital effect, characteristic for the heavier elements. By analysing the electronic structures and bonding patterns of the anions and relevant transition state structures, clear explanations are offered for the differing reactivities of the whole set of [ECX]&#8722; anions. To serve for synthetic investigations, possible outcomes of nucleophilic substitutions are predicted, and the target molecules are expected to be versatile and useful synthons.

         <title>Using Solution History to Control Hydrogel Properties of a Perylene Bisimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gelation: We demonstrate how one perylene bisimides gelator and one gelation trigger can form different hydrogels with different mechanical and optical properties. This is done by altering the starting pH and the history of the solution before it is gelled. This demonstrates the tunability of a single molecule using the same gelation conditions is possible, which is valuable in material design.







Abstract
pH dependence on water soluble aggregates is well&#8208;known in the field of low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs), with different aggregates sometimes having very different properties depending on their final pH. This aggregation determines their applications and performance. Here, we investigate the pH dependence of perylene bisimide gels; initially solutions are formed at a high pH and gels form as the pH is decreased. We find it is not only the final pH but also the starting pH that can impact the resulting gel. We use small angle neutron scattering (SANS), rheology, 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy to examine the effect of starting pH on gelation kinetics and final gel properties. Adjusting the solution from pH&#8197;9 (where there are few or no aggregates) to pH&#8197;6 results in the formation of different worm&#8208;like micelles than the ones directly formed at pH&#8197;6, leading to again gels with different mechanical properties. This work highlights the importance of controlling the pH of solutions before gelation, but also opens up more possible morphologies and therefore more properties from the same molecule.

         <title>Polarity and Dielectric Property Control Triggered by a Coordinated Solvent Molecule Exchange in Luminescent Mononuclear Aluminium(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first example of solvent vapour&#8208;induced polarity and dielectric property switching, including the formation of ferroelectric domains, has been demonstrated in luminescent mononuclear aluminium(III) complexes, which exhibit strong green emission in the solid state. In this system, the coordinated solvent substitution is the &#8220;trigger&#8221; for the corresponding structural rearrangements.







Abstract
The development of molecule&#8208;based multifunctional switchable materials that exhibit a switch of polarity and dielectric property are extremely limited. We have demonstrated solvent&#8208;vapour&#8208;induced reversible molecular rearrangements between nonpolar crystals [Al(sap)(acac)(sol)] (H2sap=2&#8208;salicylideneaminophenol, acac=acetylacetonate, sol=MeOH (1), EtOH (2)) and polar crystal [Al(sap)(acac)(DMSO)] (3). This crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal structural transformation was accompanied by a switch of second harmonic generation (SHG) and dielectric properties, including the formation of ferroelectric domains, thus reflecting the SHG&#8208;active polar Cc space group of 3. This is the first reported example of dielectric properties and polarity switching in luminescent mononuclear aluminium(III) complexes, which exhibit strong green emission in the solid state.

         <title>Preparation of UFM1&#8208;Derived Probes through Highly Optimized Total Chemical Synthesis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A total chemical synthesis strategy utilizing UFM1&#8197;C&#8208;terminal valine hydrazide as a versatile handle is reported for the facile preparation of UFM1&#8208;derived probes. This approach allows the convenient installation of electrophilic warheads, fluorescent reporters and unnatural purification tags onto the UFM1 sequence.







Abstract
Ufmylation is involved in various cellular processes and associated with many human diseases. The understanding of this modification relies on the use of customized UFM1&#8208;derived probes for activity&#8208;based profiling of its related enzymes. This study presents a highly optimized total chemical synthesis for the generation of diverse UFM1&#8208;derived probes including UFM1&#8208;PA, Biotin&#8208;UFM1&#8208;PA and UFM1&#8208;AMC, in which a UFM1&#8197;C&#8208;terminal valine hydrazide was readily prepared by hydrazide&#8208;based ligation and used as a versatile handle for the installation of enzyme&#8208;sensitive warheads and fluorescent reporters. The resulting probes display high reactivity and selectivity for UFM1&#8208;specific enzymes in cell lysates. This strategy facilitates the generation and diversity of the UFM1&#8208;derived toolkit that can be employed to profile UFM1&#8208;specific enzymes, thereby shining insights into the dynamics of ufmylation.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Photochemical C&#8722;N Coupling of Amides with (Hetero)aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical C&#8722;N coupling reaction of (hetero)aryl halides with amides using NiCl2&#8208;bipyridine complex as a pre&#8208;catalyst in the absence of an external photocatalyst is reported, allowing a broad array of aryl chlorides to be converted into the corresponding (hetero)arylamides.







Abstract
This paper reports a photochemical C&#8722;N coupling of abundant, but less reactive aryl chlorides, with structurally diverse primary and secondary amides by Ni&#8208;mediated without an external photocatalyst. Under the irradiation of light (390&#8211;395&#8197;nm) with a soluble organic amine as the base, the reaction allows for the successful transformation of (hetero)aryl chlorides to a wide range of N&#8208;aryl amides. More than 60&#8197;examples are shown, demonstrating the feasibility and applicability of this protocol in organic synthesis. Mechanic studies indicate that this amidation proceeds via a Ni(I)&#8208;Ni(III) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Formate Additive for Efficient and Stable Methylammonium&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells by Gas&#8208;Quenching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formate addtives play a critical role in regulating the crystal growth and orientation of MA&#8208;free perovskite films prepared with gas&#8208;quenching. The MA&#8208;free device with addition of FAFO demonstrate a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.94&#8201;% and improved stability without any interfacial passivation.







Abstract
In order to promote the commercialization of perovskite solar cells, gas&#8208;quenching is considered to be a promising technique for perovskite film fabrication. However, when handling with methylammonium&#8208;free (MA&#8208;free) perovskites, it is often difficult to obtain high&#8208;quality perovskite films by gas&#8208;quenching. Herein, formate additives are employed to regulate the crystallization of MA&#8208;free perovskite, and improve the quality of perovskite films. Different additives of formamidine formate (FAFO) and potassium formate (KFO) is compared to investigate the role of formate groups in the crystallization of perovskite films prepared by gas&#8208;quenching. The FAFO additive facilitates the perovskite crystallization in (001) orientation whereas KFO favors for (111) orientation. The MA&#8208;free device with addition of FAFO demonstrate a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.94&#8201;%, compared to that of 20.14&#8201;% for KFO devices. In addition, FAFO device also exhibits improved thermal stability in ambient condition without encapsulation, extending the T80 lifetime by 18&#8197;times compared to the pristine device.

         <dc:description>
Comparative UV/Vis absorption studies illustrate the importance to mind the assumptions behind temperature&#8208; and solvent&#8208;dependent data evaluation to obtain thermodynamic parameters for self&#8208;assembly processes with the same reliability as from classical concentration&#8208;dependent studies.







Abstract
Mathematical models for the concentration&#8208;, temperature&#8208; and solvent&#8208;dependent analysis of self&#8208;assembly equilibria are derived for the most simple case of dimer formation, to highlight the assumptions these models and the thus determined thermodynamic parameters are based on. The three models were applied to UV/Vis absorption data for the dimerization of a highly dipolar merocyanine dye in 1,4&#8208;dioxane. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) dilution experiments were performed as an independent reference technique. While the concentration&#8208;dependent analysis is according to our studies the most reliable method, also the less time&#8208;consuming temperature&#8208;dependent evaluation can give accurate results in the present example, despite small thermochromic effects. In contrast, the strong negative solvatochromism of the merocyanine tampers with the results from the solvent&#8208;dependent evaluation. Even though the studies presented in this work are limited to the monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium of a dipolar dye, the basic principles can be transferred to other chromophores and different self&#8208;assembly models, including those for supramolecular polymerization.

         <title>Co2+ Doped Biotinylated Carbon Dot: A Theranostic Agent for Target Specific Killing of Cancer Cells via Hypoxia Induced Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting cancer cells: Biotinylated Co2+&#8208;integrated carbon dot (CoCDb) selectively diagnosed and killed cancer cells with marked superiority over normal cells by hypoxia induced apoptosis in absence of traditional therapeutic intervention. Immunoblotting assay confirmed the increased expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) that has key role in hypoxia generation leading to apoptosis. In 3D tumor spheroid, CoCDb treated cancer cells showed significant apoptosis.







Abstract
Conventional cancer treatments have systematic side effects that stand against its desirable therapeutic efficacy. Alternative strategies using biochemical features of cancer cells to promote apoptosis are finding notable significance. One such important biochemical feature of malignant cells is hypoxia, alteration of which can lead to cell death. Hypoxia inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) has the key role in hypoxia generation. Herein, we synthesized biotinylated Co2+&#8208;integrated carbon dot (CoCDb) that specifically diagnose and selectively killed cancer cells with 3&#8211;3.1&#8208;fold higher efficiency over non&#8208;cancer cells by hypoxia induced apoptosis in absence of traditional therapeutic intervention. Immunoblotting assay in CoCDb treated MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231&#8197;cells confirmed the increased expression of HIF&#8208;1&#945; that was responsible for efficient killing of cancer cells. In 2D cells and 3D tumor spheroid, CoCDb treated cancer cells showed significant apoptosis that make CoCDb a potential theranostic agent.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Stachyurin and Casuarinin Focusing on C&#8208;Glycosidic Bond Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stachyurin and casuarinin are ellagitannins, a class of polyphenols that exhibit various biological activities that have an impact on human health. Casuarinin is a stachyurin stereoisomer. These compounds contain the characteristic C&#8208;glycosidic bond between the open&#8208;chain D&#8208;glucose and the phenol aromatic ring. Therefore, chemical elucidation of the C&#8208;glycosidic bond reactivity is required to exploit their multiple bioactivities. This study developed a method for the divergent synthesis of stachyurin and casuarinin via the &#945;&#8208;selective C&#8208;glycosylation as well as the &#946;&#8208;selective introduction of the oxygen functional group, focusing on structural specificity. The proposed method applies to the syntheses of stachyurin and casuarinin analogues, thereby facilitating the utilisation of their beneficial bioactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Light Absorption and Improved Charge Separation by Protonation of the Organic Ligand in a Bismuth Based Metal&#8722;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report a new method to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic activity of metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) with nitrogen&#8208;containing ligand, namely the protonation of nitrogen. Specifically, a protonated Bi&#8208;based MOF synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;H, MMTAA= 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiazoleacetic acid) displays a wider visible light absorption than Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;R with the same single&#8208;crystal structure but synthesized by a reflux method. The red&#8208;shifted light absorption was confirmed to be caused by the protonation of nitrogen in the thiazolyl ring in MMTAA. Moreover, this protonation also facilitates the charge separation and transfer and improves the photocatalytic activity of selective oxidation of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to p&#8208;cymene. Our results provide a new idea for nitrogen&#8208;containing Bi&#8208;based MOFs to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsically switchable electroactive fluorophores based on &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and full characterization of a family of stable &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines connected in 4,4&#8208;position through a variety of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridges. The impact of the &#960;&#8208;bridge on the optical (absorption/emission) and redox properties is investigated using a joint experimental/theoretical approach. In contrast to the p&#8208;extended ones, the &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines directly connected through a C&#8208;C bond in 4,4&#8208;position display two easily accessible and reversible oxidations highlighting their multi&#8208;stage redox character. The in situ formed radical cations are studied by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry and electron paramagnetic resonance. Finally, electrochemical modulation of fluorescence (electrofluorochromism) was performed and revealed the potential of these intrinsically switchable electroactive fluorophores for further applications as switchable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Push&#8211;Pull Bridged Distyrylbenzene with Highly Bright Solid&#8208;State Red&#8208;Orange Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple emission colors in solid&#8208;state organic fluorophores with the same main skeleton are essential for improving the performance of light&#8208;emitting devices/materials. Specifically, emission in the red/near&#8208;infrared region is of great importance in the biological field. Previously, we developed di&#8208;bridged&#8208;distyrylbenzene DBDB[7] with high&#8208;brightness solid&#8208;state blue and aggregation&#8208;induced emissions (AIE) by introducing the bridging structures of a seven&#8208;membered ring into the vinylene groups of distyrylbenzene (DSB). Herein, we synthesize MNDSDMeOB[7] (1), which features substituted methoxy and malononitrile groups as donor and acceptor groups, respectively, in DBDB[7]. In solvents more polar than THF, MNDSDMeOB (3), which has the same main skeleton as 1 but without bridges, shows no emission in the solid state, whereas 1 exhibits highly bright red&#8208;orange emission in the solid state owing to the suppression of intermolecular electronic interactions by the bridges and the AIE property. We also synthesize MNDSD(EHO)B (2) in which the methoxy groups of 3 are replaced by ethylhexyloxy groups, thus disrupting the crystallinity of the molecule. 2 exhibits positive fluorescence solvatochromism and has a high fluorescence quantum yield in the solid state as a red&#8208;emitting DSB derivative. The solid&#8208;state emission properties of 1 and 2 will improve the applicability of DSBs and functionalities of light&#8208;emitting devices/materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting methanol&#8208;mediated CO2 hydrogenation into aromatics by synergistically tailoring oxygen vacancy and acid site properties of multifunctional catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Even though the direct hydrogenation of CO2 into aromatics has been realized via a methanol&#8208;mediated pathway and multifunctional catalyst, few works have been focused on the simultaneously rational design of each component in multifunctional catalyst to improve the performance. Also, the structure&#8208;function relationship between aromatics synthesis performance and the different catalytic components (reducible metal oxide and acidic zeolite) has been rarely investigated. Herein, we increase the oxygen vacancy (Ov) density in reducible Cr2O3 by sequential carbonization and oxidation (SCO) treatments of Cr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Thanks to the enriched Ov, Cr2O3&#8208;based catalyst affords high methanol selectivity of 98.1% (without CO) at a CO2 conversion of 16.8% under high reaction temperature (350 oC). Furthermore, after combining with the acidic zeolite H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, the multifunctional catalyst realizes the direct conversion of CO2 into aromatics with conversion and selectivity as high as 25.4% and 80.1% (without CO), respectively. The property of acid site in H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, especially the Al species that located at the intersection of straight and sinusoidal channels, plays a vital role in enhancing the aromatics selectivity, which can be precisely controlled by varying the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Our work provides a synergistic strategy to boost the aromatics synthesis performance from CO2 hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous Chiral Resolution of a MnIII Spin&#8208;Crossover Complex with High Temperature 80&#8197;K Hysteresis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous chiral resolution of the &#916; and &#923; isomers of a racemic mixture of a MnIII spin&#8208;crossover complex is achieved by conglomerate crystallization. The complex exhibits gradual spin crossover with a wide thermal hysteresis, &#8764;80&#8197;K at its maximum, with T1/2&#8593;=250&#8197;K and T1/2&#8595;=200&#8197;K. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and circular dichroism was used to confirm the enantiopurity of the &#916; and &#923; isomers.







Abstract
Non&#8208;centrosymmetric spin&#8208;switchable systems are of interest for their prospective applications as magnetically active non&#8208;linear optical materials and in multiferroic devices. Chiral resolution of simple spin&#8208;crossover chelate complexes into the &#916; and &#923; forms offers a facile route to homochiral magnetic switches, which could be easily enantiomerically enriched. Here, we report the spontaneous resolution of a new hysteretic spin&#8208;crossover complex, [MnIII(sal2323)]SCN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;EtOH (1), into &#916; and &#923; forms, without the use of chiral reagents, where sal2323 is a Schiff base resulting from condensation of 1,2&#8208;bis(3&#8208;aminopropylamino)ethane with 2&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehyde. The enantiopurity of the &#916; and &#923; isomers was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and circular dichroism. Quantum chemistry calculations were used to investigate the electronic structure. The opening of a wide 80&#8197;K thermal hysteresis window at high temperature highlights the potential for good magneto&#8208;optical function at ambient temperature for materials of this type.

Abstract
Two novel nona&#8208;coordinated Eu(III) complexes [Eu(btfa)3(Ph&#8208;TerPyr)] (Eu&#8208;1) and [Eu(NTA)3(Ph&#8208;TerPyr)] (Eu&#8208;2) have been synthesized and characterized. The structure of the complexes was elucidated by density functional theory (DFT) methods. The experimental photophysical properties of the complexes were investigated and complemented with theoretical calculations. Effective energy transfer (ET) pathways for the sensitized red luminescence is discussed. The complexes were tested as emitting layers (EML) in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). At the optimum doping concentration of 4&#8197;wt.%, the double&#8208;EML OLEDs of Eu&#8208;1 exhibited red electroluminescence (EL) with an EQE of 4.0&#8201;% and maximum brightness (B)=1179&#8197;cd/m2, maximum current efficiency (&#951;c)=5.64&#8197;cd/A, and maximum power efficiency (&#951;p)=4.78&#8197;lm/W at the current density (J) of 10&#8197;mA/cm2. Interestingly, the double&#8208;EML OLEDs of Eu&#8208;2 at the optimum concentration of 3&#8197;wt.%, displayed an outstanding EL performance with EQE of 7.32&#8201;% and B=838&#8197;cd/m2, &#951;c=10.19&#8197;cd/A and &#951;p=10.33&#8197;lm/W at J=10&#8197;mA/cm2. The EL performance of this device is among the best reported for devices incorporating a europium complex as a red emitter.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Based Terpyridine Complexes as Antitumor Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of 4&#8217;&#8208;X&#8208;terpyridines/tetra&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinylpyrazine silver derivatives with or without phosphines as ancillary ligands has shown high cytotoxicity against different tumour cells. In addition, a great selectivity index has been detected for healthy lymphocytes T in some cases. These derivatives interact with CT&#8208;DNA through moderate intercalation, and cell death studies indicate that they promote an apoptotic cell death.







Abstract
Silver complexes bearing substituted terpyridine or tetra&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinylpyrazine ligands have been prepared and structurally characterised. The study of the anticancer properties of silver complexes with this type of ligands is scarce, despite the possibilities of combining the properties of the metal and the ability of the ligands for DNA binding. Here, the antiproliferative activity, stability, CT&#8208;DNA binding, and mechanism of cell death of these types of derivatives are studied. High cytotoxicity against different tumour cells was observed, and, more important, a great selectivity index has been detected between tumour cells and healthy lymphocytes T for some of these compounds. The CT&#8208;DNA interaction study has shown that these derivatives are able to interact with CT&#8208;DNA by moderate intercalation. Furthermore, cell death studies indicate that these derivatives promote the apoptosis by a mitochondrial pathway.

         <title>Latent Pronucleophiles in Lewis Base Catalysis: Enantioselective Allylation of Silyl Enol Ethers with Allylic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of latent pronucleophiles greatly expands the scope of Lewis base catalysis and enables enantioselective allylation of silyl enol ethers setting up to two stereogenic centers in a single operation.







Abstract
Lewis base catalyzed allylations of C&#8208;centered nucleophiles have been largely limited to the niche substrates with acidic C&#8722;H substituted for C&#8722;F bonds at the stabilized carbanionic carbon. Herein we report that the concept of latent pronucleophiles serves to overcome these limitations and allow for a variety of common stabilized C&#8208;nucleophiles, when they are introduced as the corresponding silylated compounds, to undergo enantioselective allylations using allylic fluorides. The reactions of silyl enol ethers afford the allylation products in good yields and with high degree of regio/stereoselectivity as well as diastereoselectivity when cyclic silyl enol ethers are used. Further examples of silylated stabilized carbon nucleophiles that undergo efficient allylation speak in favor of the general applicability of this concept to C&#8208;centered nucleophiles.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The concept of latent pronucleophiles&lt;/b&gt; greatly expands the scope of Lewis base catalysis and enables enantioselective allylation of silyl enol ethers setting up to two stereogenic centers in a single operation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis base catalyzed allylations of C-centered nucleophiles have been largely limited to the niche substrates with acidic C&#8722;H substituted for C&#8722;F bonds at the stabilized carbanionic carbon. Herein we report that the concept of latent pronucleophiles serves to overcome these limitations and allow for a variety of common stabilized C-nucleophiles, when they are introduced as the corresponding silylated compounds, to undergo enantioselective allylations using allylic fluorides. The reactions of silyl enol ethers afford the allylation products in good yields and with high degree of regio/stereoselectivity as well as diastereoselectivity when cyclic silyl enol ethers are used. Further examples of silylated stabilized carbon nucleophiles that undergo efficient allylation speak in favor of the general applicability of this concept to C-centered nucleophiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insight into the Mechanism of Cd2+ Removal by MgAl Layered Double Hydroxides with Different Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adsorption mechanism of heavy metals: Cd2+ was removed as CdCO3 for MgAl&#8722;CO3, while Cd2+ could be mineralized in a super&#8208;stable way as CdAl&#8208;LDHs by isomorphic substitution of MgAl&#8722;NO3/SO4/Cl. This was attributed to the different binding energies and Gibbs free energies caused by distinct host&#8208;guest interactions of various anions intercalated in MgAl&#8208;LDH.







Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have shown great potential as adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals. Nevertheless, how the host&#8208;guest interactions of LDHs affect the removal mechanism remains to be less explored. Herein, CO32&#8722;/NO3&#8722;/SO42&#8722;/Cl&#8722; intercalated MgAl&#8208;LDHs with different host&#8208;guest interactions were fabricated and their removal mechanism for Cd2+ was investigated. The removal capacity increased in the order of MgAl&#8722;CO3 (127.3&#8197;mg/g)&lt;MgAl&#8722;SO4 (173.3&#8197;mg/g)&lt;MgAl&#8722;NO3 (305.0&#8197;mg/g)&#8776;MgAl&#8722;Cl (312.5&#8197;mg/g). The quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ XRD and XAS demonstrated that Cd2+ was removed as CdCO3 for MgAl&#8722;CO3, while for MgAl&#8722;Cl/NO3/SO4, Cd2+ was removed as CdAl&#8208;LDHs by an isomorphic substitution mechanism. DFT calculations revealed that compared to the CdAl&#8208;LDHs formation the Gibbs free energy of the CdCO3 formation was lower, which made it easier to remove Cd2+ as CdCO3 on MgAl&#8722;CO3. Conversely, isomorphic substitution of MgAl&#8722;NO3 to obtain CdAl&#8208;LDHs was a free energy reduction process.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Bridge Controlled Patterning of BTR:PC71BM Bulk Heterojunction Micro Arrays towards High&#8208;Performance Photodetector</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capillary&#8208;bridge strategy was introduced for the patterning of organic bulk heterojunctions. The fabricated BTR:PC71BM micropatterns arrays have exhibited hierarchical morphology with suitable domain size, which enhanced the charge generation and transport. For this reason, the fabricated microphotodiodes presented excellent performance with a responsivity of 40.56&#8197;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 and a specific detectivity of 2.15&#215;1012&#8197;Jones.







Abstract
The patterning strategy of organic semiconductors is a crucial issue for integrated circuit. However, due to the uncontrollable liquid dewetting, most of the research is mainly focused on the patterning of single component, few works have been done on the patterning of multi&#8208;component or heterojunction, which play an important role in optoelectronic devices. Therefore, a capillary&#8208;bridge strategy was introduced for patterning of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) micro&#8208;arrays, with liquid crystalline BTR and PC71BM utilized as donor and acceptor, respectively. The BTR:PC71BM arrays presented hierarchical morphology with suitable phase separation, which contributes to the efficient charge generation and transport. Moreover, the photodetector exhibited excellent performance with the light on/off ratio greater than 2000, the responsivity of 40.57&#8197;A&#8201;W&#8722;1, and specific detectivity of 2.15&#215;1012&#8197;Jones. Such progress demonstrates that the capillary&#8208;bridge strategy is a promising approach for the fabrication of high&#8208;quality BHJ micropatterns arrays.

         <title>Room Temperature Hydroxyl Group&#8208;Assisted Preparation of Hydrophobicity&#8208;Adjustable Metal&#8208;Organic Framework UiO&#8208;66 Composites: Towards Continuous Oil Collection and Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective post&#8208;synthetic modification approach assisted with metal hydroxyl groups at room temperature is reported to induce hydrophobicity in the hydrophilic UiO&#8208;66. The bonding between Zr&#8722;OH in UiO&#8208;66 and n&#8208;tetradecylphosphonic acid is vital for the hydrophobic modification. Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic composites were constructed for continuous oil collection and emulsion separation by coating modified UiO&#8208;66 on porous substrates.







Abstract
Developing a straightforward and effective hydrophobic modification for metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) under mild conditions is meaningful for MOF applications. Here, a post&#8208;synthetic modification approach assisted with metal hydroxyl groups at room temperature is reported to induce hydrophobicity in the hydrophilic UiO&#8208;66. The bonding between Zr&#8722;OH in UiO&#8208;66 and n&#8208;tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA) is the vital force for the modifier TDPA. Superhydrophobic and superoleophilic composites were constructed for efficient oil&#8208;water separation by coating TDPA&#8208;modified UiO&#8208;66 (P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) on commercial melamine sponges (MS) and filter papers (FP) with water contact angles of 153.2&#176; and 155.6&#176;, respectively. The P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS composite could quickly and selectively absorb oily liquids up to 43&#8197;times its weight from water. The P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS achieved continuous oil collection with high separation efficiencies (&#8805;99.4&#8201;%). In addition, P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/FP and P&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MS showed high separation efficiencies for water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions (&#8805;98.5&#8201;%) and oil&#8208;in&#8208;water emulsions, respectively, with high resistance to low/high temperatures and acid/base conditions. The metal hydroxyl group&#8208;assisted post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy offers a facile and broad way to prepare hydrophobic MOFs for promising applications in environmental fields.

         <title>Synthesis of Polysubstituted Enamides by Hydrogen Atom Transfer Alkene Isomerization Using Dual Cobalt/Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of polysubstituted enamides via metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer by merger of cobalt/photoredox catalysis was achieved. The judicious choice of Co(3&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5&#8208;CF3&#8208;salophen) and Co(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalophen) enabled access to polysubstituted enamides. The method tolerated haloarenes, heteroarenes, free hydroxy groups, non&#8208;protected indoles, and drug&#8208;like molecules. Furthermore, this method can isomerize styrene derivatives in good yield and E/Z selectivity.







Abstract
M&#8208;HAT isomerization is a highly reliable method to access thermodynamically stable alkenes with high functional group tolerance. However, synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes by M&#8208;HAT isomerization reaction is still underdeveloped. Herein, we report an enamide synthesis using M&#8208;HAT via a combination of cobalt and photoredox catalysis. This method tolerates a variety of functional groups including haloarenes, heteroarenes, free hydroxy groups, non&#8208;protected indoles, and drug derivatives. Furthermore, this method can isomerize styrene derivatives in good yield and E/Z selectivity.

This method tolerates a variety of functional groups including haloarenes, heteroarenes, free hydroxy groups, non-protected indoles, and drug derivatives. Furthermore, this method can isomerize styrene derivatives in good yield and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Base&#8208;Triggered Oxidative Addition to Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P&#8208;chelation assisted strategy to promote oxidative addition of C(sp2)&#8722;I bonds to gold has been extended to secondary phosphine oxides, but in contrast with related phosphines, a base (NEt3, K2CO3) is needed. Back&#8208;donation prevails over donation in such oxidative additions. The reaction gives access to (P=O,C)&#8208;cyclometallated Au(III) complexes whose SPO moiety can be chemically derivatized.







Abstract
The coordination of secondary phosphine oxides (SPO) was shown to efficiently promote the activation of C(sp2)&#8722;I bonds by gold, as long as a base is added (NEt3, K2CO3). These transformations stand as a new type of chelation&#8208;assisted oxidative addition to gold. The role of the base and the influence of the electronic properties of the P&#8208;ligand were analyzed computationally. Accordingly, the oxidative addition was found to be dominated by Au&#8594;(Ar&#8722;I) backdonation. In this case, gold behaves similarly to palladium, suggesting that the inverse electron flow reported previously (with prevailing (Ar&#8722;I)&#8594;Au donation, resulting in faster reactions of electron&#8208;enriched substrates) is a specific feature of electron&#8208;deficient cationic gold(I) complexes. The reaction gives straightforward access to (P=O,C)&#8208;cyclometallated Au(III) complexes. The possibility to chemically derivatize the SPO moiety at Au(III) was substantiated by protonation and silylation reactions.

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Hydrogenative Reactions Using Liquid Hydrogen Donors: Mechanisms, Catalysts Design, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept summarizes recent development in heterogeneous photocatalysis for hydrogenative reactions from the perspective of hydrogen donors. The basic criteria of hydrogen abstraction from organic molecule and water, donation to the target acceptor, and the design strategy of the photocatalyst materials are discussed.







Abstract
Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a promising approach for a wide range of hydrogenative reactions owing to the mild reaction conditions and the possibility of employing liquid hydrogen donors. Currently, the major interest is focused on the development of high performance photocatalyst materials and the expansion of reaction scope. An overview from a perspective of hydrogen donor and thus the related mechanistic understanding of the light&#8208;induced hydrogenative reactions is rare. Here, we have categorized the photocatalytic hydrogenative reactions by the type of employed liquid hydrogen donors (hydrocarbons and water), discussed the basic criteria of hydrogen abstraction from these donors, and elaborated the design strategy of the photocatalyst materials.

         <title>Regioselective Dehydrogenative Reverse Prenylation of Indoles with 2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene</title>

An efficient C&#8208;3 regioselective dehydrogenation reverse prenylation of indoles has been developed by use of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene as the prenylation reagent. The protocol is of atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economies.







Abstract
Bulk chemical 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene, one of the main C5 distillates of the petrochemical industry, has scarcely been utilized directly in synthesizing high&#8208;value&#8208;added fine chemicals. Herein, we use 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;butene as the starting material to develop a palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly site&#8208; and regio&#8208;selective C&#8208;3 dehydrogenation reverse prenylation of indoles. This synthetic method features mild reaction conditions, a broad substrate scope, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economies.

         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species play critical roles in enzymatic catalysis yet their properties are still poorly understood. In this work we report a combined experimental and computational study into biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo and iron(III)&#8208;oxo complexes with tight second&#8208;coordination sphere environments that restrict substrate access. The work shows that the second&#8208;coordination sphere slows the hydrogen atom abstraction step from toluene dramatically and the kinetics is zeroth order in substrate. However, the iron(II)&#8208;hydroxo that is formed has a low reduction potential and hence cannot do OH rebound favorably. The tolyl radical in solution then reacts further with alternative reaction partners. By contrast, the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species reacts predominantly through OH rebound to form alcohol products. Our studies show that the oxidation state of the metal influences reactivities and selectivities with substrate dramatically and that enzymes will likely need an iron(IV) center to catalyze C&#8722;H hydroxylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Muscle&#8208;Like Supramolecular Polymers with Dual Motion Patterns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benefiting from the features like polymeric linear structures, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and dynamic adaptiveness, supramolecular polymers (SPs) are favored as exploiting muscle&#8208;like materials, allowing for imitating the muscle functions. However, a substantial part of these materials barely owned an unitary motion orientation while it was obviously known that muscle movements involved distinct orientations. Herein, M1 holding the structure of 44&#8208;membered macrocycle with two aldehyde&#160;groups was designed, meanwhile, M2 comprising of secondary ammonium ions, 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups as well as the alkyl chains was fabricated, for which it could be assembled with M1 to generate SPs based on host&#8208;guest interactions from a large macrocycle and two secondary ammonium ions. SPs underwent vertical compression upon the addition of N2H4 owing to the forming dynamic covalent bonds, notably, mechanically interlocked structures were also generated. Afterwards, the vertically compressed SPs experienced horizontal shrinkage when tetrabutylammonium chloride was contributed due to the destruction of host&#8208;guest interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fully Conjugated Benzyne&#8208;Derived Three&#8208;Dimensional Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic polymers (POPs) have gained tremendous attention owing to their chemical tunability, stability and high surface areas. Whereas there are several examples of fully conjugated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) POPs, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ones are rather challenging to realize in the absence of structural templates. Herein, we report the base&#8208;catalyzed direct synthesis of a fully conjugated 3D POPs, named benzyne&#8208;derived polymers (BDPs), containing biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties starting from a simple bisbenzyne precursor, which undergoes [2+2] and [2+2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions to form BDPs primarily composed of biphenylene and tetraphenylene moieties. The resulting polymers exhibited ultramicroporous structures with surface areas up to 544 m2&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;and very high CO2/N2&#160;selectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mild Synthesis of Aryl Triflates Enabling the Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Drug Analogs and Complex Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the discovery of a novel strategy to convert phenols into the corresponding aryl triflates using 1&#8209;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;one in the presence of a fluoride source. This novel reagent can be handled without any precautions to exclude air or moisture making this method highly convenient. The reactions generally show very clean conversions within only a few minutes at room temperature. The mild conditions allow the so far unprecedented O&#8209;triflation of tyrosine in peptides bearing challenging side chains present for example in arginine and histidine including the late&#8208;stage triflation of complex bioactive peptides. We show how aryl triflates &#8211; an interesting but so far underutilized group &#8211; can be used to optimize physicochemical and in vitro properties of compound series in medicinal chemistry. We believe that this method is highly attractive for applications in peptide functionalization as well as automated and medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>[Ni(CO)4]+ as NiI Synthon: Synthesis and Characterization of NiI Half&#8208;Sandwich and Sandwich Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stable, easily accessible salt [Ni(CO)4]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8211; (RF = C(CF3)3) was used as a NiI synthon to generate the novel half&#8208;sandwich complexes [Ni(arene)(CO)2]+ (arene = C6H6, o&#8208;dfb = 1,2&#8208;F2C6H4). By irreversible removal of CO from the equilibrium, even the rather endergonic reaction to a [Ni(o&#8208;dfb)2]+ salt was successful (DrG&#176;(solv) = +78&#160;kJ mol&#8211;1). The latter displays an unprecedented slipped &#951;3,&#951;3&#8208;sandwich structure and is the ultimate synthon to NiI&#8208;chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Observation for Dynamic Oscillation during Self&#8208;Assembly and Clearance of A&#946;42</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By performing a real&#8208;time observation and molecular dynamics investigation, we identified a non&#8208;equilibrium interaction occurring in the self&#8208;assembled pathway of A&#946;42 that dominated neuronal survival during interplay with an oscillator. A specific bait could further lengthen the lifetime of dynamic oscillation for heteromolecular binding by slowing down the self&#8208;propagation of A&#946;42, enhancing the efficiency of A&#946;42 clearance by neuronal cells.







Abstract
The dynamic oscillation implicated in structural heterogeneity during the self&#8208;assembly of amyloid peptide 1&#8211;42 (A&#946;42) may play a crucial role in eliciting cellular responses. We developed a real&#8208;time monitoring platform to observe an oscillatory non&#8208;equilibrium interaction that dominated the A&#946;42 clearance by neuronal cells during interplay with an oscillator (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). Molecular dynamics studies indicated that the electrostatic and hydrophobic segments of LPS involved in the temporary heteromolecular association and slightly decelerated the intrinsic thermally&#8211;induced protein dynamics of A&#946;42. A bait&#8208;specific intervention strategy could temporarily slow down the self&#8208;propagation of A&#946;42 to extend the lifetime of autonomous oscillation and augment A&#946;42 clearance of neuronal cells. The lifetime increment of oscillation shows a bait concentration&#8208;dependent manner to reflect the non&#8208;equilibrium binding strength. This relationship may serve as a predictor for Alzheimer's disease drug discovery.

         <title>Synergistic Visible Light Photocatalysis with Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the strategy of merging visible light photocatalysis and organocatalysis has been utilized and applied in a wide range of reactions. Taking advantage of synergistic visible light photocatalysis with organocatalysis, remarkable progress has recently been achieved in modern chemical synthesis. In these dual catalytic systems, photocatalysts or photosensitizers absorb visible light to induce their photo&#8208;excited states which can activate unreactive substrates via electron or energy transfer mechanisms, and organocatalysts are usually employed to control the chemical reactivities of the other substrates. This review mainly focuses on the recent development of cooperative catalysis by the combination of organocatalysis and photocatalysis in recent organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonyl Diazaborine &#8216;Click&#8217; Chemistry Enables Rapid and Efficient Bioorthogonal Labeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Finding an ideal biorthogonal reaction that responds to a wide range of biological queries and applications is of great interest in biomedical applications. Rapid diazaborine (DAB) formation in water by the reactions of ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid with &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles is an attractive conjugation module. Nevertheless, these conjugation reactions demand to satisfy stringent criteria for biorthogonal applications. Here we show that widely used sulfonyl hydrazide (SHz) offers a stable DAB conjugate by combining with ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid at physiological pH, competent for an optimal biorthogonal reaction. Remarkably, the reaction conversion is quantitative and rapid (k2&#160;&gt;103&#160;M&#8208;1s&#8208;1) at low micromolar concentrations, and it preserves comparable efficacy in a complex biological milieu. DFT calculations support that SHz facilitates DAB formation via the most stable hydrazone intermediate and the lowest energy transition state compared to other biocompatible &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles. This conjugation is extremely efficient on living cell surfaces, enabling compelling pretargeted imaging and peptide delivery. We anticipate this work will permit addressing a wide range of cell biology queries and drug discovery platforms exploiting commercially available sulfonyl hydrazide fluorophores and derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Tf2O&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization/Trifluoromethylselenolation of Alkynes for Synthesis of CF3Se&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Constructing pH&#8208;Responsive and Tunable Azo&#8208;Phenol&#8208;Based o&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Photocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple triggered&#8208;release strategies are widely utilized to control the release of caged target molecules. Among them, photocages with conditional triggers provide extra layers of control in photorelease. In this work, we designed a series of pH&#8208;responsive photocages that could be triggered under irradiation and specific intracellular pH values. We conjugated the pH&#8208;sensitive phenolic groups with o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNB) to form azo&#8208;phenolic NPX photocages with tunable pKa. Our azo&#8208;phenol&#8208;based oNB photocages showed differentiable photoreleasing profiles at pH 5.0, 7.2 and 9.0. By attaching fluorogenic cargos, we were able to show that one of the photocages, NPdiCl, could be used to differentiate between acidic pH 5.0 and neutral pH 7.2 in cells under artificial pH conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that NPdiCl is a promising pH&#8208;responsive photocage for photoreleasing cargo inside acidic tumor cells.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is the development of a novel method for activating thioglycosides without a glycosyl halide intermediate. This has been achieved through the use of a silver salt coupled with an acid additive and molecular iodine. Unreactive in the presence of iodine, disarmed thioglycosides showed high reactivity under the developed reaction conditions. It has been demonstrated that the stereocontrol can be achieved using the H&#8208;bond mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) method, and the extended glycan synthesis can be achieved via the iteration of protecting group removal and glycosylation steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Sequential Catalytic Arylation&#8208;Fukuyama Cross&#8208;coupling of 1,1&#8208;Biszincioalkane Linchpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one pot double cross&#8208;coupling sequence employing gem C(sp3)&#8208;organodizinc dinucleophiles is achieved for the first time with high enantioselectivity through an original strategy relying on the combination of a first non&#8208;stereoselective desymmetrization reaction delivering a racemic stereolabile mono&#8208;organozinc intermediate that undergoes subsequent catalytic deracemization. A modular entry to enantioenriched 1&#8208;arylalkyl ketones is developed.







Abstract
1,1&#8208;Bis(iodozincio)alkanes are used as dinucleophilic linchpins in an enantioselective double cross&#8208;coupling reaction sequence involving aryl iodides and then thioesters. The two catalytic C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions are achieved in the same pot through two distinct palladium&#8208;based catalytic systems: a first non&#8208;enantioselective one delivering configurationally labile secondary benzylzinc species from an achiral precursor, and a second enantioconvergent one that operates a highly efficient dynamic kinetic resolution of the racemic intermediates. This strategy, new in the area of asymmetric synthesis through two consecutive electrophilic substitution reactions of geminated C(sp3)&#8208;organodimetallics, provides useful methodology to access in a modular fashion acyclic &#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketone products with very high enantiomeric purity.

         <title>A Brick&#8208;Wall Topological 2D Covalent Organic Framework Constructed from an H&#8208;Shaped &#8220;Two&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare brick&#8208;wall topological imine COF (H&#8208;Blm&#8208;COF) was prepared by self&#8208;condensation of an H&#8208;shaped &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomer, which displayed excellent rejection efficiency towards ionic dyes.







Abstract
As an emerging class of porous crystalline material, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received considerable research interests in terms of exploring new architectures and functions. Herein, we developed an unprecedented &#8220;H&#8208;shaped&#8221; monomer, upon self&#8208;polycondensation, which facilely produced a benzoimidazole&#8208;based COF (H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF) with a rarely reported brick&#8208;wall topology. H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF displayed high crystallinity, nano&#8208;sized porosity, and high thermal and chemical stabilities. Interestingly, H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF based membranes showed selective permeability towards different solvents, which related to the size and polarity of the guest molecule. Additionally, initial study suggested the COF displayed excellent rejection efficiency towards ionic dyes, for example chromium black T (99.7&#8201;%) and rhodamine B (97.3&#8201;%). This work provides insights into developing new topological COFs by designing monomers with new configurations.

         <title>Intermolecular Dearomative 1,2&#8208;Amination/Carbonylation via Nucleophilic Addition of Simple Amines to Arene &#960;&#8208;Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multicomponent reaction for dearomative 1,2&#8208;amination/carbonylation of chromium&#8208;bound arenes using simple amines as nitrogen source has been developed, providing rapid access to poly&#8208;functionalized alicyclic compounds containing amino and amide functionalities.







Abstract
The incorporation of the privileged amino functionality is of paramount importance in organic synthesis. In contrast to the well&#8208;developed amination methods for alkenes, the dearomative amination of arenes is largely underexplored due to the inherently inert reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;bonds and selectivity challenges. Herein, we report an intermolecular dearomative aminofunctionalization via direct nucleophilic addition of simple amines to chromium&#8208;bound arenes. This multicomponent 1,2&#8208;amination/carbonylation reaction enables rapid access to complicated alicyclic compounds containing amino and amide functionalities from benzene derivatives under CO&#8208;gas&#8208;free conditions, which also represents the first application of nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles in &#951;6&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced arene dearomatizations.

         <title>Deoxygenative Radical Boration of Inert Amides via a Combination of Relay and Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deoxygenative boration of widely occurring amides is developed, which combines relay and cooperative catalysis with Ir&#8208;photoredox&#8208;organo catalysis to build structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;amino organoborons in one pot. The boryl radical generated in&#8197;situ is applied as the functionalization partner instead of traditional nucleophile in this reductive transformation of amides, thus overcoming the limitation of [C]&#8208;functionalization reagents to deliver high value&#8208;added &#945;&#8208;boryl amines.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A deoxygenative boration of widely occurring amides is developed, which combines relay and cooperative catalysis with Ir-photoredox-organo catalysis to build structurally diverse &#945;-amino organoborons in one pot. The boryl radical generated in&#8197;situ is applied as the functionalization partner instead of traditional nucleophile in this reductive transformation of amides, thus overcoming the limitation of [C]-functionalization reagents to deliver high value-added &#945;-boryl amines.

         <title>&#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;Iodanes: Substituent Effects and Pseudorotation/Hypervalent Twisting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes exhibit positional isomerization through pseudorotation or twisting; the latter have been invoked for the stability as well as the reactivities of iodanes. Judicious exploitation of sterics around iodine atom of the iodane is found to enhance its reactivity. This review collates the literature developments on the effect of substituents and twisting/pseudorotation in iodanes, and their synthetic applications.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine (III and V) compounds exhibit positional isomerization through pseudorotation or twisting; the latter have been invoked for the stability as well as the reactivity of &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes. By judicious exploitation of sterics, the twisting process in iodanes can be facilitated to promote reactivity. For example, ortho&#8208;substitution in &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes accelerates &#945;&#8208;tosyloxylation of ketones and oxidation of alcohols. The enhancement of reactivity arises from sterically&#8208;induced non&#8208;planarity and the resultant weakening of the 3c&#8211;4e bonds involving the hypervalent iodine atom. The ortho&#8208;substitution constitutes an important strategy to maneuver reactivity, control selectivity, and develop new catalysts, including chiral, for diverse reactions. This review entails coverage of the literature developments in regard to the effect of substituents and twisting/pseudorotation on the stability as well as the reactivity of hypervalent &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes, and the application of the latter for synthetic transformations.

         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry is a valuable tool used by modern synthetic chemists who use electricity to facilitate redox reactions. In this image, created by Karrar Nadhom, the dragon provides the electrical surge to create a reaction between sodium nitrite and a secondary amine, which are fused to form the N&#8208;nitroso product. Despite dragons being extinct in most parts of the world, the title reaction is an ecologically green process, as indicated by the colour of the dragon. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Wirth and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300957).

         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;component umpolung cascade reaction of phenols, C60, and nucleophiles has been developed as a practical and efficient protocol for one&#8208;pot synthesis of diversified 1,4&#8208;[60]fullerephenols.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component umpolung cascade coupling reaction of phenols, C60, and different nucleophiles which includes H2O, alcohols, triphenylamines and carbazoles was developed. Furthermore, one&#8208;pot 1,4&#8208;bisphenol coupling on C60 has been realized by this method. This practical protocol features high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, wide substrate range, easy operation and low cost, thus providing a robust method for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of various unsymmetrical 1,4&#8208;[60]fullerephenols.

         <title>Reversible Pressure&#8208;Magnetic Modulation in a Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Dyad Piezochromic Dysprosium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet
</title>

         <dc:description>
The Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet behaviour of an isotopically enriched dysprosium piezochromic mononuclear complex was modulated by applying an external pressure.







Abstract
The extreme sensitivity of trivalent lanthanide ions to crystal field variations led to the emergence of single&#8208;molecule magnetic switching under various stimuli. The use of pressure as an external stimulus instead of classic light irradiation, oxidation or any chemical reactions allows a fine tuning of the magnetic modulation. Here the well&#8208;known pure isotopically enriched [162Dy(tta)3(L)]&#8901;C6H14 (162Dy) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) (tta&#8722;=2&#8208;2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetonate and L=4,5&#8208;bis(propylthio)&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine) was experimentally investigated by single&#8208;crystal diffraction and squid magnetometry under high applied pressures. Both reversible piezochromic properties and pressure modulation of the slow magnetic relaxation behavior were demonstrated and supported by ab initio calculations. The magnetic study of the diluted sample [162Dy0.05Y0.95(tta)3(L)]&#8901;C6H14 (162Dy@Y) indicated that variations in the electronic structure have mainly intermolecular origin with weak intramolecular contribution. Quantitative magnetic interpretation concludes to a deterioration of the Orbach process for the benefit of both Raman and QTM mechanisms under applied pressure.

         <title>Matched Ligands for Small, Stable Colloidal Nanoparticles of Copper, Cuprous Oxide and Cuprous Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small and stable colloidal nanoparticles of copper, cuprous oxide and cuprous sulfide were synthesized exploiting the organometallic chemistry of copper mesityl. Sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities of X&#8208;type carboxylate and di(thio)carboxylate ligands were used to produce colloidal nanoparticles; the nature of the ligand influences both the nanoparticle solubility and stability.







Abstract
This work applies organometallic routes to copper(0/I) nanoparticles and describes how to match ligand chemistries with different material compositions. The syntheses involve reacting an organo&#8208;copper precursor, mesitylcopper(I) [CuMes]z (z=4, 5), at low temperatures and in organic solvents, with hydrogen, air or hydrogen sulfide to deliver Cu, Cu2O or Cu2S nanoparticles. Use of sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities of protonated ligand (pro&#8208;ligand; 0.1&#8211;0.2&#8197;equivalents vs. [CuMes]z) allows saturation of surface coordination sites but avoids excess pro&#8208;ligand contaminating the nanoparticle solutions. The pro&#8208;ligands are nonanoic acid (HO2CR1), 2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (HO2CR2) or di(thio)nonanoic acid, (HS2CR1), and are matched to the metallic, oxide or sulfide nanoparticles. Ligand exchange reactions reveal that copper(0) nanoparticles may be coordinated by carboxylate or di(thio)carboxylate ligands, but Cu2O is preferentially coordinated by carboxylate ligands and Cu2S by di(thio)carboxylate ligands. This work highlights the opportunities for organometallic routes to well&#8208;defined nanoparticles and the need for appropriate ligand selection.

     alt="Matched Ligands for Small, Stable Colloidal Nanoparticles of Copper, Cuprous Oxide and Cuprous Sulfide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-small and stable colloidal nanoparticles of copper, cuprous oxide and cuprous sulfide were synthesized exploiting the organometallic chemistry of copper mesityl. Sub-stoichiometric quantities of X-type carboxylate and di(thio)carboxylate ligands were used to produce colloidal nanoparticles; the nature of the ligand influences both the nanoparticle solubility and stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work applies organometallic routes to copper(0/I) nanoparticles and describes how to match ligand chemistries with different material compositions. The syntheses involve reacting an organo-copper precursor, mesitylcopper(I) [CuMes]&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; (z=4, 5), at low temperatures and in organic solvents, with hydrogen, air or hydrogen sulfide to deliver Cu, Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nanoparticles. Use of sub-stoichiometric quantities of protonated ligand (pro-ligand; 0.1&#8211;0.2&#8197;equivalents vs. [CuMes]&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;) allows saturation of surface coordination sites but avoids excess pro-ligand contaminating the nanoparticle solutions. The pro-ligands are nonanoic acid (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CR&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or di(thio)nonanoic acid, (HS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CR&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and are matched to the metallic, oxide or sulfide nanoparticles. Ligand exchange reactions reveal that copper(0) nanoparticles may be coordinated by carboxylate or di(thio)carboxylate ligands, but Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is preferentially coordinated by carboxylate ligands and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S by di(thio)carboxylate ligands.

         <title>To Isomerize or not to Isomerize? E/Z Isomers of Cyclic Azobenzene Derivatives and Their Reactivity Upon One&#8208;Electron Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;electron reduction of azo compounds generally results in isomerization forming the thermodynamically most stable radical anion. It is shown that the size of the central ring in 1,2&#8208;diazocines and diazonines has a ruling influence on the configuration of the one&#8208;electron reduced species.







Abstract
Azo compounds are efficient electron acceptors. Upon one&#8208;electron reduction they generally isomerize forming the thermodynamically most stable radical anion. Herein we show that the size of the central ring in 1,2&#8208;diazocines and diazonines has a ruling influence on the configuration of the one&#8208;electron reduced species. Markedly, diazonines, which bear a central nine membered heterocycle, show light&#8208;induced E/Z isomerization, but retain the configuration of the diazene N=N moiety upon one&#8208;electron reduction. Accordingly, E/Z isomerization is not induced by reduction.

         <title>Engineering the BASHY Dye Platform toward Architectures with Responsive Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BASHY dyes, such as the one drawn in the foreground, are prepared in a multicomponent reaction. This is symbolized by the background, which shows part of a beach that is made of sea&#8208;washed stones and which is located in the North of Portugal (Praia de Belinho). The BASHY dyes discussed in the Research Article by P.&#8197;M.&#8197;P. Gois, U. Pischel and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300579) show several photophysical features such as fluorescence, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), which jointly orchestrate the function of the dye.

4,4&#8217;&#8208;Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (4,4&#8217;&#8208;MDI) is a key diisocyanate linker in the production of polyurethanes. 4,4&#8217;&#8208;MDI is thermally unstable, undergoing dimerization to unreactive and insoluble uretdione. The &#8220;catch&#8211;store&#8211;release&#8221; strategy presented in the Research Article by S. Groysman and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300924) allows 4,4&#8217;&#8208;MDI to be stabilized in the form of an imidazolium amidate that is produced by the coordination of two equivalents of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. The complex can be released by heating with CuCl (with or without sulfur); this forms a CuI carbene/urea complex and restores MDI. Artwork by the authors with help from Mary Iverson.

         <title>Organoiridium Complexes Enhance Cellular Defense Against Reactive Aldehydes Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive aldehyde species (RASP) have been implicated in numerous diseases due to their ability to alkylate or crosslink biomolecules. In this work, it was demonstrated that iridium small&#8208;molecule intracellular metal catalysts protect cells from RASP&#8208;induced cell death with greater efficiency than conventional aldehyde scavengers. A catalyst&#8208;based detoxification strategy could offer unique benefits over those relying on stoichiometric reactants.







Abstract
Although reactive aldehyde species (RASP) are associated with the pathogenesis of many major diseases, there are currently no clinically approved treatments for RASP overload. Conventional aldehyde detox agents are stoichiometric reactants that get consumed upon reacting with their biological targets, which limits their therapeutic efficiency. To achieve longer&#8208;lasting detoxification effects, small&#8208;molecule intracellular metal catalysts (SIMCats) were used to protect cells by converting RASP into non&#8208;toxic alcohols. It was shown that SIMCats were significantly more effective in lowering cell death from the treatment with 4&#8208;hydroxynon&#8208;2&#8208;enal than aldehyde scavengers over a 72&#8197;h period. Studies revealed that SIMCats reduced the aldehyde accumulation in cells exposed to the known RASP inducer arsenic trioxide. This work demonstrates that SIMCats offer unique benefits over stochiometric agents, potentially providing new ways to combat diseases with greater selectivity and efficiency than existing approaches.

         <title>Bonding in Low&#8208;Coordinated Organoarsenic and Organoantimony Compounds: A Threshold Photoelectron Spectroscopic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biradical formation vs. &#960;&#8208;bonding: The low&#8208;valent, highly reactive pnictogen compounds PnCH3 (Pn=As, Sb) have been generated in situ by controlled homolysis of Pn(CH3)3 in the gas phase and investigated by photoelectron&#8211;photoion coincidence spectroscopy. This allowed us to establish trends in nature's strategy to stabilize low&#8208;valent pnictogen species either by tautomerization with concomitant multiple bond formation (HPn=CH2) or by biradical formation (Pn&#8722;CH3). The graphic illustrates the energetic steps separating the isomers of these fundamentally important group 15 compounds. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Lichtenberg, P. Hemberger, I. Fischer and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300637).

         <title>Balanced Energy Gaps as a Key Design Rule for Solution&#8208;Phase Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free organic emitters that display solution&#8208;phase room temperature phosphorescence (sRTP) remain exceedingly rare. Here, we investigate the structural and photophysical properties that support sRTP by comparing a recently reported sRTP compound (BTaz&#8208;Th&#8208;PXZ) to two novel analogous materials, replacing the donor group by either acridine or phenothiazine. The emissive triplet excited state remains fixed in all three cases, while the emissive charge&#8208;transfer singlet states (and the calculated paired charge&#8208;transfer T2 state) vary with the donor unit. While all three materials show dominant RTP in film, in solution different singlet&#8208;triplet and triplet&#8208;triplet energy gaps give rise to triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation followed by weak sRTP for the new compounds, compared to dominant sRTP throughout for the original PXZ material. Engineering both the sRTP state and higher charge&#8208;transfer states therefore emerges as a crucial element in designing emitters capable of sRTP.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Stabilized Liquid Crystal Films Containing Dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;Based Chiral Photoswitch: Multi&#8208;Modulation for Environment&#8208;Adaptative Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A polymer&#8208;stabilized liquid crystal (PSLC) based environment&#8208;adaptative smart window with multi&#8208;modulations is demonstrated. This PSLC system contains a right&#8208;handed dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;based chiral photoswitch and a chiral dopant S811 with the opposite handedness, of which the reversible cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of the switch can drive the self&#8208;shading of the smart window under UV light stimulus because of the transition from nematic phase to cholesteric one. With the assistance of solar heat, the opacity of the smart window can be deepened due to that heat promotes the isomerization conversion rate of the switch. This switch has no thermal relaxation, so the smart window exhibits dual stabilization: transparent state (cis&#8208;isomer) and opaque state (trans&#8208;isomer). Meanwhile, the throughput of sunlight can be regulated by an electric field, which meets the need in some specific situations. Such an energy&#8208;saving device can be applied to buildings and vehicles to control indoor temperature and adapt to the required ambiance.</dc:description>

         <title>Sunlight Induced and Alternative Sc(OTf)3 Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Halogenation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The remote C5&#8208;H halogenation has been achieved ether by natural light or catalytic Sc(OTf)3 under mild condition. Moreover, the cascade C6&#8208;H bromination and benzylic C&#8722;H oxidation under photocatalytic conditions was also discussed.







Abstract
A mild and catalyst&#8208;free sunlight induced protocol for the remote meta bromination of electron&#8208;deficient indoles is described for the first time. Herein, N&#8208;bromosaccharin is activated by sunlight irradiation. Alternately, a synergistic activation model (Sc(OTf)3/HFIP) has also been developed for the activation of haloniums, complementary to the light induced strategy. In addition, the cascade C6&#8208;H bromination and benzylic C&#8722;H oxidation under photocatalytic conditions was also discussed. High regio&#8208;and chem&#8208;selectivity, mild reaction conditions, and scalability demonstrate great potential of the developed methods in practical applications and further functionalization.

         <title>Numerical Simulation and Experimental Study of Methyl Ammonium Bismuth Iodide Absorber Layer Based Lead Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SCAPS&lt;?&#8194;&gt;1D simulation software was to investigate the simulation of lead&#8208;free methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9) based perovskite solar cells. The study examined various electron and hole transport layers and optimized the thickness of each layer using the software. The results showed a power conversion efficiency of 14.07&#8201;% via the simulation software, and reasonable efficiency and open circuit voltage in the fabricated MA3Bi2I9 based perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
In the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the development and production of perovskite or perovskite&#8208;like materials that do not contain lead (Pb) for the purpose of constructing solar cells. The development and testing of lead&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;like structures for solar cells is crucial. In this study, we used the solar cell capacitance software (SCAPS) to simulate perovskite solar cells based on methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9). The electron&#8208;transport layer, hole&#8208;transport layer, and absorber layer thickness were optimized using SCAPS. The simulated perovskite solar cells (FTO/TiO2/MA3Bi2I9/spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/Au) performed well with a power conversion efficiency of 14.07&#8201;% and a reasonable open circuit voltage of 1.34&#8197;V, using the optimized conditions determined by SCAPS. Additionally, we conducted experiments to fabricate perovskite solar cells under controlled humidity, which showed a power conversion efficiency of 1.31&#8201;%.

The results showed a power conversion efficiency of 14.07&#8201;% via the simulation software, and reasonable efficiency and open circuit voltage in the fabricated MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; based perovskite solar cells.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the development and production of perovskite or perovskite-like materials that do not contain lead (Pb) for the purpose of constructing solar cells. The development and testing of lead-free perovskite-like structures for solar cells is crucial. In this study, we used the solar cell capacitance software (SCAPS) to simulate perovskite solar cells based on methyl ammonium bismuth iodide (MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;). The electron-transport layer, hole-transport layer, and absorber layer thickness were optimized using SCAPS. The simulated perovskite solar cells (FTO/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;/spiro-OMeTAD/Au) performed well with a power conversion efficiency of 14.07&#8201;% and a reasonable open circuit voltage of 1.34&#8197;V, using the optimized conditions determined by SCAPS. Additionally, we conducted experiments to fabricate perovskite solar cells under controlled humidity, which showed a power conversion efficiency of 1.31&#8201;%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>UV&#8208;Blocking and Light&#8208;Responsive Poly (&#1013;&#8208;Caprolactone)/ZIF&#8208;8 Multifunctional Composite Films for Efficient Antibacterial Activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PQZ composite films have many concurrent properties, including antibacterial, UV&#8208;blocking, hydrophobicity, thermal stability, and high tensile strength, which are extremely important for their application as food packaging materials.







Abstract
Antibacterial photodynamic therapy (APDT) has received considerable attention owing to its superiority. ZIF&#8208;8 was used to address the poor stability of the photosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB) encapsulation to synthesize RB@ZIF&#8208;8 NPs, which were doped into a composite film with poly (&#1013;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) and polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;quaternary ammonium chitosan (PVA&#8208;QCS) as substrates to form composite films (PQZ). The composite films exhibited excellent photodynamic sterilization and good resistance to bacterial adhesion. The tensile strength of the film increased to 43.4&#8197;MPa, which was approximately 1.8&#8197;times that of the PCL film. With the addition of SiO2 and RB@ZIF&#8208;8 NPs, the film exhibited water repellency and UV&#8208;blocking properties. RAW264.7&#8197;cells were selected using the MTT method to confirm that the composite films had excellent biocompatibility and had no significant inhibitory effect on cell growth and reproduction. PQZ multifunctional composite films show potential as novel APDT antimicrobial materials for food packaging.

         <title>Tr&#246;ger's Base&#8208;Based Cuboid Constructed by Chiral Self&#8208;Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cuboid constructed by self&#8208;discrimination of a chiral macrocycle (TBBP) is reported. Iodine vapor is used to stimulate the cuboid structure to transform its stacking mode. The cuboid&#8208;stacking mode collapsed and opened the sealed cavity of TBBP in the process of the formation of TBBP&#8208;iodine complexes. Additionally, TBBP shows high iodine uptake up to 3.43&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Cuboid, a basic geometric structure, has been widely applied in architecture and mathematics. In chemistry, the introduction of cuboid structures always provides a specific structural shape, enhances the stability of the structure and improves the performance of materials. Herein, a simple strategy exploiting self&#8208;discrimination to construct a cuboid&#8208;stacking crystal material is proposed, in which a chiral macrocycle (TBBP) based on Tr&#246;ger's base (TB) and benzophenone (BP) was synthesized as the building element of the cuboid. The cuboid is designed to be transformable compared with cuboid structures in previous work. For this reason, it is considered that the cuboid&#8208;stacking structure can be transformed through external stimulation. Iodine vapor is selected as the external stimulus to transform the cuboid&#8208;stacking structure due to the favorable interaction between iodine and the cuboid. The changes in the stacking mode of TBBP is studied by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD). To our surprise, this Tr&#246;ger's base&#8208;based cuboid shows strong iodine adsorption capacity up to 3.43&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 and exhibits potential as a crystal material for iodine adsorption.

         <title>Excited State Processes in Supramolecular Complexes of Cyclic Dibenzopyrrolopyrrole Isomers with C60 Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient charge separation and low sensitivity to the spatial orientation of monomeric units in tetramer make host&#8211;guest complexes of cyclic dibenzopyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles attractive for photovoltaic applications.







Abstract
An approach to modulating the properties of carbon nanorings by incorporating pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole units is of particular interest due to the combined effect of heteroatom and antiaromatic character on electronic properties. The inclusion of units other than phenylene leads to the formation of stereoisomers. In this work, we computationally study how the spatial orientation of monomeric units in the ring affects the properties of cyclic dibenzopyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles and their complexes with C60 fullerene. For [4]PP and [4]DHPP, the most symmetrical AAAA isomer is the most stable and forms stronger interactions with fullerene than the isomers where one or two monomeric units are flipped, mostly due to less Pauli repulsion. &#960;&#8208;Electron delocalization in the monomeric unit is crucial for directing the electron transfer (from or to nanoring). The energy of excited states with charge transfer depends on the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, which varies from one stereoisomer to another only for [4]DHPP&#8835;C60 with aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole units. The rates of electron transfer and charge recombination reactions are relatively weakly dependent of the spatial isomerism of nanorings.

         <dc:description>Herein, we present an unprecedented azine&#8208;limited C5&#8208;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;aminopyridines enabled by a transient and electron&#8208;deficient perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species via C&#8208;H/C&#8208;H coupling. The protocol further allows C3(5)&#8208;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;alkoxypyridines guided by sterics and electronics for the first time. The late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H functionalization of drugs, drug derivatives, and natural product derivatives and synthesis of C5&#8208;aryl drug derivatives further demonstrated the method&#8217;s utility. The preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic combination of the bulky yet electrophilic perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species and the partial nucleophilicity of the C5&#8208;position of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines is the origin of reactivity and selectivity.

         <title>Thienoindolizines and their Benzo&#8208;Fused Derivatives:

Synthesis and Physical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of thienoindolizine structural isomers have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step procedure starting from easily accessible gem&#8208;difluoroalkene functionalized bromothiophenes. The developed method gives easy access to a range of thienoindolizine products containing thieno[3,2&#8208;g]&#8208;, thieno[3,4&#8208;g]&#8208; and thieno[2,3&#8208;g]indolizine core structures. The described synthesis strategy consists of a base mediated, transition metal free nucleophilic substitution of fluorine atoms by nitrogen containing heterocycles followed by a Pd catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. A series of 22 final product examples has been obtained with yields ranging from 29% to 95%. UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime measurements and cyclic voltammetry were carried out with selected final products to evaluate structural effects on photophysical and electrochemical properties.

The developed method gives easy access to a range of thienoindolizine products containing thieno[3,2-g]-, thieno[3,4-g]- and thieno[2,3-g]indolizine core structures. The described synthesis strategy consists of a base mediated, transition metal free nucleophilic substitution of fluorine atoms by nitrogen containing heterocycles followed by a Pd catalyzed intramolecular cyclization. A series of 22 final product examples has been obtained with yields ranging from 29% to 95%. UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime measurements and cyclic voltammetry were carried out with selected final products to evaluate structural effects on photophysical and electrochemical properties. (TD)DFT and NICS calculations were performed to provide insight into the electronic properties of the four core molecular structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steric Control over the Threading of Pyrophosphonates with One&#160;or Two Cyanostar Macrocycles during Pseudorotaxane Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The supramolecular recognition of anions is increasingly harnessed to achieve the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular architectures, ranging from cages and polymers to (pseudo)rotaxanes. The cyanostar (CS) macrocycle has previously been shown to form 2:1 complexes with organophosphate anions that can be turned into [3]rotaxanes by stoppering. Here we achieved steric control over the assembly of pseudorotaxanes comprising the cyanostar macrocycle and a thread based, for the first time, on organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates. Subtle differences in steric bulk on the threads allowed formation of either [3]pseudorotaxanes or [2]pseudorotaxanes. We demonstrate that the threading kinetics are governed by the steric demand of the organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates and in one case, slows down to the timescale of minutes. Calculations show that the dianions sterically offset inside the macrocycles. Our findings broaden the scope of cyanostar&#8208;anion assemblies and may have relevance for the design of molecular machines whose directionality is a result of relatively slow slipping.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed Synthesis of Aryl and Alkenyl Halides from Fluorosulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl and alkenyl halides are widely used as key intermediates in organic synthesis, particularly for the formation of organometallic reagents or as radical precursors. They are also found in pharmaceutical and agrochemical ingredients. In this work, we report the synthesis of aryl and alkenyl halides from the corresponding fluorosulfonates using commercially available ruthenium catalysts. Notably, this is the first conversion of phenols to aryl halides that is efficient with chloride, bromide, and iodide. Fluorosulfonates are readily prepared using sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) and less expensive substitutes for triflates. Although aryl fluorosulfonates and their reactions are well known, this is the first report of an efficient coupling of alkenyl fluorosulfonates. To finish, we have demonstrated, by means of representative examples, that the reaction is possible in a one&#8208;pot process, starting directly from the phenol or aldehyde.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;functionalized Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Battery Cycling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur&#160;batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their outstanding theoretical energy density. However, they suffer from low sulfur utilization and poor cyclability, greatly limiting their practical implementation. Herein, we adopted a phosphate&#8208;functionalized zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) as an&#160;inorganic host for sulfur. With their porous structure, remarkable electrochemical stability, and synthetic versatility, Zr&#8208;MOFs present great potential in preventing soluble polysulfides from leaching. Phosphate groups were introduced to the framework post&#8208;synthetically since they have shown a strong affinity towards lithium polysulfides and an ability to facilitate Li ion transport. The successful incorporation of phosphate in MOF&#8208;808 was demonstrated by a series of techniques including infrared spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis. When employed in batteries, phosphate&#8208;functionalized Zr&#8208;MOF (MOF&#8208;808&#8208;PO4) exhibits significantly enhanced sulfur utilization and ion diffusion compared to the parent framework, leading to higher capacity and rate capability. The good capacity retention and inhibited self&#8208;discharge rate also demonstrate effective polysulfide encapsulation utilizing MOF&#8208;808&#8208;PO4. Furthermore, we explored their potential towards high&#8208;density batteries by examining the cycling performance at various sulfur loadings. Our approach to correlate structure with function using hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic materials offers new chemical design strategies for advancing battery materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Electrocatalysts for the Selective 2e&#8208; Oxygen Reduction Reaction: A Never&#8208;Ending Story?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis via the 2e&#8208; Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) represents a highly challenging, environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective alternative to the current anthraquinone&#8208;based technology. Various lightweight element hetero&#8208;doped carbon&#160;nanostructures are promising and cheap metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis, particularly those containing O&#8208;functionalities. The exact role of O&#8208;containing functional groups as electroactive sites for the process remains debated if not highly controversial. Herein, we have reported on the covalent exohedral functionalization to the outer surface of extra&#8208;pure Multi&#8208;walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) with discrete O&#8208;functional groups as a unique approach to prepare selective electrocatalysts for the process. This kind of decoration has added fundamental tiles to the puzzling structure/reactivity relationship of O&#8208;containing carbon&#8208;based catalysts for ORR, clearing doubts on the controversial role of hydroxyl/phenol groups as key functionalities for the design of more performing 2e&#8208; ORR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Y&#8208;Shaped D&#8208;A Type Thioxanthone Derivatives: Mechano&#8208;Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and High&#8208;Contrast Mechano&#8208;Responsive Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;contrast mechano&#8208;responsive luminescence (MRL) materials with mechano&#8208;induced emission enhancement properties are fascinating candidates but few, for applications in rewritable media and recording devices. Here, an interesting design strategy of &#8220;Y&#8208;shape&#8221; donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type molecules for high&#8208;contrast MRL materials was presented, based on substituted diphenylamine donor and planar acceptor. Interestingly, their D&#8208;A torsion angles are small in crystals but increased after ground, resulted in planar and twist intramolecular charge transfer (PICT and TICT) states, respectively. Therefore, high&#8208;contrast MRL switching between weak blue (450 nm) fluorescence and bright yellow (552 nm) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can be achieved for compound TXDO (4,4'&#8208;dimethoxydiphenylamine donor), which photoluminescence quantum yield increased from 2.8% to 54.7% after ground. Most importantly, the two independent D&#8208;A conjugation dihedral angles are actually independent in the &#8220;Y&#8208;shape&#8221; molecules. Especially for compound TXDT (4,4'&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphenylamine donor), its crystal exhibited both PICT and TICT processes inside, resulted from the different dihedral angles of 11.8&#176; and 35.5&#176;, respectively. The TXDT crystal thus showed dual&#8208;peak emission, including both TICT fluorescence and PICT room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Therefore, this strategy of "Y&#8208;shape" D&#8208;A type molecules provide a new approach to design advanced luminescent materials with mechano&#8208;induced TADF feature, for high&#8208;contrast MRL and single&#8208;component white luminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide Stapling&#160;with Boronate Esters&#8211; A Reversible Folding of (Artificial) Peptide Chain to &#945;&#8208;Helix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilization of a peptide conformation via stapling strategy may be realized by the reversible or more often irreversible connection of side chains being in mutually appropriate geometry. An incorporation of phenylboronic acid and sugar residues (fructonic or galacturonic acid), attached to two lysine side chains via amide bonds and separated by 2, 3, or 6 other residues in the C&#8208;terminal fragment of RNase A introduces the intramolecular interaction stabilizing the &#945;&#8208;helical organization. The boronate ester stapling is stabilized in mild basic conditions and may be switched off by acidification leading to unfolded organization of the peptide chain. We investigated the possibility of using switchable stapling by mass spectrometry, NMR and UV&#8208;CD spectroscopies, and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

We investigated the possibility of using switchable stapling by mass spectrometry, NMR and UV-CD spectroscopies, and DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of faradaic interlayer confinement and carbon&#8208;centered macro structure designs for ion capture and recovery of elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Environmental protection associated with renewable energy is among the most critical challenges for translational ion&#8208;capture based on capacitive storage of ions in electrical double layers at the interface of electrode and electrolyte. Electric double&#8208;layer capacitance with charge induction and faradaic pseudo&#8208;capacitance with charge transfer which classifies the capacitance of the electrochemical interface. The electrochemical interface in most energy technologies involves porous and pseudocapacitive redox materials that offer a varying degree of electrolyte confinement. In this review, we have discussed the factors affecting water desalination, such as the effect of nanopores for ion capture, the ion sieving effect, effect of hydration energy, and hydration radius in the carbon sub&#8208;nanometer pore. Moreover, the surface phenomena of electrodes, including carbon corrosion, and the potential of zero charge to control the oxidation of carbon electrodes are explained along with the protection mechanisms. The various capacitive deionization (CDI) operations and the corresponding electrochemical cell technology are briefly introduced including the significance of double layer charging materials with faradaic intercalation which suffers less from co&#8208;ion expulsion. Finally, we have revisited the effects of various nanoarchitectures and construction of capacitive deionization electrodes to serve the benefit of clean water technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Amine&#8208;Mediated Domino Reaction for the Synthesis of Substituted Quinolines from Dicyanoalkenes and Eneynals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Substituted quinolines, tricyclic and tetracyclic molecules with a quinoline moiety are synthesized by a domino reaction from dicyanoalkenes and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;pent&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;4&#8208;ynals in one pot. We established two methods: one is catalyzed by chiral diphenylprolinol silyl ether, and the other is catalyzed by di(2&#8208;ethyl)hexylamine, in combination with p&#8208;nitrophenol. A wide variety of dicyanoalkenes can be employed. As the catalysts are secondary amines, and water is the only by&#8208;product, this is an environmentally benign synthetic method for the preparation of substituted quinolines.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparison of Antiaromatic Properties in a Series of Structurally Isomeric Naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;Indacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fusion of aromatic subunits to stabilize an antiaromatic core allows the isolation and study of otherwise unstable paratropic systems. A complete study of a series of six naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene isomers is herein described. Additionally, the structural modifications resulted in increased &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlap in the solid state, which was further explored through changing the sterically blocking mesityl group to (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl in three derivatives. The computed antiaromaticity of the six isomers is compared to the observed physical properties, such as NMR chemical shift, UV&#8208;vis, and CV data. We find that the calculations predict the most antiaromatic isomer and give a general estimation of the relative degree of paratropicity for the remaining isomers, when compared to the experimental results.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Hydroformylation&#8208;Aldol Condensation Reaction Enabled by Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The tandem hydroformylation&#8208;aldol condensation (tandem HF&#8208;AC) reaction offers an efficient synthetic route to the synthesis of industrially relevant products. The addition of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 to the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of 1&#8208;hexene enables tandem HF&#8208;AC under milder pressure and temperature conditions than the aldox process, where zinc salts are added to cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation reactions to promote aldol condensation. The yield of the aldol condensation products increases by up to 17 times that of the homogeneous reaction without MOF and up to 5 times compared to the aldox catalytic system. Both Co2(CO)8 and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 are required to significantly enhance the activity of the catalytic system. Density functional theory simulations and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared experiments show that heptanal, the product of hydroformylation, adsorbs on the open metal site (OMS) of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, thereby increasing the electrophilic character of the carbonyl carbon atom and facilitating the condensation</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquids and Electrolytes with Flexible Aromatic Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Five new&#160;n&#8208;tetrabutylphosphonium (P4444)+&#160;cation based ionic liquids (ILs) with oligoether substituted aromatic carboxylate anions have been synthesized. The nature and position of the oligoether chain affect thermal stability (up to 330 &#186;C), phase behaviour (Tg&#160;&lt;&#160;&#8208;55 &#186;C) and ion transport. Furthermore, with the aim of application in lithium batteries, electrolytes were created for two of the ILs by 10 mol% doping using the corresponding Li&#8208;salts. This affects the ion diffusion negatively, from being higher and equal for cations and anions to lower for all ions and unequal. This is due to the stronger ionic interactions and formation of aggregates, primarily between the&#160;Li+&#160;ions&#160;and the carboxylate group of the anions.&#160;Electrochemically, the electrolytes have&#160;electrochemical stability windows up to 3.5 V, giving some promise for battery application.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioenriched Boron C,N&#8208;Chelates via Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecules stereogenic only at tetrahedral boron atoms show great promise for applications e.g. as chiroptical materials, but are scarcely investigated due to their synthetic challenge. Hence, we report a two&#8208;step synthesis of enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates. First, the diastereoselective complexation of alkyl/aryl borinates with chiral aminoalcohols furnished boron stereogenic heterocycles in up to 86% yield and d.r. &gt; 98:2. Treatment of these O,N&#8208;complexes with chelate nucleophiles was surmised to transfer the stereoinformation via the ate&#8208;complex into the C,N&#8208;products. This chirality transfer succeeded by substitution of the O,N&#8208;chelates with lithiated phenyl pyridine to give boron stereogenic C,N&#8208;chelates in up to 84% yield and e.r. up to 97:3. The chiral aminoalcohol ligands could be recovered after isolation of the C,N&#8208;chelates. The chirality transfer tolerated alkyl, alkynyl and (hetero&#8208;)aryl moieties at boron and could be further extended by post&#8208;modification: transformations such as catalytic hydrogenations or sequential deprotonation / electrophilic trapping were feasible while maintaining the stereochemical integrity of the C,N&#8208;chelates. Structural aspects of the boron chelates were studied by variable temperature NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Late&#8208;stage functionalisation is an attractive method to generate peptide analogues containing non&#8208;natural residues. We show that cysteine residues can be activated as Crich&#8208;type thioethers, either by alkylation of a synthetic cysteine&#8208;continuing peptide or via incorporation of a modified cysteine unit into solid phase or solution phase peptide synthesis. Photoredox catalysed reaction of the thioether generates an alanyl radical intermediate in a stereoretentive and site&#8208;selective manner, even in the presence of free cysteine residues. The radical can react with non&#8208;activated alkenes to form non&#8208;natural residues bearing aliphatic, hydrophobic units. A method to avoid unwanted alkylation of amine residues was identified and the process was applied to the functionalization of both linear and cyclic synthetic peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Diimidazolium Salt HBDIM: An Easily Available, Low&#8208;Cost CageCarbene Precursor with Broad Applications in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of diimidazolium salt HBDIM 1, a precursor for di&#8208;NHCs ligand, from cheap and easily available agent hexabenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane (HBIW) was reported. Under basic conditions, HBDIM underwent facile deprotonation to in situ generate CageCarbene which could efficiently coordinate to transition&#8208;metals such as Au, Cu or Pd to give the corresponding bimetallic complexes 2&#8208;4. These complexes were isolated and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray diffraction of their single crystals. It was found that the steric hinderance of CageCarbene is similar to that of SIMes but smaller than that of IPr, and electronically, CageCarbene is a strong &#963;&#8208;donator silimar to SIMs and a stronger &#963;&#8208;donator than IPr. Further studies showed that complexes 2&#8208;4 were highly reactive to catalyze up to 17 reactions. Control experiments utilizing N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;substituted monoimidazolium salt showed much low catalytic reactivity when it was bounded to Au or Cu, but exhibited similar reactivity for the Pd&#8208;complex. Kenetic studies showed that the low reactivity of the monodentate carbene&#8208;ligated Au or Cu complex was due to the low stability of the complex under the reaction condions.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the substrate scope of acyltransferase LovD9&#160; for the biosynthesis of statin analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study identifies new acyl donors for manufacturing statin analogues through the acylation of monacolin J acid by the laboratory evolved acyltransferase LovD9. Vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters have emerged as alternate substrates for LovD9 acylation mechanism. While vinyl esters can reach product yields as high as the ones obtained by &#945;&#8208;dimethyl butyryl&#8208;S&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;mercaptopropionate (DMB&#8208;SMMP), the thioester for which LovD9 was evolved, p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters display a reactivity even higher than DMB&#8208;SMMP for the first acylation step yet the acylation product yield is lower. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated through quantum mechanics (QM) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Unimolecular reactivity of [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R = organyl): stepwise vs. concerted mechanism in copper&#8208;mediated trifluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cuprate complexes [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; (R = organyl) offer an efficient synthetic access to valuable trifluoromethylation products RCF3. Here, we use electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry to analyze the formation of these intermediates in solution and probe their fragmentation pathways in the gas phase. Furthermore, we explore the potential energy surfaces of these systems by quantum chemical calculations. Upon collisional activation, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R = Me, Et, Bu,  s Bu, allyl) afford the product ions [Cu(CF3)3]&#8226;&#8722; and [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722;. The former obviously results from an R&#8226; loss, whereas the latter originates either from the stepwise release of R&#8226; and CF3&#8226; radicals or a concerted reductive elimination of RCF3. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments as well as the quantum chemical calculations indicate that the preference for the stepwise reaction toward [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; increases with the stability of the formed organyl radical R&#8226;. This finding suggests that the recombination of R&#8226; and CF3&#8226; radicals may possibly contribute to the formation of RCF3 from [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; in synthetic applications. In contrast, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R = aryl) only yield [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; when subjected to collision&#8208;induced dissociation. These species exclusively undergo a concerted reductive elimination because the competing stepwise pathway is disfavored by the low stability of aryl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Role of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Salts in Alkyl Radical Generation from Alkyl Alcohols: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds through cross&#8208;coupling reactions using readily available substrates, like alcohols, is crucial for modern organic chemistry. Recently, direct alkyl alcohol functionalization has been achieved by the use of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) salts via in situ formation of an alcohol&#8208;NHC adduct and its activation by a photoredox catalysts to generate carbon&#8208;centered alkyl radicals. Experimentally, only electron deficient NHC activators work but the reasons of this behavior remains underexplored. Herein, DFT computational study of the mechanism of alcohol activation using up to seven NHC salts is performed to shed light into the influence of their electronic properties in the alkyl radical formation. This study demonstrated that four reaction steps are involved in the transformation and characterized how the electronic properties of the NHC salt affect each step. A fine balance of the NHC electron&#8208;richness is proved to be determinant for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetrically Functionalized Copper and Silver Corrole&#8208;Bis&#8208;Tetracyanobutadiene Push&#8208;Pull Conjugates: Efficient Population of Triplet States via Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper and silver tritolylcorroles (TTC) are symmetrically functionalized to carry two tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD) entities via [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroeletrocyclization reaction involving functionalized corroles with an electron acceptor, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) in excellent yields, as the first examples of corrole&#8208;TCBD push&#8208;pull systems. The strong push&#8208;pull effect resulted in charge polarization in the ground state resulting in a considerable hypsochromic shift, extending the absorption&#160;into the near&#8208;IR region. Electrochemical and computational studies revealed interactions between the TCBD entities via the corrole &#960;&#8208;system and the degree of such interactions was found to depend on the metal ion present in the corrole cavity. Energy considerations suggested charge transfer (CT) from the S2 or vibrationally hot S1 state but not the relaxed S1 state in the case of CuTTC(TCBD)2 while CT to occur from all these states in the case of AgTTC(TCBD)2. Additionally, the high&#8208;energy CT states populate the low&#8208;lying triplet states. Systematic femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies provided the ultimate proof for the occurrence of excited CT as a function of excitation wavelength followed by the efficient population of the triplet states. The present study brings out the significance of charge transfer in efficiently populating the triplet states in rather unusual copper and silver corroles carrying two TCBD entities.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation and Characterization of a Tetraradical Embedded in a Curved Cyclic Paraphenylene Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unique spin&#8211;spin (magnetic) interactions, ring&#8208;size effects on ground&#8208;state spin multiplicity, and in&#8208;plane aromaticity has been found in localized 1,3&#8208;diradicals embedded in curved benzene structures such as cycloparaphenylene (CPP). In this study, we characterized the magnetic interactions in a tetraradical consisting of two localized 1,3&#8208;diradical units connected by p&#8208;quaterphenyl within a curved CPP skeleton by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Persistent triplet species with zero&#8208;field splitting parameters similar to those of a triplet 1,3&#8208;diphenylcyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl diradical were observed by continuous wave (CW) or pulsed X&#8208;band EPR measurements. The quintet state derived from the ferromagnetic interaction between the two triplet diradical moieties was not detected at 20 K under glassy matrix conditions. At the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G(d) level of theory, the singlet state was lower in energy than the triplet and quintet states. These findings will aid in the development of open&#8208;shell species for material science application.</dc:description>

         <title>New Generation of Benzidine Wide&#8208;gap Conjugated Materials: Solution Processing a Classic Evaporated Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole and fluorene&#8208;substituted benzidine blocks have been functionalized with two different solubilizing pendant groups, in order to enhance the material&#8217;s solubility in greener solvents. Preserving the optical and electrochemical properties, the aromatic function and substitution showed an important influence on the solvent affinity, achieving concentrations up to 150 mg/mL in o&#8208;xylenes for the glycol&#8208;containing materials and decent solubility in alcohols for the compounds functionalized with ionic chains. The latter solution proved to be ideal for the preparation of luminescence slot&#8208;die coating film on top of flexible&#8208;substrates up to 33 cm x 2 cm. As a proof of concept, the materials have been implemented in different organic electronic devices, highlighting the low turn&#8208;on voltage (4 V) presented by the OLEDs, which is comparable with vacuum&#8208;processed devices. A structure&#8208;solubility relationship and a synthetic strategy are disentangled in this manuscript to tailor organic semiconductors and adapt their solubility towards the desired solvent and application.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing the boundary of covalency in lanthanoid&#8208;tellurium bonds: Insights from synthesis, molecular and electronic structures of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric europium(II) and ytterbium(II) tellurolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the strict hard/soft dichotomy between the lanthanoids and tellurium atoms, and the strong affinity of lanthanoid ions for high coordination numbers, low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes have remained elusive as compared to the lanthanoid complexes with lighter group 16 elements (O, S, and Se). This makes the development of suitable ligand systems for low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes an appealing endeavor. In a first report, a series of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid (Yb, Eu) tellurolate complexes were synthesized by utilizing the secondary bonding interaction stabilized hybrid organotellurolate ligands. The reaction of bis[2&#8208;((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl] ditelluride, 1 and 8,8'&#8208;diquinolinyl ditelluride, 2 with Ln0 metal (Ln = Eu, Yb) resulted in the formation of monomeric complexes [LnII(TeR)2(Solv)2] [R = C6H4(CH2NMe2)&#8208;2] [3: Ln = Eu, Solv = tetrahydrofuran; 4: Ln = Eu, Solv = acetonitrile; 5: Ln = Yb, Solv = tetrahydrofuran; 6: Ln = Yb, Solv = pyridine] and [EuII(TeNC9H6)2(Solv)n] (7: Solv = tetrahydrofuran, n = 3; 8: Solv = 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane, n = 2), respectively. Complexes 3&#8208;4 and 7&#8208;8 represent the first sets of examples of monomeric europium tellurolate complexes. The molecular structures of complexes 3&#8208;8 are validated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>TLC&#8208;Freeze SERS: A&#160;Powerful Tool for Monitoring Synthetic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is widely used to confirm the formation of the target compound in chemical synthesis. The key issue in TLC is spot identification relying on retention factors. Coupling of TLC with surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which gives direct molecular information, is a possible choice, to overcome this challenge. However, interference from the stationary phase and impurities on the nanoparticles added for SERS measurements significantly degrades TLC&#8208;SERS efficiency. We have found that freezing effectively eliminates such interferences and dramatically improves the performance of TLC&#8208;SERS. This study shows that TLC&#8208;freeze SERS is a powerful tool for monitoring essential organic reactions. This method can identify the product and side&#8208;products of similar structures, detect compounds with high sensitivity, and provide information of quantities that allows the reliable determination of the reaction time based on kinetic analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>New Opportunities in Metal Organic Framework Catalysis: From Bifunctional to Frustrated Lewis Pairs Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article highlights novel prospects for metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in heterogeneous catalysis as having frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs (FLPs) or as bifunctional acid&#8208;base solid catalysts able to activate molecular hydrogen. Starting from the extensive application MOFs as Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysts, this article uses catalytic hydrogenation to briefly summarize the efforts made to heterogenize boron and amine in MOFs to mimic molecular FLP systems. The core of this concept is based on recent findings1 which demonstrate the ability of two commonly used MOFs, namely UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;101, to catalyze the selective hydrogenation of polar double X=Y bonds at moderate H2 pressures below 10 bar. The influence of electron&#8208;donating, the withdrawal of substituents on the linker, and the aniline poisoning effect highlight the significance of Lewis acid sites, while density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate the heterolytic H&#8208;H bond cleavage at the MOF metal oxo clusters. It is expected that this new perspective on MOFs as solid FLP systems will spur further research to explore and define the potential of dual sites in the catalytic activation of small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;induced Intelligence of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active soft matter&#8208;based materials with strong stimulus responsiveness and reversible, large&#8208;shape morphing capabilities. LCEs have demonstrated broad and growing applications in soft robotics, wearable devices, artificial muscles, and optical machines. The actuation intelligence and advanced functionality of LCEs depend on the smartness and properties of structures. In this review, we discuss recent advances in structure&#8208;induced intelligence of LCEs, specifically the integration of structural properties with the alignment and processing of LCEs. The structural design principles for three categories consisting of common structures (film, fiber, and tubule), smart structures (origami, kirigami, mechanical metamaterial, topology, and topography), and complex structures (monolithic and integrated) are presented. Various alignment controls of LCEs, including mechanical, surface, field&#8208;assisted, and shear alignment, are capable of inducing structural properties. The coupling and collaboration mechanisms of the LCE structures and the generated functions are discussed. The review concludes with perspectives on current challenges and emerging opportunities.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA Based Dissipation System that Synchronizes Multiple Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial dissipative networks have emerged as advanced bionic systems for the development of material technology and synthetic biology. Here, we demonstrate a DNA&#8208;based artificial dissipation system that synchronizes multiple energy&#8208;rich molecules (fuels) including oligonucleotide, dNTP, and ATP. The autonomous operation of the dissipation system relies on the integration of DNA reaction network including polymerase extension, kinase phosphorylation, and exonuclease digestion. The use of multiple fuels provides multiple transient states with different energy levels and fine&#8208;tuning dissipative kinetics. The lifetime of the transient state can be programmed to increase or decrease just by varying one of the fuel molecules unlike conventional DNA&#8208;based dissipative systems where the increase in the concentration of fuel molecule increases the lifetime. This design greatly expands the toolkits for establishing dissipative/dynamic DNA networks. The dissipation system is harnessed to dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the assembly kinetics via multiple fuels. Owing to the multiple transient states in the dissipation system, two nanotubes can be regulated in parallel. We envision that the system would find broad applications in responsive materials, soft robotics, biosensors, and on&#8208;demand drug delivery.</dc:description>
