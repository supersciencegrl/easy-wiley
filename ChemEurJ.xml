         <title>Synthetic Antibody&#8208;Rhamnose Cluster Conjugates Show Potent Complement&#8208;Dependent Cell Killing by Recruiting Natural Antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of homogeneous antibody&#8208;rhamnose and antibody&#8208;&#945;Gal cluster conjugates is described. The synthesis was achieved through a modular antibody Fc&#8208;glycan remodeling that includes site&#8208;specific chemoenzymatic Fc&#8208;glycan functionalization and subsequent click conjugation of synthetic rhamnose&#8208; and &#945;Gal trisaccharide clusters. A comparative cell&#8208;based assay indicated that the antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates showed potent complement&#8208;dependent targeted cancer cell killing by recruiting natural anti&#8208;rhamnose antibodies.







Abstract
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are one of the most rapidly growing drug classes used for the treatment of cancer, infectious and autoimmune diseases. Complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is one of the effector functions for antibodies to deplete target cells. We report here an efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined conjugates of a monoclonal antibody with a rhamnose&#8208; and an &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to recruit natural anti&#8208;rhamnose and anti&#8208;&#945;Gal antibodies, respectively, to enhance the CDC&#8208;dependent targeted cell killing. The synthesis was achieved by using a modular antibody Fc&#8208;glycan remodeling method that includes site&#8208;specific chemoenzymatic Fc&#8208;glycan functionalization and subsequent click conjugation of synthetic rhamnose&#8208; and &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to provide the respective homogeneous antibody conjugates. Cell&#8208;based assays indicated that the antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates could mediate potent CDC activity for targeted cancer cell killing and showed much more potent efficacy than the antibody&#8208;&#945;Gal trisaccharide cluster conjugates for CDC effects.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Eucophylline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two strategies based respectively on the free&#8208;radical carbo&#8208; and sulfonyl&#8208;cyanation of cyclopropenes and cyclobutenes were developed to achieve the total enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;eucophylline, a monoterpene alkaloid isolated from Leuconotis eugenifolius.







Abstract
The total enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;eucophylline 1 was achieved using as a key&#8208;structural motif a chiral piperidinone bearing the natural product all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. The elaboration of the latter is based on two strategies relying on the free&#8208;radical carbo&#8208;cyanation and sulfonyl&#8208;cyanation respectively of enantiopure substituted cyclopropenes and cyclobutenes. Co&#8208; or Ni&#8208;boride reduction of the nitrile functional group along with the cyclopropane and cyclobutane ring&#8208;opening then led to the formation of the chiral piperidinone ring. Further elaboration of the latter into the key 1&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane motif followed by its coupling with a 2&#8208;cyanoaniline allowed the formation of the tetrahydrobenzo[b][1,8]&#8208;naphthyridine skeleton of 1, which was finally accessible in 17 steps and 5.9&#8201;% overall yield from 1,1&#8208;dibromobutene.

         <dc:description>Herein we report a Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction of allenyl sulfides and  a  &#8208;diazoesters, which provides an efficient synthetic route to enantio&#8208;enriched chiral tertiary homopropargylic sulfides. This reaction features high enantioselectivities (up to 96%  ee  ) and good functional group tolerance. The alkyl substituted  a  &#8208;diazoester was demonstrated as the efficient substrates in the asymmetric Doyle&#8208;Kirmse reaction. Mechanistic studies, including kinetic experiments, were conducted to gain insights into the details of the reaction pathway. The potential synthetic utility of this protocol has also been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Unique Platforms to Gain Insight of &#963;&#8208;Hole Interactions for the Removal of Organic Dyes from Aquatic Ecosystems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The combination of high crystallinity and rich host&#8208;guest chemistry in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), have situated them in an advantageous position, with respect to traditional porous materials, to gain insight on specific weak noncovalent supramolecular interactions. In particular, sulfur s&#8208;hole interactions are known to play a key role in the biological activity of living beings as well as on relevant molecular recognitions processes. However, so far, they have been barely explored. Here, we describe both how the combination of the intrinsic features of MOFs, especially the possibility of using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography (SCXRD), can be an extremely valuable tool to gain insight on sulfur s&#8208;hole interactions, and how their rational exploitation can be enormously useful in the efficient removal of harmful organic molecules from aquatic ecosystems. Thus, we have used a MOF, prepared from the amino acid L&#8208;methionine and possessing channels decorated with &#8211;CH2CH2SCH3 thioalkyl chains, to remove a family of organic dyes at very low concentrations (10 ppm) from water. This MOF is able to efficiently capture the four dyes in a very fast manner, reaching within five minutes nearly the maximum removal. Remarkably, the crystal structure of the different organic dyes within MOFs channels could be determined by SCXRD. This have enabled us to directly visualize the important role sulfur s&#8208;hole interactions play on the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions, representing one of the first studies on the rational exploitation of s&#8208;hole interactions for water remediation.</dc:description>

         <title>Factors Governing the Catalytic Insertion of CO2 into Arenes &#8211; A DFT Case Study for Pd and Pt Phosphane Sulfonamido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potential of Pd/Pt complexes for catalytic carboxylation of arenes with CO  2  is investigated by means of computational chemistry. Recently we reported that the bis[(2&#8208;methoxyphenyl)phosphino]&#8208;benzenesulfonamido palladium complex  1  inserts CO  2  reversibly in its Pd&#8208;C(aryl) bond generating carboxylato complex  2  . In the present work we study how geometric and electronic factors of various ligands and substrates influence the overall activation barrier (energy span, ES) of a potential catalytic cycle for arene carboxylation comprising this elementary step. The tendency of the key intermediates to dimerize and thus deactivating the potential catalysts is examined as well as the role of the base, which inevitably is needed to stabilize the reaction product. We show that Pd and Pt complexes  I(Pd)&#8208;L16&#8208;S1  and  I(Pt)&#8208;L16&#8208;S1  do not dimerize, enable the computation of complete catalytic cycles, and show interestingly low ES values of 26.8 and 24.5 kcal/mol, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive Characterization of Shredded Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Recycling Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report on an analytical study of dry&#8208;shredded lithium ion battery (LIB) materials with unknown composition. Samples from an industrial recycling process were analyzed concerning the elemental composition and (organic) compound speciation. Deep understanding of the base material for LIB recycling was obtained by identification and analysis of transition metal stoichiometry, current collector metals, base electrolyte and electrolyte additive residues, aging marker molecules and polymer binder fingerprints. For reversed engineering purposes, the main electrode and electrolyte chemistries were traced back to pristine materials. Furthermore, possible lifetime application and accompanied aging was evaluated based on target analysis on characteristic molecules described in literature. With this, the reported analytics provided precious information for value estimation of the undefined spent batteries and enabled tailored recycling process deliberations. The comprehensive feedstock characterization shown in this work paves the way for targeted process control in LIB recycling processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Hydrogen Evolution at Visible Light Wavelengths Using a Photocathode with Modal Strong Coupling between Plasmons and a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot Nanocavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hot&#8208;hole injection from plasmonic metal nanoparticles to the valence band of p&#8208;type semiconductors and reduction by hot electrons should be improved for efficient and tuneable reduction to obtain beneficial chemical compounds. We employed the concept of modal strong coupling between plasmons and a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) nanocavity to enhance the hot&#8208;hole injection efficiency. We fabricated a photocathode composed of gold nanoparticles (Au&#8208;NPs), p&#8208;type nickel oxide (NiO), and a platinum film (Pt film) (ANP). The ANP structure absorbs visible light over a broad wavelength range from 500 nm to 850 nm via hybrid modes based on the modal strong coupling between the plasmons of Au&#8208;NPs and the FP nanocavity of NiO on a Pt film. All wavelength regions of the hybrid modes of the modal coupling system promoted hot&#8208;hole injection from the Au&#8208;NPs to NiO and proton/water reduction by hot electrons. The incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency based on H 2 evolution through water/proton reduction by hot electrons reached 0.2% at 650 nm and 0.04% at 800 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;temperature quantum tunneling and hydrogen bonding rearrangements characterize the solid&#8208;solid phase transitions in a phosphonium&#8208;based protic ionic liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the complex phase behavior of the glass forming protic ionic liquid octylphosphonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [C 8 H 17 PD 3 ][NTf 2 ] by means of solidstate NMR spectroscopy. Combined line shape and spin relaxation studies of the deuterons in the PD 3 group of the octylphosphonium cation allow to map and correlate the phase behavior for a broad temperature range from 71 K to 343 K. In the solid PIL at 71 K, we observed a static state, characterized by the first deuteron quadrupole coupling constant reported for PD 3 deuterons. A transition enthalpy of about 12 kJ mol &#8208;1 from the static to the mobile state with increasing temperature suggests the breaking of a weak, charge&#8208;enhanced hydrogen bond between cation and anion. The highly mobile phase above 100 K exhibits an almost disappearing activation barrier, strongly indicating quantum tunneling. Thus, we provide first evidence of tunneling driven mobility of the hydrogen bonded P&#8208;D moieties in the glassy state of PILs, already at surprisingly high temperatures up to 200 K. Above 250 K, the mobile phase turns from anisotropic to isotropic motion, and indicates strong internal rotation of the PD 3 group. The analyzed line shapes and spin relaxation times allow us to link the structural and dynamical behavior at molecular level with the phase behavior beyond the DSC traces .</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the C/N Ratio of C&#8208;Rich Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) Materials by the Melamine/Carboxylic Acid Adduct Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile synthesis route to graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4)&#8208;type materials CNx having a large range of composition (0.66&lt;x&lt;1.4) is presented. The process is based on the decomposition of melamine/carboxylic acid adducts and yields peculiar 2D nanostructures with presumably C&#8208;rich nanodomains embedded in g&#8208;C3N4 domains. The characteristics of these nanocomposites are investigated by different techniques (X&#8208;ray diffraction, thermal analysis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and many others).







Abstract
C&#8208;rich graphitic carbonitride materials (CNx) with a large range of compositions have been prepared thanks to the self&#8208;assembly, in different ratios, of melamine (M) and a panel of polycarboxylic acids (A) such as oxalic, tartaric and citric acid. The thermal conversion of the formed adducts (MAy), led to CNx phases, with x ranging from 0.66 to 1.4 (x=1.33 for g&#8208;C3N4 for comparison). The properties of these materials were examined by different techniques (XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, TGA, XPS and DRIFT). It appears that the increase in the C content is associated with the disappearance of the long&#8208;range order of heptazine units and an increase in the sub&#8208;nanometer carbon&#8208;rich cluster size within the graphitic g&#8208;C3N4 structure. This trend is followed by a significant increase in the interlayer spacing and a lower proportion of N=C&#8722;N bonds compared to C=C bonds. The thermal stability under an inert atmosphere of these phases and their UV&#8208;Visible absorbance properties were also investigated.

         <title>Benchmarking of Density Functionals for the Description of Optical Properties of Newly Synthesized &#960;&#8208;Conjugated TADF Blue Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and computational guidelines based on benchmarking of DFT functionals for new &#960;&#8208;conjugated TADF emitters are reported. The three target compounds were obtained by multistep synthesis, including metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions and functional&#8208;group transformations. The emitters feature electron donors and acceptors moderately coupled through a spacer. The importance of the treatment of long&#8208;range exchange within the functionals and their ability to balance the &#960;&#8208;delocalization of the separate molecular fragments are explicitly outlined.







Abstract
Computational modeling of the optical characteristics of organic molecules with potential for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) may assist markedly the development of more efficient emitting materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Recent theoretical studies in this area employ mostly methods from density functional theory (DFT). In order to obtain accurate predictions within this approach, the choice of a proper functional is crucial. In the current study, we focus on testing the performance of a set of DFT functionals for estimation of the excitation and emission energy and the excited singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of three newly synthesized compounds with capacity for TADF. The emitters are designed specifically to enable charge transfer by &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation, at the same time possessing high&#8208;energy excited triplet states. The functionals chosen for testing are from various groups ranging from gradient&#8208;corrected through global hybrids to range&#8208;separated ones. The results show that the monitored optical properties are especially sensitive to how the long&#8208;range part of the exchange energy is treated within the functional. The accurate functional should also be able to provide well balanced distribution of the &#960;&#8208;electrons among the molecular fragments. Global hybrids with moderate (less than 0.4) share of exact exchange (B3LYP, PBE0) and the meta&#8208;GGA HSE06 are outlined as the best performing methods for the systems under study. They can predict all important optical parameters correctly, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

         <title>Tribo&#8208;Excited Chemical Reaction Using an EuIII Complex with a Stacked Anthracene Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;selective tribo&#8208;chemical reaction using a dinuclear lanthanide complex is demonstrated for the first time. The dinuclear complex is composed of two EuIII ions, hexafluoroacetylacetonato ligands, and anthracene&#8208;based phosphine oxide bridges. Single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed a face&#8208;to&#8208;face&#8208;type anthracene dimer structure in the dinuclear EuIII complex. Mechanical stimulus on the dinuclear EuIII complex induced selective formation of oxidized anthracene. This first spin&#8208;selective tribo&#8208;chemical reaction using a EuIII complex will offer new possibilities for the development of tribo&#8208;excitation chemistry.

         <title>Investigating a Boronate&#8208;Affinity&#8208;Guided Acylation Reaction for Labelling Native Antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding function: A boronate&#8208;affinity ligand and an S&#8208;aryl thioester have been developed that are capable of labelling native Abs with a functional molecule. Additionally, a photoactivatable crosslinker allows purification of labelled Abs in a reagentless manner, thereby producing homogeneous Ab&#8208;drug conjugates.







Abstract
The excellent molecular recognition capabilities of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have opened up exciting opportunities for biotherapeutic discovery. Taking advantage of the full potential of this tool necessitates affinity ligands capable of conjugating directly with small molecules to a defined degree of biorthogonality, especially when modifying natural Abs. Herein, a bioorthogonal boronate&#8208;affinity&#8208;based Ab ligand featuring a 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)pyridine and an S&#8208;aryl thioester to label full&#8208;length Abs is reported. The photoactivatable linker in the acyl donor facilitated purification of azide&#8208;labelled Ab (N3&#8208;Ab) was quantitatively cleaved upon brief exposure to UV light while retaining the original Ab activity. Click reactions enabled the precise addition of biotin, a fluorophore, and a pharmacological agent to the purified N3&#8208;Abs. The resulting immunoconjugate showed selectivity against targeted cells. Bioorthogonal traceless design and reagentless purification allow this strategy to be a powerful tool to engineer native antibodies amenable to therapeutic intervention.

         <title>Rational Design and Integrative Assembly of Heteromeric Metalla[2]Catenanes Featuring Cp*Ir/Rh Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrative assembly of a series of heteromeric metalla[2]catenanes was realized on account of prior precise design. A new design strategy was proposed. The design strategy essentially follows the principle of shape complementarity. Based on careful rational design of the functional groups, the shape and the size of the building blocks, the integrative assembly of a series of heteromeric [2]catenanes were successfully achieved both by assembly of two pre&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;rectangles and by one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly.







Abstract
We report a design strategy for integrative assembly of heteromeric [2]catenanes. The design focuses on the shape and functional group match of two different metalla&#8208;rectangles. A series of dipyridyl ligands with different lengths, widths and functional groups were designed and used for assembly experiments. Six heteromeric [2]catenanes were obtained both by direct mixture of two pre&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;rectangles and one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly. Multiple analytic methods were employed to characterize the catenanes, including single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, NMR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis.

Digital drug design reveals DNA aptamers binding SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2: A hybrid in silico et vitro approach, structure and interaction&#8208;based drug design, has been developed to create highly specific DNA aptamers for the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein. The structure and binding affinity of the aptamers were validated by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, flow cytometry, and fluorescence polarization. This approach offers a blueprint for the straightforward design of targeting molecules for new pathogens and emerging variants. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.

         <title>The Decisive Role of Spin States and Spin Coupling in Dictating Selective O2 Adsorption in Chromium(II) Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of spin state and spin coupling in gas binding selectivity in MOFs has been uncovered using periodic DFT calculations. The electron&#8208;transfer mechanism adopted by gaseous O2 leads to its strongly spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent binding, unlike the case for N2 and H2. O2/N2&#8208;selective adsorption/desorption processes have high commercial value, and this work offers a new strategy for such selective control.







Abstract
The coordinatively unsaturated chromium(II)&#8208;based Cr3[(Cr4Cl)3(BTT)8]2 (Cr&#8722;BTT; BTT3&#8722;=1,3,5&#8208;benzenetristetrazolate) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) has been shown to exhibit exceptional selectivity towards adsorption of O2 over N2/H2. Using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we attempted to decipher the origin of this puzzling selectivity. By computing and analyzing the magnetic exchange coupling, binding energies, the partial density of states (pDOS), and adsorption isotherms for the pristine and gas&#8208;bound MOFs [(Cr4(X)4Cl)3(BTT)8]3&#8722; (X=O2, N2, and H2), we unequivocally established the role of spin states and spin coupling in controlling the gas selectivity. The computed geometries and gas adsorption isotherms are consistent with the earlier experiments. The binding of O2 to the MOF follows an electron&#8208;transfer mechanism resulting in a CrIII superoxo species (O2.&#8722;) with a very strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the two centers, whereas N2/H2 are found to weakly interact with the metal center and hence only slightly perturb the associated coupling constants. Although the gas&#8208;bound and unbound MOFs have an S=0 ground state (GS), the nature of spin the configurations and the associated magnetic exchanges are dramatically different. The binding energy and the number of oxygen molecules that can favorably bind to the Cr center were found to vary with respect to the spin state, with a significant energy margin (47.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). This study offers a hitherto unknown strategy of using spin state/spin couplings to control gas adsorption selectivity in MOFs.

&lt;p&gt;The coordinatively unsaturated chromium(II)-based Cr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[(Cr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(BTT)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Cr&#8722;BTT; BTT&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=1,3,5-benzenetristetrazolate) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) has been shown to exhibit exceptional selectivity towards adsorption of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we attempted to decipher the origin of this puzzling selectivity. By computing and analyzing the magnetic exchange coupling, binding energies, the partial density of states (pDOS), and adsorption isotherms for the pristine and gas-bound MOFs [(Cr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(X)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(BTT)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (X=O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), we unequivocally established the role of spin states and spin coupling in controlling the gas selectivity. The computed geometries and gas adsorption isotherms are consistent with the earlier experiments. The binding of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the MOF follows an electron-transfer mechanism resulting in a Cr&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; superoxo species (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) with a very strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the two centers, whereas N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are found to weakly interact with the metal center and hence only slightly perturb the associated coupling constants. Although the gas-bound and unbound MOFs have an &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=0 ground state (GS), the nature of spin the configurations and the associated magnetic exchanges are dramatically different. The binding energy and the number of oxygen molecules that can favorably bind to the Cr center were found to vary with respect to the spin state, with a significant energy margin (47.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This study offers a hitherto unknown strategy of using spin state/spin couplings to control gas adsorption selectivity in MOFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

How to welcome guests: In this review, we summarize the current strategies for introducing guest molecules into MOFs to improve their proton conductivity, and divide the guest molecules into four types. We also present the challenges and prospects of applying this strategy for these solid proton conducting materials.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a porous frame material, exhibit considerable electrical conductivity. In recent decades, research on the proton conductivity of MOFs has made gratifying progress. In this review, the designable guest molecules encapsulated into MOFs are summarized and generalized into four types in terms of promoting proton conductive performance, and then recent progress in the promotion of proton conductivity by MOFs encapsulating guest molecules is discussed. The existing challenges and prospects for the development of this strategy for promoting MOFs&#8217; proton conductivity are also listed.

Visible&#8208;light photoswitching: A photoswitchable ligand and palladium(II) ions form a dynamic mixture of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular structures. Visible&#8208;light photoswitching of the azobenzene&#8208;based ligand reversibly pumps the system away from equilibrium towards the thermodynamically unstable structure.







Abstract
A photoswitchable ligand and palladium(II) ions form a dynamic mixture of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular structures. The photoswitching ligand is an ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzene with appended pyridyl groups. Combining the E&#8208;isomer with palladium(II) salts affords a double&#8208;walled triangle with composition [Pd3L6]6+ and a distorted tetrahedron [Pd4L8]8+ (1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio at 298&#8197;K). Irradiation with 410&#8197;nm light generates a photostationary state with approximately 80&#8201;% of the E&#8208;isomer of the ligand and results in the selective disassembly of the tetrahedron, the more thermodynamically stable structure, and the formation of the triangle, the more kinetically inert product. The triangle is then slowly transformed back into the tetrahedron over 2&#8197;days at 333&#8197;K. The Z&#8208;isomer of the ligand does not form any well&#8208;defined structures and has a thermal half&#8208;life of 25&#8197;days at 298&#8197;K. This approach shows how a thermodynamically preferred self&#8208;assembled structure can be reversibly pumped to a kinetic trap by small perturbations of the isomer distribution using non&#8208;destructive visible light.

         <title>MOF Encapsulated AuPt Bimetallic Nanoparticles for Improved Plasmonic&#8208;induced Photothermal Catalysis of CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Porous UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 encapsulated AuPt alloy NPs exhibit a significant enhancement in the CO2 hydrogenation under low temperature (150&#8201;&#176;C). The outstanding performance of AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 was attributed to the synergetic effect induced by plasmonic metal Au, active metal Pt, and versatile substrate UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Importantly, the AuPt alloy structure retains both the optical behavior of plasmonic metal and the reactive behavior of catalytic metal. This construction strategy provides guidance for the preparation of high&#8208;performance plasmonic catalysts.







Abstract
Exploring new catalytic strategies for achieving efficient CO2 hydrogenation under mild conditions is of great significance for environmental remediation. Herein, a composite photocatalyst Zr&#8208;based MOF encapsulated plasmonic AuPt alloy nanoparticles (AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2) was successfully constructed for the efficient photothermal catalysis of CO2 hydrogenation. Under light irradiation at 150&#8201;&#176;C, AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 achieved a CO production rate of 1451&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 91&#8201;% selectivity, which far exceeded those obtained by Au@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 with Pt shell on Au (599&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and Au@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 (218&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gmetal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). The outstanding performances of AuPt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 were attributed to the synergetic effect originating from the plasmonic metal Au, doped active metal Pt, and encapsulation structure of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 shell. This work provides a new way for photothermal catalysis of CO2 and a reference for the design of high&#8208;performance plasmonic catalysts.

         <dc:description>
Cocrystallization of TEMPO with a series of dithiadiazolyl (DTDA) radicals, p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN), led to the isolation of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 radical&#8208;radical cocrystals [p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN]2[TEMPO] that exhibit a common S4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O structural motif. Computational studies reflect the robust nature of this interaction and identify a well&#8208;isolated S=
 spin ground state, largely localized on the TEMPO radical.







Abstract
Cocrystallization of the dithiadiazolyl (DTDA) radicals p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN) with TEMPO afforded the 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystals [p&#8208;XC6F4CNSSN]2[TEMPO] (1&#8211;5) whose structures all reflect a common S4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O supramolecular motif. The nature of this interaction was probed by DFT calculations (M06/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ) on 1 which revealed that the enthalpy of formation of the [C6F5CNSSN]2[TEMPO] supramolecular motif from [C6F5CNSSN]2 and TEMPO is substantial (&#8722;54.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Electronic structure calculations revealed a TEMPO&#8208;based doublet S=
 configuration as the ground state with limited spin density on the DTDA rings (2.4&#8201;%). The corresponding spin quartet state is +78.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 higher in energy. An atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules analysis reveals four bond critical points (BCPs) between the TEMPO O and the DTDA S atoms as well as additional BCPs between selected DTDA S atoms and methyl H atoms of the TEMPO molecule. Herein, the structures of 2&#8211;5 are considered within the context of a hierarchical view of competing and complementary intermolecular interactions; in particular, the established supramolecular CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S&#8722;S synthon is sacrificed in order to form the new S4&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cocrystallization of the dithiadiazolyl (DTDA) radicals &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-XC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CNSSN (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN) with TEMPO afforded the 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystals [&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-XC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;CNSSN]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[TEMPO] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) whose structures all reflect a common S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O supramolecular motif. The nature of this interaction was probed by DFT calculations (M06/aug-cc-pVDZ) on &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; which revealed that the enthalpy of formation of the [C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CNSSN]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[TEMPO] supramolecular motif from [C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;CNSSN]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and TEMPO is substantial (&#8722;54.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Electronic structure calculations revealed a TEMPO-based doublet &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;=
 configuration as the ground state with limited spin density on the DTDA rings (2.4&#8201;%). The corresponding spin quartet state is +78.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; higher in energy. An atoms-in-molecules analysis reveals four bond critical points (BCPs) between the TEMPO O and the DTDA S atoms as well as additional BCPs between selected DTDA S atoms and methyl H atoms of the TEMPO molecule. Herein, the structures of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; are considered within the context of a hierarchical view of competing and complementary intermolecular interactions; in particular, the established supramolecular CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S&#8722;S synthon is sacrificed in order to form the new S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Chemical Protein Synthesis Utilizing Fmoc&#8208;Masked Selenazolidine to Address the Redox Functionality of Human Selenoprotein F**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of the thioredoxin&#8208;like domain of the ER human selenoprotein F using novel Fmoc&#8208;protected selenazolidine is reported. This allowed us to perform different in&#8197;vitro biological characterizations, including redox potential determination, insulin turbidimetric assay, and the effect on the oxidative folding of Cys&#8208;rich protein models. Our results support that SELENOF acts as a reductase for non&#8208;native disulfide bonds in the ER.







Abstract
Human SELENOF is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) selenoprotein that contains the redox active motif CXU (C is cysteine and U is selenocysteine), resembling the redox motif of thiol&#8208;disulfide oxidoreductases (CXXC). Like other selenoproteins, the challenge in accessing SELENOF has somewhat limited its full biological characterization thus far. Here we present the one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of the thioredoxin&#8208;like domain of SELENOF, highlighted by the use of Fmoc&#8208;protected selenazolidine, native chemical ligations and deselenization reactions. The redox potential of the CXU motif, together with insulin turbidimetric assay suggested that SELENOF may catalyze the reduction of disulfides in misfolded proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SELENOF is not a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)&#8208;like enzyme, as it did not enhance the folding of the two protein models; bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and hirudin. These studies suggest that SELENOF may be responsible for reducing the non&#8208;native disulfide bonds of misfolded glycoproteins as part of the quality control system in the ER.

         <title>Investigation of Molecular Iridium Fluorides IrFn (n = 1&#8208;6): A Combined Matrix&#8208;Isolation and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photo&#8208;initiated defluorination of iridium hexafluoride (IrF  6  ) was investigated in neon and argon matrices at 6 K, and their photoproducts are characterized by IR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies as well as quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The primary photoproducts obtained after irradiation with  l  = 365 nm are iridium pentafluoride (IrF  5  ) and iridium trifluoride (IrF  3  ), while longer irradiation of the same matrix with  l  = 278 nm produced iridium tetrafluoride (IrF  4  ) and iridium difluoride (IrF  2  ) by Ir&#8208;F bond cleavage or F  2  elimination. In addition, IrF  5  can be reversed to IrF  6  by adding a F atom when exposed to blue&#8208;light (  l  = 470 nm ) irradiation. Laser irradiation (  l  = 266 nm) of IrF  4  also generated IrF  6  , IrF  5  , IrF  3  and IrF  2  . Alternatively, molecular binary iridium fluorides IrF  n  (  n  = 1&#8208;6) were produced by co&#8208;deposition of laser&#8208;ablated iridium atoms with elemental fluorine in excess neon and argon matrices under cryogenic conditions. Computational studies up to scalar relativistic CCSD(T)/triple&#8208;  &#950;  level and two&#8208;component quasirelativistic DFT computations including spin&#8208;orbit coupling effects supported the formation of these products and provided detailed insights into their molecular structures by their characteristic Ir&#8208;F stretching bands. Compared to the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, the influence of spin&#8208;orbit coupling dominates in IrF  5  , leading to a triplet ground state with  C  4v  symmetry, which was spectroscopically detected in solid argon and neon matrices.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Transformations Using Strictosidine Aglycones: Divergent Total Syntheses of Monoterpenoid Indole Alkaloids in the Early Stage of Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 10, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired transformations to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids are reported. An important biosynthetic transformation mediated by &#946;&#8208;glycosidase were replaced with a simple removal of the silyl group from designed strictosidine aglycone silyl ether derivatives. Subsequent bioinspired transformations under substrate control resulted in the concise and divergent total syntheses of heteroyohimbine&#8208; and corynantheine&#8208;type, akagerine and naucleaoral related alkaloids.







Abstract
A series of bioinspired transformations that are applied to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is reported. The highly reactive key intermediates, strictosidine aglycones, were prepared in situ by simple removal of a silyl protecting group from the silyl ether derivatives, and converted selectively via bioinspired transformations under substrate control into heteroyohimbine&#8208; and corynantheine&#8208;type, and akagerine and naucleaoral related alkaloids. Thus, concise, divergent total syntheses of 13 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, (&#8722;)&#8208;cathenamine, (&#8722;)&#8208;tetrahydroalstonine, (+)&#8208;dihydrocorynantheine, (&#8722;)&#8208;corynantheidine, (&#8722;)&#8208;akagerine, (&#8722;)&#8208;dihydrocycloakagerine, (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleaoral B, (+)&#8208;naucleidinal, (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleofficines D and III, (&#8722;)&#8208;nauclefiline, and (&#8722;)&#8208;naucleamides A and E, were accomplished in fewer than 13&#8197;steps.

         <title>A Masked Form of an O&#8208;Borylated Breslow Intermediate for the Diastereoselective FLP&#8208;Type Activation of Aldehydes</title>

Compound 3 featuring an FLP&#8208;type activated CO2 is used as a masked form of an elusive O&#8208;borylated Breslow intermediate for the complete diastereoselective FLP&#8208;type activation of aldehydes. Kinetic and theoretical investigations shed light on the mechanism at play.







Abstract
Breslow intermediates are very often elusive species whose application in frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chemistry is unprecedented. Described herein is the use of a masked form of an O&#8208;borylated Breslow (OBB) intermediate that performs FLP&#8208;type activation of the carbonyl function of five different benzaldehyde derivatives with complete diastereoselectivity. The resulting compounds are characterised in solution by NMR spectroscopy (compounds 4&#8211;8) and in solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (compounds 4&#8211;6). A combined kinetic and theoretical investigation reveals the associative nature of the rate determining step and suggests that the OBB intermediate part is never released during the whole process.

         <title>Selective Encapsulation and Unusual Stabilization of cis&#8208;Isomers by a Spherical Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 10, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to a polyaromatic capsule, an azobenzene derivative is quantitatively encapsulated by the spherical cavity with 100&#8201;% cis&#8208;selectivity. The cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization is suppressed against heat and light due to the confined cavity effect. C,N&#8208;diphenyl imines are also encapsulated by the capsule and adopt an otherwise unstable cis&#8208;form. The cavity suppresses their hydrolysis in water due to the shielding effect.







Abstract
To explore new cavity functions, we herein employed cis&#8208;trans stereoisomers with a N=N, C=C, or C=N unit as guest indicators for a polyaromatic capsule. Thanks to the rigid, spherical cavity with a diameter of &#8764;1&#8197;nm, azobenzene and stilbene derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule with 100&#8201;% cis&#8208;selectivity in water. The isomerization of the cis&#8208;azo compound is suppressed against heat and light in the cavity, due to the confinement effect. Furthermore, C,N&#8208;diphenyl imine derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule in water and adopt an otherwise unstable cis&#8208;form. The polyaromatic cavity suppresses the hydrolysis of the imines in water, even at elevated temperature, due to the shielding effect. Accordingly, the properties of the cis&#8208;trans isomers could be largely altered through supramolecular manipulation.

         <title>Abnormal Association between Metal&#8722;Organic Cages and Counterions Regulated by the Hydration Shells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 10, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
When introducing extra salts into Cage 1 aqueous solution, most salts (Na2SO4, NaNO3, NaClO4, and NaSCN) can trigger larger&#8208;sized blackberry; while no clear change can be observed for Cage 2 solution, except NaSCN, which can be attribute to the thick hydration shell of Cage 2, inhibiting the counterion&#8211;macroion interaction.







Abstract
A unique trend in the binding affinity between cationic metal&#8722;organic cages (MOCs) and external counteranions in aqueous media was observed. Similar to many macroions, two MOCs, sharing similar structures but carrying different number of charges, self&#8208;assembled into hollow spherical single&#8208;layered blackberry&#8208;type structures through counterion&#8208;mediated attraction. Dynamic and static light scattering and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements confirm the stronger interactions among less charged MOCs and counteranions than that of highly charged MOCs, leading to larger assembly sizes. DOSY NMR measurements suggest the significance of thick hydration shells of highly charged MOCs, inhibiting the MOC&#8208;counterion binding and weakening the interaction between them. This study demonstrates that the greater role played by hydration shell on ion&#8208;pair formation comparing with charge density of MOCs.

         <title>Synthesis of Polyoxygenated Tropolones and their Antiviral Activity against Hepatitis B Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 10, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is described for the generation of polyoxygenated tropolones by using an intermolecular oxidopyrylium cycloaddition/ring&#8208;opening strategy and complementary benzyl alcohol incorporation steps. The antiviral activity of these molecules was assessed against the pathogenic viruses hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex virus&#8208;1, providing new structure&#8211;function insight.







Abstract
Polyoxygenated tropolones possess a broad range of biological activity, and as a result are promising lead structures or fragments for drug development. However, structure&#8211;function studies and subsequent optimization have been challenging, in part due to the limited number of readily available tropolones and the obstacles to their synthesis. Oxidopyrylium [5+2] cycloaddition can effectively generate a diverse array of seven&#8208;membered ring carbocycles, and as a result can provide a highly general strategy for tropolone synthesis. Here, we describe the use of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;pyrone&#8208;based oxidopyrylium cycloaddition chemistry in the synthesis of functionalized 3,7&#8208;dimethoxytropolones, 3,7&#8208;dihydroxytropolones, and isomeric 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;methoxytropolones through complementary benzyl alcohol&#8208;incorporating procedures. The antiviral activity of these molecules against herpes simplex virus&#8208;1 and hepatitis B virus is also described, highlighting the value of this approach and providing new structure&#8211;function insights relevant to their antiviral activity.

         <title>Assessing Alkali&#8208;Metal Effects in the Structures and Reactivity of Mixed&#8208;Ligand Alkyl/Alkoxide Alkali&#8208;Metal Magnesiates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 10, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and isolation of several new mixed alkyl/alkoxide alkali&#8208;metal magnesiates have allowed for assessing their stability in solution and their reactivity towards Mg&#8722;Br exchange using 2&#8208;bromoanisole as a model substrate. Revealing a pronounced alkali&#8208;metal effect, potassium magnesiates are more powerful exchange reagents although the constitution of the final products in these reactions is strongly dependent on the nature of the alkoxide employed.







Abstract
Advancing the understanding of using alkali&#8208;metal alkoxides as additives to organomagnesium reagents in Mg&#8722;Br exchange reactions, a homologous series of mixed&#8208;ligand alkyl/alkoxide alkali&#8208;metal magnesiates [MMg(CH2SiMe3)2(dmem)]2 [dmem=2&#8208;{[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]methylamino} ethoxide; M=Li, 1; Na, 2; (THF)K, 3] has been prepared. Structural and spectroscopic studies have established the constitutions of these heteroleptic/heterometallic species, which are retained in arene solution. Evaluation of their reactivity towards 2&#8208;bromoanisole has uncovered a marked alkali&#8208;metal effect with potassium magnesiate 3 being the most efficient of the three ate reagents. Studies probing the constitution of the exchange product from this reaction suggest that the putative [KMgAr2(dmem)]2 (Ar=o&#8208;OMe&#8722;C6H4) intermediate undergoes redistribution into its single metal components [KAr]n and [MgAr(dmem)]2 (5). This process can be circumvented by using a different potassium alkoxide containing an aliphatic chain such as KOR&#8217; (R&#8217;=2&#8208;ethylhexyl) which undergoes co&#8208;complexation with Mg(CH2SiMe3) to give [KMg(CH2SiMe3)2(OR&#8217;)]2 (7). This ate, in turn, reacts quantitatively with 2&#8208;bromoanisole furnishing [KMgAr2(OR&#8217;)]2 (9) which is stable in solution as a bimetallic compound. Collectively this work highlights the complexity of these alkali&#8208;metal mediated Mg&#8722;Br exchange reactions, where each reaction component can have a profound effect not only on the success of the reaction; but also the stability of the final metalated intermediates prior to their electrophilic interception.

&lt;p&gt;Advancing the understanding of using alkali-metal alkoxides as additives to organomagnesium reagents in Mg&#8722;Br exchange reactions, a homologous series of mixed-ligand alkyl/alkoxide alkali-metal magnesiates [MMg(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(dmem)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [dmem=2-{[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]methylamino} ethoxide; M=Li, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;; Na, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;; (THF)K, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;] has been prepared. Structural and spectroscopic studies have established the constitutions of these heteroleptic/heterometallic species, which are retained in arene solution. Evaluation of their reactivity towards 2-bromoanisole has uncovered a marked alkali-metal effect with potassium magnesiate &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; being the most efficient of the three ate reagents. Studies probing the constitution of the exchange product from this reaction suggest that the putative [KMgAr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(dmem)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ar=&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-OMe&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) intermediate undergoes redistribution into its single metal components [KAr]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and [MgAr(dmem)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). This process can be circumvented by using a different potassium alkoxide containing an aliphatic chain such as KOR&#8217; (R&#8217;=2-ethylhexyl) which undergoes co-complexation with Mg(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to give [KMg(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OR&#8217;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;). This ate, in turn, reacts quantitatively with 2-bromoanisole furnishing [KMgAr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OR&#8217;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;) which is stable in solution as a bimetallic compound. Collectively this work highlights the complexity of these alkali-metal mediated Mg&#8722;Br exchange reactions, where each reaction component can have a profound effect not only on the success of the reaction; but also the stability of the final metalated intermediates prior to their electrophilic interception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Hexaazatrianthracene (HATA) and hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;hexacarbonitrile {HAT(CN)6} ligands form coordination complexes with high&#8208;spin (S=2) FeII atoms in dianion and radical&#8208;trianion states. This provides weak antiferromagnetic exchange or ferromagnetic alignment of the FeII spins within the coordination assemblies.







Abstract
Hexaazatrianthracene (HATA) and hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile {HAT(CN)6} are reduced by metallic iron in the presence of crystal violet (CV+)(Cl&#8722;). Anionic ligands are produced, which simultaneously coordinate three FeIICl2 to form (CV+)2{HATA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8722;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3&#8197;C6H4Cl2 (1) and (CV+)3{HAT(CN)6. (FeIICl2)3}3&#8722;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.5CVCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.5&#8197;C6H4Cl2 (2). High&#8208;spin (S=2) FeII atoms in both structures are arranged in equilateral triangles at a distance of 7&#8197;&#197;. An antiferromagnetic exchange is observed between FeII in {HATA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8722; (1) with a Weiss temperature (&#920;) of &#8722;80&#8197;K, the PHI estimated exchange interaction (J) is &#8722;4.7&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The {HAT(CN)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}3&#8722; assembly is obtained in 2. The formation of HAT(CN)6.3&#8722; is supported by the appearance of an intense EPR signal with g=2.0037. The magnetic behavior of 2 is described by a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the FeII and HAT(CN)6.3&#8722; spins with J1=&#8722;164&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (&#8722;2&#8197;J formalism) and by a weaker antiferromagnetic coupling between the FeII spins with J2=&#8722;15.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The stronger coupling results in the spins of the three FeIICl2 units to be aligned parallel to each other in the assembly. As a result, an increase of the &#967;MT values is observed with the decrease of temperature from 9.82 at 300&#8197;K up to 15.06&#8197;emu&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K/mol at 6&#8197;K, and the Weiss temperature is also positive being at +23&#8197;K. Thus, a change in the charge and spin state of the HAT&#8208;type ligand to &#8901;3&#8722; results in ferromagnetic alignment of the FeII spins, yielding a high&#8208;spin (S=11/2) system. DFT calculations showed that, due to the high symmetry and nearly degenerated LUMO of both HATA and HAT(CN)6, their complexes with FeIICl2 have a variety of closely lying excited high&#8208;spin states with multiplicity up to S=15/2.

Non&#8208;nucleoside RdRp inhibitors. A family of unprecedented farnesylated dimethylbenzimidazoles called the sandacrabins have been discovered from a new myxobacterial Sandaracinus species. They exhibit antiviral activities that could be correlated to inhibition of the RNA synthesis as their potential antiviral mode of action. This study describes their structure elucidation, biosynthetic origin, total synthesis and biological evaluation.







Abstract
Structure elucidation and total synthesis of five unprecedented terpenoid&#8208;alkaloids, the sandacrabins, are reported, alongside with the first description of their producing organism Sandaracinus defensii MSr10575, which expands the Sandaracineae family by only its second member. The genome sequence of S. defensii as presented in this study was utilized to identify enzymes responsible for sandacrabin formation, whereby dimethylbenzimidazol, deriving from cobalamin biosynthesis, was identified as key intermediate. Biological activity profiling revealed that all sandacrabins except congener A exhibit potent antiviral activity against the human pathogenic coronavirus HCoV229E in the three digit nanomolar range. Investigation of the underlying mode of action discloses that the sandacrabins inhibit the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase complex, highlighting them as structurally distinct non&#8208;nucleoside RNA synthesis inhibitors. The observed segregation between cell toxicity at higher concentrations and viral inhibition opens the possibility for their medicinal chemistry optimization towards selective inhibitors.

         <title>Cationic Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Decarbonylative Aryl Addition of Aromatic Aldehydes to Bicyclic Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 10, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building bridges: We have developed an unprecedented asymmetric decarbonylative aryl addition of an aromatic aldehyde to bicyclic alkenes, catalyzed by chiral cationic iridium. This process provides efficient access to a wide variety of enantioenriched bridged bicyclic systems from aromatic aldehydes in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee).







Abstract
We report an unprecedented catalytic protocol for the enantioselective decarbonylative transformation of aryl aldehydes. In this process, the decarbonylation of aldehydes catalyzed by chiral iridium complexes enabled the formation of asymmetric C&#8722;C bonds through the formation of an aryl&#8722;iridium intermediate. The decarbonylative aryl addition to bicyclic alkenes was fluidly performed without a stoichiometric aryl&#8722;metal reagent, such as aryl boronic acid, with a cationic iridium complex generated in&#8197;situ from Ir(cod)2(BArF4) and the sulfur&#8208;linked bis(phosphoramidite) ligand ((R,R)&#8208;S&#8722;Me&#8722;BIPAM). This reaction has broad functional group compatibility, and no waste is generated, except carbon monoxide.

In this process, the decarbonylation of aldehydes catalyzed by chiral iridium complexes enabled the formation of asymmetric C&#8722;C bonds through the formation of an aryl&#8722;iridium intermediate. The decarbonylative aryl addition to bicyclic alkenes was fluidly performed without a stoichiometric aryl&#8722;metal reagent, such as aryl boronic acid, with a cationic iridium complex generated in&#8197;situ from Ir(cod)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(BAr&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and the sulfur-linked bis(phosphoramidite) ligand ((&lt;i&gt;R,R&lt;/i&gt;)-S&#8722;Me&#8722;BIPAM). This reaction has broad functional group compatibility, and no waste is generated, except carbon monoxide.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of the Flexibility of Nickel PCP&#8208;Pincer Complexes on C&#8722;H and P&#8722;C Bond Activation and Ethylene Reactivity: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 10, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental/theoretical study of Ni pincer complexes with a bridgehead pyrimidine&#8208;based NHC and arylphosphino side arms revealed unique features about stepwise C&#8722;H activation, ethylene insertion into the Ni&#8722;H bond of an isolated complex followed by ethyl migration with C&#8722;CNHC coupling, and an unprecedented C&#8722;P bond activation affording through PPh2 migration a NiII complex with a terminal phosphanido ligand and a new C&#8722;CNHC&#8722;P pincer ligand.







Abstract
Using a pincer platform based on a bridgehead NHC donor with functional side arms, the combined effect of increased flexibility in six&#8208;membered pyrimidine&#8208;type heterocycles compared to the more often studied five&#8208;membered imidazole, and rigidity of phosphane side arms was examined. The unique features observed include: 1) the reaction of the azolium Csp2&#8722;H bond with [Ni(cod)2] affording a carbanionic ligand in [NiCl(PCsp3HP)] (8) rather than a carbene; 2) its transformation into the NHC, hydrido complex [NiH(PCNHCP)]PF6 (9) upon halide abstraction; 3) ethylene insertion into the Ni&#8722;H bond of the latter and ethyl migration to the N&#8722;C&#8722;N carbon atom of the heterocycle in [Ni(PCEtP)]PF6 (10); and 4) an unprecedented C&#8722;P bond activation transforming the P&#8722;CNHC&#8722;P pincer ligand of 8 in a C&#8722;CNHC&#8722;P pincer and a terminal phosphanido ligand in [Ni(PPh2)(CCNHCP)] (15). The data are supported by nine crystal structure determinations and theoretical calculations provided insights into the mechanisms of these transformations, which are relevant to stoichiometric and catalytic steps of general interest.

A rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclooligomerization of bifunctional monomers possessing triazolyl (carbene precursor) and vinyl groups at 2,3&#8208; and 3,4&#8208;positions on the thiophene ring is studied. Cyclic dimers, which adopt a tub&#8208;shaped conformation, are obtained as the major components. We also observe the phenomenon of racemization caused by a tub&#8208;to&#8208;tub ring&#8208;flipping, the activation energy of which is determined as 108&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 by electronic circular dichroism spectra measurement.

         <title>A Semiconductor&#8208;Mediator&#8208;Catalyst Artificial Photosynthetic System for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 10, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid semiconductor&#8208;mediator&#8208;catalyst photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell mimicking the PSII is proposed for efficient water oxidation. Addition of carbazole mediator results in a significant enhancement in PEC water oxidation performance as it promotes interfacial hole transfer from the Fe2O3 light absorber to the Ru(carbene) catalyst, a function similar to the tyrosine residue in photosystem II. Such a semiconductor&#8208;mediator&#8208;catalyst assembly greatly inspires the rational design of high&#8208;performance artificial photosynthesis systems.







Abstract
In fabricating an artificial photosynthesis (AP) electrode for water oxidation, we have devised a semiconductor&#8208;mediator&#8208;catalyst structure that mimics photosystem II (PSII). It is based on a surface layer of vertically grown nanorods of Fe2O3 on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes with a carbazole mediator base and a Ru(II) carbene complex on a nanolayer of TiO2 as a water oxidation co&#8208;catalyst. The resulting hybrid assembly, FTO|Fe2O3|&#8722;carbazole|TiO2|&#8722;Ru(carbene), demonstrates an enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performance compared to an electrode without the added carbaozle base with an increase in photocurrent density of 2.2&#8208;fold at 0.95&#8197;V vs. NHE and a negatively shifted onset potential of 500&#8197;mV. The enhanced PEC performance is attributable to carbazole mediator accelerated interfacial hole transfer from Fe2O3 to the Ru(II) carbene co&#8208;catalyst, with an improved effective surface area for the water oxidation reaction and reduced charge transfer resistance.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Tertiary Allylic Amines by Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkynes with Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 10, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical and symmetrical alkynes undergo hydroaminoalkylation with tertiary amines in the presence of a cationic titanium catalyst system, which is generated in&#8197;situ. The products obtained are synthetically and pharmaceutically very interesting tertiary allylamines, which are formed in very good yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and with excellent stereoselectivity. A major highlight of the work is the successful conversion of trimethylamine into N,N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;E&#8208;allylamines.







Abstract
Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkynes with tertiary amines take place in the presence of catalytic amounts of TiBn4, Ph3C[B(C6F5)4], and a sterically demanding aminopyridinato ligand precursor. The resulting products, synthetically and pharmaceutically useful tertiary &#946;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted allylic amines, are formed in convincing yields and with excellent stereoselectivity. Particularly promising for future applications is the fact that even the industrial side product trimethylamine can be used as a substrate.

         <title>Light&#8208;Sensitive Phenacyl Crosslinked Dextran Hydrogels for Controlled Delivery**

Polymer phenacyl crosslinked hydrogels that can release doxorubicin, bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G by using light (254&#8197;nm&#8211;375&#8197;nm) as a trigger are reported. One crosslinker was designed to optimize the overlap with the Cerenkov luminescence emission window, bearing an &#960;&#8208;extended phenacyl core, resulting in a high quantum yield (QY, 14&#8201;%) of photocleavage when irradiated with 375&#8197;nm light.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials enable controlled release of loaded drug molecules and biomolecules. Controlled release of potent chemotherapeutic or immunotherapeutic agents is crucial to reduce unwanted side effects. In an effort to develop controlled release strategies that can be triggered by using Cerenkov luminescence, we have developed polymer hydrogels that can release bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G by using light (254&#8197;nm&#8211;375&#8197;nm) as a trigger. We describe the synthesis and photochemical characterization of two light sensitive phenacyl bis&#8208;azide crosslinkers that are used to prepare transparent self&#8208;supporting hydrogel patches. One crosslinker was designed to optimize the overlap with the Cerenkov luminescence emission window, bearing an &#960;&#8208;extended phenacyl core, resulting in a high quantum yield (14&#8201;%) of photocleavage when irradiated with 375&#8197;nm light. We used the extended phenacyl crosslinker for the preparation of protein&#8208;loaded dextran hydrogel patches, which showed efficient and selective dosed release of bovine serum albumin or immunoglobulin G after irradiation with 375&#8197;nm light. Cerenkov&#8208;triggered release is as yet inconclusive due to unexpected side&#8208;reactivity. Based on the high quantum yield, efficient release and large overlap with the Cerenkov window, we envision application of these photosensitive soft materials in radiation targeted drug release.

The compound Li5SnP3 completes for x=0 the series Li10+4xSn2&#8722;xP6 (x=0&#8211;1) of lithium&#8208;ion conducting phosphidostannates. The thorough investigation of the crystal structure as well as the materials properties applying X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as NMR and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy allows for a detailed comparison of the materials structure&#8208;property relationships, and thus, improves the understanding of the conduction mechanism within solid ion conductors.







Abstract
The targeted search for suitable solid&#8208;state ionic conductors requires a certain understanding of the conduction mechanism and the correlation of the structures and the resulting properties of the material. Thus, the investigation of various ionic conductors with respect to their structural composition is crucial for the design of next&#8208;generation materials as demanded. We report here on Li5SnP3 which completes with x=0 the series Li10+4xSn2&#8722;xP6 of the fast lithium&#8208;ion conductors &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Li8SnP4 (x=0.5) and Li14SnP6 (x=1). Synthesis, crystal structure determination by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction methods, as well as 6Li, 31P and 119Sn MAS NMR and temperature&#8208;dependent 7Li NMR spectroscopy together with electrochemical impedance studies are reported. The correlation between the ionic conductivity and the occupation of octahedral and tetrahedral sites in a close&#8208;packed array of P atoms in the series of compounds is discussed. We conclude from this series that in order to receive fast ion conductors a partial occupation of the octahedral vacancies seems to be crucial.

         <title>Gas Phase Preparation of the Elusive Monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH Molecule through Nonadiabatic Reaction Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 10, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH molecule was prepared in the gas phase through bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium with germane (GeH4). The divergent chemistries of germanium versus carbon are reflected when comparing the acetylene isomers with the isovalent germanium analogues. This reaction deepens our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing nonclassical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.







Abstract
The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH (X1A&#8242;) molecule was prepared in the gas phase by bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium with germane (GeH4). Electronic structure calculations revealed that this reaction commenced on the triplet surface with the formation of a van der Waals complex, followed by insertion of germanium into a germanium&#8208;hydrogen bond over a submerged barrier to form the triplet digermanylidene intermediate (HGeGeH3); the latter underwent intersystem crossing from the triplet to the singlet surface. On the singlet surface, HGeGeH3 predominantly isomerized through two successive hydrogen shifts prior to unimolecular decomposition to Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH isomer, which is in equilibrium with the vinylidene&#8208;type (H2GeGe) and dibridged (Ge(&#956;&#8208;H2)Ge) isomers. This reaction leads to the formation of cyclic dinuclear germanium molecules, which do not exist on the isovalent C2H2 surface, thus deepening our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing nonclassical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.

Strictosidine is an important molecule in the biosynthesis of higher plants that gives rise to a great variety of structures. A series of bioinspired transformations that are applied to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is reported. In this image, the strictosidine aglycon is depicted as a gavel that produces treasure in Japanese folktales to represent the production of various natural products from a single molecule. The natural products produced in this study will be very useful as a library for drug discovery. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Sakamoto and H. Ishikawa (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104052).

An unprecedented catalytic protocol for the asymmetric decarbonylative transformation: The cover art depicts how the asymmetric reaction of the Ir/S&#8722;Me&#8208;BIPAM complex takes precedence over the decarbonylation. The picture of the balance shows that the competing decarbonylation side reaction will not happen, as well as highlighting the asymmetry. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Shirai et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104347).

         <title>Catalytic Reduction of Oximes to Hydroxylamines: Current Methods, Challenges and Opportunities</title>

How to access hydroxylamine derivatives? Likely, one of the most straightforward strategy involves the catalytic reduction of oximes. These substrates are however difficult to reduce selectively as overeduction breaks their weak N&#8722;O bond giving primary amines instead. The few different capable catalytic systems are overviewed in this minireview as well as new opportunities for advancing the research field are suggested.







Abstract
Catalytic reduction of oximes represents a direct efficient approach to synthesize valuable hydroxylamine derivatives. However this transformation presents significant challenges: oximes are hard to reduce and, if reactive, reductive cleavage of the weak N&#8722;O bond often leads to primary amine side products. The first suitable systems involved the use of platinum&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with hydrogen as reductant and stoichiometric amounts of a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. More recently metal&#8208;free and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysts have been developed, which display the highest turnovers (up to 4000). In the asymmetric variants, the E/Z&#8208;geometry of the oxime double bond affects significantly the stereoselectivity, sometimes requiring extra synthetic efforts in substrate preparation. This minireview provides an overview of the advances and limitations in catalytic oxime to hydroxylamine reduction. Emphasis is put on highlighting and comparing the practical aspects of the existing methods, such as their reaction conditions and substrate scope. Additionally, future directions for improving this young research area are suggested.

Recent progress in water&#8208;dispersible gold nanoclusters in terms of their synthesis strategies, optical properties, and bio&#8208;applications is discussed. Different synthesis strategies for water&#8208;dispersible AuNCs are highlighted. The progress achieved in the optical properties and biological applications of these molecules is also reviewed.

Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) are an emerging class of quantum&#8208;sized nanomaterials. Intrinsic discrete electronic energy levels have endowed them with fascinating electronic and optical properties. They have been widely applied in the fields of optoelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysis, biochemical sensing, bio&#8208;imaging, and therapeutics. Nevertheless, most AuNCs are synthesized in organic solvents and do not disperse in aqueous solutions; this restricts their biological applications. In this review, we focus on the recent progress in the preparation of water&#8208;dispersible AuNCs and their biological applications. We first review different methods of synthesis, including direct synthesis from hydrophilic templates and indirect phase transfer of hydrophobic AuNCs. We then discuss their photophysical properties, such as emission enhancement and fluorescence lifetimes. Next, we summarize their latest applications in the fields of biosensing, biolabeling, and bioimaging. Finally, we outline the challenges and potential for the future development of these AuNCs.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of meta&#8208;Bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;Trifluoromethylanilines from Cyclopentanones by a Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 10, February 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fully regioselective synthesis of meta&#8208;bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;trifluoromethylanilines through a cascade reaction from bench&#8208;stable non&#8208;aromatic precursors is reported. The convenient reaction setup requires only heating of the desired amine and the bench&#8208;stable reagents in sulfolane. The method is compatible with a broad range of primary, secondary and aromatic amines and proceeds in 20&#8211;81&#8201;% yields.







Abstract
Anilines are key constituents in biologically active compounds and often obtained from transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling of an aryl halide with an amine. In this work, we report a transition metal&#8208;free method for the synthesis of meta&#8208;bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;trifluoromethylanilines starting from 3&#8208;tribromomethylcyclopentanone or 3&#8208;(2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethyl)cyclopentanone, respectively. The scope of the transformation is shown by application of primary, secondary and aromatic amines. The reaction proceeds in acceptable to high yields (20&#8211;81&#8201;%), and allows for the synthesis of anilines with substitution patterns otherwise difficult to access.

     alt="Transition Metal-Free Synthesis of meta-Bromo- and meta-Trifluoromethylanilines from Cyclopentanones by a Cascade Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The fully regioselective&lt;/b&gt; synthesis of &lt;i&gt;meta-&lt;/i&gt;bromo- and &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-trifluoromethylanilines through a cascade reaction from bench-stable non-aromatic precursors is reported. The convenient reaction setup requires only heating of the desired amine and the bench-stable reagents in sulfolane. The method is compatible with a broad range of primary, secondary and aromatic amines and proceeds in 20&#8211;81&#8201;% yields.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anilines are key constituents in biologically active compounds and often obtained from transition metal-catalyzed coupling of an aryl halide with an amine. In this work, we report a transition metal-free method for the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-bromo- and &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-trifluoromethylanilines starting from 3-tribromomethylcyclopentanone or 3-(2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethyl)cyclopentanone, respectively. The scope of the transformation is shown by application of primary, secondary and aromatic amines. The reaction proceeds in acceptable to high yields (20&#8211;81&#8201;%), and allows for the synthesis of anilines with substitution patterns otherwise difficult to access.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Properties of Bromine Fused Salts Based on Quaternary Ammonium Molecules and Their Relevance for Use in a Hydrogen Bromine Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Properties of fused salts of quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) and various polybromides (PB) are investigated for the first time systematically on their applicability in a H2/Br2 flow battery. Fused salt capacities of up to 730&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 are reached. Conductivity, which bases on a hopping mechanism between PBs, viscosity and temperature stability depend on the chosen QAC and the fractions of PBs present at a selected state of charge of the electrolyte.







Abstract
Bromine complexing agents (BCA) in aqueous electrolytes for hydrogen bromine flow batteries are used to reduce bromine&#8216;s vapour pressure, while an insoluble and liquid fused salt is formed. The properties (concentrations, composition, conductivity and viscosity) of this fused salt are investigated in this study systematically ex situ by using 7 BCAs at different state of charge in HBr/Br2/H2O electrolytes with a theoretical capacity of 179.6&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1. Bromine is stored in the fused salt at concentrations up to 13.6&#8197;M, reaching theoretical volumetrical capacities up to 730&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1 in fused salts. The fused salt consists of a pure, bromine&#8208; and water&#8208;free ionic liquid of organic [BCA]+ cations and polybromides, and its conductivity bases on a hopping mechanism among the polybromides. Alkyl side chain length of the BCAs and distribution of polybromides influence strongly the conductivity and viscosity of the fused salts. 1&#8208;ethylpyridin&#8208;1&#8208;iumbromide results to be favoured BCA for application.

         <title>A Universal DNA Aptamer that Recognizes Spike Proteins of Diverse SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants of Concern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is a unique one: A unique DNA aptamer has been discovered that has the ability to recognize the spike proteins of the wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its seven current variants of concern (VoCs), including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, B.1.617.1 B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.529 and is predicted to recognize the spike proteins of future VoCs.







Abstract
We report on a unique DNA aptamer, denoted MSA52, that displays universally high affinity for the spike proteins of wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa, Delta and Omicron variants. Using an aptamer pool produced from round 13 of selection against the S1 domain of the wildtype spike protein, we carried out one&#8208;round SELEX experiments using five different trimeric spike proteins from variants, followed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing and sequence alignment analysis of aptamers that formed complexes with all proteins. A previously unidentified aptamer, MSA52, showed Kd values ranging from 2 to 10&#8197;nM for all variant spike proteins, and also bound similarly to variants not present in the reselection experiments. This aptamer also recognized pseudotyped lentiviruses (PL) expressing eight different spike proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with Kd values between 20 and 50&#8197;pM, and was integrated into a simple colorimetric assay for detection of multiple PL variants. This discovery provides evidence that aptamers can be generated with high affinity to multiple variants of a single protein, including emerging variants, making it well&#8208;suited for molecular recognition of rapidly evolving targets such as those found in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

The triptycene scaffold has been ring&#8208;opened by using an acidic retro&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type reaction to give its corresponding anthrone product. 9&#8208;Hydroxytriptycenes and unsubstituted triptycene were ring&#8208;opened by treatment with TfOH. The electron&#8208;donating group on the arene moiety allows the reaction to proceed in the presence of weaker acids. Additionally, the reaction has been applied toward the synthesis of tetracene. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Iwata, M. Shindo et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104160).

         <title>Strengthening of the C&#8722;F Bond in Fumaryl Fluoride with Superacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;F bond of fumaryl fluoride is strengthened by protonation of the oxygen atom in a sea of superacid. The chain represents the reinforced connection between the carbon atom and the fluorine atom. The C&#8722;F bond even reveals a slight double&#8208;bond character and a formal positive charge on the fluorine atom. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;J. Kornath, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104422).

         <title>Quadrupolar Ultrafast Charge Transfer in Diaminoazobenzene&#8208;Bridged Perylenediimide Triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transfer of charge in covalently linked donor&#8211;acceptor systems is highly important in many areas of chemistry, artificial photosynthesis, semiconductor devices, and solar cells. Intramolecular charge transfer occurs when a fraction of the charge is transferred between the entities after photo&#8208;excitation of the electron donor or acceptor entity. In this study, molecular triads comprising two electron&#8208;deficient perylenediimides are covalently linked to a bridging electron donor, diamino&#8208;azobenzene, to give strong ground&#8208;state polarization resulting in wide&#8208;band optical coverage. Using fluorescence spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, charge&#8208;transfer reversal in these triads is also seen. Further, the formation of ultrafast quadrupolar charge transfer upon photoexcitation is demonstrated. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Fern&#225;ndez&#8208;L&#225;zaro, F. D&#8242;Souza, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104574).

         <dc:description>
Gaseous iodine has been captured by using a series of zirconium&#8208;based UiO&#8208;n metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) sorbents. This study highlights the significant role of amino groups attached to the organic linker, which enhance the iodine uptake capacity, as well as its conversion into anionic iodide I3&#8722; species, trapped within UiO&#8208;n cavities. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Loiseau et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104437). Margot Friscourt and Orfeas Plastiras are thanked for the cover artwork.

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Aldehydes with Allylboronates Enables Facile Access to Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for the preparation of ketones from aldehydes and allylic boronic esters is presented. This reaction involves the allylation of aldehydes with allylic boronic esters and the Rh&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking of homoallylic alcohols. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional groups. Mechanistic studies also supported that a tandem allylation and chain&#8208;walking process were involved.







Abstract
We present herein a novel strategy for the preparation of ketones from aldehydes and allylic boronic esters. This reaction involves the allylation of aldehydes with allylic boronic esters and the Rh&#8208;catalyzed chain&#8208;walking of homoallylic alcohols. The key to this successful development is the protodeboronation of alkenyl borylether intermediate via a tetravalent borate anion species in the presence of KHF2 and MeOH. This approach features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies also supported that the tandem allylation and chain&#8208;walking process were involved.

         <title>H/F Substitution Induced Large Increase of Tc in a 3D Hybrid Rare&#8208;Earth Double Perovskite Multifunctional Compound</title>

Multifunctional perovskites: Two 3D hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite compounds show multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties that ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and photoluminescence. The photoluminescence response shows that the emission intensity has no quench as the temperature increased. In particular, using the H/F substitution strategy generating an Rb&#8208;F coordinate bond enhanced the interactions between the cations and the anions to realize high Tc ferroelasticity.







Abstract
Increasing attention has been devoted to studying perovskite&#8208;type multifunctional stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with multiple channel physical characteristics. However, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve multifunction and regulate structural phase transition temperature in hybrid perovskites. Here, we report two three&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite compounds, (HQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (1, HQ=quinuclidium) and (4FHQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (2, 4FHQ=4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;quinuclidium), which exhibit ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and excellent photoluminescence response. The phase transition temperature of 2 increases 169&#8197;K compared with 1 through H/F substitution. This result is attributed to the H/F substitution inducing the generation of the Rb&#8208;F coordination bond between cations and anions. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence emission intensity of 2 shows no quench with the increase of temperature, in particular, the emission spectrum achieves fine regulation at high temperatures. This work provides a new solution for the realization of multi&#8208;functions and regulations of the properties based on hybrid perovskite materials with high critical temperatures.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mimetic Molecular Selective Catalysis via Single Zr Atom Catalysis in Chelated Cage Embedded in a Flexible Piezoelectrical Matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of supramolecular recognition and piezoelectrical field in soft assemblies in achieving molecularly selective high performance catalysis on single atom catalyst is first elucidated. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90&#8201;% after 100&#8197;min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted.







Abstract
The molecularly selective catalysis in enzyme is central to life. However, their functioning mechanism remains elusive. We propose here that the synergistic effects from (i) effective orbital hybridizing and energy gap decreasing via chelating on single Zr atom as the catalytic center, (ii) selective supramolecular encapsulation in the cage, and (iii) piezoelectrical field motivation are able to achieve the enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective high performance catalysis. Metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOPs) are added into a piezoelectrical polymer matrix to achieve the composite structure where ultrasonic treatment motivates redox reactions in the MOP&#8208;guest complex. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90&#8201;% after 100&#8197;min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted. This study first proposes a synergistic plot for enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalyst realization and is expected to inspire new mentality in efficient catalyst designing.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Chemisorption, Interpenetration and Polycatenation: Cationic MOFs and CPs from Group 13 Metal Halides and Di&#8208;Pyridyl&#8208;Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Eight cationic, two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) were synthesized in reactions of the group 13 metal halides AlBr  3  , AlI  3  , GaBr  3  , InBr  3  and InI  3  with the dipyridyl ligands 1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethylene (  bpe  ), 1,2&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane (  bpa  ) and 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (  bipy  ). Seven of them follow the general formula  2  &#8734;  [MX  2  (  L  )  2  ]A, M = Al, In, X = Br, I, A  &#8208;  = [MX  4  ]  &#8208;  , I  &#8208;  , I  3  &#8208;  ,  L = bipy, bpa, bpe.  Thereby, the porosity of the cationic frameworks can be utilized to take up the heavy molecule iodine in gas&#8208;phase chemisorption vital for the capture of iodine radioisotopes. This is achieved by switching between I  &#8208;  and the polyiodide I  3  &#8208;  in the cavities at room temperature, including single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation. The MOFs are 2D networks that exhibit (4,4)&#8208;topology in general or (6,3)&#8208;topology for  2  &#8734;  [(GaBr  2  )  2  (  bpa  )  5  ][GaBr  4  ]  2  &#8729;  bpa  . The two&#8208;dimensional networks can either be arranged to an inclined interpenetration of the cationic two&#8208;dimensional networks, or to stacked networks without interpenetration. Interpenetration is accompanied by polycatenation. Due to the cationic character, the MOFs require the counter ions [MX  4  ]  &#8208;  , I  &#8208;  or I  3  &#8208;  counter ions in their pores. Whereas the [MX  4  ]  &#8208;  , ions are immobile, iodide allows for chemisorption. Furthermore, eight additional coordination polymers and complexes were identified and isolated that elaborate the reaction space of the herein reported syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective, Transition Metal&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;Diboration of Alkyl Halides, Tolsylates, and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defunctionalization of readily available feedstocks to provide alkenes for the synthesis of multifunctional molecules represents an extremely useful process in organic synthesis. Herein, we describe a transition metal&#8208;free, simple and efficient strategy to access alkyl 1,2&#8208;bis(boronate esters) via regio&#8208; and diastereoselective diboration of secondary and tertiary alkyl halides (Br, Cl, I), tosylates, and alcohols. Control experiments demonstrated that the key to this high reactivity and selectivity is the addition of a combination of potassium iodide and N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA). The practicality and industrial potential of this transformation are demonstrated by its operational simplicity, wide functional group tolerance, and the late&#8208;stage modification of complex molecules. From a drug discovery perspective, this synthetic method offers control of the position of diversification and diastereoselectivity in complex ring scaffolds, which would be especially useful in a lead optimization program.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We describe the oxygenation of tertiary arylamines, and the amination of tertiary arylamines and phenols.

         <dc:description>Copper complexes of patellamides have shown catalytic activity in a variety of reactions but their biological function remains unknown. There are significant differences between the natural macrocycles and synthetic analogues in the various catalytic activities. It therefore is essential to be able to perform  in vivo  and  ex vivo  reference measurements with the natural patellamide macrocycles, very similar derivatives and a large range of synthetic analogues. The preparative method described allows for a highly adaptable synthetic process producing building blocks for a large range of patellamide derivatives: apart from natural compounds, a new synthetic patellamide was prepared that does not have any substituents at any of the four heterocycles. Together with the variation of substituents at the aliphatic backbone, this allowed to elucidate the catalytic activity for phosphoester hydrolysis as a function of the structure and dynamics of the dicopper(II)&#8208;patellamide complexes, both by experiment and DFT&#8208;based mechanistic studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile near&#8208;infrared super&#8208;resolution imaging of amyloid fibrils with the fluorogenic probe CRANAD&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CRANAD&#8208;2 is a fluorogenic curcumin derivative used for near&#8208;infrared detection and imaging in vivo of amyloid aggregates, which are involved in neurodegenerative diseases. We explore the performance of CRANAD&#8208;2 in two super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques, namely stimulated emission depletion (STED) and singlemolecule localization microscopy (SMLM), with markedly different fluorophore requirements. By conveniently adapting the concentration of CRANAD&#8208;2, which transiently binds to amyloid fibers, we show that it performs well in both techniques, achieving a resolution in the range of 45 &#8211; 55 nm. Correlation of SMLM with atomic force microscopy (AFM) validates the resolution of fine features in the reconstructed super&#8208;resolved image. The good performance and versatility of CRANAD&#8208;2 provides a powerful tool for near&#8208;infrared nanoscopic imaging of amyloids  in vitro  and  in vivo  .</dc:description>

         <title>Planar chiral rhodium complexes of 1,4&#8208;benzoquinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diene rhodium complexes are important catalysts in modern organic synthesis. Herein, we report a new approach to the such complexes with the uncommon planar chirality. The synthesis is achieved by face&#8208;selective coordination of the prochiral 2,5&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinones (R2&#8208;Q) with rhodium precursors containing the chiral auxiliary ligand S&#8208;salicyl&#8208;oxazoline (S&#8208;Salox). Such coordination leads to the formation of (R,R&#8208;R2&#8208;Q)Rh(S&#8208;Salox) complexes in high yields and with exceptional diastereoselectivity (d.r. &gt; 20:1). Subsequent replacement of the auxiliary ligand provides various benzoquinone rhodium complexes with retention of the planar chirality. Combined theoretical and experimental studies show that due to their electron&#8208;withdrawing nature benzoquinones bind metals stronger than the related 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene, but weaker than other common diene ligands, such as cyclooctadiene.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of Asx&#8208;turn types and their connate relationship with &#946;&#8208;turns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Models of asparagine&#8208;containing dipeptides, specifically designed to favor intrinsic folding into an Asx&#8208;turn, were characterized both theoretically, using quantum chemistry, and experimentally, using laser spectroscopy in the gas phase. Both approaches provided evidence for the spontaneous folding of both the Asn&#8208;Ala and Asn&#8208;Gly dipeptide models into the most stable Asx&#8208;turn, a conformation stabilized by a C10 H&#8208;bond which was very similar to a type II&#8217; &#946;&#8208;turn. In parallel, analysis of the Asx&#8208;turns implicating asparagine in crystallized protein structures in the Protein Data Bank revealed a sequence&#8208;dependent behavior. In Asn&#8208;Ala sequences, the Asx&#8208;turn was found in conjunction with a type I &#946;&#8208;turn for which the first of the four defining residues was Asn. The observation that the Asx turn in these structures is mostly of type II&#8217; (  i.e.  its most stable innate structure) suggests that this motif may foster the formation and/or enhance the stability of the backbone &#946;&#8208;turn. In contrast, the Asx turns observed in Asn&#8208;Gly sequences extensively adopted a type II Asx&#8208;turn structure, suggesting that their formation should be ascribed to other factors, such as hydration. The fact that the Asx&#8208;turn in a Asn&#8208;Gly sequence is also often found in combination with a hydrated &#946;&#8208;bulge supports the premise that a Asn&#8208;Gly sequence might efficiently promote the formation of the &#946;&#8208;bulge secondary structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton or Carbene Transfer? On the Dark and Light Reaction of Diazoalkanes with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;H Functionalization: In this combined experimental and computational study, the reaction of diaryl diazoalkanes with alcohols is reported. In the ground state, a direct proton transfer governs reactivity with acidic HFIP. On the contrary, photoexcitation leads to formation of a triplet carbene intermediate that undergoes an alcohol&#8208;assisted intersystem crossing to a solvent&#8208;stabilized carbene that results in high&#8208;yield photochemical O&#8722;H functionalization reactions.







Abstract
The formal alkylation reaction of OH groups with diazoalkanes under catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions finds broad application in organic synthesis. However, even today, this reaction is mainly limited to the use of diazomethane as reaction partner. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we aim at a fundamental understanding of the reaction of diazoalkanes with alcohols to make this transformation amenable to a generalized approach towards formal alkylation reactions of alcohols with diazoalkanes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest a direct proton transfer only in exceptional cases. In a more general setting, such O&#8722;H functionalization proceed both under dark and photochemical conditions via a key hydrogen&#8208;bonded singlet carbene intermediate that undergoes a protonation&#8211;addition mechanism. We conclude with applications of this approach in O&#8722;H functionalization reactions of alcohols, including simple fluorinated, halogenated and aliphatic alcohols and showcase functional&#8208;group tolerance of this method in the reaction of biologically active and pharmaceutically relevant alcohols.

         <title>Highly Selective Lysine Acylation in Proteins Using a Lys&#8208;His Tag Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short, designed Lys&#8208;His tag can be inserted into proteins where it autocatalyzes the highly selective acylation of the Lys side&#8208;chain amine with phenyl esters. The reaction conditions of this site&#8208;selective, chemical protein modification method are mild, and no oxidative reagents, reductants nor enzymes are required.







Abstract
Chemical modification of proteins has numerous applications, but it has been challenging to achieve the required high degree of selectivity on lysine amino groups. Recently, we described the highly selective acylation of proteins with an N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;His6 segment. This tag promoted acylation of the N&#8208;terminal N&#945;&#8208;amine resulting in stable conjugates. Herein, we report the peptide sequences Hisn&#8208;Lys&#8208;Hism, which we term Lys&#8208;His tags. In combination with simple acylating agents, they facilitate the acylation of the designated Lys N&#1013;&#8208;amine under mild conditions and with high selectivity over native Lys residues. We show that the Lys&#8208;His tags, which are 7 to 10 amino acids in length and still act as conventional His tags, can be inserted in proteins at the C&#8208;terminus or in loops, thus providing high flexibility regarding the site of modification. Finally, the selective and efficient acylation of the therapeutic antibody Rituximab, pure or mixed with other proteins, demonstrates the scope of the Lys&#8208;His tag acylation method.

         <title>Elucidating the Germanium Distribution in ITQ&#8208;13 Zeolites by Density Functional Theory**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferred Ge distributions in ITQ&#8208;13 silicogermanates with different Si/Ge ratios were investigated with electronic structure calculations, with the primary aim of predicting the most stable local structures across the range of Ge contents. Additional calculations were used to study the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the incorporated fluoride anions as a function of the local environment and the defluorination behaviour of different fluoride&#8208;containing cages.







Abstract
ITQ&#8208;13 is a medium&#8208;pore zeolite that can be prepared in all&#8208;silica form and as silicogermanate with Si/Ge ratios as low as 3. Usually synthesised in the presence of fluoride, ITQ&#8208;13 is among the very few systems containing fluoride anions in two distinct cage types, cube&#8208;like d4r units and [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages. Here, dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the energetically most favourable Ge distributions for Si/Ge ratios between 55 and 6. The calculations show Ge atoms are incorporated at both the corners of d4r cages and at the basal plane of the [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages, in accordance with 19F&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Two Ge atoms at adjacent corners of [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages are stable at the highest Ge content considered (Si/Ge=6). Such a local environment has not yet been considered in the experimental literature. A calculation of the corresponding 19F&#8197;NMR resonance points to overlap with other resonances, which might preclude its clear identification. Additional calculations investigate the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the fluoride anions as a function of the local environment as well as the selective defluorination of the [4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;56] cages.

         <title>Synthesis of Natural Products by C&#8722;H Functionalization of Heterocycless</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the recent strategies towards the total synthesis of heterocyclic natural products enabled by C&#8722;H functionalization is presented. The review is focused on transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed approaches, such as palladium catalysis, gold catalysis, iridium and ruthenium catalysis, and also presents transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free radical strategies as well as electrophilic&#8208;type metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization reactions and direct deprotonation approaches driven by the properties of heterocycles. The implementation of C&#8722;H functionalization of heterocycles enables novel tactics in the construction of core architectures, while changing the logic design of retrosynthetic strategies and permitting access to natural product scaffolds with novel and enhanced biological activities.







Abstract
Total synthesis is considered by many as the finest combination of art and science. During the last decades, several concepts were proposed for achieving the perfect vision of total synthesis, such as atom economy, step economy, or redox economy. In this context, C&#8722;H functionalization represents the most powerful platform that has emerged in the last years, empowering rapid synthesis of complex natural products and enabling diversification of bioactive scaffolds based on natural product architectures. In this review, we present an overview of the recent strategies towards the total synthesis of heterocyclic natural products enabled by C&#8722;H functionalization. Heterocycles represent the most common motifs in drug discovery and marketed drugs. The implementation of C&#8722;H functionalization of heterocycles enables novel tactics in the construction of core architectures, but also changes the logic design of retrosynthetic strategies and permits access to natural product scaffolds with novel and enhanced biological activities.

         <title>Fibril Structure Demonstrates the Role of Iodine Labelling on a Pentapeptide Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iodination is an attractive yet minimal functionalization to engineer the self&#8208;assembly of amyloidogenic peptides. Despite having received little attention in the field, iodinated aliphatic residues can expand the library of functional moieties able to tune peptides self&#8208;assembly. In our work, a custom iodinated aliphatic amino acid was synthesized and introduced into a pentapeptide, enhancing its self&#8208;assembly and crystallogenic properties.







Abstract
Iodination has long been employed as a successful labelling strategy to gain structural insights into proteins and other biomolecules via several techniques, including Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP&#8208;MS), and single&#8208;crystal crystallography. However, when dealing with smaller biomolecular systems, interactions driven by iodine may significantly alter their self&#8208;assembly behaviour. The engineering of amyloidogenic peptides for the development of ordered nanomaterials has greatly benefitted from this possibility. Still, to date, iodination has exclusively been applied to aromatic residues. In this work, an aliphatic bis&#8208;iodinated amino acid was synthesized and included into a custom pentapeptide, which showed enhanced fibrillogenic behaviour. Peptide single crystal X&#8208;ray structure and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction on its dried water solution demonstrated the key role of iodine atoms in promoting intermolecular interactions that drive the peptide self&#8208;assembly into amyloid fibrils. These findings enlarge the library of halogenated moieties available for directing and engineering the self&#8208;assembly of amyloidogenic peptides.

         <title>Heterodinuclear Mg(II)M(II) (M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) Complexes for the Ring Opening Copolymerization of Carbon Dioxide/Epoxide and Anhydride/Epoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new heterodinuclear complexes comprising Mg(II)M(II) are reported as highly efficient catalysts for both the ROCOP of CO2/cyclohexene oxide and norbornene anhydride/cyclohexene oxide. Mg(II)Co(II) and Mg(II)Fe(II) were the most effective combinations in the catalysis.







Abstract
The catalysed ring opening copolymerizations (ROCOP) of carbon dioxide/epoxide or anhydride/epoxide are controlled polymerizations that access useful polycarbonates and polyesters. Here, a systematic investigation of a series of heterodinuclear Mg(II)M(II) complexes reveals which metal combinations are most effective. The complexes combine different first row transition metals (M(II)) from Cr(II) to Zn(II), with Mg(II); all complexes are coordinated by the same macrocyclic ancillary ligand and by two acetate co&#8208;ligands. The complex syntheses and characterization data, as well as the polymerization data, for both carbon dioxide/cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and endo&#8208;norbornene anhydride (NA)/cyclohexene oxide, are reported. The fastest catalyst for both polymerizations is Mg(II)Co(II) which shows propagation rate constants (kp) of 34.7&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (CO2) and 75.3&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (NA) (100&#8201;&#176;C). The Mg(II)Fe(II) catalyst also shows excellent performances with equivalent rates for CO2/CHO ROCOP (kp=34.7&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) and may be preferable in terms of metallic abundance, low cost and low toxicity. Polymerization kinetics analyses reveal that the two lead catalysts show overall second order rate laws, with zeroth order dependencies in CO2 or anhydride concentrations and first order dependencies in both catalyst and epoxide concentrations. Compared to the homodinuclear Mg(II)Mg(II) complex, nearly all the transition metal heterodinuclear complexes show synergic rate enhancements whilst maintaining high selectivity and polymerization control. These findings are relevant to the future design and optimization of copolymerization catalysts and should stimulate broader investigations of synergic heterodinuclear main group/transition metal catalysts.

         <title>In vitro anticancer ability of nano fluorescent 111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA on Hela cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In past decades, nanoscale metal&#8208;organic frameworks (NMOFs) have drawn more and more attention in multimodal imaging and targeting therapy of various malignant cancers. Here, we proposed to dope 111In into fluorescent In&#8208;based NMOFs (In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68&#8208;NH2), with an attempt to prepare a new nanomedicine with great anti&#8208;cancer potential. As a proof of concept, the obtained NMOF (In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA) with targeting motifs is able to act as a fluorescent probe to achieve Hela cell imaging. Moreover, the Auger electron emitter 111In built in corresponding radioactive NMOF (111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA) can bring clear damage to cancer cells, resulting in a high cell killing rate of 59.3% within 48 h. In addition, the cell cycle presented a significant dose&#8208;dependent G2/M inhibiting mode, which indicates that 111In&#8208;MIL&#8208;68/PEG&#8208;FA&#160;has the ability to facilitate the cancer cells to enter apoptotic program. This work demonstrated the potential of 111In labelled NMOFs in specific killings of cancer cells, providing a new approach to develop nanomedicines with theranostic function.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly sensitive &#8220;off/on&#8221; EPR probes to monitor enzymatic activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assessment of unregulated level of enzyme activity is a crucial parameter for early diagnoses in a wide range of pathologies. In this study, we propose the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) as an easy method to probe carboxylesterase (CE) enzymatic activity  in vitro  . For this application, were synthesized two amphiphilic, nitroxide containing esters, namely  Tempo&#8208;C12  (T&#8208;C12) and  Tempo&#8208;2&#8208;C12  (T&#8208;2&#8208;C12). They exhibit low solubility in water and form stable micelles in which the radicals are EPR almost silent, but the hydrolysis of the ester bond yields narrows and intense EPR signals. The intensity of the EPR signals is proportional to the enzymatic activity. CEs1, CEs2 and esterase from porcine liver (PLE) were investigated. The obtained results show that T&#8208;C12&#8208; and T&#8208;2&#8208;C12&#8208;containing systems display a much higher selectivity toward the CEs2, with a Limit of Detection of the same order of those ones obtained with optical methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Chemoenzymatic Installation of Hydroxy&#8208;Bearing Allyl Moiety on the Indole Ring of Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The late&#8208;stage functionalization of indole&#8208; and tryptophan&#8208;containing compounds with reactive moieties facilitates downstream diversification and leads to changes in their biological properties. Here we describe the synthesis of two hydroxy&#8208;bearing allyl pyrophosphates. We demonstrate a chemoenzymatic method using a promiscuous indole prenyltransferase enzyme to install a dual reactive hydroxy&#8208;bearing allyl moiety directly on the indole ring of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides. This is the first report of late&#8208;stage indole modifications with this reactive group.</dc:description>

         <title>Type S Non Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases for the rapid generation of tailormade peptide libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial natural products in general, and non&#8208;ribosomally synthesized peptides in particular, are structurally diverse and provide us with a broad range of pharmaceutically relevant bioactivities. Yet, traditional natural product research suffers from rediscovering the same scaffolds and has been stigmatized as inefficient, time&#8208;, labour&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive. Combinatorial chemistry, on the other hand, can produce new molecules in greater numbers, cheaper and in less time than traditional natural product discovery, but also fails to meet current medical needs due to the limited biologically relevant chemical space that can be addressed. Consequently, methods for the high throughput generation of new natural products would offer a new approach to identifying novel bioactive chemical entities for the hit to lead phase of drug discovery programms. As a follow&#8208;up to our previously published proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study on generating bipartite type S non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), we now envisaged the&#160;  de novo  &#160;generation of non&#8208;ribosomal peptides (NRPs) on an unreached scale. Using synthetic zippers, we split NRPS in up to three subunits and rapidly generated different bi&#8208; and tripartite NRPS libraries to produce 49 peptides, peptide derivatives, and&#160;  de novo  &#160;peptides at good titres up to 145 mg L  &#8208;1  . A further advantage of type S NRPSs not only is the possibility to easily expand the created libraries by re&#8208;using previously created type S NRPS, but that functions of individual domains as well as domain&#8208;domain interactions can be studied and assigned rapidly.</dc:description>

For example, complexes  1  and  2  on reaction with  L  1  and  L  2  afforded dihydridoborate species [LAM(&#956;&#8208;H)  2  BHL]  4&#8208;6  (  4  : L  A  = Cp*, M = Ru, L = amt;  5  : L  A  = Cp*, M = Ru, L = mp;  6  : L  A  = COD, M = Ir, L = mp).

         <title>Solid Base Assisted Dual&#8208;Promoted Heterogeneous Conversion of PVC to Metal&#8208;Free Porous Carbon Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is widely used in daily life, but its waste has become a serious environmental problem. A solid base assisted low&#8208;temperature solvothermal dehalogenation was developed in this work to sustainably and efficiently transform PVC into high&#8208;value dimethylamine hydrochloride (DMACl) chemical and N,O co&#8208;doped carbon monolith with hierarchically porous structure. The synergistic promotion of solid&#8208;base catalyst and solvent decomposition with the removal of HCl can shift forward the chemical equilibrium to promote the dechlorination of PVC and increase the carbon yield. Meanwhile, the solid&#8208;base catalyst can also act as a pore&#8208;forming additive to fabricate the carbon monolith with hierarchical pores. Induced by the high specific surface area, hierarchical pores and N,O co&#8208;doped structure, the generated carbon monolith exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance towards H  2  evolution. These discoveries shed light on the design of synergistically coupled solvent and solid catalyst to promote the heterogeneous conversion of waste chlorinated plastics into high&#8208;value chemicals for a sustainable future.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Strong Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Absorbing Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes for Robust and Efficient Light &#8208; Driven Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Weak light absorption has hidden the use of most Ir(III) complexes as efficient photosensitizers in photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water. To address this issue, a series of cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes (  Ir1  &#8208;  Ir5  ), featuring different electron&#8208;donating substituents to enhance the absorptivity, have been synthesized and studied as photosensitizers (PSs) for light&#8208;driven hydrogen production from water.  Ir6  &#8211;  Ir7  were prepared as fundamental systems for comparisons. Electron donors, including 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole, triphenylamine, 4,4'&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine, 4,4'&#8208;di(  N  &#8208;hexylcarbazole)triphenylamine moieties were introduced on 6&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenanthridine&#8208;based cyclometalating (C^N) ligands to explore the donor effect on the hydrogen evolution performance of these cationic Ir(III) complexes. Remarkably,  Ir  4  with 4,4'&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine achieved the highest turn&#8208;over number (TON) of 12,300 and initial turnover frequency (TOF  i  ) of 394 h  &#8722;  1  , with initial activity (activity  i  ) of 547,000 &#956;mol g  &#8722;1  h  &#8722;1  and initial apparent quantum yield (AQY  i  ) of 9.59%, under the illumination of blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) for 105 hours, which demonstrated a stable three&#8208;component photocatalytic system with high efficiency. The TON (based on  n  (H  2  )/  n  (PSr)) in this study is the highest value reported to date among the similar photocatalytic systems using Ir(III) complexes with Pt nanoparticles as catalyst. Great potential of using triphenylamine&#8208;based Ir(III) PSs in boosting the photocatalytic performance has also been shown.</dc:description>

         <title>Sigma/pi bonding preferences of solvated alkali&#8208;metal cations to ditopic arylmethyl anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylmethyl anions allow alkali&#8208;metals to bind in a &#963;&#8208;fashion to the lateral carbanionic centre or a &#960;&#8208;fashion to the aryl ring or in between these extremities, with the trend towards &#960; bonding increasing on descending group 1. Here we review known alkali&#8208;metal structures of diphenylmethane, fluorene, 2&#8208;benzylpyridine and 4&#8208;benzylpyridine. Next, we synthesise Li, Na, K monomers of these diarylmethyls using polydentate donors PMDETA or Me  6  TREN to remove competing oligomerizing interactions, studying the effect that two aromatic rings have on negative charge (de)localisation via NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and DFT studies. Diphenylmethyl and fluorenyl anions maintain C(H)&#8208;M interactions regardless of alkali&#8208;metal, although the adjacent arene carbons engage in interactions with larger alkali&#8208;metals. Introducing a nitrogen atom into the ring (at the 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;position) encourages relocalisation of negative charge away from the deprotonated carbon and onto nitrogen. Phenyl(2&#8208;pyridyl)methyl moves from an enamide formation at one extremity (lithium) to an aza&#8208;allyl formation at the other extremity (potassium), while C&#8208; or N&#8208; coordination modes become energetically viable for Na and K phenyl(4&#8208;pyridyl)methyl complexes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Adding to the versatile class of ionic liquids, we report the detailed structure and property analysis of a new class of asym&#173;metrically substituted imida&#173;zolium salts, offering interesting thermal charac&#173;teristics, such as liquid crystalline beha&#173;vior, polymorphism or glass transitions.

These imidazolium salts were studied by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffract&#173;tion (SC&#8208;XRD), NMR spectroscopy and thermochemical methods (DSC, TGA). Furthermore, these imi&#173;dazolium salts were used as  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand precursors for mono&#173;nuclear, first&#8208;row transition metal complexes (Mn  II  , Fe  II  , Co  II  , Ni  II  , Zn  II  , Cu  I  , Ag  I  , Au  I  ) and for the dinuclear Ti&#8208;support&#173;ed Fe&#8208;NHC complex [(OPy)  2  Ti(OPh  2  &#173;ImC  12  )  2  (FeI  2  )] (OPy = pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#173;methan&#173;olate). The complexes were studied concerning their struc&#173;tural and magnetic beha&#173;vior via multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy, SC&#8208;XRD analyses, variable temperature and field&#8208;dependent (VT&#8208;VF) SQUID magnetization methods, X&#8208;band EPR and, where appropriate, zero&#8208;field  57  Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy.</dc:description>

The complexes were studied concerning their struc&#173;tural and magnetic beha&#173;vior via multi-nuclear NMR spectroscopy, SC-XRD analyses, variable temperature and field-dependent (VT-VF) SQUID magnetization methods, X-band EPR and, where appropriate, zero-field  57  Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Oligomerization of Aromatic Amino Acids Induced by Gaps in Four&#8208;Helix Bundles of DNA or RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Folded nucleic acids with no more than 65 base pairs were found to act as amino acid polymerase for aromatic amino acids. Both DNA and RNA 4&#8208;helix bundles showed this effect, which was most pronounced for tryptophan.







Abstract
The formation of peptides from amino acids is one of the processes associated with life. Because of the dominant role of translation in extant biology, peptide&#8208;forming processes that are RNA induced are of particular interest. We have previously reported the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNAs as the products of spontaneous condensation reactions between ribonucleotides and free amino acids in aqueous solution. We now asked whether four&#8208;helix bundle (4HB) DNA or RNA folding motifs with a single&#8208; or double&#8208;nucleotide gap next to a 5&#8217;&#8208;phosphate can act as reaction sites for phosphoramidate formation. For glycine, this was found to be the case, whereas phenylalanine and tryptophan showed accelerated formation of peptides without a covalent link to the nucleic acid. Free peptides with up to 11 tryptophan or phenylalanine residues were found in precipitates forming in the presence of gap&#8208;containing DNA or RNA 4HBs. Control experiments using motifs with just a nick or primer alone did not have the same effect. Because folded structures with a gap in a double helix are likely products of hybridization of strands formed in statistically controlled oligomerization reactions, our results are interesting in the context of prebiotic scenarios. Independent of a putative role in evolution, our findings suggest that for some aromatic amino acids an RNA&#8208;induced pathway for oligomerization exists that does not have a discernable link to translation.

         <dc:description>It is still challenging to realize the dual&#8208;emission system, in which two luminescent bands simultaneously appear by the photo excitation, in solid with organic dyes due to difficulty in regulation of electronic properties in the excited state and concentration quenching.  o  &#8208;Carborane is known to be a versatile platform for constructing solid&#8208;state emitters since the sphere boron cluster is favorable for suppressing intermolecular interactions and subsequently concentration quenching. In this paper, we show the solid&#8208;state dual&#8208;emissive  o  &#8208;carborane derivatives. We prepared 4 types of  o  &#8208;carborane derivatives and found dual&#8208;emission behaviors both in solution and solid states. By regulating rotation at the  o  &#8208;carborane unit with the intramolecular C  cage  H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interaction, intensity ratios in dual emission were changed. Finally, it was demonstrated that the overall photoluminescence spectra can be estimated by the binding energy of intramolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and Cysteine&#8208;Specific Modification of Peptides, Proteins and Bacteriophage Using Chlorooximes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a novel chlorooxime mediated modification of native peptides and proteins under physiologic conditions. This method features fast reaction kinetics (apparent k 2 = 306 &#177; 4 M &#8208;1 s &#8208;1 for GSH) and exquisite selectivity for cysteine residues. This cysteine conjugation reaction can be carried out with just single&#8208;digit micromolar concentrations of the labeling reagent. The conjugates show high stability towards acid, base, and external thiol nucleophiles. A nitrile oxide species generated in situ is likely involved as the key intermediate. Furthermore, a bis&#8208;chlorooxime reagent is synthesized to enable facile Cys&#8208;Cys stapling in native peptides and proteins. This highly efficient cysteine conjugation and stapling was further implemented on bacteriophage to construct chemically modified phage libraries.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow Capsule NiCo2NS Prepared by Self&#8208;Sacrificing Template Method for High&#8208;Efficiency Bifunctional Catalyst and its Application in Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring the application of high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional oxygen catalysts to rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries has been a research hotspot in recent years. We succeeded in obtaining NiCo  2  NS with a hollow capsule structure through the self&#8208;sacrificing template method, which has a larger specific surface area and can provide more active sites. The introduction of S can change the valence distribution of N and the electronic structure of the M&#8208;N bond, so that NiCo  2  NS exhibits excellent performance in the overpotential and stability of ORR and OER. It shows overpotential of 154 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76 V. When used as a dual&#8208;function catalyst in ZABs, it exhibits good stability within 400 h. The flexible battery assembled by NiCo  2  NS also shows excellent performance, and can be cycled stably for 20 hours. The current maintains good stability when it is bent at different angles during the cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective C&#8722;H Functionalization Reactions under Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gold&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization reactions has gained significant attention as it often provides complementary chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities as compared to other transition metal&#8208;catalyzed processes. This review focuses on the recent developments in the field of enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization reactions under gold catalysis and also highlights the mechanistic rationale at the appropriate places.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective functionalization of ubiquitous C&#8722;H bonds has proven to be promising field as it offers the construction of chiral molecular complexity in a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical manner. In recent years, gold has emerged as an attractive contender for catalyzing such reactions. The unique reactivities and selectivities offered by gold catalysts have been exploited to access numerous asymmetric transformations based on gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization processes. Herein, this review critically highlights the major advances and discoveries made in the enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization under gold catalysis which is accompanied by mechanistic insights at appropriate places.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free approach for the synthesis of symmetrical/unsymmetrical triarylmethanes and diarylmethanes is reported. This protocol features mild conditions, feedstock reagents, very low catalyst loading, remarkable scope (&gt;85 examples) and gram&#8208;scale synthesis (TON=475). Moreover, several unexplored biologically active molecules for example, the antiparkinson agent, vibrindole A, turbomycin B and, total synthesis of an anti&#8208;breast&#8208;cancer agent is demonstrated.

This work describes a mild and robust double hydroarylation strategy for the synthesis of symmetrical /unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes in excellent yields using Lambert salt (0.2&#8211;1.0&#8197;mol%). Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling selective product formation, unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes products are obtained unprecedentedly. A highly efficient gram scale reaction has also been reported (TON for symmetrical product=475 and for unsymmetrical product=390). The synthetic utility of the methodology is demonstrated by the preparation of several unexplored diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethane&#8208;based biologically relevant molecules, such as arundine, vibrindole A, turbomycin B, and certain anti&#8208;inflammatory agents. A total synthesis of an anti&#8208;breast&#8208;cancer agent is also demonstrated. Control experiments, Hammett analysis, HRMS and GC&#8208;MS studies reveal the reaction intermediates and reaction mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;A transition-metal-free approach for the synthesis of symmetrical/unsymmetrical triarylmethanes and diarylmethanes is reported. This protocol features mild conditions, feedstock reagents, very low catalyst loading, remarkable scope (&amp;gt;85 examples) and gram-scale synthesis (TON=475). Moreover, several unexplored biologically active molecules for example, the antiparkinson agent, vibrindole A, turbomycin B and, total synthesis of an anti-breast-cancer agent is demonstrated. Control experiments and mechanistic studies have also been carried out to detect the reaction intermediates and reaction progress to elucidate the possible reaction mechanism.

         <title>Role of Anionic Backbone in NHC&#8208;Stabilized Coinage Metal Complexes: New Precursors for Atomic Layer Deposition**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In pursuit of new precursors for the deposition of coinage metals by atomic layer deposition (ALD), a series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;based CuI and AgI complexes has been synthesized, analyzed, and evaluated for their potential use in ALD. One precursor was found to be particularly useful for the deposition of metallic copper when using hydroquinone as the reducing agent in a thermally driven ALD process.







Abstract
Cu and Ag precursors that are volatile, reactive, and thermally stable are currently of high interest for their application in atomic&#8208;layer deposition (ALD) of thin metal films. In pursuit of new precursors for coinage metals, namely Cu and Ag, a series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;based CuI and AgI complexes were synthesized. Modifications in the substitution pattern of diketonate&#8208;based anionic backbones led to five monomeric Cu complexes and four closely related Ag complexes with the general formula [M(tBuNHC)(R)] (M=Cu, Ag; tBuNHC=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; R=diketonate). Thermal analysis indicated that most of the Cu complexes are thermally stable and volatile compared to the more fragile Ag analogs. One of the promising Cu precursors was evaluated for the ALD of nanoparticulate Cu metal deposits by using hydroquinone as the reducing agent at appreciably low deposition temperatures (145&#8211;160&#8201;&#176;C). This study highlights the considerable impact of the employed ligand sphere on the structural and thermal properties of metal complexes that are relevant for vapor&#8208;phase processing of thin films.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Synthesis of the Thinnest In2Se3/In2S3/In2Se3 Sandwich&#8208;Like Heterojunction for Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sandwich&#8208;like In2Se3/In2S3/In2Se3 (SW In2S3@In2Se3) heterojunction was fabricated via the in&#8197;situ synthesis method for water splitting. The in&#8197;situ synthesis technology was used to realize the overall transformation of the exterior of ultra&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets while ensuring that the nanosheet array is not damaged in this work. The sandwich&#8208;like structure constructed by this technology avoids the problems of heterojunction stacking. As a result, the SW In2S3@In2Se3 shows the best photoelectrochemical water splitting performance and excellent stability.







Abstract
The efficient utilization of solar energy for photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting is a feasible solution for developing clean energy and alleviating environmental issues. However, as the core of PEC technology, the existing photoanode catalysts have disadvantages such as poor photoelectrocatalytic conversion efficiency, low conductivity of photogenerated carriers, and instability. Here, we report the ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional sandwich&#8208;like (SW) heterojunction of In2Se3/In2S3/In2Se3 (SW In2S3@In2Se3) for the first time for PEC water splitting. Our findings identify the efficient separation of electrons and holes by constructing SW In2S3@In2Se3 heterojunction. The in&#8197;situ synthesis of ultrathin nanosheet arrays by using surface substitution of Se atom to epitaxially grow cell In2Se3 maximizes the contact area of heterogeneous interface and accelerates the transmission of charge carrier. Benefitting from the unique structure and composition characteristic, SW In2S3@In2Se3 displays excellent performance in PEC water splitting. The photocurrent density of SW In2S3@In2Se3 reaches 8.43&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE. Compared with In2S3, the SW In2S3@In2Se3 photoanode has nearly 12 times higher PEC performance, which represents the best performance among the In2S3&#8208;based photoanode heterojunction reported so far. The evolution rate of O2 reaches 78.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, and the photocurrent has no apparent variety within 24&#8197;h.

         <title>Tunable Excimer Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Isohexide Derivatives from Renewable Resources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and economical protocol for obtaining new CPL&#8208;emitting materials starting from natural chiral scaffold was developed. By choosing the scaffold, the aromatic moiety and the spacer, fine tuning of CPL and especially inversion of the preferential circular polarization of the emitted light was obtained.







Abstract
Organic compounds showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are at the forefront of novel applications and technologies. Here we show the synthesis and chiroptical properties of pyrene and perylene derivatives of inexpensive chiral scaffolds: isomannide and isosorbide. Low&#8208;intensity ECD spectra were obtained, suggesting the absence of chromophore interaction in the ground state, except in the case of isomannide bis&#8208;perylenecarboxylate, whose ECD spectrum showed a positive exciton couplet. All isomannide derivatives, with the only exception of the one containing a pyrenecarboxylate and a perylenecarboxylate, exhibited excimer CPL spectra, whereas isosorbide derivatives did not show any CPL. Isomannide derivatives bearing two pyrenecarboxylate or two pyrenylacetate groups showed positive CPL emission with dissymmetry factors up to 10&#8722;2, which depends on the conformational freedom of the appended units. The CPL sign, Stokes shift and order of magnitude of dissymmetry factor were reproduced by excited&#8208;state calculations on a representative compound. Interestingly, the mixed derivative containing pyrenic units with different spacing from the isomannide scaffold showed an oppositely signed excimer band with respect to the homo&#8208;substituted derivatives.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Rapid and high&#8208;throughput SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection without RNA extraction and amplification using a microfluidic biochip</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ongoing outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has spread globally and poses a threat to public health and national economic development. Rapid and high&#8208;throughput SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection without the need of RNA extraction and amplification remain a key challenge. In this study, we developed a novel SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection strategy using a microfluidic biochip for the rapid and ultrasensitive detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 without RNA extraction and amplification. The developed strategy takes advantage of the specific SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA and probe DNA reaction in the microfluidic channel, fluorescence signal regulation by nanomaterials, and accurate sample control by the microfluidic chip. It presents an ultralow limit of detection of 600 copies/mL in a large linear detection regime from 1 aM to 100 fM. Fifteen samples were simultaneously detected in 40 min without the need for RNA purification and amplification. The detection accuracy of the strategy was validated via quantitative reverse transcription&#8208;polymerase chain reaction (qRT&#8208;PCR), with a recovery of 99&#8208;113%. Therefore, the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA detection strategy proposed in this study can potentially be used for the quantitative diagnosis of viral infectious diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>The Potential of Micellar Media in the Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (DELs) have become a widely used technology in drug discovery. The use of micelle&#8208;forming surfactants provides new possibilities for synthetic organic chemistry and could be a promising technique for DNA&#8208;compatible chemistry as well. This review provides a summary of existing examples of micellar DEL approaches, together with a selection of micellar organic transformations fundamentally suitable for DEL synthesis.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology has become widely used in drug discovery research. The construction of DELs requires robust organic transformations that proceed in aqueous media under mild conditions. Unfortunately, the application of water as reaction medium for organic synthesis is not evident due to the generally limited solubility of organic reagents. However, the use of surfactants can offer a solution to this issue. Oil&#8208;in&#8208;water microemulsions formed by surfactant micelles are able to localize hydrophobic reagents inside them, resulting in high local concentrations of the organic substances in an otherwise poorly solvated environment. This review provides a conceptual and critical summary of micellar synthesis possibilities that are well suited to DEL synthesis. Existing examples of micellar DEL approaches, together with a selection of micellar organic transformations fundamentally suitable for DEL are discussed.

         <title>Electronic Circular Dichroism&#8208;Circularly Polarized Raman (eCP&#8208;Raman): A New Form of Chiral Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly developed chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, which combines high chirality sensitivity of electronic CD and high resolution capability of Raman is reported in this Concept article. The model for quantifying eCP&#8208;Raman effects is derived and multiple examples, which show strong eCP&#8208;Raman responses of solvents and the resonating chiral solutes, are discussed. Its usage in untangling complex excited state phenomena is also mentioned.







Abstract
This Concept article summarizes recent work on the development of a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, which combines two spectroscopies: electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized Raman (CP&#8208;Raman). First, some puzzling observations while carrying out Raman optical activity (ROA) measurements of several transition metal complexes under resonance are described, as well as the search for the mechanisms responsible. Then an equation for quantifying the eCP&#8208;Raman contribution is presented, followed by several examples of how eCP&#8208;Raman influences the IR&#8722;IL spectra of achiral and chiral solvent molecules and of a number of chiral solutes under resonance. The conditions to extract resonance ROA, when the eCP&#8208;Raman contribution is minimized, are also discussed. Finally, we comment on the potential applications of eCP&#8208;Raman.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Oxaboracyclic Compounds Based on Naphthalene and Biphenyl Backbone and Phase&#8208;Dependent Luminescence of their Chelate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General synthetic routes to a series of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered boracyclic systems based on naphthalene and biphenyl backbones were developed. Their physicochemical properties were comprehensively studied by NMR, X&#8208;ray and computational techniques. Strong phase&#8208;dependent variation in luminescent properties with quantum yields ranging from 10&#8211;95&#8201;% was observed for organoboron complex derived from 1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1H,3H&#8208;naphtho[1,8&#8208;cd][1,2]oxaborinin&#8208;3&#8208;one.







Abstract
The approach to a series of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered oxaboraheterocycles based on naphthalene or biphenyl backbones was developed. The key synthetic step involved Br/Li exchange in respective potassium (bromoaryl)trifluoroborates followed by quenching with selected electrophiles (CO2, DMF, Me2Si(H)Cl) and hydrolytic workup. Two ring&#8208;expanded benzoxaborole congeners were obtained by an additional reduction step with LiAlH4 or NaBH4. The obtained boracyclic compounds were characterized in detail by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Specifically, biphenyl&#8208;based systems show dynamic behaviour interpreted in terms of inversion of non&#8208;planar seven&#8208;membered boraheterocycles. The acidity of the obtained compounds varies very strongly (pKa ranges from 3.1&#8211;9.6) depending on their structure. Due to the enhanced boron Lewis acidity, selected compounds were used as a basis for luminescent complexes with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. A strong phase&#8208;dependent variation of emission&#8208;band maximum (480&#8211;527&#8197;nm) and photoluminescence quantum yield (10&#8211;95&#8201;%) was observed, which was rationalized in terms of specific aggregation effects.

         <title>Femtosecond spectroscopy and nonlinear optical properties of aza&#8208;BODIPY derivatives in solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fast relaxation processes in the excited electronic states of functionalized aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (aza&#8208;BODIPY) derivatives (  1  &#8208;  4  ) were investigated in liquid media at room temperature, including the linear photophysical, photochemical, and nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. Optical gain was revealed for nonfluorescent derivatives  3  and  4  in the near infrared (NIR) spectral range under femtosecond excitation. The values of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and excited&#8208;state absorption (ESA) cross&#8208;sections were obtained for  1  &#8208;  4  in dichloromethane using femtosecond Z&#8208;scans, and the role of bromine substituents in the molecular structures of  2  and  4  is discussed.

         <title>Evidence of Kinetically Relevant Consistency in Thermal and Photo&#8208;thermal HCOOH Decomposition over Pd/LaCrO3/C3N4 Composite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;thermal catalysis has been an attractive alternative strategy to promote chemical reactions for years, however, how light cooperates with thermal energy is still unclear. We meet this demand by exploring reaction mechanism via pressure dependency studies as well as H/D exchange experiments with HCOOH decomposition as a probe over a palladium nanoparticle (Pd  n  ) and isolated Pd (Pd  1  ) decorated LaCrO  3  /C  3  N  4  composite catalyst, in which the H  2  formation rate shows a first&#8208;order dependence on HCOOH and inverse first&#8208;order dependence on CO partial pressures no matter the reaction was driven by thermal or photo&#8208;thermal energy. Additionally, negligible kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs: k  H  /k  D  ) were determined under both dark and light conditions at 1.04 and 1.18 when the HCOOH was replaced by HCOOD. Besides, when the reactant HCOOH was further replaced by DCOOD, the KIE values of 1.55 (dark) and 1.92 (light) was obtained, which indicates that the HCOOH decomposition follows kinetically relevant (KR) of C&#8208;H bond rupture within HCOOH molecule under both thermal and photo&#8208;thermal reactions and the catalytic surface was found to be densely covered by CO based on the pressure dependency studies as well as  in&#8208;situ  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Clearly, the HCOOH decomposition driven by thermal and photo&#8208;thermal energy follows the same reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Explorations of New SHG Materials in Mercury Iodate Sulfate System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Through systematic experiments, two novel mercury iodate sulfates, namely, Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  )(H  2  O) and Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  ) have been obtained. They crystallize in monoclinic space group  C  2 and  C  2/  c  , respectively. Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  )(H  2  O) exhibits the [Hg(IO  3  )]  +  polar cationic layer inherited from Hg(IO  3  )  2  and the threedimensional (3D) framework inherited from HgSO  4  . This enables Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  )(H  2  O) to generate a strong second harmonic generation (SHG) response of 6 times that of KH  2  PO  4  (KDP). The structure of Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  ) is very similar to that of Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  )(H  2  O), and it features a 3D network composed of [Hg(IO  3  )]  +  cationic layers linked by bridging SO  4  2&#8208;  anions. Hg  2  (IO  3  )  2  (SO  4  )(H  2  O) shows a large optical band gap of 3.98 eV and a high dehydration temperature of 250&#176;C. This study indicates that by reasonable design, the introduction of multiple functional groups into a compound may combine their advantages to achieve good overall optical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Stable Yttrium Organic Framework as a Host for Optical Thermometry and D2O Detection</title>

         <dc:description>The yttrium&#8208;organic framework (Y 0.89 Tb 0.10 Eu 0.01 ) 6 (BDC) 7 (OH) 4 (H 2 O) 4 (BDC = benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate) is hydrothermally stable up to at least 513 K and thermally stable in air in excess of 673 K. The relative intensities of luminescence of Tb 3+ and Eu 3+ are governed by Tb 3+ &#8208;to&#8208;Eu 3+ phonon&#8208;assisted energy transfer and Tb 3+ &#8208;to&#8208;ligand back transfer and are responsible for the differing temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence of the two ions. This provides a ratiometric luminescent thermometer in the 288 &#8211; 573 K temperature range, not previously seen for MOF materials, with a high sensitivity, 1.69&#177;0.04% K &#8208;1 at 523 K. In aqueous conditions, loosely bound H 2 O can be replaced by D 2 O in the same material, which modifies decay lifetimes to yield a quantitative luminescent D 2 O sensor with a useful sensitivity for practical application</dc:description>

         <title>Control of Crystallinity of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Polymers by Rational Monomer Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interest in two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers (2D CPs) has increased significantly in recent years. In particular, vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs with fully in&#8208;plane sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated structures, high thermal and chemical stability, have become the focus of attention. Although the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reaction has been recently demonstrated in synthesizing vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs, it remains largely unexplored due to the challenge in synthesis. In this work, we reveal the control of crystallinity of 2D CPs during the solvothermal synthesis of 2D&#8208;poly(phenylene&#8208;quinoxaline&#8208;vinylene)s (2D&#8208;PPQVs) and 2D&#8208;poly(phenylene&#8208;vinylene)s  via  the HWE polycondensation. The employment of fluorinated phosphonates and rigid aldehyde building blocks is demonstrated as crucial factors in enhancing the crystallinity of the obtained 2D CPs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the critical role of the fluorinated phosphonate in enhancing the reversibility of the (semi)reversible C&#8208;C single bond formation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: We report the direct synthesis of diamine radical cations in crystalline form proceeding through oxidation of triphenylamine followed by the formation of a novel C&#8208;N bond. While the oxidative coupling of triphenylamine is well studied, diamine products are rarely captured in their radical cation state. The neutral diamine most frequently obtained from this reaction pathway is N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine. Here, we have demonstrated the capture of radical cations of diamines in crystalline form in one step starting with neutral triphenylamine, and observed the formation of two products (the radical cations of N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediamine or N,N,N',N'&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine) depending on the oxidizing agent used. The radical species are characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208; Ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and optical spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Road Toward More Efficient Biocompatible Two&#8208;Photon Excitable Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon absorption is a widely use process for bioimaging, as it allows to go deeper in tissue than conventional absorption and also limit photodamages. Unfortunately, classical dyes possess poor two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections. In this work, we developed a series of quadrupolar dyes and showed that these biocompatible probes exhibit high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections (up to 3650&#8197;GM) and are therefore good candidates for two&#8208;photon bioimaging.







Abstract
Red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR absorption and emission wavelengths are key requirements for intravital bioimaging. One of the way to reach such excitation wavelengths is to use two&#8208;photon excitation. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of two&#8208;photon excitable fluorophores that are both efficient and biocompatible. Thus, we design a series of biocompatible quadrupolar dyes in order to study their ability to be used for live&#8208;cell imaging, and in particular for two&#8208;photon microscopy. Hence, we report the synthesis of 5 probes based on different donor cores (phenoxazine, acridane, phenazasiline and phenothiazine) and the study of their linear and non&#8208;linear photophysical properties. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were performed and were able to highlight the structure&#8208;property relationship of this series. All these studies highlight the great potential of three of these biocompatible dyes for two&#8208;photon microscopy, as they both exhibit high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections (up to 3650&#8197;GM) and emit orange to red light. This potential was confirmed through live&#8208;cell two&#8208;photon microscopy experiments, leading to images with very high brightness and contrast.

         <title>S&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)Benzothioate (TFBT): A KF&#8208;Based Reagent for Nucleophilic Trifluoromethylthiolation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No need for HF: S&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)benzothioate (TFBT), which is easily synthesized by using KF as the only fluorine source, has been developed as an inexpensive, bench&#8208;stable and user&#8208;friendly trifluoromethylthiolation reagent. TFBT reagent can readily release SCF3&#8722; with various counterions. The synthetic application of TFBT is demonstrated by trifluoromethylthiolation&#8208;halogenation of arynes, bis(trifluoromethylthiolation)&#8208;halogenation of 1,2&#8208;benzdiynes, nucleophilic substitution of alkyl halides, deoxytrifluoromethylthiolation of alcohols, and cross&#8208;coupling with aryl and vinyl boronic acids.

         <title>The Spin Modulation Stimulated Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over LaCoO3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin modulation strategy is proposed to improve the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction activity for perovskite oxide LaCoO3 (LCO), which was realized by adjusting the high temperature thermal reduction time. The prepared catalyst with optimized high temperature thermal reduction time of 60&#8197;min (LCO&#8208;60) exhibits more appropriate eg orbital occupation and shows significantly enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity under an external magnetic field.







Abstract
Perovskite is a promising non&#8208;noble catalyst and has been widely investigated for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, there is still serious lack of valid approaches to further enhance their catalytic performance. Herein, we propose a spin state modulation strategy to improve the OER electrocatalytic activity of typical perovskite material of LaCoO3. Specifically, the electronic configuration transition was realized by a simple high temperature thermal reduction process. M&#8208;H hysteresis loop results reveal that the reduction treatment can produce more unpaired electrons in 3d orbit by promoting the electron transitions of Co from low spin state to high spin state, and thus lead to the increase of the spin polarization. Electrochemical measurements show that the catalytic performance of LaCoO3 is strongly dependent on its electronic configuration. With the optimized reduction treatment, the overpotential for the OER process in 0.5&#8197;M KOH electrolyte solution at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density was 396&#8197;mV, significantly lower than that of the original state. Furthermore, it can mediate efficient OER with an overpotential of 383&#8197;mV under an external magnetic field, which is attributed to the appropriate electron filling. Our results show that electron spin state regulation is a new way to boost the OER electrocatalytic activity.

         <dc:description>Physico&#8208;chemical properties important to drug discovery (pKa  , LogP, and aqueous solubility), as well as metabolic stability, were studied for a series of functionalized  gem&#8208;difluorinated cycloalkanes and compared to those of non&#8208;fluorinated and acyclic counterparts to evaluate the impact of the fluorination. It was found that the influence of the CF2&#160;moiety on the acidity/basicity of the corresponding carboxylic acids and amines was defined by inductive the effect of the fluorine atoms and was nearly the same for acyclic and cyclic aliphatic compounds. Lipophilicity and aqueous solubility followed more complex trends and were affected by the position of the fluorine atoms, ring size, and even the nature of the functional group present; also, significant differences were found for the acyclic and cyclic series. Also,  gem&#8208;difluorination either did not affect or slightly improved the metabolic stability of the corresponding model derivatives. The presented results can be used as a guide for rational drug design employing fluorine and establish the first chapter in a catalog of the key  in vitro  properties of fluorinated cycloalkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Strengthening of the C&#8722;F Bond in Fumaryl Fluoride with Superacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
F plus: The reaction of fumaryl fluoride with the superacids XF/MF5 (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) results in monoprotonated and diprotonated species: the first examples of a protonated acyl fluoride moiety. Surprisingly, the C&#8722;F bond lengths in the protonated cations are considerably shortened.







Abstract
The reaction of fumaryl fluoride with the superacidic solutions XF/MF5 (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) results in the formation of the monoprotonated and diprotonated species, dependent on the stoichiometric ratio of the Lewis acid to fumaryl fluoride. The salts [C4H3F2O2]+[MF6]&#8722; (M=As, Sb) and [C4H2X2F2O2]2+([MF6]&#8722;)2 (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) are the first examples with a protonated acyl fluoride moiety. They were characterized by low&#8208;temperature vibrational spectroscopy. Low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses were carried out for [C4H3F2O2]+[SbF6]&#8722; as well as for [C4H4F2O2]2+([MF6]&#8722;)2 (M=As, Sb). The experimental results are discussed together with quantum chemical calculations of the cations [C4H4F2O2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;HF]2+ and [C4H3F2O2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF]+ at the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory. In addition, electrostatic potential (ESP) maps combined with natural population analysis (NPA) charges were calculated in order to investigate the electron distribution and the charge&#8208;related properties of the diprotonated species. The C&#8722;F bond lengths in the protonated dication are considerably reduced on account of the +R effect.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;F plus&lt;/b&gt;: The reaction of fumaryl fluoride with the superacids XF/MF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) results in monoprotonated and diprotonated species: the first examples of a protonated acyl fluoride moiety. Surprisingly, the C&#8722;F bond lengths in the protonated cations are considerably shortened.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of fumaryl fluoride with the superacidic solutions XF/MF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) results in the formation of the monoprotonated and diprotonated species, dependent on the stoichiometric ratio of the Lewis acid to fumaryl fluoride. The salts [C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[MF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (M=As, Sb) and [C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;([MF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (X=H, D; M=As, Sb) are the first examples with a protonated acyl fluoride moiety. They were characterized by low-temperature vibrational spectroscopy. Low-temperature NMR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray structure analyses were carried out for [C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as well as for [C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;([MF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (M=As, Sb). The experimental results are discussed together with quantum chemical calculations of the cations [C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2&#8201;HF]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and [C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. In addition, electrostatic potential (ESP) maps combined with natural population analysis (NPA) charges were calculated in order to investigate the electron distribution and the charge-related properties of the diprotonated species. The C&#8722;F bond lengths in the protonated dication are considerably reduced on account of the +R effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Driven Systematic Synthesis of Coordination Polymers with Non&#8208;centrosymmetric Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Concept article, a systematic method to synthesize coordination polymers with macroscopic non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures by using chiral organic ligands as structure directing agents is provided. Our survey and analysis contain material design strategies, structure&#8208;driven SHG properties, and structure&#8208;property relationships. The importance of hyperpolarizability formed by intermolecular hydrogen boding interactions to SHG is emphasized. The topic could provide new insight into the target design and systematic synthesis of new functional materials with intriguing chemical and physical properties.







Abstract
Chirality is an important concept in chemistry revealing intriguing optical properties such as circular dichroism (CD), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), etc. As one of the non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) classes, chiral materials with extended structures may exhibit unique nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, such as second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). In this Concept article, a series of recently discovered NCS coordination polymers (CPs) from use of carefully designed chiral organic ligands are reviewed. Combining several metal cations such as lanthanides, lead, zinc, and cadmium with rigid chiral ligands has resulted in interesting CPs with both polar and nonpolar structures. Detailed structures, SHG properties, and structure&#8208;property relationships are provided. The importance of hyperpolarizability formed by intermolecular hydrogen boding interactions to SHG is emphasized.

The intermediate incommensurate modulated structure of &#923;&#8208;cobalt (III) sepulchrate trinitrate is ordered yet retains amplitude of molecular rotations common to high temperature disordered as well as low temperature high Z&#8242; structure. Contributions from bifurcated N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds as well as very short H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H contacts in addition to C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds leads to severe frustrations in crystal packing than that in the lock&#8208;in phase.







Abstract
Phase transitions in molecular crystals are often determined by intermolecular interactions. The cage complex of [Co(C12H30N8)]3+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3&#8201;NO3&#8722; is reported to undergo a disorder&#8208;order phase transition at Tc1 &#8776;133&#8197;K upon cooling. Temperature&#8208;dependent neutron and synchrotron diffraction experiments revealed satellite reflections in addition to main reflections in the diffraction patterns below Tc1. The modulation wave vector varies as function of temperature and locks in at Tc3&#8776;98&#8197;K. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal symmetry lowers from hexagonal to monoclinic in the incommensurately modulated phases in Tc1&lt;T&lt;Tc3. Distinctive levels of competitions: trade&#8208;off between longer N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O and shorter C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds; steric constraints to dense C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O bonds give rise to pronounced modulation of the basic structure. Severely frustrated crystal packing in the incommensurate phase is precursor to optimal balance of intermolecular interactions in the lock&#8208;in phase.

         <title>Exploring the Association of Electron&#8208;Donating Corroles with Phthalocyanines as Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;covalent corrole&#8208;(Zn)phthalocyanine conjugates were afforded by mixing electron&#8208;donating 10&#8208;meso&#8208;pyridine corroles with an electron&#8208;accepting phthalocyanine. Investigation of the complexation by NMR, absorption, and fluorescence essays revealed binding constants as high as 106&#8201;m&#8722;1. Introducing non&#8208;covalent corrole&#8208;phthalocyanine linkages induces sizeable differences in the context of light harvesting and charge&#8208;transfer when compared to covalently linked equivalents.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;donating corroles (Cor) were integrated with electron&#8208;accepting phthalocyanines (Pc) to afford two different non&#8208;covalent Cor&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Pc systems. At the forefront was the coordination between a 10&#8208;meso&#8208;pyridine Cor and a ZnPc. The complexation was corroborated in a combination of NMR, absorption, and fluorescence assays, and revealed association with binding constants as high as 106&#8197;m&#8722;1. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies evidenced that regardless of exciting Cor or Pc, the charge&#8208;separated state evolved efficiently in both cases, followed by a slow charge&#8208;recombination to reinstate the ground state. The introduction of non&#8208;covalent linkages between Cor and Pc induces sizeable differences in the context of light harvesting and transfer of charges when compared with covalently linked Cor&#8208;Pc conjugates.

         <title>Disordered low molecular weight spiropyran exhibiting photoregulated adhesion ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functions of the materials composed of small molecules are highly dependent on their ordered molecular arrangements in both natural and artificial systems. Without ordered structure, small molecules hardly gain complicated functions, due to the absence of intermolecular covalent bond connection or strong network. Here, a low molecular weight spiropyran that could exhibit attractive photochromism and powerful adhesion property in disordered solid state is demonstrated. With maximum up to ~8 MPa, the adhesion strength could be photoregulated in multiple levels, which also shows one&#8208;to&#8208;one correspondence to the specific color state. The working mechanism analysis on the photoregulated adhesion reveals that the isomer ratio of merocyanine form and the molecular packing density of spiropyran are the determining factors for the adhesion ability. The discovery of photoregulated adhesion from pure spiropyran provides a new strategy for developing functional materials by employing low molecular weight compounds.</dc:description>

The discovery of photoregulated adhesion from pure spiropyran provides a new strategy for developing functional materials by employing low molecular weight compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Carbonyl Alkylative Amination Enabled by Titanium Dioxide Mediated Decarboxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein a heterogeneous carbonyl alkylative amination has been developed that proceeds via photoredox catalysis. The use of nano titanium dioxide (TiO2, 25 nm) as photocatalyst allows for efficient synthesis of diverse amines in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies reveals a single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism involving the photoexcitation of TiO2 to generate alkyl radicals from carboxylic acids decarboxylation. This protocol highlights the utility of using heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysts to promote a practical and general synthesis of complex amines from readily available feedstocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Diradical Properties of Boron&#8208;Containing &#960;&#8208;Systems by Structural Isomerism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning diradical character is an important topic for organic diradicaloids. Herein, we report the precise borylation enabling structural isomerism as an effective strategy to modulate diradical character and thereby properties of organic diradicaloids. We synthesized a new B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon that has the indeno[1,2&#8208;  b  ]fluorene &#960;&#8208;skeleton with the &#946;&#8208;carbons bonding to two boron atoms. Detailed theoretical and experimental results show that this bonding pattern leads to its distinctive electronic structures and properties in comparison to that of its isomeric molecule. This molecule has the efficient conjugation between boron atoms and &#960;&#8208;skeleton, resulting in downshifted LUMO and HOMO levels. Moreover, it exhibits smaller diradical character and thereby inhibited diradical properties, such as significantly blue&#8208;shifted light absorption, larger energy bandgap and weak para&#8208;magnetic resonance. Notably, this B&#8208;containing polycyclic hydrocarbon possesses much stronger Lewis acidity and its Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts display enhanced diradical character, demonstrating the positive effects of Lewis coordination on modulating diradical performance.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first chiral helicene&#8208;NHC gold(I) complexes efficient in enantioselective catalysis were prepared. The L&#8208;shaped chiral ligand is composed of an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ylidene (IPy) scaffold laterally&#8208;substituted by a configurationally stable [5]&#8208;helicenoid unit.

After HPLC enantiomeric resolution, X&#8208;ray crystallography and theoretical calculations enabled structural and stereochemical characterization of these configurationally stable NHC&#8208;gold(I) complexes.

         <dc:description>A new photocatalytic ring expansion reaction that transforms &#947;&#8208;lactams into 2&#8208;pyridones is described. The reaction is radical&#8208;triggered and was inspired by a late stage oxidation commonly observed in fungal metabolism. The reaction is particularly powerful because it can be included in a one pot process which converts readily accessible furans directly into 2&#8208;pyridones through sequential photo&#8208;induced reactions (energy transfer &amp; electron transfer). The study also unveiled unprecedented reactivity for the mild and metal&#8208;free photocatalyst eosin, wherein it is used to cleave a C&#8208;I bond activated only by an electron donor on the neighbouring carbon.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkali Metal Based Triimidosulfite Cages as Versatile Precursors for Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>

The potassium and sodium cages [{S(tBuN)2(tBuNH)}2K3(tmeda)K3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}2] (1), [S(tBuN)3(thf)3Na3SNa3(thf)3(NtBu)3S] (2) and [S(tBuN)3(thf)3Na3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}] (3) serve as precursors to give f&#8208;metal single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMM). Especially, the sodium precursor 2 represents an ideal candidate and the subsequent dysprosium SMM [ClDy{Na(thf)}2{(NtBu)3S}2] (6) displays an energy barrier Ueff of 513&#8197;cm&#8722;1, a frequency dependency of the dynamic out&#8208;of&#8208;phase susceptibility up to 60&#8197;K and a butterfly hysteresis up to 7&#8197;K.







Abstract
Based on the potassium [{S(tBuN)2(tBuNH)}2K3(tmeda)&#8208;K3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}2] (1) and sodium precursors [S(tBuN)3(thf)3&#8208;Na3SNa3(thf)3(NtBu)3S] (2), [S(tBuN)3(thf)3Na3{(HNtBu)(NtBu)2S}] (3) and [(tmeda)3S&#8208;{Na3(NtBu)3S}2] (4) the syntheses and magnetic properties of three mixed metal triimidosulfite based alkali&#8208;lanthanide&#8208;metal&#8208;cages [(tBuNH)Dy{K(0.5tmeda)}2{(NtBu)3S}2]n (5) and [ClLn{Na(thf)}2{(NtBu)3S}2] with Ln=Dy (6), Er (7) are reported. The corresponding potassium (1) and sodium (2&#8211;4) based cages are characterized through XRD and NMR experiments. Preventing lithium chloride co&#8208;complexation led to a significant increase of SMM performance to previously reported sulfur&#8208;nitrogen ligands. The subsequent DyIII&#8208;complexes 5 and 6 display slow relaxation of magnetization at zero field, with relaxation barriers U=77.0&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for 5, 512.9 and 316.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1 for 6, respectively. Significantly, the latter complex 6 also exhibits a butterfly&#8208;shaped hysteresis up to 7&#8197;K.

         <title>Capture of Gaseous Iodine in Isoreticular Zirconium&#8208;Based UiO&#8208;n Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Influence of Amino Functionalization, DFT Calculations, Raman and EPR Spectroscopic Investigation</title>

Conversion of I2 into I3&#8722; species trapped within UiO&#8208;n. The adsorption of gaseous iodine in UiO&#8208;n MOF&#8208;like materials has been systematically studied by analyzing kinetic curves. They show the conversion of trapped I2 into anionic species I3&#8722;, which is enhanced by the existence of amino groups functionalizing the organic linkers.







Abstract
A series of Zr&#8208;based UiO&#8208;n MOF materials (n=66, 67, 68) have been studied for iodine capture. Gaseous iodine adsorption was collected kinetically from a home&#8208;made set&#8208;up allowing the continuous measurement of iodine content trapped within UiO&#8208;n compounds, with organic functionalities (&#8722;H, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, &#8722;(OH)2, &#8722;NO2, &#8722;NH2, (&#8722;NH2)2, &#8722;CH2 NH2) by in&#8208;situ UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This study emphasizes the role of the amino groups attached to the aromatic rings of the ligands connecting the {Zr6O4(OH)4} brick. In particular, the preferential interaction of iodine with lone&#8208;pair groups, such as amino functions, has been experimentally observed and is also based on DFT calculations. Indeed, higher iodine contents were systematically measured for amino&#8208;functionalized UiO&#8208;66 or UiO&#8208;67, compared to the pristine material (up to 1211&#8197;mg/g for UiO&#8208;67&#8208;(NH2)2). However, DFT calculations revealed the highest computed interaction energies for alkylamine groups (&#8722;CH2NH2) in UiO&#8208;67 (&#8722;128.5&#8197;kJ/mol for the octahedral cavity), and pointed out the influence of this specific functionality compared with that of an aromatic amine. The encapsulation of iodine within the pore system of UiO&#8208;n materials and their amino&#8208;derivatives has been analyzed by UV&#8208;Vis and Raman spectroscopy. We showed that a systematic conversion of molecular iodine (I2) species into anionic I&#8722; ones, stabilized as I&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I2 or I3&#8722; complexes within the MOF cavities, occurs when I2@UiO&#8208;n samples are left in ambient light.

         <title>Directed Synthesis and Chemistry of Unsymmetric Dicationic Diboranes and Their Use in Frustrated Lewis Pair&#8208;like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several new unsymmetric dicationic diboranes were synthesized and characterized by substitution reactions of two triflato groups by a phosphino&#8208;pyridine double Lewis base. The intermediate of one of these substitution reactions, in which only the pyridine base of the phosphino&#8208;pyridine is bound to the diboron unit, displays frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;like chemistry. On the basis of the results, a new type of FLP chemistry is proposed, using for the first time dicationic diboranes as Lewis acidic component.







Abstract
The chemistry of dicationic diboranes with two BII atoms that are engaged in direct B&#8722;B bonding is by enlarge unexplored, although these molecules have intriguing properties due to their combined Lewis acidic and electron&#8208;donor properties. Unsymmetric dicationic diboranes are extremely rare, but especially attractive due to their polarized B&#8722;B bond. In this work we report the directed synthesis of several stable unsymmetric dicationic diboranes by reaction between the electron&#8208;rich ditriflato&#8208;diborane B2(hpp)2(OTf)2 (hpp=1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyrimidinate) and phosphino&#8208;pyridines, establishing B&#8722;N and B&#8722;P bonds with the diborane concomitant with triflate elimination. In the case of 2&#8208;((ditertbutylphosphino)methyl)pyridine, the B&#8722;N bond is formed instantly, but the B&#8722;P bond formation requires (due to steric constraints) several days at ambient conditions for completion, creating an intermediate that could be used for frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;like chemistry. Here we test its reaction with an aldehyde, and propose a new type of FLP&#8208;like chemistry.

         <title>Peroxidase&#8208;Mimetic Copper&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Dots for Oxidative Stress&#8208;Mediated Broad&#8208;Spectrum and Efficient Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;sized, mono&#8208;dispersible, hydrophilic, and peroxidase&#8208;mimetic Cu&#8208;doped carbon dots (Cu&#8208;CDs) were prepared via one&#8208;pot hydrothermal carbonization. The harvested Cu&#8208;CDs permeated the cytomembrane and greatly promoted the catalytic oxidization of endogenous H2O2 into .OH and glutathione (GSH) depletion by oxidizing GSH into glutathione disulfide (GS&#8208;SG), resulting in the occurrence of oxidative stress and finally, death of bacteria.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have recently emerged as antibacterial agents and have attracted considerable attention owing to their fascinating merits of small size, facile fabrication, and surface functionalization. Most of them are involved in external light activation or hybridization with other functional nanomaterials. Herein, we present peroxidase&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doped CDs (Cu&#8208;CDs) for in vitro antibacterial applications. The unique peroxidase&#8208;mimicking property of the Cu&#8208;CDs was demonstrated by tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic assay, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, and hydroxy radical probe. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were chosen as representative gram&#8208;negative/positive models against which Cu&#8208;CDs exhibited superior antimicrobial activity even at a dosage down to 5&#8197;&#956;g/mL. A possible mechanism of action was that the Cu&#8208;CDs triggered a catalytic redox reaction of endogenous H2O2 and glutathione depletion in the bacteria cells, with subsequent oxidative stress and membrane disruption. This work provides a new strategy for the design of microenvironment&#8208;responsive antimicrobial nano&#8208;agents.

Abstract
An electrochemical method for the green and practical synthesis of a broad range of substituted isoxazoline cores is presented. Both aryl and more challenging alkyl aldoximes are converted to the desired isoxazoline in an electrochemically enabled regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reaction with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. Additionally, in&#8208;situ reaction monitoring methods compatible with electrochemistry equipment have been developed in order to probe the reaction pathway. Supporting analyses from kinetic (time&#8208;course) modelling and density functional theory support a stepwise, radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, and discounts hypothesised involvement of closed shell [3+2] cycloaddition pathways.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An electrochemical method for the green and practical synthesis of a broad range of substituted isoxazoline cores is presented. Both aryl and more challenging alkyl aldoximes are converted to the desired isoxazoline in an electrochemically enabled regio- and diastereoselective reaction with electron-deficient alkenes. Additionally, in-situ reaction monitoring methods compatible with electrochemistry equipment have been developed in order to probe the reaction pathway. Supporting analyses from kinetic (time-course) modelling and density functional theory support a stepwise, radical-mediated mechanism, and discounts hypothesised involvement of closed shell [3+2] cycloaddition pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quadrupolar Ultrafast Charge Transfer in Diaminoazobenzene&#8208;Bridged Perylenediimide Triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient quadrupolar charge transfer in diaminoazobenzene&#8208;bridged perylenediimide triads resulted in wide&#8208;band light capture. Charge&#8208;transfer emission was also possible to observe, and by fluorescence&#8208;spectroelectrochemistry it was possible to revert this phenomenon. Ultrafast quadrupolar charge transfer was confirmed by computational and femtosecond pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy in these triads.







Abstract
Strong push&#8208;pull interactions between electron donor, diaminoazobenzene (azo), and an electron acceptor, perylenediimide (PDI), entities in the newly synthesized A&#8722;D&#8722;A type triads (A=electron acceptor and D=electron donor) and the corresponding A&#8722;D dyads are shown to reveal wide&#8208;band absorption covering the entire visible spectrum. Electrochemical studies revealed the facile reduction of PDI and relatively easier oxidation of diaminoazobenzene in the dyads and triads. Charge transfer reversal using fluorescence&#8208;spectroelectrochemistry wherein the PDI fluorescence recovery upon one&#8208;electron oxidation, deterring the charge&#8208;transfer interactions, was possible to accomplish. The charge transfer state density difference and the frontier orbitals from the DFT calculations established the electron&#8208;deficient PDI to be an electron acceptor and diaminoazobenzene to be an electron donor resulting in energetically closely positioned PDI&#948;&#8722;&#8208;Azo&#948;+&#8208;PDI&#948;&#8722; quadrupolar charge&#8208;transfer states in the case of triads and Azo&#948;+&#8208;PDI&#948;&#8722; dipolar charge&#8208;transfer states in the case of dyads. Subsequent femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies unequivocally proved the occurrence of excited&#8208;state charge transfer in these dyads and triads in benzonitrile wherein the calculated forward charge transfer rate constants, kf, were limited to instrument response factor, meaning &gt;1012&#8197;s&#8722;1 revealing the occurrence of ultrafast photo&#8208;events. The charge recombination rate constant, kr, was found to depend on the type of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates, that is, it was possible to establish faster kr in the case of triads (&#8764;1011&#8197;s&#8722;1) compared to dyads (&#8764;1010&#8197;s&#8722;1). Modulating both ground and excited&#8208;state properties of PDI with the help of strong quadrupolar and dipolar charge transfer and witnessing ultrafast charge transfer events in the studied triads and dyads is borne out from the present study.

         <title>Nanosized Carbon Macrocycles Based on a Planar Chiral Pseudo Meta&#8208;[2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of planar chiral pseudo meta&#8208; [2.2]paracyclophane with cycloparaphenylenes backbone leads to necklace&#8208;shaped chiral macrocycles, which exhibit unique photophysical properties with high fluorescence quantum yield of up to 82&#8201;%. In addition, size&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties with moderately large |glum| and CPL brightness BCPL value originating from the planar chirality of [2.2]paracyclophane were observed.







Abstract
Structural designs combining cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) backbone with planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane ([2.2]PCP) lead to optical&#8208;active chiral macrocycles with intriguing properties. X&#8208;ray crystal analysis revealed aesthetic necklace&#8208;shaped structures and size&#8208;dependent packages with long&#8208;range channels. The macrocycles exhibit unique photophysical properties with high fluorescence quantum yield of up to 82&#8201;%, and the fluorescent color varies with ring size. In addition, size&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties with moderately large CPL dissymmetry factor of 10&#8722;3 and CPL brightness in the range of 30&#8211;40&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 were observed.

         <dc:description>Exerting morphological control over metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is critical for determining their catalytic performance and to optimize their packing behavior in areas from separations to fuel gas storage. A mechanism&#8208;based approach to tailor the morphology of MOFs is introduced and experimentally demonstrated for five cubic Zn  4  O&#8208;based MOFs. This methodology provides three key features: 1) computational screening for selection of appropriate additives to change crystal morphology based on knowledge of the crystal structure alone; 2) use of additive to metal cluster geometric relationships to achieve morphologies expressing desired crystallographic facets; 3) potential for suppression of interpenetration for certain phases.</dc:description>

         <title>Random Occupation of Multimetal Sites in Transition Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Less order, more action: Compared to single metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the random occupation of multi&#8208;metal nodes in transitional MOFs builds a high&#8208;entropy state. Furthermore, this high&#8208;entropy&#8208;state MOFs caused a partial crystal distortion that can break up the catalytic atom&#8216;s saturated coordination environment to produce a highly active unsaturated state, optimizing the adsorption energies between oxygen intermediates and catalytic centres.







Abstract
Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with excellent performance is essential for the conversion of renewable electricity to clean fuel. Herein, we present a facile concept for the synthesis of efficient high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) as electrocatalysts in a one&#8208;step solvothermal synthesis. This strategy allows control of the microstructure and corresponding lattice distortion by tuning the metal ion composition. As a result, the OER activity was improved by optimizing the coordination environment of the metal catalytic center. The optimized Co&#8208;rich HEMOFs exhibited a low overpotential of 310&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, better than a RuO2 catalyst tested under the same conditions. The finding of lattice distortion of the HEMOFs provides a new strategy for developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion.

Gold&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;exo cyclization/oxidation and silver&#8208;promoted 6&#8208;endo cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines have been developed to synthesize 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones and isoquinolinium salts, respectively. The two kinds of cyclization products could be transformed into isoindolinone&#8208;based benzocyclobutenes, isoquinolinones, 4&#8208;iodo&#8208;isoquinolin&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;one, oxazatricycle, and tetrahydroisoquinoline.







Abstract
Coinage metal&#8208;promoted 5&#8208;exo and 6&#8208;endo selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines has been studied. It was found that, under gold catalysis, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines exclusively underwent 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization processes, followed by oxidation to form N&#8208;aryl 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones. In contrast, in the presence of base and under activation of AgOTf, switching of 5&#8208;exo to 6&#8208;endo cyclizations of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines was observed, exclusively giving N&#8208;aryl or N&#8208;alkyl substituted isoquinolinium salts. The two key reaction intermediates, exocyclic vinyl&#8208;Au and the endocyclic vinyl&#8208;Ag species have been isolated and characterized, and a study of their reactivities confirms the plausible mechanisms. Reactions of the resultant 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones with benzyne afforded structurally important isoindolinone&#8208;based benzocyclobutenes. Additionally, several interesting transformations of the resultant isoquinolinium salts have been investigated.

         <title>Activation by Glutathione in Hypoxic Environment of an Azo&#8208;based Rhodamine Activatable Photosensitizer. A Computational Elucidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mediated reduction: The mechanism of glutathione (GHS)&#8208;mediated reduction of the activatable photosensitizer azoSeRho to the active drug SeRho has been computationally elucidated and requires four GSH molecules to take place. The SeRho formation is favoured in hypoxic environment. The exploration of the SeRho photophysical properties have allowed to highlight its intrinsic properties that make is suitable to trigger type II photoreactions in photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
In the present paper, density functional theory (DFT) has been applied to the study of the activation mechanism of a new selenium azo&#8208;rhodamine (azoSeRho) in presence of the tripeptide thiol, glutathione (GSH), as potent activatable photosensitizer to be employed in photodynamic therapy. The introduction of the azo group into the conjugated system of the seleno&#8208;rhodamine dye and its reaction with GSH allow the selective formation of the active photosensitizer, SeRho. Furthermore, DFT calculations have allowed to shed light on the activation mechanism of the azoSeRho photosensitizer when molecular oxygen is present and hydrogen peroxide is formed. This study is the first theoretical investigation revealing how the reductive cleavage of the azo moiety by GSH occurs. Time&#8208;dependent DFT approach has been used to evaluate the chalcogen&#8208;substitution effect on the structures and photophysical properties of the azo derivatives and, then, on the activated photosensitizers.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Variediene Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five DMAPP analogs with additional carbon atoms or with changed methylation patterns were converted with IPP and the bifunctional variediene synthase from Aspergillus brasiliensis AbVS to yield diterpene analogs with unusual skeletons. The DMAPP analogs opened new reaction pathways through the stabilisation of cationic charges at alternative carbon atoms that are naturally not observed.







Abstract
Five analogs of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) with additional or shifted Me groups were converted with isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and the fungal variediene synthase from Aspergillus brasiliensis (AbVS). These enzymatic reactions resulted in the formation of several new terpene analogs that were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy. Several DMAPP analogs showed a changed reactivity giving access to compounds with unusual skeletons. Their formation is mechanistically rationalised and the absolute configurations of all obtained compounds were determined through a stereoselective deuteration strategy, revealing absolute configurations that are analogous to that of the natural enzyme product variediene.

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity and Structural Properties of Trifluoromethylphosphoranides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different trifluoromethylated phosphoranides are accessible upon treatment of trifluoromethylated phosphanes, such as P(CF3)3, with a source of F&#8722; or CF3&#8722; in presence of a stabilizing counterion. The hypervalent compounds have been investigated by NMR spectroscopic as well as X&#8208;ray crystallographic methods, gaining insights into their stability and structural behavior. In addition, the phosphoranides have revealed fluorinating and trifluoromethylating properties towards electrophiles.







Abstract
Phosphoranides are interesting hypervalent species which serve as model compounds for intermediates or transition states in nucleophilic substitution reactions at trivalent phosphorus substrates. Herein, the syntheses and properties of stable trifluoromethylphosphoranide salts are reported. [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)4], [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)3F], and [NMe4][P(CF3)2F2] were obtained by treatment of trivalent precursors with sources of CF3&#8722; or F&#8722; units. These [P(CF3)4&#8208;nFn]&#8722; (n=0&#8211;2) salts exhibit fluorinating (n=1&#8211;2) or trifluoromethylating (n=0) properties, which is disclosed by studying their reactivity towards selected electrophiles. The solid&#8208;state structures of [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)4] and [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF3)3F] are ascertained by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The dynamics of these compounds are investigated by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Kinase Sensing Based on Protein Interactions at the Catalytic Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical biosensor, based on the interaction between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate for detection, is described. The phosphorylation site peptide of HDGF, a substrate of ERK2, was absorbed on gold electrodes to electrochemically sense ERK2 without ATP. Surface chemistry analysis showed that ERK2 was bound to the peptide monolayer, which changed the packing of the layer, resulting in increased permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the layer and electrochemical sensing.







Abstract
The role kinases play in regulating cellular processes makes them potential biomarkers for detecting the onset and prognosis of various diseases, including many types of cancer. Current kinase biosensors, including electrochemical and radiometric methods, rely on sensing the ATP&#8208;dependant enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Here we introduce a new type of interaction&#8208;based electrochemical kinase biosensor that does not require any chemical labelling or modification. The basis for sensing is the interactions between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate rather than the phosphorylation reaction. We demonstrated this concept with the ERK2 kinase and its substrate protein HDGF, which is involved in lung cancer. A peptide monolayer derived from the HDGF phosphorylation site was adsorbed onto a gold electrode and was used to sense ERK2 without ATP. The sensitivity of the assay was down to 10&#8197;nM of ERK2, corresponding with the range of its cellular concentrations. Surface chemistry analysis confirmed that ERK2 was bound to the HDGF peptide monolayer. This increased the permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the monolayer and resulted in ERK2 electrochemical sensing. Since our detection approach is based on protein&#8208;protein interactions and not on the enzymatic reaction, it can be further utilized for more selective detection of different types of enzymes.

         <title>Dielectric and Magnetic Relaxations Exhibited in 2D Parallel Interpenetrating Frustrated Star Net</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing multiple functional geometric frustration magnets is a hot topic in solid state chemistry and material science. Herein, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) parallel interpenetrating &#8220;star&#8221; net complex [HDMPDA][Fe  6  (  &#956;  3  &#8208;O)  2  (  &#956;  &#8208;O  2  CH)  15  ] (  1  ) was obtained successfully with HDMPDA (DMPDA = N, N&#8217;&#8208; dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanediamine) as charge balancer. The dipole reorientation of the rotator [HDMPDA]  +  in the complex brings a structure transition which leads dielectric relaxation close to room temperature. Despite strong antiferromagnetic coupling existing between ions in the net, long&#8208;range order temperature T  N  of the complex is suppressed to 4.2 K by geometric frustration. Interestingly, below T  N  , a canted antiferromagnetic state, accompanied with slow magnetic relaxation, is detected due to the lack of enough magnetic coupling between 2D layers. Thus,  1  is a particular multifunctional magnetic frustration material containing two different types of relaxations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The silver&#8208;promoted reaction of tertiary cyclobutanols with  N  &#8208;methoxypyridinium salts enables the efficient synthesis of a range of C2&#8208;substituted pyridines. The overall process likely occurs by ring&#8208;opening (via  &#946;  &#8208;scission) of the tertiary cyclobutanol to generate the corresponding  &#947;  &#8208;keto alkyl radical that itself adds to the pyridinium salt. A wide range of tertiary cyclobutanols and  N  &#8208;methoxypyridinium salts are compatible with these reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Unified Mechanism for the PhCOCOOH&#8208;mediated Photochemical Reactions: Revisiting its Action and Comparison to Known Photoinitiators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since 2014, we have introduced in literature the use of phenylglyoxylic acid (PhCOCOOH), a small and commercially available organic molecule, as a potent promoter in a variety of photochemical processes. Although PhCOCOOH has a broad scope of photochemical reactions that can promote, the understanding of its mode of action in our early contributions was moderate. Herein, we are restudying and revisiting the mechanism of action of PhCOCOOH in most of these early contributions, providing a unified mechanism of action. Furthermore, the understanding of its action as a photoinitiator opened a new comparison study with known and commercially available photoinitiators.</dc:description>

         <title>Glyoxal&#8208;Linked Nucleotides and DNA for Bioconjugations and Crosslinking with Arginine&#8208;Containing Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein probes: Phenylglyoxal&#8208;linked dNTPs have been designed and synthesized by using two different approaches &#8211; CuAAC and Sonogashira reactions &#8211; that are compatible with the highly reactive glyoxal moiety. These nucleotides were shown to be good substrates for the enzymatic construction of DNA probes for crosslinking with Arg&#8208;containing peptides or proteins.







Abstract
Glyoxal&#8208;linked 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridine 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;mono&#8208; and triphosphates were synthesized through a CuAAC click reaction of 4&#8208;azidophenylglyoxal or a Sonogashira reaction of 4&#8208;bromophenylglyoxal with 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;dUMP or &#8208;dUTP. The triphosphates were used as substrates for enzymatic synthesis of modified DNA probes with KOD XL DNA polymerase. The glyoxal&#8208;linked nucleotides reacted with arginine&#8208;containing peptides to form stable imizadolone&#8208;linked conjugates. This reactive glyoxal modification in DNA was used for efficient bioconjugations and crosslinking with Arg&#8208;containing peptides or proteins (e.&#8201;g., histones) and was found to be more reactive than previously reported 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;linked DNA probes.

         <title>Strain&#8208;induced Ring Expansion Reactions of Calix[3]pyrrole&#8208;related Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent discovery of calix[3]pyrrole, a porphyrinogen&#8208;like tripyrrolic macrocycle, has provided an unprecedented strain&#8208;induced ring expansion reaction into calix[6]pyrrole. Here, we synthesized calix[n]furan[3&#8211;n]pyrrole (n = 1~3) macrocycles to investigate the reaction scope and mechanism of the ring expansion. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that macrocyclic ring strain increases as the number of inner NH sites increases. While calix[1]furan[2]pyrrole exhibited almost quantitative conversion into calix[2]furan[4]pyrrole within 5 minutes, less&#8208;strained calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole and calix[3]furan were inert. However, N&#8208;methylation of calix[2]furan[1]pyrrole induced a ring&#8208;expansion reaction that enabled the isolation of a linear reaction intermediate. The mechanism analysis revealed that the ring expansion consists of regioselective ring cleavage and subsequent cyclodimerization. This reaction was further utilized for synthesis of calix[6]&#8208;type macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>The recent progress of prelithiation reagents and strategies on high energy Lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely employed in energy storage applications owing to the relatively higher energy density and longer cycling life, while on the other hand, they still need further improvement especially on the energy density to satisfy the increasing demands on the market. In this respect, the irreversible capacity loss (ICL) in the initial cycle is a critical challenge due to the lithium loss during the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the anode surface. The strategy of prelithiation was then proposed to compensate for the ICL in anode and recover the energy density. Here, various methods of the prelithiation are summarized and classified according to the basic working mechanism. Further, considering the critical importance and promising progress of prelithiation in both fundamental research and real applications, this review is intended to discuss the considerations on the selection of prelithiation reagents/strategies and the electrochemical performance in full&#8208;cells. Moreover, insights are provided regarding the practical application prospects and the challenges that still need to be addressed.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal Catalyst free Synthesis of Olefins from Organoboron Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereoselective preparation of highly substituted olefins is still a severe challenge that requires well defined elimination precursors. Organoboron chemistry is particularly suited for the preparation of molecules with adjacent stereocenters. As organo boron substrates with leaving groups in b&#8208;position can undergo stereospecific  syn  &#8208; or  anti  &#8208;elimination, this chemistry harbors great potential for the synthesis of complex olefins. In recent years three main strategies emerged, which differ in their approach to the b&#8208;functionalized organoboron elimination precursor. (i) Stereoselective preparation of such elimination precursor can be achieved by addition of a boron&#8208;stabilized anion (d  1  ) to an aldehyde or ketone (a  1  ) or diastereoselective 1,3&#8208;rearrangement of suitable boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes. Stereospecific methods rely either on (ii)&#160;diastereospecific 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement of boron&#8208;ate&#8208;complexes that involve opening of appropriate heterocycles or (iii) addition of chiral carbenoids (d  1  *) to chiral boronates (a  1  *) with a leaving group in a&#8208;position.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Nitrogen Rich N&#8208;Heteropolycycles: Synthesis of Octaazaperopyrenes (OAPP)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ortho  substituted octaazaperopyrenes (OAPPs) are a new class of functional dyes characterized by their strong electron accepting behavior. Here, the synthesis as well as the electrochemical and photo physical properties of an OAPP dye is reported. The OAPP target was prepared via selective nucleophilic substitution at the  peri  position of a  bay  chlorinated tetraazaperylene by introduction of four amino&#8208;substituents. The resulting tetraminoperylene was reacted with different acyl chlorides and anhydrides to give the twisted  bay  chlorinated OAPP derivatives which were isolated in their reduced dihydro&#8208;form. The OAPP target could be obtained via a palladium catalyzed dehalogenation and a subsequent oxidation. The eightfold isosteric [CH&#8594;N] replacement within the peropyrene core structure results in a large decrease of the frontier orbital energies, rendering the target compound a potent oxidant while preserving the planarity of the aromatic core. The radical anion was obtained by reduction of the OAPP with KC  8  and characterized via EPR&#8208;spectroscopy. A general discussion of the number and location of [CH&#8594;N] replacements in peropyrene structures and their frontier orbital energies is provided.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A methodology for the C&#8208;H azidation of N &#8208;terminal proline&#8208;containing peptides was developed employing only commercially available reagents. Peptides bearing a broad range of functionalities and containing up to 6 amino acids were selectively azidated at the carbamate&#8208;protected N &#8208;terminal residue in presence of the numerous other functional groups present on the molecules. Post&#8208;functionalizations of the obtained aminal compounds were achieved: Cycloaddition reactions or C&#8208;C bond formations via a sequence of imine formation/nucleophilic addition were performed, offering an easy access to diversified peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductase: A Multifaceted Biocatalyst in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis integrate microbiologists, enzymologists, and organic chemists to access the repertoire of pharmaceutical and agrochemicals with high chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and enantioselectivity. The saturation of carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds by biocatalysts challenge the conventional chemical methodology as it bypasses the use of precious metals (in combination with chiral ligands and molecular hydrogen) or organocatalysts. In this line, Ene&#8208;reductases (ERs) from the Old Yellow Enzymes (OYEs) family are found to be a prominent asymmetric biocatalyst that is increasingly used in academia and industries towards unparalleled stereoselective  trans  &#8208;hydrogenations of activated C=C bonds. ERs gained prominence as they were used as individual catalysts, multi&#8208;enzyme cascades, and in conjugation with chemical reagents (chemoenzymatic approach). Besides, ERs&#8217; participation in the photoelectrochemical and radical&#8208;mediated process helps to unlock many scopes outside traditional biocatalysis. These up&#8208;and&#8208;coming methodologies entice the enzymologists and chemists to explore, expand and harness the chemistries displayed by ERs for industrial settings. Herein, we reviewed the last five year&#8217;s exploration of organic transformations using ERs.</dc:description>

         <title>An alternate [2&#215;2] grid constructed around TiO4N2 units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of a tetranuclear self&#8208;assembled species constructed around a TiO  4  N  2  motif is reported. This aggregate is generated from Ti(O  i  Pr)  4  , 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrimidine (bpym) and a bisbiphenol strand (L  2  H  4  ) where two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol units are connected with a biphenyl spacer. The solid&#8208;state structure of the [Ti  4  (L  2  )  4  (bpym)  4  ] architecture reveals the formation of an unprecedented chiral alternate [2&#215;2] grid. In addition to the structural characterization of the [Ti  4  (L  2  )  4  (bpym)  4  ] architecture, geometry optimisation on various possible isomeric tetrameric assemblies ([2&#215;2] grid, alternate [2x2] grid, circular helicate or cyclic hemihelicate) is performed using DFT calculations. These results confirm the higher stability of the alternate [2x2] grid over the other possible tetranuclear isomers and allow examining the replacement of the bpym ligands by two novel diimine chelates within the tetranuclear assembly (2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine = bipy and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazine = bipyraz). From this initial theoretical investigation, the competition between these three nitrogen ligands in the course of the selfassembly process is next evaluated. Overall, this investigation shows that the exclusive formation of the alternate [2x2] grid is driven by CH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;N interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Dye&#8208;Conjugated Spinach RNA by Genetic Alphabet Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;emitting systems using an RNA aptamer&#8722;dye pair, such as Spinach RNA, are an attractive method for imaging and tracing RNA expression  in vitro  and  in vivo  . We present an alternative Spinach method by genetic alphabet expansion using an unnatural base pair system, in which a dye&#8208;conjugated unnatural base substrate is site&#8208;specifically incorporated at a specific position in Spinach RNA by transcription involving the third base pair. The incorporation position was predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. This dye&#8208;conjugated Spinach RNA increased the thermal stability of the fluorescence, the robustness against ion sensitivity, and the resistance against photobleaching. Furthermore, we applied our method to Baby Spinach, a shorter version of Spinach, for dye conjugation toward the visible detection of transcripts. This is the first demonstration of an alternative RNA imaging method for a detection system using genetic alphabet expansion.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric synthesis of heterocyclic chloroamines and aziridines by enantioselective protonation of catalytically generated enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a method for the synthesis of chiral vicinal chloroamines via asymmetric protonation of catalytically generated prochiral chloroenamines using chiral Br&#248;nsted acids. The process is highly enantioselective, with the origin of asymmetry and catalyst substituent effects elucidated by DFT calculations. We show the utility of the method as an approach to the synthesis of a broad range of heterocycle&#8208;substituted aziridines by treatment of the chloroamines with base in a one&#8208;pot process, as well as the utility of the process to allow access to vicinal diamines.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylcyclopropane [3+2] Cycloaddition with Acetylenic Sulfones Based on Visible Light Photocatalysis**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the first intermolecular visible light [3+2] cycloaddition reaction performed on a  meta  photocycloadduct employing acetylenic sulfones. The developed methodology exploits the advantages of combining UV and visible&#8208;light in a two&#8208;step sequence that provides a photogenerated cyclopropane which, through a strain&#8208;release process, generates a new cyclopentane ring while significantly increasing the molecular complexity. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations indicate an energy transfer pathway for the visible light&#8208;driven reaction step. This strategy could be extended to simpler vinylcyclopropanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Induced Near&#8208;Infrared Emission and Controlled Photooxidation Based on Sulfonated Crown Ether in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulation of physio&#8208;chemical properties and reaction activities via noncovalent methodology has become one of increasingly significant topics in supramolecular chemistry, and showed inventive applications in miscellaneous fields. Herein, we demonstrate that sulfonated crown ether can form very stable host&#8211;guest complexes with a series of push&#8211;pull&#8208;type photosensitizers, eventually leading to the dramatic fluorescence enhancement in visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Meanwhile, severe suppression in singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) production is found, mainly due to the higher energy barriers between the excited single and triple states upon host&#8211;guest complexation. Moreover, such complexation&#8208;induced tunable  1  O  2  generation systems has been utilized in adjusting the photochemical oxidation reactions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (anthracene) and sulfides ((methylthio)benzene) in water. This supramolecularly controlled photooxidation based on the selective molecular binding of crown ether with photosensitizers may provide a feasible and applicable strategy for monitoring and modulating many photocatalysis processes in aqueous phase.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Intermolecular Sulfonyl/fluoromethyl Heteroarylation of Vinyl Ethers via Visible Light&#8208;Induced Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a visible light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component sulfonyl&#8208;heteroarylation of vinyl ethers with sulfinates and five&#8208;membered heteroaryl chlorides. This protocol proceeds via electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes between sulfinates and heteroaryl chlorides, forging &#946;&#8208;sulfonyl alkyl five&#8208;membered heteroarenes with high efficiency and excellent regioselectivity under mild and catalyst&#8208;free conditions. Utilization of CF  3  SO  2  Na or CF  2  HSO  2  Na as coupling partners further achieves three&#8208;component fluoromethyl&#8208;arylation of vinyl ethers, furnishing a series of valuable CF  3  /CF  2  H&#8208;incorporated alkyl heterocycles under mild conditions.</dc:description>
