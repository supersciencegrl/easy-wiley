         <title>Unveiling the Hidden &#963;&#8208;Dimerization of a Kinetically Protected Olympicenyl Radical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hitherto undetected &#963;&#8208;dimerization pathway in an olympicenyl system was revealed from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Theoretical calculations gave clear structural and energetic profiles for the &#963;&#8208;dimerization, and regioselective oxidation of the olympicenyl radical afforded biolympicenylidene with significant singlet diradical character and high resistance towards both thermal and photochemical ring&#8208;cyclization.







Abstract
The &#963;&#8208;dimer of a kinetically protected olympicenyl radical, which evaded the experimental detection, was revealed by conversion into biolympicenylidene with E&#8208;configuration in a regioselective manner. The complicated stereochemistry and energetics of the &#963;&#8208;dimers derived from C2v symmetry and uneven spin distribution of the olympicenyl radical were revealed by the theoretical calculations, and the energetic preference of &#960;&#8208;dimer over &#963;&#8208;dimer by a minute gap was disclosed. The E&#8208;biolympicenylidene, a polycyclic ene structure previously considered as reactive intermediate in the phenalenyl radical system, exhibited exceptional stability, which allowed for a detailed investigation on its singlet diradical character and physical properties by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR absorption/emission spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, and assisted by theoretical calculations. The E&#8208;biolympicenylidene showed high resistance towards both thermal and photochemical ring&#8208;cyclization reactions, which was attributed to high activation energies for the rate&#8208;determining electrocyclization operated on both disrotatory and conrotatory mode, as well as a small spin density at the bonding sites for the radical&#8208;radical coupling process.

         <title>Supramolecular Alloys from Fluorinated Hybrid Tri4Di6 Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular alloy, freely composed of eight hybrid Tri4Di6 imine cages with a tunable degree of fluorination can be created with high crystallinity. Although the fluorinated and the non&#8208;fluorinated building blocks used herein differ vastly in reactivity, gaining control over the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly process was achieved by carefully controlling the feed ratio.







Abstract
To create innovative materials, efficient control and engineering of pore sizes and their characteristics, crystallinity and stability is required. Eight hybrid Tri4Di6 imine cages with a tunable degree of fluorination and one fully fluorinated Tri4Di6 imine cage are investigated. Although the fluorinated and the non&#8208;fluorinated building blocks used herein differ vastly in reactivity, it was possible to gain control over the outcome of the self&#8208;assembly process, by carefully controlling the feed ratio. This represents the first hybrid material based on fluorinated/hydrogenated porous organic cages (POCs). These cages with unlimited miscibility in the solid state were obtained as highly crystalline samples after recrystallization and even showed retention of the crystal lattice, forming alloys. All mixtures and the fully fluorinated Tri4Di6 imine cage were analyzed by MALDI&#8208;MS, single&#8208;crystal XRD, powder XRD and in regard to thermal stability (TGA).

         <title>Bis(Iminophosphorano)&#8208;Substituted Pyridinium Ions and their Corresponding Bispyridinylidene Organic Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized synthetic routes to pyridinium ions featuring two strongly &#960;&#8208;donating R3P=N&#8722; substituents are presented. These substituents cause severe disruption in aromaticity in these cations, and also impart exceptional reducing ability to the related bispyridinylidenes (neutral 2 e&#8208; donors). Preliminary reactivity studies show some enhanced reducing capabilities owing to the low redox potential of the bispyridinylidene.







Abstract
Optimized synthetic procedures for pyridinium ions featuring iminophosphorano (&#8722;N=PR3; R=Ph, Cy) &#960;&#8208;donor substituents in the 2&#8208; and 4&#8208; positions are described. Crystallographic and theoretical studies reveal that the strongly donating substituents severely polarize the &#960;&#8208;electrons of the pyridyl ring at the expense of aromaticity. Moreover, the pyridinium ions are readily deprotonated to generate powerful bispyridinylidene (BPY) organic electron donors. Electrochemical studies show exceptionally low redox potentials for the two&#8208;electron BPY/BPY2+ couples, ranging from &#8722;1.71&#8197;V vs the saturated calomel electrode for 3PhPh (with four Ph3P=N&#8722; groups) to &#8722;1.85&#8197;V for 3CyCy (with four Cy3P=N&#8722; groups). These new compounds represent the most reducing neutral organic electron donors (OEDs) currently known. Some preliminary reductions involving 3CyCy showed enhanced capability owing to its low redox potential, such as the thermally activated reduction of an aryl chloride, but purification challenges were often encountered.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Pentafluorosulfanylative Domino Cyclization of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Alkenes to Oxaheterocycles by Using SF6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let's play dominoes with SF6: The photoredox catalytic activation of SF6 in the presence of a&#8208;substituted styrenes and alkynols initiates a reaction sequence that consecutively forms a C&#8722;O bond, a C&#8722;C bond and a C&#8722;SF5 bond, one after another. Finally, this domino reaction yields pentafluorosulfanylated oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles in a single step. These new compounds bear a complex structure and broaden the scope of pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks for chemical synthesis in the future. More information can be found in the Communication by D. Rombach, B. Birenheide, and H.&#8208;A. Wagenknecht. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100767).

         <title>Click Chemistry in Ultra&#8208;high Vacuum &#8211; Tetrazine Coupling with Methyl Enol Ether Covalently Linked to Si(001)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let it click in UHV: a click chemistry reaction suitable for application under ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions was developed based on enolether/tetrazine coupling. It is orthogonal to the strain&#8208;promoted cycloaddition of cyclooctynes to azides and allows for tailored layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer synthesis on highly reactive semiconductor surfaces such as Si(001) seen through the window of a UHV apparatus. More information can be found in the Communication by M. D&#252;rr et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005371).

It is orthogonal to the strain&#8208;promoted cycloaddition of cyclooctynes to azides and allows for tailored layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer synthesis on highly reactive semiconductor surfaces such as Si(001) seen through the window of a UHV apparatus.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Approach to Multilayer 3D Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality has existed in nature from the early stages of life on Earth. A new form of chirality, multilayer 3D chirality, has been established involving nearly parallel patterns. This work presents the first asymmetric catalytic approach to multi&#8208;layer 3D chirality. New complexes of Pd and chiral amide&#8208;phosphine ligands were utilized as catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling for assembling various multilayer 3D chiral molecules, which displayed strong luminescence under UV irradiation and strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) of different colors. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G. Li et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100700).

         <title>CeCoOx core / Nb2O5@TiO2 Double Shell Nanocage Catalyst Demonstrates High Activity and Water Resistance for Catalytic Combustion of O&#8208;dichlorobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we have successfully prepared a series of catalysts with different core&#8208;shell structures via hydrothermal method. They were consisted of CeCoOx@TiO2 (single shell), CeCoOx@Nb2O5 (single shell) and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 (double shell) core&#8208;shell nanocages and CeCoOx nanocages, in which CeCoOx was core and TiO2 and Nb2O5 were shell. Then, the influence of core&#8208;shell structure on the catalytic performance of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene was investigated by activity, water&#8208;resistance, thermal stability test and catalyst characterization. The temperature corresponding to 90% conversion of o&#8208;dichlorobenzene (T90) of CeCoOx, CeCoOx@TiO2, CeCoOx@Nb2O5 and CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts was 415, 383, 362 and 367 &#176;C, respectively. CeCoOx@Nb2O5 exhibited the excellent catalytic activity, mainly owing to the special core&#8208;shell structure, large specific surface area, abundant activity species of Co3+, Ce3+, Nb5+, strong reducibility and more active oxygen vacancies. It can be seen that the Nb2O5 coating can greatly improve the catalytic activity of the catalyst. In addition, due to the protective effect of TiO2 shell on CeCoOx, CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 catalysts exhibited the outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability within 1200 minutes. The T90 of CeCoOx@Nb2O5@TiO2 was slightly lower than that of CeCoOx@Nb2O5, but it had higher stability and hydrothermal stability. Furthermore, the possible reaction pathway involving the Mars&#8208;van&#8208;Krevelen (MvK) and Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood (L&#8208;H) models were deduced.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reactions of the cyclo&#8209;As  5  complex   [Cp*Fe(&#951;  5  &#8208;As  5  )]&#160;(  B  ) with the Ag(I)   and Cu(I)   salts of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) [FAl{OC  6  F  10  (C  6  F  5  )}  3  ]   &#8254;   ([FAl]   &#8254;   )   are studied. These reactions allow the synthesis of the mononuclear complexes [M(&#951;  5  :&#951;  2  &#8208;  B  )  2  ][FAl] (   M = Ag (  1  ), Cu (  2  )) when a   ratio of  B  :M(FAl) = 2:1 is used. Compound  1  shows an unusual disorder of the central Ag(I) cation between two &#960;&#8208;coordinating cyclo&#8209;As  5  ligands which is absent in  2  pointing to a weak interaction of the Ag&#160;center towards the cyclo&#8209;As  5  ligands in  B  . When the ratio of    B    :Ag(FAl) is changed to 3:1 or 1:1, the respective coordination compounds [Ag(&#951;  2  &#8208;  B  )  3  ][FAl]&#160;(  3  ) and [Ag  2  (&#951;  2  :&#951;  2  &#8208;  B  )  2  ][FAl]  2  &#160;(  4  ) are accessible. The coordination modes of the   cyclo&#8209;As  5  units in  1  ,  3  and  4  are all different, reflecting the adaptive coordination behavior of  B  towards Ag(I) ions. The optimized geometries in the gas phase of  1  &#8208;  4  are determined by DFT calculations to support the bonding situation observed in their solid&#8208;state structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge Transfer Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Containing the Red&#8208;Ox Active TTF/NDI Units for Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as a class of new inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid crystal materials, may have important application in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion. Herein, we obtained a new charge transfer MOF ( Co&#8208;MOF ) with mixed ligands of H 4 TTFTB and bpmNDI incorporating red&#8208;ox active tetrathiafulvalene/naphthalene diimide (TTF/NDI) units into one system. Due to the presence of TTF/NDI oxidative and reductive couples, stable radicals can be observed in the MOF. Additionally, the charge transfer from the electron donor (TTF) to the acceptor (NDI) units results in a broad absorption in NIR region. Co&#8208;MOF exhibited the efficient photothermal effect induced by irradiating with NIR laser. Under the 808 nm laser (0.5 W cm &#8722;2 ) illumination, the temperature of Co&#8208;MOF promptly increases from room temperature to 151.7 &#176;C in only 10 s. Furthermore, a series of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films doped with trace amount of Co&#8208;MOF showed efficient NIR photothermal conversion. Irradiated by 808 nm laser with power of 0.5 W cm &#8722;2 , the temperature of Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS (0.6 wt%) film can reach a plateau at 62 &#176;C from 20 &#176;C within 100 s. Our experimental results from Co&#8208;MOF@PDMS film demonstrates that the effectiveness and feasibility of the material in promising photothermal applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Reentrant Photoinduced Morphological Transformation and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Kinetic Products of a Rectangular&#8208;Shaped Amphiphilic Diarylethene Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amphiphilic rectangular&#8208;shaped photochromic diarylethene bearing two hydrophobic alkyl chains and two hydrophilic tri(ethylene glycol) chains was synthesized, and its photoinduced morphological transformation in water was investigated. Two unexpected phenomena were revealed in the course of the experiments: a reentrant photoinduced macroscopic morphological transformation and temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic products of supramolecular assembly. When the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was dispersed in water, its reentrant photoinduced morphological transformation, i.e., photoinduced transition from the hydrated phase to the dehydrated phase and then back to the hydrated phase, was observed by optical microscopy upon irradiation with green light at 20 &#176;C, which was interpreted by the V&#8208;shaped phase diagram of the LCST transition. The aqueous assembly of the pure closed&#8208;ring isomer was controlled by changing the temperature; specifically, rapid cooling to 15 and 5 &#176;C gave J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates, respectively, as the kinetic products. The thermodynamic product at both temperatures was a mixture of mostly H&#8208;aggregate with a small amount of J&#8208;aggregate. This behavior was rationalized by the temperature&#8208;dependent potential energy surface of the supramolecular assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Ortho&#8208;Directed Dicarboxylation of Cyclopentadiene by Methylcarbonates and CO2 or COS &#8211; First Insight into Co&#8208;ordination Chemistry of New Ambident Ligands</title>

A highly regioselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylated and &#8208;dithiocarboxylated cyclopentadienide salts [Cat]2[C5H3(CO2)2H] by reaction of organic cation methylcarbonate salts Cat[OCO2Me] (Cat=DMP+, NMe4+, EMMIm+) with cyclopentadiene or by reaction of CO2/COS with Cat[Cp] (Cat=DMP+, NMe4+, PPh4+) was developed. First insight into their coordination chemistry reveals ambident ligand behaviour following Pearsons acid&#8208;base concept. In some reactions with metal Lewis acids, a slow decarboxylation of the [C5H3(CO2)2H] ligand was observed. The mechanism is discussed.







Abstract
This research presents the highly regioselective syntheses of 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylated cyclopentadienide salts [Cat]2[C5H3(CO2)2H] by reaction of a variety of organic cation methylcarbonate salts [Cat]OCO2Me (Cat=NR4+, PR4+, Im+) with cyclopentadiene (CpH) or by simply reacting organic cation cyclopentadienides Cat[Cp] (Cat=NR4+, PR4+, Im+) with CO2. One characteristic feature of these dianionic ligands is the acidic proton delocalized in an intramolecular hydrogen bridge (IHB) between the two carboxyl groups, as studied by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and XRD analyses. The reaction cannot be stopped after the first carboxylation. Therefore, we propose a Kolbe&#8208;Schmitt phenol&#8208;carboxylation related mechanism where the acidic proton of the monocarboxylic acid intermediate plays an ortho&#8208;directing and CO2 activating role for the second kinetically accelerated CO2 addition step exclusively in ortho position. The same and related thiocarboxylates [Cat]2[C5H3(COS)2H] are obtained by reaction of COS with Cat[Cp] (Cat=NR4+, PR4+, Im+). A preliminary study on [Cat]2[C5H3(CO2)2H] reveals, that its soft and hard coordination sites can selectively be addressed by soft Lewis acids (Mo0, Ru2+) and hard Lewis acids (Al3+, La3+).

         <title>Forever Young: Structural Stability of Telomeric Guanine Quadruplexes in the Presence of Oxidative DNA Lesions**

The structural stability of guanine quadruplexes in the presence of oxidative lesions is revealed using molecular dynamics simulations, CD spectroscopy and immunofluorescence.







Abstract
Human telomeric DNA, in G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) conformation, is characterized by a remarkable structural stability that confers it the capacity to resist to oxidative stress producing one or even clustered 8&#8208;oxoguanine (8oxoG) lesions. We present a combined experimental/computational investigation, by using circular dichroism in aqueous solutions, cellular immunofluorescence assays and molecular dynamics simulations, that identifies the crucial role of the stability of G4s to oxidative lesions, related also to their biological role as inhibitors of telomerase, an enzyme overexpressed in most cancers associated to oxidative stress.

Excitation, delocalization, emission: Molecules of crystallographically asymmetric anti&#8208;[2.2](1,4)(4,1)fluorenophane (K2C&#8208;2) aggregate to form one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular chain structures through effective intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlapping.

Abstract
A series of new [2,2]fluorenophanes has been synthesized and characterized; among them, molecules of crystallographically asymmetric anti&#8208;[2.2](1,4)(4,1)fluorenophane (K2C&#8208;2) aggregate to form one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular chain structures through effective intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; overlapping. This, in combination with the synergistic intramolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, leads to prominent dual emission mediated by charge transfer (CT) exciton delocalization. Support of this new insight is given by mapping the transition density along the &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing direction where the intramolecular excitation and intermolecular CT coexist in K2C&#8208;2.

         <title>Pentafluorophenyl Esters as Exchangeable Stoppers for the Construction of Photoactive [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene&#8208;containing [2]rotaxane building blocks bearing pentafluorophenyl ester functions have been prepared and stopper exchange reactions carried out to generate a wide range of [2]rotaxanes with amide, ester or thioester stoppers. Starting from a fullerene&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arene derivative, this new strategy gave easy access to a photoactive [2]rotaxane incorporating a C60 moiety and two Bodipy stoppers.

         <title>High&#8208;Quality Thin Films of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 by Coordination Modulated Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Liquid Phase Epitaxy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dense, crack&#8208;free, and crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 thin films were grown on silicon dioxide surfaces by coordination modulated liquid phase epitaxy (CM&#8208;LPE). In a stepwise process, the substrate was alternatively immersed in Zr6O4(OH)4(OMc)12 and H2&#8208;bdc&#8208;NH2 ethanol solutions which both contain methacrylic acid as a coordination modulator. For optimal thin film quality, the ideal activation of the SiO2 substrate prior to the thin film growth is key, whereby piranha acid is superior to ozone treatment.







Abstract
We report the fabrication of macroscopically and microscopically homogeneous, crack&#8208;free metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 (UiO: Universitetet i Oslo; [Zr6O4(OH)4(bdc&#8208;NH2)6]; bdc&#8208;NH22&#8722;: 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylate) thin films on silicon oxide surfaces.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dense, crack&#8208;free, and crystalline&lt;/b&gt; UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin films were grown on silicon dioxide surfaces by coordination modulated liquid phase epitaxy (CM&#8208;LPE). In a stepwise process, the substrate was alternatively immersed in Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(OMc)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;bdc&#8208;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ethanol solutions which both contain methacrylic acid as a coordination modulator. For optimal thin film quality, the ideal activation of the SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; substrate prior to the thin film growth is key, whereby piranha acid is superior to ozone treatment.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadruply BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulenes were synthesized through four&#8208;fold electrophilic borylation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that the BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulene exhibits crystal polymorphism, in which the circulene core adopts both planar and saddle conformations in the solid state. The experimental and theoretical studies revealed that the weaker aromaticity of azaborine compared with benzene renders the flexibility to the BN&#8208;fused tetrathia[8]circulenes.

         <title>Racemic Tartrate/Malate Anions Combine with Racemic Complex Cations to Form Optically Active Ionic Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;AgI3RhIII2 complex cations with racemic RR/SS&#8208;tartrate gave a single conglomerate containing a pair of enantiomers &#916;&#916;&#8208;SS and &#923;&#923;&#8208;RR on crystallization. While similar treatment using racemic R/S&#8208;malate also gave a single conglomerate, the enantiomers produced have opposite chiralities of &#923;&#923;&#8208;S and &#916;&#916;&#8208;R. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the S form of natural malate, which is opposite to the RR form of natural tartrate. The presence of S&#8208;aspartate led to preferential crystallization of one enantiomer &#916;&#916;&#8208;SS or &#923;&#923;&#8208;RR dependent on the solution pH.







Abstract
Spontaneous resolution has attracted continuing attention in various research fields since Pasteur's work on the crystallization behavior of racemic tartrate. Here, a unique example of this phenomenon is reported, involving ionic crystals generated from racemic RR/SS&#8208; tartrate or R/S&#8208;malate and racemic &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[Ag3Rh2(2&#8208;aminoethanethiolato)6]3+ (&#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+) in water. RR&#8208; and SS&#8208;tartrate selectively recognize the &#923;&#923; and &#916;&#916; isomers of [1]3+ to produce ionic crystals of (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(RR&#8208;tartrate)3 and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(SS&#8208;tartrate)3, respectively, which can undergo spontaneous resolution. While spontaneous resolution also occurs when using R/S&#8208;malate, R&#8208; and S&#8208;malate select the opposite isomers of [1]3+ to give ionic crystals of (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;malate)3 and (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;malate)3, respectively. In the presence of S&#8208;aspartate, (&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1])2(R&#8208;tartrate)3 and (&#916;&#916;&#8208;[1])2(S&#8208;tartrate)3 are preferentially crystallized from &#916;&#916;/&#923;&#923;&#8208;[1]3+ and RR/SS&#8208;tartrate at solution pH values of 6 and 10, respectively. This finding provides significant insight into the optical resolution of chemical species by spontaneous resolution and the origin of homochirality in nature.

         <title>Effect of Manganese Valence on Specific Capacitance in Supercapacitors of Manganese Oxide Microspheres</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effect of manganese valence on specific capacitance: Hierarchical manganese oxides microspheres were prepared by hydrothermal and calcination methods. Mn2O3 exhibited Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ transitions during the charge/discharge process. The redox reaction equations of Mn2O3 was proposed based on the electrochemical measurements. Mn2O3 exhibited superior specific capacitance due to the two redox couples and unique structure.







Abstract
Manganese oxides have attracted great interest in electrochemical energy storage due to high theoretical specific capacitance and abundant valence states. The multiple valence states in the redox reactions are beneficial for enhancing the electrochemical properties. Herein, three manganese microspheres were prepared by a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method and subsequent calcination at different temperatures using carbon spheres as templates. The trivalent manganese of Mn2O3 exhibited multiple redox transitions of Mn3+/Mn2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ during the intercalation/deintercalation of electrolyte ions. The possible redox reactions of Mn2O3 were proposed based on the cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammogram results. Mn2O3 microsphere integrated the advantages of multiple redox couples and unique structure, demonstrating a high specific capacitance and long cycling stability. The symmetric Mn2O3//Mn2O3 device yielded a maximum energy density of 29.3&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at 250&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Uniform Nanowires Containing a Heterogeneous&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Core of Controlled Length, Composition and Morphology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterojunction nanowires containing a heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of controlled length, composition and morphology were generated by co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding and &#8220;heating/cooling&#8221;&#8208;seeded growth approaches in spite of distinct molecular size and conformation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units.







Abstract
In this work, it is demonstrated for the first time that heterojunction nanowires, consisting of a gradient and segmented&#8208;like heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core with controllable length, composition and morphology, can be generated by co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding of oligo(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (OPV)&#8208; and oligo(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene) (OPE)&#8208;containing block copolymers in spite of different chain lengths and molecular conformation for OPE and OPV. More importantly, based on the understanding of the formation of heterogeneous core by the co&#8208;self&#8208;seeding approach, a &#8220;heating/cooling&#8221; seeded growth route was developed, by which linear and branched heterojunction nanowires containing a segmented heterogeneous &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of controlled length, composition and morphology can be obtained. This work provides a versatile platform to generate heterojunction nanowires with excellent controllability in length, composition, and morphology.

         <title>Hydrophobic POM Electrocatalyst Achieves Low Voltage &#8220;Charge&#8221; in Zn&#8208;Air Battery Coupled with Bisphenol A Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn&#8208;air battery was assembled with hydrophobic polyoxometalates (POM) as cathode material. Compared with common Zn&#8208;air battery, the &#8220;charge&#8221; voltage of this battery decreases very clearly.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;air batteriesare a perspective power source for grid&#8208;storage. But, after they are discharged at1.1 to 1.2&#8197;V, large overpotential is required for their charging (usually 2.5&#8197;V). This is due to a sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Incorporating organic pollutants into the cathode electrolyte is a feasible strategy for lowering the required charging potential. In the discharge process, the related oxygen reduction reaction, hydrophobic electrocatalysts are more popular than hydrophilic ones. Here, a hydrophobic bifunctional polyoxometalate electrocatalyst is synthesized by precise structural design. It shows excellent activities in both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions. In bisphenol A containing electrolyte, to achieve 100&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, its potential is only 1.32&#8197;V, which is 0.34&#8197;V lower than oxygen evolution reaction. In the oxygen reduction reaction, this electrocatalyst follows the four&#8208;electron mechanism. In both bisphenol A degradation and oxygen reduction reactions, it shows excellent stability. With this electrocatalyst as cathode material and bisphenol A containing KOH as electrolyte, a Zn&#8208;air battery was assembled. When &#8220;charged&#8221; at 85&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, it only requires 1.98&#8197;V. Peak power density of this Zn&#8208;air battery reaches 120.5&#8197;mW&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, in the &#8220;charge&#8221; process, bisphenol A is degraded, which achieves energy saving and pollutant removal simultaneously in one Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <title>Urea&#8208;Urease Reaction in Controlling Properties of Supramolecular Hydrogels: Pros and Cons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autocatalytic reaction between urease and urea produces ammonia in aqueous medium which increases the pH. Here, we summarize how the urea&#8208;urease reaction can be used to control hydrogel properties. The advantages and limitations of this method compared to conventional methods of pH increase are also discussed.







Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels are useful in many areas such as cell culturing, catalysis, sensing, tissue engineering, drug delivery, environmental remediation and optoelectronics. The gels need specific properties for each application. The properties arise from a fibrous network that forms the matrix. A common method to prepare hydrogels is to use a pH change. Most methods result in a sudden pH jump and often lead to gels that are hard to reproduce and control. The urease&#8208;urea reaction can be used to control hydrogel properties by a uniform and controlled pH increase as well as to set up pH cycles. The reaction involves hydrolysis of urea by urease and production of ammonia which increases the pH. The rate of ammonia production can be controlled which can be used to prepare gels with differing properties. Herein, we show how the urease&#8208;urea reaction can be used for the construction of next generation functional materials.

         <title>RbMT3(BO3)2O3 (M=Ba, Sr; T=Al, Ga): New Double&#8208;Layered Oxyborates Constructed from [BO3] Triangles and [TO4] Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered configuration in SBBO crystals gives them excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties. Here, four new alumino&#8208;/galloborates with the general formula RbMT3(BO3)2O3 (M=Ba, Sr; T=Al, Ga) have been synthesized by using a high&#8208;temperature solution method. They have SBBO&#8208;like structures formed by the [BO3] triangles and [TO4] tetrahedra.







Abstract
Four new alumino&#8208;/galloborates RbMT3(BO3)2O3 (M=Ba, Sr; T=Al, Ga) have been synthesized for the first time by using a high&#8208;temperature solution method. All the title compounds have Sr2Be2B2O7&#8208;like structures, in which the [BO3] triangles and [TO4] tetrahedra form the final double&#8208;layered configurations with the M&#8208; and Rb&#8208;site atoms located between and in the double layer, respectively. The structure evolution from Sr2Be2B2O7 to RbMT3(BO3)2O3 series is discussed. The broader energy bandgaps in Al&#8208;based borates when compared with Ga&#8208;based ones can be entirely attributed to the location of Al/Ga s orbitals near the Fermi surface. Both experimental and computational approaches were used to study their structure&#8208;property relationships.

         <title>Oxidative Coordination versus C3&#8722;C(O)Me Bond Cleavage in Acetylacetonate Iridium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key role of olefin co&#8208;ligands in the reactivity of IrI precursors toward alkylidenediketone, pyCH=C(COMe)2, is shown. In this regard, 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene and cyclooctene induce the oxidative coordination of the above&#8208;mentioned alkylidenediketone, leading to the formation of new iridabicyclic complexes. By contrast, dimethylbutadiene promotes at room temperature C3&#8722;COMe bond cleavage of the alkylidenediketone.







Abstract
Iridabicycles [Ir{&#954;3&#8208;N,C,O&#8208;(pyC(H)=C(C(O)Me)2}(Cl)(L&#8722;L)](L&#8722;L=cod (cod=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), 1&#8201;a; bipy (bipy=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine), 1&#8201;b) have been obtained by oxidative coordination of 3&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;methylene)pentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione L1, to the complexes [{Ir(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(cod)}2] and [{Ir(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(coe)2}2] (coe=cis&#8208;cyclooctene), the latter in the presence of bipy. Remarkably, cleavage of the C3&#8722;C(O)Me bond of L1 has instead been achieved in the reaction with [Ir(Cl)(dmb)2] (dmb=2,3&#8208;dimethylbutadiene), yielding a compound formulated as [Ir{&#954;2&#8208;N,C&#8208;(pyC(H)C(C(O)Me))}(CO)(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(Me)]2, 2. Treatment of dimer 2 with DMSO or PMe3 produced the complexes[Ir{&#954;2&#8208;N,C&#8208;(pyC(H)C(C(O)Me)}(CO)Cl(Me)L] (L=DMSO, 3&#8201;a; PMe3, 3&#8201;b). Plausible mechanisms for the reactions leading to complexes 1 and 2 are proposed by means of DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;The key role of olefin co&#8208;ligands in the reactivity of Ir&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; precursors toward alkylidenediketone, pyCH=C(COMe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is shown. In this regard, 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene and cyclooctene induce the oxidative coordination of the above&#8208;mentioned alkylidenediketone, leading to the formation of new iridabicyclic complexes. By contrast, dimethylbutadiene promotes at room temperature C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;COMe bond cleavage of the alkylidenediketone.

         <title>Polyoxotungstate Archetype {P4W27} and its 3d Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
{P4W27} represents an extended and stabilized version of the elusive V&#8208;shaped dimer {P2W12}2, derived from the seminal Wells&#8208;Dawson&#8208;type phosphotungstate archetype, and offers a coordination pocket that can induce unusual oxygen coordination polyhedra, such as a trigonal prism for MnII.







Abstract
The propensity of the new, phenylphosphonate&#8208;stabilized polyoxotungstate [(C6H5PVO)2P4W24O92]16&#8722; to act as a precursor for new 3d metal&#8208;functionalized polyanions has been investigated. Reactions with MnII and CuII induce the formation of the previously unknown polyoxotungstate archetype {P4W27}, isolated as salts of the polyanions [Na&#8834;{MnII(H2O)}{WO(H2O)}P4W26O98]13&#8722; (1) and [K&#8834;{CuII(H2O)}{W(OH)(H2O)}P4W27O99]14&#8722; (2), which were characterized in the solid state (single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, elemental and TG analyses, IR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry) and in aqueous solution (UV/Vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry).

         <title>Alkali&#8208;induced Transformation of Ni&#8208;MOF into Ni(OH)2 Nanostructured Flower for Efficient Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post treatment of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is widely employed to develop efficient electrocatalysts with better catalytic properties. But the complex processes of post treatment generally led to the collapse of the original structures of MOFs, making the preservation of their pristine hierarchical porous structure a great challenge. Herein, we propose the strategy of alkali treatment of Ni&#8208;MOF to transform it into Ni(OH)  2  with similar morphology and enhanced electrocatalytic properties for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The structure and electrocatalytic properties of as&#8208;obtained Ni(OH)  2  nanostructured flowers were seriously depended on the alkali concentrations. As the result, Ni(OH)  2  obtained from Ni&#8208;MOF treated by 0.25 M NaOH (noted as Ni(OH)  2  &#8208;0.25) performs 1.5 and 2.5 times larger current density than those of Ni(OH)  2  &#8208;0.025 and Ni(OH)  2  &#8208;0.5 for MOR. Moreover, the electrocatalytic process and mechanism of MOR on the catalyst of Ni(OH)  2  &#8208;0.25 are also revealed. Hence, this  ex situ  conversion strategy of alkali treatment for Ni&#8208;MOF uncovered the transformation of MOFs in alkaline solution and develops robust electrocatalyst for practical application of methanol fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>3,3&#8208;Disubstituted oxindoles bearing quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers are privileged structural motifs, which widely exist in pharmaceutical and natural products. Herein, we describe a highly regio&#8208;, enantio&#8208;, and diastereoselective allylic alkylation of 3&#8208;alkyl oxindoles through synergistic iridium and copper catalysis, providing a series of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives containing adjacent quaternary and tertiary stereogenic centers in excellent yields, enantiomeric excess, and diastereomeric ratio (for 30 examples, up to 97% yield, &gt;99% ee, and &gt;20:1 dr). This method provides exclusive branched selectivity, excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities, and good functional compatibility. Control experiments suggested that the chiral copper catalyst is required for achieving high reactivities and diastereoselectivities under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards DNA&#8208;encoded Micellar Chemistry: DNA&#8208;micelle Association and Environment&#8208;sensitivity of Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of DNA&#8208;compatible reaction methodologies is a central theme to advance DNA&#8208;encoded screening library technology. Recently, we could show that sulfonic acid functionalized block copolymer micelles facilitated Br&#248;nsted acid promoted reactions such as the Povarov reaction on DNA&#8208;coupled starting materials with minimal DNA degradation. Here, we investigated the impact of polymer composition on micelle shape, and reaction conversion. A dozen sulfonic acid&#8208;functionalized block copolymers of different molar mass and composition were prepared by RAFT&#8208;polymerization and were tested in the Povarov reaction, removal of the Boc protective group, and the Biginelli reaction. The results showed trends of polymer structure &#8208; micellar catalytic activity relationship. For instance, micelles composed of block copolymers with shorter acrylate ester chains formed smaller particles and tended to provide faster reaction kinetics. Moreover, fluorescence quenching experiments as well as circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that DNA&#8208;oligomer&#8208;conjugates, although highly water&#8208;soluble, accumulated very effectively in the micellar compartments as an essential prerequisite for carrying out a DNA&#8208;encoded reaction in the presence of polymer micelles.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Transfer Deuteration and Hydrodeuteration: Emerging Techniques to Selectively Transform Alkenes and Alkynes to Deuterated Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing demand for deuterium&#8208;labeled organic molecules has spurred a renewed interest in selective methods for deuterium installation. Catalytic transfer deuteration and transfer hydrodeuteration are emerging as powerful techniques for the selective incorporation of deuterium into small molecules. These reactions not only obviate the use of D  2  &#160;gas and pressurized reaction setups but provide new opportunities for selectively installing deuterium into small molecules. Commercial or readily synthesized deuterium donors are typically employed as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagents for transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration reactions. In this minireview, we will discuss recent advances in the catalytic transfer deuteration and hydrodeuteration of alkenes and alkynes for the selective synthesis of deuterated alkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Vapochromic Luminescent &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems with Reversible Coordination&#8208;Number Control of Hypervalent Tin(IV)&#8208;Fused Azobenzene Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Vapochromic luminescence of hypervalent tin(IV) complexes: Hypervalent tin(IV) complexes having deep&#8208;red emission can be synthesized. The critically narrow energy gap was attributed to three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8211;4e) bonds. Furthermore, dynamic and reversible color changes of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems were caused by coordination&#8208;number control of the hypervalent tin(IV) complexes. The color&#8208;change mechanism and degree of binding constants were well explained by theoretical calculation.







Abstract
The dynamic and reversible changes of coordination numbers between five and six in solution and solid states, based on hypervalent tin(IV)&#8208;fused azobenzene (TAz) complexes, are reported. It was found that the TAz complexes showed deep&#8208;red emission owing to the hypervalent bond composed of an electron&#8208;donating three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8211;4e) bond and an electron&#8208;accepting nitrogen&#8211;tin (N&#8211;Sn) coordination. Furthermore, hypsochromic shifts in optical spectra were observed in Lewis basic solvents because of alteration of the coordination number from five to six. In particular, vapochromic luminescence was induced by attachment of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vapor to the coordination point at the tin atom accompanied with a crystal&#8211;crystal phase transition. Additionally, the color&#8208;change mechanism and degree of binding constants were well explained by theoretical calculation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of vapochromic luminescence by using stable and variable coordination numbers of hypervalent bonds.

         <title>Metal Cation&#8208;Driven Dynamic Covalent Formation of Imine and Hydrazone Ligands Displaying Synergistic Co&#8208;catalysis and Auxiliary Amine Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 27, Page 7516-7524, May 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine and hydrazone formation is strongly driven by metal ions and the latter also displays a synergistic effect of both metal ions and an auxiliary amine. The rate acceleration occurs both in stoichiometric and catalytic conditions, displaying a true catalysis of imine and hydrazone formation. The synergistic metallo&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis relates to the construction of complex dynamic systems.







Abstract
Optimizing C=N bond formation and C/N component exchange has major significance in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry (DCC). Imine and hydrazone generation from their aldehyde, amine and hydrazine components showed large accelerations in presence of AgOTf or Zn(OTf)2, up to 104 for the Zn(II)&#8208;(p&#8208;anisidine)imine complex. Zn(OTf)2 and auxiliary p&#8208;anisidine together accelerated 630 times the formation of the Zn(II)&#8208;hydrazone complex, revealing a strong synergistic effect, traced to very fast initial formation of the reactive Zn(II)&#8208;imine complex presenting a C=N bond metallo&#8208;activated towards reaction with the hydrazine component. Reactions involving more entities showed kinetically faster and thermodynamically simpler outputs due to dynamic competition within a mixture of higher complexity. Catalytic amounts of metal salts and auxiliary amine gave similar marked rate accelerations and turnover, indicating true catalysis. The synergistic effect achieved by combining metallo&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis points to a powerful co&#8208;catalysis strategy of bond&#8208;formation in DCC through interconnected chemical transformations.

         <title>Rapid and Mild Lactamization Using Highly Electrophilic Triphosgene in a Microflow Reactor</title>

Go with the microflow: Methods that accomplish rapid (0.5&#8211;10&#8197;s) and mild lactamization with highly electrophilic triphosgene in a microflow reactor are described. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields (72&#8211;95&#8201;%). The developed approach enabled safe, rapid, mild, inexpensive, and less&#8208;wasteful synthesis of lactams without the need for tedious purification.







Abstract
Lactams are cyclic amides that are indispensable as drugs and as drug candidates. Conventional lactamization includes acid&#8208;mediated and coupling&#8208;agent&#8208;mediated approaches that suffer from narrow substrate scope, much waste, and/or high cost. Inexpensive, less&#8208;wasteful approaches mediated by highly electrophilic reagents are attractive, but there is an imminent risk of side reactions. Herein, a methods using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a microflow reactor that accomplishes rapid (0.5&#8211;10&#8197;s), mild, inexpensive, and less&#8208;wasteful lactamization are described. Methods&#8197;A and B, which use N&#8208;methylmorpholine and N&#8208;methylimidazole, respectively, were developed. Various lactams and a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without the need for tedious purification. Undesired reactions were successfully suppressed, and the risk of handling triphosgene was minimized by the use of microflow technology.

After more than 25&#8197;years, the synthesis and characterization of the parent compound of the pentaphosphaferrocenes were possible. Its use as building block and template in supramolecular chemistry reveals unprecedented results.







Abstract
The so far missing parent compound of the large family of pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1&#8201;b) was synthesized by the thermolysis of [CpFe(CO)2]2 with P4 using the very high&#8208;boiling solvent diisopropylbenzene. It was comprehensively characterized by, inter alia, NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis, cyclic voltammetry and DFT computations. Moreover, its coordination behavior towards CuI halides was explored, revealing the unprecedented 2D polymeric networks [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu2(&#956;&#8208;X)2]n (2&#8201;a: X=Cl, 2&#8201;b: X=Br) and [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (3) and even the first cyclo&#8208;P5&#8208;containing 3D coordination polymer [{CpFe(&#951;5:1:1&#8208;P5)}Cu(&#956;&#8208;I)]n (4). The sandwich complex&#8197;1&#8201;b can also be incorporated in nano&#8208;sized supramolecules based on [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1&#8201;a) and CuX (X=Cl, Br, I): [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]@[{Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)}12(CuX)20&#8208;n] (5&#8201;a: X=Cl, n=2.4; 5&#8201;b: X=Br, n=2.4; 5&#8201;c: X=I, n=0.95). Thereby, the formation of the CuI&#8208;containing fullerene&#8208;like sphere 5&#8201;c is found for the first time.

         <title>Intersystem Crossing and Electron Spin Selectivity in Anthracene&#8208;Naphthalimide Compact Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Showing Different Geometry and Electronic Coupling Magnitudes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 27, Page 7572-7587, May 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dependency of the charge transfer and Intersystem crossing on molecular geometry and electronic coupling in electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads: Efficient spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) was observed in compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads. The electron spin selectivity of the ISC was studied with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra.







Abstract
Anthracene&#8208;naphthalimide (An&#8208;NI) compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads were prepared, in which the orientation and distance between the two subunits were varied by direct connection or with intervening phenyl linker. Efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and long triplet state lifetime (&#934;&#916;=92&#8201;%, &#964;T=438&#8197;&#956;s) were observed for the directly connected dyads showing a perpendicular geometry (81&#176;). This efficient spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer ISC (SOCT&#8208;ISC) takes 376&#8197;fs, inhibits the direct charge recombination (CR) to ground state (1CT&#8594;S0, takes 3.04&#8197;ns). Interestingly, efficient SOCT&#8208;ISC for dyads with intervening phenyl linker (&#934;&#916;=40&#8201;% in DCM) was also observed, although the electron donor and acceptor adopt almost coplanar geometry (dihedral angle: 15&#176;). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy shows that the electron spin polarization of the triplet state, i.&#8201;e. the electron spin selectivity of ISC, is highly dependent on the dihedral angle and the linker. For the dyads showing weaker coupling between the donor and acceptors, the charge separation and the intramolecular triplet energy transfer are inhibited at 80&#8197;K (frozen solution), because both the 3An and 3NI states were observed and the ESP are same as compared to the native anthracene and naphthalimide, which unravel their origin. The dyads were used as triplet photosensitizers for triplet&#8722;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA UC). High UC quantum yield (&#934;UC=12.9&#8201;%) as well as a large anti&#8208;Stokes shift (0.72&#8197;eV) was attained by excitation into the CT absorption band.

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 27, Page 7533-7541, May 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is known that serotonin binds to lipid membranes with high affinity, but what does it do to it? We find that it makes artificial lipid bilayers softer and easier to indent by an AFM tip (top), and promotes disorder in ordered regions. For cell membranes, this effect facilitates increased endocytosis (bottom). This increase occurs even when the serotonin receptors are blocked, providing a receptor&#8208;independent pathway for serotonin action.







Abstract
Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane properties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucleation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order parameter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors. Similarly, it increases the membrane binding and internalization of oligomeric peptides. Our results uncover a mode of serotonin&#8211;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion.

         <title>Synthesis of Uniform Gold Nanorods with Large Width to Realize Ultralow SERS Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 27, Page 7549-7560, May 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm were successfully synthesized by introducing heptanol molecules during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The array of vertically aligned Au NRs as SERS substrates can achieve the ultralow limit of detection (LOD) (10&#8722;16&#8197;M for CV probes) with good reliability and reproducibility. Thanks to their LOD, they can be used for rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances with an ultralow concentration.







Abstract
In this work, we successfully demonstrate high&#8208;yield synthesis of high&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm by introducing heptanol molecules as secondary templating agents during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The results show that an appropriate concentration of heptanol molecules not only alter the micellization behavior of CTAB in water, but also help silver ions impact the symmetry&#8208;breaking efficiency of additional Au&#8722;NP seeds in addition to enhancing the utilization of gold precursors. Moreover, the generality and versatility of the present strategy for synthesis of Au NRs with flexible controlled dimensions are further demonstrated by successful synthesis of Au NRs with the assistance of other fatty alcohols with properly long alkyl chains. Furthermore, when arrays of vertically aligned Au NRs with large width (AVA&#8722;Au120&#215;90 NRs) are used as SERS substrates, they can achieve the ultralow limit of detection for crystal violet (10&#8722;16&#8197;M) with good reliability and reproducibility, and the rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances.

     alt="Synthesis of Uniform Gold Nanorods with Large Width to Realize Ultralow SERS Detection"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;High&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs)&lt;/b&gt; with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm were successfully synthesized by introducing heptanol molecules during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The array of vertically aligned Au NRs as SERS substrates can achieve the ultralow limit of detection (LOD) (10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;16&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M for CV probes) with good reliability and reproducibility. Thanks to their LOD, they can be used for rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances with an ultralow concentration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we successfully demonstrate high&#8208;yield synthesis of high&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm by introducing heptanol molecules as secondary templating agents during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The results show that an appropriate concentration of heptanol molecules not only alter the micellization behavior of CTAB in water, but also help silver ions impact the symmetry&#8208;breaking efficiency of additional Au&#8722;NP seeds in addition to enhancing the utilization of gold precursors. Moreover, the generality and versatility of the present strategy for synthesis of Au NRs with flexible controlled dimensions are further demonstrated by successful synthesis of Au NRs with the assistance of other fatty alcohols with properly long alkyl chains. Furthermore, when arrays of vertically aligned Au NRs with large width (AVA&#8722;Au&lt;sub&gt;120&#215;90&lt;/sub&gt; NRs) are used as SERS substrates, they can achieve the ultralow limit of detection for crystal violet (10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;16&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M) with good reliability and reproducibility, and the rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Frontispiece: Biological and Medical Applications of Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 27, May 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Among inorganic materials, calcium phosphate nanoparticles are well suited to transport organic or biological molecules into cells and tissue. They are well tolerated by cells and organisms and have a clearly defined degradation pathway, also due to their almost ubiquitous presence in the body. If they are used as carriers, they are advantageous to encapsulate sensitive cargo like proteins or nucleic acids inside to protect them from enzymatic degradation, something that is impossible with solid nanoparticles. Promising applications are seen in drug and gene delivery and also in immunization, for example, for vaccination. This Review explores the synthesis, characterization, functionalization and biomedical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles from the literature. For more information, see the Review article by. M. Epple and V. Sokolova on on page&#8197;7471&#8197;ff.

         <title>Frontispiece: The Prospect of Dimensionality in Porous Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 27, May 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, the field of porous semiconductors has significantly diversified. Hinging on the mostly untapped potential of COFs, POPs and MOFs, a plethora of suitable synthetic and post synthetic strategies have been developed to tune and optimize these materials, resulting in a wide range of possible applications. In this Minireview, the authors critically evaluate the role of dimensionality in porous semiconductors, which has not been intensely investigated, yet can play a key role in developing targeted and more functional semiconductors. For more details see the Minireview by A. Coskun and P.&#8197;W. Fritz on on page&#8197;7489&#8197;ff.

         <title>Cover Feature: Rapid and Mild Lactamization Using Highly Electrophilic Triphosgene in a Microflow Reactor (Chem. Eur. J. 27/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 27, Page 7468-7468, May 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid (0.5 to 10&#8197;s), mild, inexpensive, and less wasteful lactamization was achieved using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a micro&#8208;flow reactor. This work reports two methods using NMM and NMI, respectively. The slight difference in basicity is critical in the lactamization depending on the type of lactam. A plausible reaction mechanism was discussed. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without tedious purifications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Fuse et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100059).

Serotonin is an important signaling molecule with a high lipid membrane affinity. Membrane binding of serotonin modulates membrane properties and potentially cellular function as well, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. The results presented in this study suggest a mode of serotonin&#8211;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D. Huster, S. Maiti, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100328).

The discovery of parent pentaphosphaferrocene [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] has been achieved after more than 30 years, closing the gap within the large class of pentaphosphaferrocenes; the cover image depicts the parent compound taking its proper place on the family tree. The influence of the unsubstituted Cp ligand on the complex formation was shown, reflecting specific conditions during the synthesis, its eclipsed conformation, different coordination behavior towards CuI halides and ability to template the construction of nano&#8208;sized fullerene&#8208;like spheres, acting hereby, in contrast to the other homologous, as an electron donor.

Hydrazone formation is strongly accelerated in the presence of both zinc ions and an auxiliary amine, traced to the very fast initial formation of the reactive ZnII&#8208;imine complex presenting a C=N bond metallo&#8208;activated towards reaction with the hydrazine component. The synergistic effect combining metallo&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis points to a powerful co&#8208;catalysis strategy of bond formation in DCC through interconnected chemical transformations.

         <title>The Prospect of Dimensionality in Porous Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 27, Page 7489-7501, May 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the advent of electronic devices, lightweight alternatives to conventionally used semiconductors are required. Porous (metal&#8211;)organic semiconductors are intriguing alternatives to silicon and especially their structural tunability resulted in a wide variety of functional materials. Although molecular design of these semiconductors is well understood, dimensionality and its influences are seldomly evaluated. In this Minireview, the role of dimensionality in porous semiconductors is critically evaluated.







Abstract
With the advent of silicon&#8208;based semiconductors, a plethora of previously unknown technologies became possible. The development of lightweight low&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductors followed soon after. However, the efficient charge/electron transfers enabled by the non&#8208;porous 3D structure of silicon is rather challenging to be realized by their (metal&#8208;)organic counterparts. Nevertheless, the demand for lighter, more efficient semiconductors is steadily increasing resulting in a growing interest in (metal&#8208;)organic semiconductors. These novel materials are faced with a variety of challenges originating from their chemical design, their packing and crystallinity. Although the effect of molecular design is quite well understood, the influence of dimensionality and the associated change in properties (porosity, packing, conjugation) is still an uncharted area in (metal&#8208;)organic semiconductors, yet highly important for their practical utilization. In this Minireview, an overview on the design and synthesis of porous semiconductors, with a particular emphasis on organic semiconductors, is presented and the influence of dimensionality is discussed.

         <title>Biological and Medical Applications of Calcium Phosphate Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 27, Page 7471-7488, May 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles are well suited to transport organic or biological molecules into cells and tissue. They are well tolerated by cells and organisms and have a clearly defined degradation pathway, also due to their almost ubiquitous presence in the body. Promising applications for them are seen in drug and gene delivery and also in immunization, for example, for vaccination. This Review explores the synthesis, characterization, functionalization and biomedical applications of calcium phosphate nanoparticles from the recent literature.







Abstract
Calcium phosphate nanoparticles have a high biocompatibility and biodegradability due to their chemical similarity to human hard tissue, for example, bone and teeth. They can be used as efficient carriers for different kinds of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, peptides, antibodies, or drugs, which alone are not able to enter cells where their biological effect is required. They can be loaded with cargo molecules by incorporating them, unlike solid nanoparticles, and also by surface functionalization. This offers protection, for example, against nucleases, and the possibility for cell targeting. If such nanoparticles are functionalized with fluorescing dyes, they can be applied for imaging in vitro and in vivo. Synthesis, functionalization and cell uptake mechanisms of calcium phosphate nanoparticles are discussed together with applications in transfection, gene silencing, imaging, immunization, and bone substitution. Biodistribution data of calcium phosphate nanoparticles in vivo are reviewed.

         <title>Accelerating H2 Evolution by Anodic Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines in Water over Co3O4 Nanoribbon Arrays Decorated Nickel Foam</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 27, Page 7502-7506, May 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation conversion based on a cobalt electrocatalyst was employed to accelerate hydrogen evolution in water. The Co3O4 nanoribbon arrays modified nickel foam anode provided rich active sites for the transformation of tetrahydroisoquinolines into various value&#8208;added dihydroisoquinolines. Electro&#8208;activated higher&#8208;valent cobalt and plenty of surface oxygen species were responsible for promoting the electrocatalytic oxidation.







Abstract
Coupling the H2 evolution reaction in water with thermodynamically favorable organic oxidation reactions is highly desirable, because it can enhance the energy conversion efficiency compared with electrocatalytic water splitting, and produce value&#8208;added chemicals instead of O2 in the anodic reaction. Herein, Co3O4 nanoribbon arrays in&#8197;situ grown on nickel foam (Co3O4@NF) was employed as an effective electrocatalyst for the selective oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs). Various value&#8208;added semi&#8208;dehydrogenation products including dihydroisoquinolines with electro&#8208;deficient or &#8208;rich groups could be obtained with moderate yields and faradaic efficiencies. Benefitting from the rich surface active sites of Co3O4@NF, a two&#8208;electrode (Co3O4@NF||Pt) electrolytic system drove a benchmark current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage as low as 1.446&#8197;V in 1.0&#8197;M KOH aqueous solution containing 0.02&#8197;M THIQ, which was reduced by 174&#8197;mV in comparison with that of overall water splitting.

         <title>Reactions of C60 with Pyridazine and Phthalazine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 27, Page 7507-7511, May 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The benzoannulation of pyridazine changes its electronic structure drastically, thus rendering the pericyclic reaction with C60 efficient. Theoretical calculations suggested that the reaction proceeds with normal electron demand in contrast to hitherto considered inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand pathway. Therefore, the enhanced reactivity could be explained by the better interaction between the LUMO of C60 and the HOMO of phthalazine.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;opened bisfulleroids are one of suitable building blocks for making a large hole on fullerenes. This work focuses on the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of C60 with azines, among synthetic methods developed thus far, to provide bisfulleroids. Surprisingly, the computational study predicted that the reaction proceeds with normal electron demand in contrast to hitherto considered inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand pathway. The benzoannulation to the pyridazine ring, i.&#8201;e., phthalazine, resulted in the remarkably shortened reaction time due to the better interaction between the HOMO of phthalazine and the LUMO of C60 as well as stronger 2,3&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene character in the phthalazine as confirmed crystallographically. Contrary to expectations, the benzobisfulleroid was converted into corresponding orifice&#8208;enlarged derivative via the photooxygenation slightly faster than the fulleroid derived from pyridazine.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 27, Page 7512-7515, May 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective addition of silylboronates to unsymmetric internal alkynes has been developed for the synthesis of structurally defined tetrasubstituted alkenes. A variety of unactivated alkynes can be employed with high selectivity under simple and mild conditions and the resulting products have been further functionalized by utilizing silyl and boryl groups on the alkene.

         <title>Externally Regulated Specific Molecular Recognition Driven Pathway Selectivity in Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reveals 4&#8208;Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) regulated pathway selectivity in the supramolecular polymerization of a naphthalene&#8208;diimide derivative (NDI&#8208;1), appended with a carboxylic acid group. In decane, NDI&#8208;1 produces ill&#8208;defined aggregate (Agg&#8208;1) due to different H&#8208;bonding motifs of the &#8208;COOH group. With one mole equivalent DMAP, the NDI&#8208;1/DMAP complex introduces new nucleation condition and exhibits a cooperative supramolecular polymerization producing J&#8208;aggregated fibrillar nanostructure (Agg&#8208;2). With 10% DMAP and fast cooling (10K/ min), similar nucleation and open chain H&#8208;bonding with the free monomer in an anti&#8208;parallel arrangement produces identical J&#8208;aggregate (Agg&#8208;2a). With 2.5% DMAP and slow cooling (1K/ min), a distinct nucleation and supramolecular polymerization pathway emerge leading to the thermodynamically controlled Agg&#8208;3 with face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking and 2D&#8208;morphology. Slow cooling with 5&#8208;10% DMAP produces a mixture of Agg&#8208;2a and Agg&#8208;3. Computational modelling studies provide valuable insights into the internal order and the pathway complexity.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Topology Structure on Photodynamic Sterilization of Porphyrinic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising photosensitizers due to no self&#8208;aggregation of porphyrin in aqueous solution. However, how the topology of porphyrinic MOFs affects the generation of singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ) is unclear. Here, we report the effect of the topology of porphyrinic MOFs on their photodynamic performance. To this end, four porphyrinic zirconium MOFs (MOF&#8208;525, MOF&#8208;545, PCN&#8208;223 and PCN&#8208;224 with different topologies (  ftw  ,  csq  ,  shp  and  she  respectively)) were selected to study the influence of topology on the photodynamic antibacterial performance. The  1  O  2  generation and the photodynamic antibacterial performance followed an decreasing order of MOF&#8208;545&gt;MOF&#8208;525&gt;PCN&#8208;224&gt;PCN&#8208;223. The results reveal that the pore size, the distance between porphyrin and the number of porphyrin per Zr  6  O  8  cluster in MOFs greatly affected the  1  O  2  generation. This work provide a guidance for designing new MOFs for efficient photodynamic sterilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Reactivity of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Alkynyl Hypervalent Iodine Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethynylbenziodoxol(on)e (EBX) cyclic hypervalent iodine reagents have become popular reagents for the alkynylation of radicals and nucleophiles, but only offer limited possibilities for further structure and reactivity fine&#8208;tuning. Herein, we report the synthesis of new  N  &#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents with increased structural flexibility based on amide, amidine and sulfoximine scaffolds. Solid state structures of the reagents are reported and the analysis of the I&#8208;C  alkyne  bond lengths allowed assessing the  trans  &#8208;effect of the different substituents. Molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps of the reagents, derived from DFT computations, revealed less pronounced &#963;&#8208;hole regions for sulfonamide&#8208;based compounds. Most reagents reacted well in the alkynylation of &#946;&#8208;ketoesters. The alkynylation of thiols afforded more variable yields, with compounds with a stronger &#963;&#8208;hole reacting better. In metal&#8208;mediated transformations, the  N  &#8208;heterocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents gave inferior results when compared to the  O  &#8208;based EBX reagents.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of cages with polyradical framework remains a challenging task. Here we report an enantiomeric pair of quinoid&#8208;bridged polyradical tetrahedral palladium (II) cages that are stabilized by an unusual dianionic diradical (dhbq&#183;&#183;  2&#8208;  ) form. These cages have been characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, squid magnetometry and mass spectrometry. Single crystal derived X&#8208;ray structural investigations of the iso&#8208;structural cages built on flouranilate linkers confirm the tetrahedral structure of the obtained radical cages. Theoretical calculations showed that the diradical state is more stable than the usual monoradical state of the dhbq anions. A weak ferromagnetic exchange between the adjacent radical centres has been observed in the DFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrostatic perturbations from the protein affect C&#8208;H bond strengths of the substrate and enable negative catalysis in the TmpA biosynthesis enzyme.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nonheme iron dioxygenase 2&#8208;(trimethylammonio)&#8208;ethylphosphonate dioxygenase (TmpA) is an enzyme involved in the regio&#8208; and chemoselective hydroxylation at the C  1  &#8208;position of the substrate as part of the biosynthesis of glycine betaine in bacteria and carnitine in humans. To understand how the enzyme avoids breaking the weak C  2  &#8208;H bond in favor of C  1  &#8208;hydroxylation, we set up a cluster model of 242 atoms representing the first and second&#8208;coordination sphere of the metal center and substrate binding pocket and investigated possible reaction mechanisms of substrate activation by an iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species by density functional theory methods. In agreement with experimental product distributions, the calculations predict a favorable C  1  &#8208;hydroxylation pathway. The calculations show that the selectivity is guided through electrostatic perturbations inside the protein from charged residues, external electric fields and electric dipole moments. In particular, charged residues influence and perturb the homolytic bond strength of the C  1  &#8208;H and C  2  &#8208;H bonds of the substrate, and strongly strengthens the C  2  &#8208;H bond in the substrate&#8208;bound orientation.</dc:description>

In particular, charged residues influence and perturb the homolytic bond strength of the C  1  &#8208;H and C  2  &#8208;H bonds of the substrate, and strongly strengthens the C  2  &#8208;H bond in the substrate&#8208;bound orientation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Fluorinated groups are essential for drug design, agro&#173;che&#173;micals, and materials science. The bis(trifluoro&#173;methyl)&#173;&#173;amino group is an example for a stable group that has a high potential. While the number of molecules containing per&#173;fluoro&#173;alkyl, perfluoro&#173;alkoxy, and other fluorinated groups is steadily increasing, exampl&#173;es with the N(CF3)2&#160;group are rare. One reason is that transfer reagents are scarce and metal&#8208;based storable reagents are unknown. Here, we present a set of CuI&#160;and AgI&#160;bis(trifluoromethyl)amido complexes stabilized by N&#8208; and P&#8208;donor ligands with un&#173;pre&#173;ce&#173;&#173;dented stability. The complexes are stable solids that can even be manipulated in air for a short time. They are bis(trifluoro&#173;methyl)amination reagents as shown by nucleo&#173;philic substitution and Sandmeyer reactions. In addition to a series of benzylbis(trifluoromethyl)amines, 2&#8208;bis(trifluoro&#173;methyl)&#173;&#173;amino acetate was obtained that upon hydrolysis gives the fluorinated amino acid&#160;N,N&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)glycine.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Lanthanide ions are particularly well&#8208;suited for the design of single&#8208;molecule magnets owing to their large unquenched orbital angular momentum and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling that gives rise to high magnetic anisotropy.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light Synthesis of Arylsulfonyl Fluorides: Scope and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key to success in the new metal&#8208;free visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of arylsulfonyl fluorides was using cyanoarene PC3 as organo&#8208;photocatalyst. A variety of arene diazonium slats were smoothly converted to the corresponding product. Mechanistic investigations including luminescence, EPR spectroscopy as well as DFT calculation allowed us to identify several key intermediates and propose a plausible mechanism.







Abstract
The first metal&#8208;free procedure for the synthesis of arylsulfonyl fluorides is reported. Under organo&#8208;photoredox conditions, aryl diazonium salts react with a readily available SO2 source (DABSO) to afford the desired product through simple nucleophilic fluorination. The reaction tolerates the presence of both electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;poor aryls and demonstrated a broad functional group tolerance. To shed the light on the reaction mechanism, several experimental techniques were combined, including fluorescence, NMR, and EPR spectroscopy as well as DFT calculations.

         <title>Rational Construction of a N, F Co&#8208;doped Mesoporous Cobalt Phosphate with Rich&#8208;Oxygen Vacancies for Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Enhanced performance: A N, F co&#8208;doped mesoporous cobalt&#8208;based phosphate with rich&#8208;oxygen vacancies was obtained by a facile in&#8208;situ pyrolysis. It exhibited highly efficient performance for OER and supercapacitors, which should be attributed to the introduction of N and F allowing regulation of its electronic structure and increasing its electroactive sites.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal phosphates have been widely applied as promising candidates for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this study, we report a simple method to prepare a N, F co&#8208;doped mesoporous cobalt phosphate with rich&#8208;oxygen vacancies by in&#8208;situ pyrolysis of a Co&#8208;phosphate precursor with NH4+ cations and F&#8722; anions. Due to this heteroatom doping, it could achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA/cm2 at lower overpotential of 276&#8197;mV and smaller Tafel slope of 57.11&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 on glassy carbon. Moreover, it could keep 92&#8201;% of initial current density for 35&#8197;h, indicating it has an excellent stability and durability. Furthermore, the optimal material applied in supercapacitor displays specific capacitance of 206.3&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintains cycling stability with 80&#8201;% after 3000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical properties should be attributed to N, F co&#8208;doping into this Co&#8208;based phosphate, which effectively modulates its electronic structure. In addition, its amorphous structure provides more active sites; moreover, its mesoporous structure should be beneficial to mass transfer and electrolyte diffusion.

         <title>Spectroscopic Studies of Synthetic Methylaluminoxane: Structure of Methylaluminoxane Activators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrolysis of Me6Al2 using hydrated salts, or reaction of Me6Al2 with trimethylboroxine affords methylaluminoxane (MAO) with different ESI&#8208;MS spectra, NMR spectra and residual Me3Al content. Unlike commercial MAO, which upon treatment with donors, consists mainly of a single anionic species [(MeAlO)16(Me3Al)6Me]&#8722;=[16,6]&#8722;, synthetic MAO can differ significantly in its ion&#8208;pair speciation. Theory suggests the ion&#8208;pair precursors have sheet structures.







Abstract
Hydrolysis of trimethylaluminum (Me3Al) in polar solvents can be monitored by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) using the donor additive octamethyltrisiloxane [(Me3SiO)2SiMe2, OMTS]. Using hydrated salts, hydrolytic methylaluminoxane (h&#8208;MAO) features different anion distributions, depending on the conditions of synthesis, and different activator contents as measured by NMR spectroscopy. Non&#8208;hydrolytic MAO was prepared using trimethylboroxine. The properties of this material, which contains incorporated boron, differ significantly from h&#8208;MAO. In the case of MAO prepared by direct hydrolysis, oligomeric anions are observed to rapidly form, and then more slowly evolve into a mixture dominated by an anion with m/z 1375 with formula [(MeAlO)16(Me3Al)6Me]&#8722;. Theoretical calculations predict that sheet structures with composition (MeAlO)n(Me3Al)m are favoured over other motifs for MAO in the size range suggested by the ESI&#8208;MS experiments. A possible precursor to the m/z 1375 anion is a local minimum based on the free energy released upon hydrolysis of Me3Al.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrolysis of trimethylaluminum (Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al) in polar solvents can be monitored by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) using the donor additive octamethyltrisiloxane [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, OMTS]. Using hydrated salts, hydrolytic methylaluminoxane (h&#8208;MAO) features different anion distributions, depending on the conditions of synthesis, and different activator contents as measured by NMR spectroscopy. Non&#8208;hydrolytic MAO was prepared using trimethylboroxine. The properties of this material, which contains incorporated boron, differ significantly from h&#8208;MAO. In the case of MAO prepared by direct hydrolysis, oligomeric anions are observed to rapidly form, and then more slowly evolve into a mixture dominated by an anion with &lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt; 1375 with formula [(MeAlO)&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Me]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Theoretical calculations predict that sheet structures with composition (MeAlO)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al)&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; are favoured over other motifs for MAO in the size range suggested by the ESI&#8208;MS experiments. A possible precursor to the &lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt; 1375 anion is a local minimum based on the free energy released upon hydrolysis of Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hypervalent&#8208;Iodine(III)&#8208;Mediated Tandem Oxidative Dearomatization/Aziridination of Phenolic Amines: Synthesis of Functionalized Unactivated Aziridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tandem reaction (oxidative dearomatization/aziridination) of phenolic amines in the presence of hypervalent&#8208;iodine(III) reagent is described. This cascade reaction shows a chemical unification of the oxidative reactivity of phenol and aliphatic primary amine in the chemistry of dearomatization and aziridination, thus providing a new method for the synthesis of unactivated aziridines with dense functionalization.







Abstract
A new hypervalent&#8208;iodine(III)&#8208;mediated tandem reaction involving oxidative dearomatization and in&#8197;situ aziridination of phenolic amines is described, providing a mild and effective method for the assembly of structurally interesting and synthetically useful aziridines. Importantly, the densely functionalized aziridines resulting from this unprecedented tandem reaction offer a platform for expeditious access to architecturally diverse aza&#8208;heterocycles through transformations initiated by selective ring&#8208;opening of aziridines.

         <title>Photoredox Catalytic Pentafluorosulfanylative Domino Cyclization of &#945;&#8208;Substituted Alkenes to Oxaheterocycles by Using SF6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Become complex! The advanced one&#8208;step photoredox catalytic activation of SF6 allows the preparation of pentaflurosulfanylated oxepans, tetrahydropyrans and tetrahydrofurans as products with high structural complexity.







Abstract
Virtually inert sulfur hexafluoride becomes a precious pentafluorosulfanylation agent, if properly activated by photoredox catalysis, to access &#945;&#8208;fluoro and &#945;&#8208;alkoxy SF5&#8208;compounds. This advanced protocol converts SF6 in the presence of alkynols as bifunctional C&#8722;C&#8208; and C&#8722;O&#8208;bond forming reagents directly into pentafluorosulfanylated oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles in a single step from &#945;&#8208;substituted alkenes. The proposed mechanism is supported by theoretical calculations and gives insights not only in the pentafluorosulfanylation step but also into formation of the carbon&#8208;carbon bond and is in full agreement with Baldwin's cyclization rules. The key step is a radical type 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; respectively 7&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#8208;cyclization. The synthesized oxaheterocycles cannot be simply prepared by other synthetic methods, show a high level of structural complexity and significantly expand the scope of pentafluorosulfanylated building blocks valuable for medicinal and material chemistry.

         <title>Strong Electronic Communication in Linearly Elongated Rylenes Featuring Tunable Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient synthetic pathways and purification strategies to access regioisomerically pure isomers of a perylene&#8208;perylene homodimer and a perylene&#8208;naphthalene heterodimer with 30 and 35 conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron pairs are reported. Furthermore, their optoelectronic properties were tuned via protonation and methylation of their dibenzimidazole&#8208;bridging unit.







Abstract
A modified synthetic pathway towards perylene&#8208;perylene dimers and a facile purification method to obtain the regioisomerically pure syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;isomers are reported. In addition, a novel perylene&#8208;naphthalene heterodimer with 30 conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron pairs was designed and synthesized on the basis of a previously described precursor and the resulting regioisomers were separated from each other. Thereby, the opto&#8208;electronic properties of the linearly elongated chromophores could be investigated regarding the differences in length of their aromatic system and the configuration of the isomers. Further tuning of their energy gaps was realized via protonation and methylation of the dibenzimidazole&#8208;bridging unit. Extraordinary red&#8208;shifts of the absorption maxima of 62&#8197;nm for the methylated and 92&#8197;nm for the protonated perylene&#8208;perylene anti&#8208;isomer could be achieved. Moreover, the maxima for the syn&#8208;isomer could be shifted bathochromically by 87 and 113&#8197;nm, respectively.

         <title>Polysaccharide Chemistry in Drug Delivery, Endocrinology, and Vaccines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the importance of using polysaccharide in disease treatment. They are a natural component that can be deployed as drugs and drug enhancers through chemical simple modifications leading to low&#8208;cost natural medicine. Polysaccharide have recently been used for pioneering work in endocrinology, drug delivery, and vaccines.







Abstract
Polysaccharides, due to their outstanding properties, have attracted the attention of researchers, working in the biomedical field and especially of those working in drug delivery. Modified/functionalized polysaccharides further increase the importance for various applications. Delivery of therapeutics for diverse ailments in different endocrine glands and hormones safely, is a focal point of researchers working in the field. Among the routes followed, the transdermal route is preferred due to non&#8208;exposure of active moieties to the harsh gastric environment and first&#8208;pass metabolism. This review starts with the overview of polysaccharides used for the delivery of various therapeutic agents. Advantages of polysaccharides used in the transdermal route are addressed in detail. Types of polysaccharides will be elaborated through examples, and in this context, special emphasis will be on the polysaccharides being used for synthesis of the membranes/films. Techniques employed for their modification to design novel carriers for therapeutics delivery will also be discussed. The review will end with a brief discussion on recent developments and future perspectives for delivery of therapeutic agents, and vaccine development.

         <title>Reductive Rearrangement of a 1&#8208;Phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When fed the right food, the hermit crab depicted in the cover image grows bigger and finally needs a larger shell. This work reports the reactivity of a 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene, the product of a hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between a 2H&#8208;phosphole and an activated imine. Thus, reductive cleavage of the phosphorus&#8722;nitrogen bond with LiAlH4 leads to an unprecedented ring expansion with formation of a 1&#8208;phosphabicyclo[3.2.1]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene. The cover image was designed by Dr. Christoph Selg. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E. Hey&#8208;Hawkins et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100898).

This work reports the reactivity of a 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;2&#8208;azanorbornene, the product of a hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between a 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phosphole and an activated imine. Thus, reductive cleavage of the phosphorus&#8722;nitrogen bond with LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; leads to an unprecedented ring expansion with formation of a 1&#8208;phosphabicyclo[3.2.1]octa&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene. The cover image was designed by Dr. Christoph Selg. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E. Hey&#8208;Hawkins et&#8197;al.

         <title>Activation of a Copper Biscarbene Mechano&#8208;Catalyst Using Single&#8208;Molecule Force Spectroscopy Supported by Quantum Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Point break: A latent copper&#8208;biscarbene mechanocatalyst becomes active when a ligand is forcefully removed. Pulling with around 2&#8197;nN breaks the copper&#8208;carbon bond, as measured by single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy. To be able to assign the bond rupture event to the Cu&#8722;C bond, mechanophores with two different lengths of safety&#8208;line were specifically synthesized for use in this AFM experiment.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy allows investigation of the effect of mechanical force on individual bonds. By determining the forces necessary to sufficiently activate bonds to trigger dissociation, it is possible to predict the behavior of mechanophores. The force necessary to activate a copper biscarbene mechano&#8208;catalyst intended for self&#8208;healing materials was measured. By using a safety line bypassing the mechanophore, it was possible to pinpoint the dissociation of the investigated bond and determine rupture forces to range from 1.6 to 2.6&#8197;nN at room temperature in dimethyl sulfoxide. The average length&#8208;increase upon rupture of the Cu&#8722;C bond, due to the stretching of the safety line, agrees with quantum chemical calculations, but the values exhibit an unusual scattering. This scattering was assigned to the conformational flexibility of the mechanophore, which includes formation of a threaded structure and recoiling of the safety line.

         <title>Sequential Tether&#8208;Directed Synthesis of New [3:2:1] Hexakis&#8208;Adducts of C60 with a Mixed Octahedral Addition Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselective synthesis of hexakis&#8208;adducts of fullerene C60 with more than two different types of addends is still a challenging task in fullerene chemistry. Following a sequential tether&#8208;directed remote functionalization strategy, chiral [3:2] pentakis&#8208;adducts with an incomplete octahedral addition pattern were synthesized and isolated. The isomerically pure pentakis&#8208;adducts served as universal building blocks for the synthesis of a series of octahedral [3:2:1] hexakis&#8208;adducts with outstanding regioselectivity. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Hirsch et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100319).

         <dc:description>Two highly efficient metal&#8722;organic framework catalysts TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NHPI and TJU&#8208;68&#8208;NDHPI have been successfully synthesized through solvothermal reactions of which the frameworks are merged with&#160;N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) units for the first time, resulting in the decoration of pore surfaces with highly active nitroxyl catalytic sites. When&#160;t&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN) is used as co&#8208;catalyst, the as synthesized MOFs are demonstrated to be highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for a novel three&#8208;phase heterogeneous oxidation of activated C&#8722;H bond of primary, secondary alcohols and benzyl compounds under mild conditions.

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based &#8220;Turn&#8208;Off&#8221; Probe with Broad Detection Range for Cu2+, Pb2+ and Hg2+ Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient pyrene&#8208;based probe using fluorescence quenching to detect mercury, lead and copper in organic solvents with high selectivity and specificity was synthetized. The rigid tris&#8208;pyrene chromophore architecture ensures a very broad dynamic range of the sensor's response. Spectroscopic investigation elucidated the stoichiometry and mode of action and revealed a unique aggregation behavior at high analyte concentrations.







Abstract
Detection of metals in different environments with high selectivity and specificity is one of the prerequisites of the fight against environmental pollution with these elements. Pyrenes are well suited for the fluorescence sensing in different media. The applied sensing principle typically relies on the formation of intra&#8208; and intermolecular excimers, which is however limiting the sensitivity range due to masking of e.&#8201;g. quenching effects by the excimer emission. Herein we report a highly selective, structurally rigid chemical sensor based on the monomer fluorescence of pyrene moieties bearing triazole groups. This sensor can quantitatively detect Cu2+, Pb2+ and Hg2+ in organic solvents over a broad concentrations range, even in the presence of ubiquitous ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+. The strongly emissive sensor's fluorescence with a long lifetime of 165&#8197;ns is quenched by a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex formation upon addition of metal ions in acetonitrile. Upon addition of a tenfold excess of the metal ion to the sensor, agglomerates with a diameter of about 3&#8197;nm are formed. Due to complex interactions in the system, conventional linear correlations are not observed for all concentrations. Therefore, a critical comparison between the conventional Job plot interpretation, the method of Benesi&#8208;Hildebrand, and a non&#8208;linear fit is presented. The reported system enables the specific and robust sensing of medically and environmentally relevant ions in the health&#8208;relevant nM range and could be used e.&#8201;g. for the monitoring of the respective ions in waste streams.

         <title>Phosphetes via transition metal free ring closure &#8211; taking the proper turn at a thermodynamic crossing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition metal free route to phosphetes featuring an exocyclic alkene unit is presented. In this approach phosphanides are added to a variety of diynes generating phosphaallylic intermediates which depending on the reaction conditions transform either to phosphetes or the corresponding phospholes. Investigation of the reaction mechanism by combined quantum chemical and experimental means identifies phosphole formation as thermodynamically controlled reaction path, whereas kinetic control furnishes the corresponding phosphetes. Structural and luminescence properties of the rare class of phosphetes are explored, as well as for selected key intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>E4 Transfer (E = P, As) to Ni Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: The utilization of [Cp''2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E = P (1a), As (1b), Cp''&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) as phosphorus or arsenic source, respectively, gives access to novel stable polypnictogen transition metal complexes at ambient temperatures. The reaction of 1a/1b with [CpRNiBr]2 (CpR = CpBn (1,2,3,4,5&#8208;penta&#8208;benzyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl), Cp''' (1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl)) was studied, to yield novel complexes depending on steric effects and stoichiometric ratios. Besides the transfer of the complete En&#160;unit, a degradation as well as aggregation can be observed. Thus, the prismane derivatives [(Cp'''Ni)2(&#956;,&#951;3:3&#8208;E4)] (2a (E = P); 2b (E = As)) or the arsenic containing cubane [{(Cp'''Ni)3(&#956;3&#8209;As)(As4)] (5) are formed. Furthermore, the bromine bridged cubanes of the type [(CpRNi)3{Ni(&#956;&#8209;Br)}(&#956;3&#8208;E)4]2 (CpR = Cp''': 6a (E = P), 6b (E = As), CpR&#160;=&#160;CpBn: 8a (E = P), 8b (E&#160;=&#160;As)) can be isolated.

         <title>Study of ground state interactions of enantiopure chiral quaternary ammonium salts and amides, nitroalkanes, nitroalkenes, esters, heterocycles, ketones and fluoroamides.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis provides high level of enantiocontrol, however no experimental data showed the interaction of catalysts and substrates. We have carried out 1H&#8208;NMR titration of Cinchona and Maruoka ammonium bromides vs nitro, carbonyl, heterocycles, and N&#8208;F containing compounds. We found that neutral organic species and quaternary ammonium salts interacted via an ensemble of catalyst +N&#8208;C&#8208;H and (sp2)C&#8208;H, specific for each substrate studied. The correspondent BArF salts interacted with carbonyls via a diverse set of +N&#8208;C&#8208;H and (sp2)C&#8208;H compared to bromides. This data suggests that BArF ammonium salts may display a different enantioselectivity profile. Although not providing quantitative data for the affinity constants, the data reported proofs that chiral ammonium salts coordinate with substrates, prior to transition state, via specific C&#8208;H positions in their structures, providing a new rational to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity in their catalyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc&#8208; and Cadmium meso&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Isoporphyrins: Non&#8208;Aromatic NIR Dyes with Distinct Conformational Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sign has risen in the porphyrin sky! Stable isoporphyrins can be produced as non&#8208;aromatic NIR dyes in yields up to 36&#8201;% by a one&#8208;pot process. Non&#8208;planar distortion modes are the key to control the optical spectra and the occurrence of isomers by means of synthesis. For the first time, the redox chemistry of isoporphyrins was studied by electrochemical methods, which is significant with regard to potential applications in photovoltaics.







Abstract
A series of pyrrolyl and dipyrrinyl isoporphyrins carrying different phenyl and thienyl groups is reported. The compounds are obtained by a one&#8208;pot approach in the presence of a template reagent. Thienyl derivatives gave better yields, and were the only subclass to form with steric hindrance. The structural analyses carried out on compounds 1 and 14 revealed distinct conformational differences which are likely to result from an intramolecular NH&#8230;Cl hydrogen bridge of the pyrrolyl subclass. In addition, this hydrogen bridge strongly favors one of the two possible atropisomers. Hindered rotation of the meso&#8208;aryl groups is observed only in the cases of methylbenzothienyl derivatives 10 and 15 and leads to the observation of several diastereomers. NIR absorptions up to 923&#8197;nm are found throughout. Electrochemical investigations into the 1e&#8722; and 2e&#8722; reduced species unravel axial ligand exchange dynamics for the zinc isoporphyrin radical, and the probable formation of a zinc phlorinate.

         <title>Solvent Induced Helix Folding of Defined Indolenine Squaraine Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of defined indolenine squaraine dye oligomers up to the nonamer were synthesised via iterative cross coupling. Depending on the solvent either a random coil (J&#8208;type) or a loose helix (H&#8208;type) is formed. Structural and folding properties were examined via optical spectroscopy, DOSY NMR, SANS and computations.







Abstract
A protecting group strategy was employed to synthesise a series of indolenine squaraine dye oligomers up to the nonamer. The longer oligomers show a distinct solvent dependence of the absorption spectra, that is, either a strong blue shift or a strong red shift of the lowest energy bands in the near infrared spectral region. This behaviour is explained by exciton coupling theory as being due to H&#8208; or J&#8208;type coupling of transition moments. The H&#8208;type coupling is a consequence of a helix folding in solvents with a small Hansen dispersity index. DOSY NMR, small angle neutron scattering (SANS), quantum chemical and force field calculations agree upon a helix structure with an unusually large pitch and open voids that are filled with solvent molecules, thereby forming a kind of clathrate. The thermodynamic parameters of the folding process were determined by temperature dependent optical absorption spectra.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Large Single Crystals of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni Prepared by a Modulation Approach: In situ Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mixed linker modulation approach yielded large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni, an analogue that has not yet been able to be studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction due to crystal size limitations. This study investigates the nitric oxide, an important therapeutic agent, gas loading behavior of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni single crystals utilizing an in&#8197;situ gas cell setup using synchrotron radiation.

The size of single crystals of the metal&#8208;organic framework CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni was incrementally increased through a series of modulated syntheses. A novel linker modulated synthesis using 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid and the isomeric ligand 4,6&#8208;dihydroxyisophthalic acid yielded large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni (&#8764;70&#8197;&#956;m). All materials were shown to have high crystallinity and phase purity through powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy methods, thermogravimetry, and compositional analysis. For the first time single&#8208;crystal structure analyses were carried out on CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni. High BET surface areas and nitric oxide (NO) release efficiencies were recorded for all materials. Large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni showed a prolonged NO release and proved suitable for in&#8197;situ single&#8208;crystal diffraction experiments to follow the NO adsorption. An efficient activation protocol was developed, leading to a dehydrated structure after just 4&#8197;h, which subsequently was NO&#8208;loaded, leading to a first NO loaded single&#8208;crystal structural model of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni.

&lt;p&gt;A novel mixed linker modulation approach yielded large single crystals of CPO&#8208;27&#8208;Ni, an analogue that has not yet been able to be studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction due to crystal size limitations.

         <dc:description>
Under control: From a single starting material, three different products can be prepared with excellent chemoselectivity in the presence of a rhodium precatalyst. Conditions for the synthesis of vinylated pyridones, tetrasubstituted alkenes, and annulated pyridone derivatives are advanced using 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;2&#8208;pyridones. Through careful choice of co&#8208;catalysts and additives, the reaction paths can be successfully manipulated to provide products that are difficult to access by other methods. Experimental and DFT studies provide insight into the diverse reaction pathways.

Depending on the reaction conditions, solvents and additives, the reaction pathway can be switched between alkenylation, alkenylation/directing group migration and rollover annulation.

These protocols exhibit excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, broad substrate scope, and good tolerance of functional groups.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Iron Catalyst for Highly Enantioselective and Diastereoselective Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron complex, in which all coordinated ligands are achiral and the overall chirality is exclusively due to a stereogenic iron center, catalyzes hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with high diastereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). Key for this excellent stereocontrol are bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl substituents at the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands which increase the steric hindrance at the catalytic site.







Abstract
This study demonstrates that chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron complexes, in which all coordinated ligands are achiral and the overall chirality the consequence of a stereogenic iron center, are capable of catalyzing asymmetric transformations with very high enantioselectivities. The catalyst is based on a previously reported design (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017, 139, 4322), in which iron(II) is surrounded by two configurationally inert achiral bidentate N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes in a C2&#8208;symmetric fashion and complemented by two labile acetonitriles. By replacing mesityl with more bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl substituents at the NHC ligands, the steric hindrance at the catalytic site was increased, thereby providing a markedly improved asymmetric induction. The new chiral&#8208;at&#8208;iron catalyst was applied to the inverse electron demand hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated &#945;&#8208;ketoester and enol ethers provide 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% ee). Other electron rich dienophiles are also suitable as demonstrated for a reaction with a vinyl azide.

         <title>Click Chemistry in Ultra&#8208;high Vacuum &#8211; Tetrazine Coupling with Methyl Enol Ether Covalently Linked to Si(001)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;free coupling of a tetrazine derivative and an enol ether group, the latter being covalently attached on a Si(001) surface via cyclooctyne, has been observed in ultra&#8208;high vacuum by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. DFT calculations identified the associated reaction meachanism. This click chemistry scheme allows the synthesis of covalently bound molecular architectures on highly reactive surfaces in a UHV environment.







Abstract
The additive&#8208;free tetrazine/enol ether click reaction was performed in ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) with an enol ether group covalently linked to a silicon surface: Dimethyl 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarboxylate molecules were coupled to the enol ether group of a functionalized cyclooctyne which was adsorbed on the silicon (001) surface via the strained triple bond of cyclooctyne. The reaction was observed at a substrate temperature of 380&#8197;K by means of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A moderate energy barrier was deduced for this click reaction in vacuum by means of density functional theory based calculations, in good agreement with the experimental results. This UHV&#8208;compatible click reaction thus opens a new, flexible route for synthesizing covalently bound organic architectures.

         <title>Binding of a TlCl Entity by a Tetragold Tetramercaptothiacalixarene Metalloligand via Metallophilic Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetramercaptotetrathiacalix[4]arene was used as a coordination platform to synthesize and investigate gold(I) complexes with varying nuclearity. Aiming at the corresponding tetranuclear complex through salt metathesis it was found capable of binding a neutral, molecular TlCl entity by metallophilic interactions, as shown by structural and theoretical investigations. These Interactions lead to photoluminescence at low temperatures (see figure).







Abstract
The successive auration of p&#8208;tert&#8208;butyltetramercaptotetrathiacalix[4]arene, H4(MTC[4]), with gold(I) phosphine units was investigated. Through deprotonation with NaOMe, followed by salt metathesis reactions with (PR3)AuCl (R=Me, Ph) complexes with two and three [(PR3)Au]+ moieties could be prepared and isolated, namely [(Ph3PAu)2H2(MTC[4])] and [(Me3PAu)3H(MTC[4])]. In [(Me3PAu)3H(MTC[4])] two gold atoms already come close enough to undergo aurophilic interactions. To introduce a fourth [(PR3)Au]+ entity TlOEt had to be used for the deprotonation, which led to the finding that four gold atoms organised by the (MTC[4])4&#8722; coordination platform are able to bind and stabilize a TlCl entity, yielding [(Me3PAu)4TlCl(MTC[4])]. As evidenced by structural and theoretical investigations the binding occurs through strong metallophilic interactions, which lead to photoluminescence at low temperatures.

         <title>Oligomers Intermediates in Between Two New Distinct Homonuclear Uranium(IV) DOTP Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between tetravalent uranium and DOTP, a cyclen&#8208;derived tetraphosphonic ligand, was studied in aqueous solutions. It resulted in the eventual formation of two new different homo&#8208;nuclear species, [UIV(DOTPH4)] and [UIV(DOTPH6)2]. Various analytical techniques showed that a pH&#8208;dependent, reversible and irreversible oligomerization processes govern both species in&#8208;solution dynamics.







Abstract
Two new aqueous UIV complexes were synthesized by the interaction between the tetravalent uranium cation and the (1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetraazacyclododecane&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetra(methylene phosphonic acid) (DOTP) macrocyclic ligand. Two distinct homonuclear complexes were identified; the first was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography as a unique &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;cage&#8221;, [U(DOTPH6)2] complex, in which the UIV cation is octa&#8208;coordinated to 4 phosphonic arms from each ligand in a square anti&#8208;prism geometry, with a C4 symmetry. The second is the &#8220;in&#8208;cage&#8221; [U(DOTPH4)] complex, in which the tetravalent cation is located between the macrocycle O4 and N4 planes. With the help of UV&#8208;Vis absorption, 1H/31P&#8197;NMR, ATR&#8208;IR, and MALDI&#8208;TOFMS analytical techniques, the chemical interchange between both species is presented. It is shown that the one&#8208;way transition is governed by the formation of a multiple number of soluble oligomeric species consisting of varied stoichiometric ratios of both characterized homonuclear complexes.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Scaffolded Disulfide Redox Network for Programming Drug&#8208;Delivery Kinetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Opening the therapeutic window wider: An in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated DNA&#8208;scaffolded disulfide redox network (DdiSRN) can be used as a smart drug&#8208;delivery system. Drug release can be controlled and drug&#8208;delivery kinetics programmed by using DNA scaffolds for precise control over the position and number of disulfide bonds. As a therapeutic platform, this DdiSRN shows greatly enhanced therapeutic efficacy in cancer therapy.







Abstract
In response to specific stimuli, dynamic covalent materials enable the generation of new structures by reversibly forming/breaking chemical bonds, thus showing great potential for application in controlled drug release. However, using dynamic covalent chemistry to program drug&#8208;delivery kinetics remains challenging. Herein, an in&#8197;situ polymerization&#8208;generated DNA&#8208;scaffolded disulfide redox network (DdiSRN) is reported in which nucleic acids are used as a scaffold for dynamic disulfide bonds. The constructed DdiSRN allows selective release of loading cargos inside cancer cells in response to redox stimuli. Moreover, the density of disulfide bonds in network can be tuned by precise control over their position and number on DNA scaffolds. As a result, drug&#8208;delivery kinetics can be programmed with a half&#8208;life, t1/2, decreasing from 8.3 to 4.4&#8197;h, thus facilitating keeping an adequate drug concentration within the therapeutic window. Both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies confirm that co&#8208;delivery of DOX and siRNA in combination with fast drug release inside cells using this DdiSRN enhances the therapeutic effect on multidrug&#8208;resistant cancer. This nontrivial therapeutic platform enabling kinetic control provides a good paradigm for precision cancer medicine.

         <title>Nickel/Cobalt Molybdate Hollow Rods Induced by Structure and Defect Engineering as Exceptional Electrode Materials for Hybrid Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects are engineered and prepared through a facile soft&#8208;template combined with partial reduction methods. The electrode material shows exceptional specific capacitance of 1329&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, and the capacitance retention of the D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4 is about 95.8&#8201;% along with the cycle number of 3000. Besides, the as&#8208;prepared D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4//AC exhibits an exceptional energy density (34.13&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1).







Abstract
Oxygen defects and hollow structures positively impact pseudocapacitive properties of diffusion/surface&#8208;controlled processes, a component of critical importance when building high&#8208;performance supercapacitors. Hence, we fabricated hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects (D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4) through a soft&#8208;template and partial reduction method, enhancing D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4&#8217;s electrochemical performance, yielding a specific capacitance of 1329&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, and demonstrating excellent durability with 95.8&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000&#8197;cycles. D&#8722;H&#8722;NiMoO4@CoMoO4 was used as the positive electrode to construct an asymmetric supercapacitor, displaying an energy density of up to 34.13&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and demonstrating good predisposition towards practical applications. This work presents an effective approach to fabricate and use hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O&#8208;defects as pseudocapacitor material for high&#8208;performance capacitive energy storage devices.

         <title>DNA Functionality with Photoswitchable Hydrazone Cytidine**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of hydrazone&#8208;modified cytidine phosphoramidite and oligodeoxynucleotides containing this modification is presented. The E&#8208;Z isomerization triggered by the irradiation of a 450&#8197;nm blue light was investigated in the contexts of both nucleoside and oligodeoxynucleotide. The control of DNA synthesis in&#8197;vitro was achieved by using the blue light in the primer extension reactions in the presence of DNA polymerases.







Abstract
A new family of hydrazone modified cytidine phosphoramidite building block was synthesized and incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides to construct photoswitchable DNA strands. The E&#8208;Z isomerization triggered by the irradiation of blue light with a wavelength of 450&#8197;nm was investigated and confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and HPLC in the contexts of both nucleoside and oligodeoxynucleotide. The light activated Z form isomer of this hydrazone&#8208;cytidine with a six&#8208;member intramolecular hydrogen bond was found to inhibit DNA synthesis in the primer extension model by using Bst DNA polymerase. In addition, the hydrazone modification caused the misincorporation of dATP together with dGTP into the growing DNA strand with similar selectivity, highlighting a potential G to A mutation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The synthesis&lt;/b&gt; of hydrazone&#8208;modified cytidine phosphoramidite and oligodeoxynucleotides containing this modification is presented. The &lt;i&gt;E&#8208;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomerization triggered by the irradiation of a 450&#8197;nm blue light was investigated in the contexts of both nucleoside and oligodeoxynucleotide. The control of DNA synthesis &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; was achieved by using the blue light in the primer extension reactions in the presence of DNA polymerases.

         <title>Conjugated Molecular Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic efforts to bend aromatic surfaces have had a remarkable evolution during the last dozen years. Conjugated nanorings and nanobelts are among the most well&#8208;known examples. However, this progress has also led to the synthesis of molecular compounds with permanent tubular shapes with radial and axial &#960; surfaces, which are the highlight of this Minireview.







Abstract
Molecular compounds with permanent tubular architectures displaying radial &#960;&#8208;conjugation are exceedingly rare. Their radial and axial delocalization presents them with unique optical and electronic properties, such as remarkable tuning of their Stokes shifts, and redox switching between global and local aromaticity. Although these tubular compounds display large internal void spaces, these attributes have not been extensively explored, thus presenting future opportunities in the development of materials. By using cutting&#8208;edge synthetic methodologies to bend aromatic surfaces, large opportunities in synthesis, property discovery, and applications are expected in new members of this family of conjugated molecular nanotubes.

         <title>&#8220;Snapshot&#8221; Trapping of Multiple Transient Azolyllithiums in Batch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent developments in flow microreactor technology have allowed the use of transient organolithium compounds that cannot be realized in a batch reactor. However, trapping of the transient heteroaryllithiums in &#8220;halogen dance&#8221; is still challenging. We report trapping of such short&#8208;lived azolyllithiums in a batch reactor by developing a finely tuned in situ zincation using zinc halide diamine complexes, whose reaction rate is controlled by the appropriate choice of the diamine ligand. The reaction is operationally simple and can be performed at 0 &#176;C with high reproducibility on a multi&#8208;gram scale. This method was applicable to a wide range of brominated azoles allowing for deprotonative functionalization, which was used for the concise divergent syntheses of both constitutional isomers of biologically active azoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of Amphiphilic Porphyrins to Construct Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrophobic photosensitizers greatly affect the cell permeability and enrichment in tumours. They cannot be used directly for clinical applications because they always reunite in water, preventing their circulation in the blood and accumulation in tumour cells. As a result, amphiphilic photosensitizers are highly desirable. Although nanomaterial&#8208;based photosensitizers can solve water solubility, they have disadvantages of complicated operation, poor reproducibility, low drug loading, and poor stability. In this work, we propose an efficient synthesis strategy that converts small molecules into nanoparticles in 100% aqueous solution via the molecular assemble without addition of any foreign species. Three photosensitizers with triphenylphosphine units and different lengths of ethylene glycol chains are synthesized as TPP&#8208;PPh  3  , TPP&#8208;PPh  3  &#8208;2PEG and TPP&#8208;PPh  3  &#8208;4PEG to improve amphiphilicity. Among of three photosensitizers, TPP&#8208;PPh3&#8208;4PEG is the most efficient (singlet oxygen yield: 0.89) for tumour photodynamic therapy not only because of its definite constituent, but also because its amphiphilic structure allows it to self&#8208;assemble in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic and molecular docking study of the interaction between neutral Re(I) tetrazolate complexes and bovine serum albumin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Re(I) complexes have potential in biomedical sciences as imaging agents, diagnostics and therapeutics. Thus, it is crucial to understand how Re(I) complexes interact with carrier proteins, like serum albumins. Here, we used two neutral Re(I) complexes (  fac  &#8208;[Re(CO)  3  (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)L], where L is either 4&#8208;cyanophenyltetrazolate  (1)  or 4&#8208;methoxycarbonylphenyltetrazole ester  (2)  , to study the interactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Spectroscopic measurements, calculations of thermodynamic and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer parameters, as well as molecular modelling were performed to study differential binding between BSA and complex  1  and  2  . Induced&#8208;fit docking combined with quantum&#8208;polarised ligand docking were employed in what is believed to be a first for a Re(I) complex as a ligand for BSA. Our findings provide a basis for other molecular interaction studies and suggest that subtle functional group alterations at the terminal region of the Re(I) complex have a significant impact on the ability of this class of compounds to interact with BSA; which is important for the functional design of Re(I) complexes in biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Enolates: Versatile Intermediates for Asymmetric C&#8208;H Functionalization via Noncovalent Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst&#8208;controlled functionalization of unmodified carbonyl compounds is a relevant operation in organic synthesis, especially when high levels of site&#8208; and stereoselectivity can be attained. This objective is now within reach for some subsets of enolizable substrates using various types of activation mechanisms. Recent contributions to this area include enantioselective transformations that proceed via transiently generated noncovalent di(tri)enolate&#8208;catalyst coordination species. While relatively easier to form than simple enolate congeners, di(tri)enolates are ambifunctional in nature and so control of the reaction regioselectivity becomes an issue. This Minireview discusses in some detail this and other problems, and how noncovalent activation approaches based on metallic and metal free catalysts have been developed to advance the field.</dc:description>

         <title>3D Uranyl Organic Frameworks Supported by Rigid Octadentate Carboxylate Ligand: Synthesis, Structure Diversity, and Luminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seven 3D uranyl organic frameworks have been hydrothermally prepared using a rigid octadentate carboxylate linker. These UOFs have diverse 3D self&#8208;assembled architectures as a function of pH, co&#8208;ligands, structure&#8208;directing agents and transition metals.







Abstract
Seven three dimensional (3D) uranyl organic frameworks (UOFs), formulated as [NH4][(UO2)3(HTTDS)(H2O)] (1), [(UO2)4(HTTDS)2](HIM)6 (2, IM=imidazole), [(UO2)4(TTDS)(H2O)2(Phen)2] (3, Phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), [Zn(H2O)4]0.5[(UO2)3(HTTDS)(H2O)4] (4), and {(UO2)2[Zn(H2O)3]2(TTDS)} (5), {Zn(UO2)2(H2O)(Dib)0.5(HDib)(HTTDS)} (6, Dib=1,4&#8208;di(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzene) and [Na]{(UO2)4[Cu3(u3&#8208;OH)(H2O)7](TTDS)2} (7) have been hydrothermally prepared using a rigid octadentate carboxylate ligand, tetrakis(3,5&#8208;dicarboxyphenyl)silicon(H8TTDS).

         <title>Isolation of an Antiaromatic 9&#8208;Hydroxy Fluorenyl Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprisingly stable after all: Attempts to prepare a m&#8208;terphenylacylium ion by fluoride abstraction from a benzoyl fluoride, gave rise to a 4&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromatic 9&#8208;hydroxy fluorenyl cation that formed via an intramolecular electrophilic attack at a flanking mesityl group prior to a 1,2&#8208;methyl shift and proton transfer to oxygen.







Abstract
Fluorenyl cations are textbook examples of 4&#960; electron antiaromatic five&#8208;membered ring systems. So far, they were reported only as short&#8208;lived intermediates generated under superacidic conditions or by flash photolysis. Attempts to prepare a m&#8208;terphenyl acylium cation by fluoride abstraction from a benzoyl fluoride gave rise to an isolable 9&#8208;hydroxy fluorenyl cation that formed by an intramolecular electrophilic attack at a flanking mesityl group prior to a 1,2&#8208;methyl shift and proton transfer to oxygen.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Hydrosilylation of Ketenes with Silicon Electrophiles: Access to Fully Substituted Aldehyde&#8208;Derived Silyl Enol Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;,&#946;&#8208;Di&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;monoaryl&#8208;substituted silyl enol ethers derived from aldehydes are difficult to prepare. This rare class of compounds has been made accessible by a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free hydrosilylation of ketenes with B(C6F5)3 as catalyst and Et3SiH as stoichiometric reductant. The substrate scope is decent, and the stereoselectivity moderate to good in selected cases.







Abstract
Little&#8208;explored hydrosilylation of ketenes promoted by main&#8208;group catalysts is reported. The boron Lewis acid tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane accelerates the slow uncatalyzed reaction of ketenes and hydrosilanes, thereby providing a convenient access to the new class of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;di&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;monoaryl&#8208;substituted aldehyde&#8208;derived silyl enol ethers. Yields are moderate to high, and Z configuration is preferred. The corresponding silyl bis&#8208;enol ethers are also available when using dihydrosilanes. The related trityl&#8208;cation&#8208;initiated hydrosilylation involving self&#8208;regeneration of silylium ions is far less effective.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Aryl Sulfoxides</title>

         <dc:description>
A nickel/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system has been developed for the borylation of aryl sulfoxides with B2(neop)2 (neop=neopentyl glycolato).

Abstract
A nickel/N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system has been developed for the borylation of aryl sulfoxides with B2(neop)2 (neop=neopentyl glycolato). A wide range of aryl sulfoxides with different electronic and steric properties were converted into the corresponding arylboronic esters in good yields. The regioselective borylation of unsymmetric diaryl sulfoxides was also feasible leading to borylation of the sterically less encumbered aryl substituent. Competition experiments demonstrated that an electron&#8208;deficient aryl moiety reacts preferentially. The origin of the selectivity in the Ni&#8208;catalyzed borylation of electronically biased unsymmetrical diaryl sulfoxide lies in the oxidative addition step of the catalytic cycle, as oxidative addition of methoxyphenyl 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl sulfoxide to the Ni(0) complex occurs selectively to give the structurally characterized complex trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4){(SO)&#8208;4&#8208;MeO&#8208;C6H4}] 4. For complex 5, the isomer trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(OSC6H5)] 5&#8208;I was structurally characterized in which the phenyl sulfinyl ligand is bound via the oxygen atom to nickel. In solution, the complex trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(OSC6H5)] 5&#8208;I is in equilibrium with the S&#8208;bonded isomer trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(SOC6H5)] 5, as shown by NMR spectroscopy. DFT calculations reveal that these isomers are separated by a mere 0.3&#8197;kJ/mol (M06/def2&#8208;TZVP&#8208;level of theory) and connected via a transition state trans&#8208;[Ni(ICy)2(C6H5)(&#951;2&#8208;{SO}&#8208;C6H5)], which lies only 10.8&#8197;kcal/mol above 5.

         <title>Molecular Tools for the Study of ADP&#8208;Ribosylation: A Unified and Versatile Method to Synthesise Native Mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;Ribosylated Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides: A universal approach to synthesise mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides is presented. These peptides can provide a valuable tool for studying ADP&#8208;ribosylation. This is demonstrated by the synthesis of a variety of ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides modified on Ser&#8208;, Thr&#8208; or Cys&#8208;residues, the latter of which can act as a stable isostere for Ser&#8208;ADPr as Cys&#8208;ADPr is not reversed by the Ser&#8208;ADPr hydrolase ARH3. Furthermore, in using these peptides, the first hydrolase capable of hydrolysing Cys&#8208;ADPr was identified.







Abstract
ADP&#8208;ribosylation (ADPr), as a post&#8208;translational modification, plays a crucial role in DNA&#8208;repair, immunity and many other cellular and physiological processes. Serine is the main acceptor for ADPr in DNA damage response, whereas the physiological impact of less common ADPr&#8208;modifications of cysteine and threonine side chains is less clear. Generally, gaining molecular insights into ADPr recognition and turn&#8208;over is hampered by the availability of homogeneous, ADP&#8208;ribosylated material, such as mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated (MARylated) peptides. Here, a new and efficient solid&#8208;phase strategy for the synthesis of Ser&#8208;, Thr&#8208; and Cys&#8208;MARylated peptides is described. ADP&#8208;ribosylated cysteine, apart from being a native post&#8208;translational modification in its own right, proved to be suitable as a stabile bioisostere for ADP&#8208;ribosylated serine making it a useful tool to further biochemical research on serine ADP&#8208;ribosylation. In addition, it was discovered that the Streptococcus pyogenes encoded protein, SpyMacroD, acts as a Cys&#8208;(ADP&#8208;ribosyl) hydrolase.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Approach to Multilayer 3D Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D chirality by using Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings in the presence of new chiral amide&#8208;phosphines is reported. The resulting multilayer products showed strong luminescence under UV irradiation, and displayed strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE).







Abstract
The first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D chirality has been achieved by using Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings. New chiral catalysts were designed and screened under various catalytic systems that proved chiral amide&#8208;phosphines to be more efficient ligands than other candidates. The multilayer 3D framework was unambiguously determined by X&#8208;ray structural analysis showing a parallel pattern of three layers consisting of top, middle and bottom aromatic rings. The X&#8208;ray structure of a catalyst complex, dichloride complex of Pd&#8208;phosphine amide, was obtained revealing an interesting asymmetric environment nearby the Pd metal center. Three rings of multilayer 3D products can be readily changed by varying aromatic ring&#8208;anchored starting materials. The resulting multilayer products displayed strong luminescence under UV irradiation and strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). In the future, this work would benefit not only the field of asymmetric synthesis but also materials science, in particular polarized organic electronics, optoelectronics and photovoltaics.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms of the Degradation of Fluoroethylene Carbonate, an Additive of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries, Unraveled by Radiation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forming an attachment: In neat fluoroethylene carbonate, an additive commonly used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, excess electrons formed upon radiolysis primarly undergo attachment rather than solvation. The formation of the cyclic radical anion is not observed when fluoroethylene carbonate is a solute in other solvents.







Abstract
Numerous additives are used in the electrolytes of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, especially for the formation of an efficient solid electrolyte interphase at the surface of the electrodes. Understanding the degradation processes of these compounds is thus important; they can be seen through radiolysis. In the case of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), picosecond pulse radiolysis experiments evidenced the formation of FEC.&#8722;. This radical is stabilized in neat FEC, whereas the ring opens to form more stable radical anions when FEC is a solute in other solvents, as confirmed by quantum chemistry calculations. In neat FEC, pre&#8208;solvated electrons primarily undergo attachment rather than solvation. On long timescales, the gases produced (H2, CO, and CO2) were quantified. A reaction scheme for both the oxidizing and reducing pathways at stake in irradiated FEC is proposed. This work shows that the nature of the primary species formed in FEC depends on the amount of FEC in the solution.

         <title>Chiral Gold(III) Complexes: Synthesis, Structure, and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Golden story: Recent progresses achieved in the synthesis of well&#8208;defined chiral gold(III) complexes have been summarized. Applications that encompass homogeneous catalysis, medicinal and material chemistry, are also described.







Abstract
Since the beginning of the 2000&#8217;s, homogeneous gold catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to promote the cyclization of unsaturated substrates with excellent regioselectivity allowing the synthesis of elaborated organic scaffolds. An important goal to achieve in gold catalysis is the possibility to induce enantioselective transformations by the assistance of chiral complexes. Unfortunately, the linear geometry of coordination for gold usually encountered in complexes at the +1 oxidation states renders this goal very challenging. In consequence, the interest toward the synthesis of chiral gold(III) complexes is steadily growing. Indeed, the square planar geometry of the gold(III) cation appears more suitable to promote chiral induction. Beside catalysis, gold(III) complexes have also shown promising potential in the field of pharmacology. Herein, syntheses and applications of well&#8208;defined gold(III) complexes reported over the last fifteen years are summarized.

Such interactions can be considered as &#8220;contra&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; H&#8208;bonds, which combine the familiar orbital interaction pattern characteristic for the covalent contribution to the conventional H&#8208;bonding with an unusual contra&#8208;electrostatic component.

Abstract
What happens when a C&#8722;H bond is forced to interact with unpaired pairs of electrons at a positively charged metal? Such interactions can be considered as &#8220;contra&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; H&#8208;bonds, which combine the familiar orbital interaction pattern characteristic for the covalent contribution to the conventional H&#8208;bonding with an unusual contra&#8208;electrostatic component. While electrostatics is strongly stabilizing component in the conventional C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X bonds where X is an electronegative main group element, it is destabilizing in the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M contacts when M is Au(I), Ag(I), or Cu(I) of NHC&#8722;M&#8722;Cl systems. Such remarkable C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interaction became experimentally accessible within (&#945;&#8208;ICyDMe)MCl, NHC&#8208;Metal complexes embedded into cyclodextrins. Computational analysis of the model systems suggests that the overall interaction energies are relatively insensitive to moderate variations in the directionality of interaction between a C&#8722;H bond and the metal center, indicating stereoelectronic promiscuity of fully filled set of d&#8208;orbitals. A combination of experimental and computational data demonstrates that metal encapsulation inside the cyclodextrin cavity forces the C&#8722;H bond to point toward the metal, and reveals a still attractive &#8220;contra&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; H&#8208;bonding interaction.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when a C&#8722;H bond is forced to interact with unpaired pairs of electrons at a positively charged metal? Such interactions can be considered as &#8220;contra&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; H&#8208;bonds, which combine the familiar orbital interaction pattern characteristic for the covalent contribution to the conventional H&#8208;bonding with an unusual contra&#8208;electrostatic component. While electrostatics is strongly stabilizing component in the conventional C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X bonds where X is an electronegative main group element, it is destabilizing in the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M contacts when M is Au(I), Ag(I), or Cu(I) of NHC&#8722;M&#8722;Cl systems. Such remarkable C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interaction became experimentally accessible within (&#945;&#8208;ICyD&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;)MCl, NHC&#8208;Metal complexes embedded into cyclodextrins. Computational analysis of the model systems suggests that the overall interaction energies are relatively insensitive to moderate variations in the directionality of interaction between a C&#8722;H bond and the metal center, indicating stereoelectronic promiscuity of fully filled set of &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;orbitals. A combination of experimental and computational data demonstrates that metal encapsulation inside the cyclodextrin cavity forces the C&#8722;H bond to point toward the metal, and reveals a still attractive &#8220;contra&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; H&#8208;bonding interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Iridium Complex of N&#8208;Fused Bilatrienone: Oxidative Cleavage of N&#8208;Fused Porphyrin Induced by Iridium&#8208;Cyclooctadiene Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalation&#8208;assisted oxidative degradation: Reaction of N&#8208;fused porphyrin with iridium&#8208;cyclooctadiene under aerobic conditions yielded a unique ring&#8208;opened N&#8208;fused bilatrienone analog. The resulting species was isolated as an octahedral iridium complex with significantly modified optical and electrochemical properties.







Abstract
N&#8208;fused porphyrin (NFP) is a unique class of photostable near&#8208;infrared dyes with an 18&#960; aromatic tetrapyrrole macrocyclic skeleton containing a tri&#8208;fused pentacyclic moiety. Here, the synthesis of an iridium complex of N&#8208;fused bilatrienone is reported as the degradation product of Ir&#8208;cyclooctadiene (cod)&#8208;induced oxidative cleavage of NFP under aerobic conditions. Similar to the native bilin chromophores, the ring&#8208;opened complex featured a broken &#960;&#8208;conjugation circuit and exhibited a broad visible absorption band. In contrast, metalation of NFP using an iridium(I)(cod) complex under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of a cod&#8208;isomerized (&#954;1,&#951;3&#8208;C8H12)&#8208;Ir complex.

         <title>Reversible Vapochromic Luminescence Accompanied by Planar&#8211;Half&#8208;Chair Conformational Change of a Propeller&#8208;Shaped Boron &#946;&#8208;Diketiminate Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Leakage of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is one of the most severe industrial accidents because it can cause environmental pollution, global warming, fire, and explosion. Hence the visualization of leakage is an essential technology to detect it at an early stage. Molecular crystals whose fluorescence color can be changed by the exposure to VOCs could potentially serve as the sensing materials for realizing rapid and facile VOC detection. These materials, however, usually require harsh conditions, such as heating or a vacuum, to recover their initial phases for reuse. Therefore, it remains a challenge to obtain completely reversible sensing systems without such energy&#8208;consuming recycling processes. Here we report the reversible color change of fluorescence from the crystals of a propeller&#8208;shaped boron  &#946;&#8208;diketiminate complex. The complex was crystallized in distinct crystalline phases having different luminescent colors. Importantly, these phases were interconverted repeatedly upon exposure to the vapors of the appropriate VOCs. The small energy differences between conformers of the complex could lead to this pseudopolymorphic behavior. This finding could be applied for the development of further eco&#8208;friendly reversible sensing materials based on four&#8208;coordinated boron complexes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The challenging metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of highly functional quaternary carbon centers is reported using decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8210;C(sp3) bond formation reactions. The key substrate, a vinyl cyclic carbonate, is activated to provide concomitantly both the requisite nucleophile (by formal umpolung) and electrophile reaction partner preceding the asymmetric crosscoupling process. A wide screening of reaction conditions, additives and catalyst precursors afforded a protocol that enabled access to a series of compounds featuring densely functionalized, elusive quaternary carbon stereocenters in appreciable yield and with enantiomeric ratios (er&#180;s) of up to 90:10.</dc:description>

         <title>A showcase of green chemistry: Sustainable synthetic approach of zirconium&#8208;based MOF materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework materials (Zr&#8208;MOFs) have more practical usage over most conventional benchmark materials and even many other MOFs due to excellent structural stability, rich coordination forms, and various active sites. However, their mass&#8208;production and application are restricted by the high&#8208;cost raw materials, complex synthesis procedures, harsh reaction conditions, and unexpected environmental impact. Based on the principles of &#8220;Green Chemistry&#8221;, considerable efforts have been devoted to breaking through the limitations, and significant progress has been made in the sustainable synthesis of Zr&#8208;MOFs over the past decade. In this review, the advancements of green raw materials and green synthesis methods in the synthesis of Zr&#8208;MOFs are reviewed, along with the corresponding drawbacks. The challenges and prospects are discussed and outlooked, expecting to provide a guidance for the acceleration of the industrialization and commercialization of Zr&#8208;based MOF.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Topological Landscape by a G&#8208;Column Flip of a Parallel G&#8208;Quadruplex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Canonical G&#8208;quadruplexes can adopt a variety of different topologies depending on the arrangement of propeller, lateral, or diagonal loops connecting the four G&#8208;columns. A novel intramolecular G&#8208;quadruplex structure is derived through inversion of the last G&#8208;tract of a three&#8208;layered parallel fold, associated with the transition of a single propeller into a lateral loop. The resulting (3+1) hybrid fold features three  syn&#183;anti&#183;anti&#183;anti  G&#8208;tetrads with a 3&#8217;&#8208;terminal all&#8208;  syn  G&#8208;column. Although the ability of forming a duplex stem&#8208;loop between G&#8208;tracts seems beneficial for a propeller&#8208;to&#8208;lateral loop rearrangement, unmodified G&#8208;rich sequences resist folding into the new (3+1) topology. However, refolding can be driven by the incorporation of  syn  &#8208;favoring guanosine analogs into positions of the fourth G&#8208;stretch. The presented hybrid&#8208;type G&#8208;quadruplex structure as determined by NMR may provide for an additional scaffold in quadruplex&#8208;based technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Surface of BaTiO3 nanocubes covered with nonpolar oleic acid (OA) and polar tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) capping ligands, derived from atomistic modelling of neutron PDF data.







Abstract
Surface adsorbates and surrounding matrix species have been demonstrated to affect the properties of nanoscale ferroelectrics and nanoscale ferroelectric composites; potentially counteracting performance losses that can occur in small particle sizes. In this work, the effects of nonpolar oleic acid (OA) and polar tetrafluoroborate (BF4&#8722;) ligand capping on the surface of various sizes of BaTiO3 nanocubes have been investigated with combined neutron diffraction and neutron pair distribution function (PDF), density functional theory (DFT), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) methods. The low real space PDF region provides an unobstructed view of rhombohedral (split short and long) Ti&#8722;O distances in BaTiO3 nanocubes, mimicking the well&#8208;established order&#8208;disorder local structure found in bulk BaTiO3. Interestingly, the intermediate&#8208;range order in nanocubes is found to be orthorhombic, rather than tetragonal. It is concluded that polar ligands adsorbed at BaTiO3 surfaces stabilize the correlation length scale of local rhombohedral distortions in ferroelectric nanoparticles relative to nonpolar ligands.

         <title>Selective, pH&#8208;Dependent Colorimetric and Fluorimetric Detection of Quadruplex DNA with 4&#8208;Dimethylamino(phenyl)&#8208;Substituted Berberine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The very weak fluorescence of 4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;substituted berberines only increases significantly if both their conformational flexibility is strongly restricted, i.&#8201;e. in viscous medium or when bound to quadruplex DNA, and the amino group is protonated at low pH. This requirement of a dual stimulation to cause a light&#8208;up effect enables the spectrometric detection of quadruplex DNA at pH&#8197;5.







Abstract
The 9&#8208; and 12&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl&#8208;substituted berberine derivatives 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b were readily synthesized by Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions and shown to be useful fluorescent probes for the optical detection of quadruplex DNA (G4&#8208;DNA). Their association with the nucleic acids was investigated by spectrometric titrations, CD and LD spectroscopy, and with DNA&#8208;melting analysis. Both ligands bind to duplex DNA by intercalation and to G4&#8208;DNA by terminal &#960; stacking. At neutral conditions, they bind with higher affinity (Kb=105&#8722;106&#8197;M&#8722;1) to representative quadruplex forming oligonucleotides 22AG, c&#8208;myc, c&#8208;kit, and a2, than to duplex calf thymus (ct) DNA (Kb=5&#8208;7&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1). At pH&#8197;5, however, the affinity of 3&#8201;a towards G4&#8208;DNA 22AG is higher (Kb=1.2&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1), whereas the binding constant towards ct DNA is lower (Kb=3.9&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1) than under neutral conditions. Notably, the association of the ligand with DNA results in characteristic changes of the absorption and emission properties under specific conditions, which may be used for optical DNA detection. Other than the parent berberine, the ligands do not show a noticeable increase of their very low intrinsic emission intensity upon association with DNA at neutral conditions. In contrast, a fluorescence light&#8208;up effect was observed upon association to duplex (&#934;fl=0.01) and quadruplex DNA (&#934;fl=0.04) at pH&#8197;5. This fluorimetric response to G4&#8208;DNA association in combination with the distinct, red&#8208;shifted absorption under these conditions provides a simple and conclusive optical detection of G4&#8208;DNA at lower pH.

         <title>Modular Toolkit of Multifunctional Block Copoly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s for the Synthesis of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyoxazoline block copolymers offer a wide range of possibilities for application depending on their molecular structure and properties. This study introduces the huge potential of this polyoxazoline toolkit and demonstrates how tailor&#8208;made toolkit polymers can be applied in representative systems.







Abstract
Post&#8208;polymerization modification provides an elegant way to introduce chemical functionalities onto macromolecules to produce tailor&#8208;made materials with superior properties. This concept was adapted to well&#8208;defined block copolymers of the poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) family and demonstrated the large potential of these macromolecules as universal toolkit for numerous applications. Triblock copolymers with separated water&#8208;soluble, alkyne&#8208; and alkene&#8208;containing segments were synthesized and orthogonally modified with various low&#8208;molecular weight functional molecules by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and thiol&#8208;ene (TE) click reactions, respectively. Representative toolkit polymers were used for the synthesis of gold, iron oxide and silica nanoparticles.

         <title>G4 Sensing Pyridyl&#8208;Thiazole Polyamide Represses c&#8208;KIT Expression in Leukemia Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridyl bis&#8208;thiazole, TPW preferentially binds to c&#8208;KIT1 G&#8208;quadruplex over other G&#8208;quadruplexes and duplex DNA and emits high fluorescence inside cell nuclei. Despite being less toxic, it represses c&#8208;KIT transcription in cancer cells. These unique properties of TPW could be useful for the detection of G&#8208;quadruplexes and nuclear labeling of cancer cells.







Abstract
Specific sensing and functional tuning of nucleic acid secondary structures remain less explored to date. Herein, we report a thiazole polyamide TPW that binds specifically to c&#8208;KIT1 G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) with sub&#8208;micromolar affinity and &#8764;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry and represses c&#8208;KIT proto&#8208;oncogene expression. TPW shows up to 10&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence upon binding with c&#8208;KIT1 G4, but shows weak or no quantifiable binding to other G4s and ds26 DNA. TPW can increase the number of G4&#8208;specific antibody (BG4) foci and mark G4 structures in cancer cells. Cell&#8208;based assays reveal that TPW can efficiently repress c&#8208;KIT expression in leukemia cells via a G4&#8208;dependent process. Thus, the polyamide can serve as a promising probe for G&#8208;quadruplex recognition with the ability to specifically alter c&#8208;KIT oncogene expression.

         <dc:description>
By diiodine&#8208;promoted one&#8208;electron oxidation of 10H&#8208;phenothiazine in a variety of solvents, the 10H&#8208;phenothiazinium radical cation, along with its radical coupling product, 10&#8208;(3&#8208;phenothiazinylidene)phenothiazinium, have been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, the latter for the first time.

Utilizing facile one&#8208;electron oxidation of 10H&#8208;phenothiazine by molecular diiodine, the solid&#8208;state structure of the 10H&#8208;phenothiazinium radical cation was obtained in three cation:iodide ratios, as well as its THF and acetone solvates. Oxidation of 10H&#8208;phenothiazine with molecular diiodine in DMSO or DMF provided the structure of the radical coupling product 10&#8208;(3&#8208;phenothiazinyldene)phenothiazinium, which has not been crystallographically characterized to date. The radical cations were balanced by a mixture (I7)&#8722;, (I5)&#8722;, (I3)&#8722;, and I&#8722; anions, where a variety of chalcogen, halogen, and hydrogen bonding interactions stabilize the structures to reveal these interesting cationic species.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By diiodine&#8208;promoted&lt;/b&gt; one&#8208;electron oxidation of 10H&#8208;phenothiazine in a variety of solvents, the 10H&#8208;phenothiazinium radical cation, along with its radical coupling product, 10&#8208;(3&#8208;phenothiazinylidene)phenothiazinium, have been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, the latter for the first time.

         <title>Benzenedisulfonic Acid as an ALD/MLD Building Block for Crystalline Metal&#8208;Organic Thin Films**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new organic linker for atomic/molecular layer depositions (ALD/MLD) was demonstrated with copper and lithium metal nodes. The films are crystalline with and without water of crystallization. The applicability of dilithium&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedisulfonate as a solid polymer ion conductor is assessed.







Abstract
Two new atomic/molecular layer deposition processes for depositing crystalline metal&#8208;organic thin films, built from 1,4&#8208;benzenedisulfonate (BDS) as the organic linker and Cu or Li as the metal node, are reported. The processes yield in&#8208;situ crystalline but hydrated Cu&#8208;BDS and Li&#8208;BDS films; in the former case, the crystal structure is of a previously known metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;like structure, while in the latter case not known from previous studies. Both hydrated materials can be readily dried to obtain the crystalline unhydrated phases. The stability and the ionic conductivity of the unhydrated Li&#8208;BDS films were characterized to assess their applicability as a thin film solid polymer Li&#8208;ion conductor.

         <title>Kinetics and Mechanism of the Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination of 1,1&#8208;Dimethylallene with N&#8208;Methylaniline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of the intermolecular hydroamination of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;butadiene (  1  ) with  N  &#8208;methylaniline (  2  ) catalyzed by (IPr)AuOTf has been studied employing a combination of kinetic analysis, deuterium labelling studies, and  in situ  spectral analysis of catalytically active mixtures. The results of these and additional experiments are consistent with a mechanism for hydroamination involving reversible, endergonic displacement of  N  &#8208;methylaniline from [(IPr)Au(NHMePh)]  +  (  4  ) by allene to form the cationic gold &#960;&#8208;  C1,C2  &#8208;allene complex [(IPr)Au(&#951;  2  &#8208;H  2  C=C=CMe  2  )]  +  (  I  ) which is in rapid, endergonic equilibrium with the regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;  C2,C3  &#8208;allene complex [(IPr)Au(&#951;  2  &#8208;Me  2  C=C=CH  2  )]  +  (  I'  ). Rapid and reversible outer&#8208;sphere addition of  2  to the terminal allene carbon atom of  I'  to form gold vinyl complex (IPr)Au[C(=CH  2  )CMe  2  NMePh] (  II  ) is superimposed on slower addition of  2  to terminal allene carbon atom of  I  to form gold vinyl complex (IPr)Au[C(=CMe  2  )CH  2  NMePh] (  III  ). Selective protodeauration of  III  releases  N  &#8208;methyl&#8208;  N  &#8208;(3&#8208;methylbut&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)aniline (  3a  ) with regeneration of  4  . At high conversion, gold vinyl complex  II  is competitively trapped by an (IPr)Au  +  fragment to form the cationic bis(gold) vinyl complex {[(IPr)Au]  2  [C(=CH  2  )CMe  2  NMePh]}  +  (  6  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial supramolecular pumps powered by light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of artificial nanoscale motors that can use energy from a source to perform tasks requires systems capable of performing directionally controlled molecular movements and operating away from chemical equilibrium. Here we describe the design, synthesis and properties of pseudorotaxanes in which a photon input triggers the unidirectional motion of a macrocyclic ring with respect to a non&#8208;symmetric molecular axle. The photoinduced energy ratcheting at the basis of the pumping mechanism is validated by measuring the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Owing to the photochemical behaviour of the azobenzene moiety embedded in the axle, the pump can repeat its operation cycle autonomously under continuous illumination. We use NMR spectroscopy to observe the dissipative non&#8208;equilibrium state generated  in situ  by light irradiation. We also show that fine changes in the axle structure lead to an improvement in the performance of the motor. Such results highlight the modularity and versatility of this minimalist pump design, which provides facile access to dynamic systems that operate under photoinduced non&#8208;equilibrium regimes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Acceptor Propensity of different Fluorine Atom Types: An Analysis of Experimentally&#8208; and Computationally&#8208;derived Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The propensity of organic fluorine acting as a weak hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) in intermolecular and intramolecular interactions has been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies often reaching different conclusions. Over the last few years new and stronger evidences have emerged for the direct involvement of fluorine in weak hydrogen bond (HB) formation. However, not all the fluorine atom types can act as weak HBA. In this work we have analyzed the differential HBA propensity of various types of fluorine atoms with a particular emphasis for the different types of alkyl fluorides. This is carried out by evaluating  ab initio  computed parameters, experimental  19  F NMR chemical shifts and small molecule crystallographic structures (extracted from the CSD database). According to this analysis, shielded (with reference to the  19  F NMR chemical shift) mono&#8208;fluorinated alkyl motifs display the highest HBA propensity in agreement with solution studies. Although much weaker than other well characterized HB complexes, the fragile HBs formed by these fluorinated motifs have important implications for the chemical&#8208;physical and structural properties of the molecules, chemical reactions and protein/ligand recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbazole&#8208; and Fluorene&#8208;fused Aza&#8208;BODIPYs: NIR Fluorophores with High Brightness and Photostability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes incorporating fused fluorene or carbazole moieties were prepared. The dyes show significant enhancement of photophysical properties compared to the parent 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetraphenyl aza&#8208;BODIPY (  TPAB  ): a bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum (up to 2700 cm  &#8208;1  ) and emission maximum (up to 2270 cm  &#8208;1  ); almost 3&#8208;fold increase of molar absorption coefficients (to around 230,000 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  ) and significant increase of the fluorescence quantum yield to 49&#8208;66%. Owing to the combination of these properties the new aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes belong to the brightest NIR dyes reported. The dyes also show excellent photostability. Due to their outstanding properties, the new dyes represent a promising platform for further exploration in biomedical research. A pH indicator containing only one fused carbazole unit is also prepared and shows absorption and emission spectra that are bathochromically shifted by about 110 and 100 nm, respectively, compared to the indicator dye based on  TPAB  chromophore.</dc:description>

A pH indicator containing only one fused carbazole unit is also prepared and shows absorption and emission spectra that are bathochromically shifted by about 110 and 100 nm, respectively, compared to the indicator dye based on  TPAB  chromophore.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steric Effects on the Thermal Processes of Hemithioindigo Based Molecular Motor Rotation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the thermal behavior of light driven molecular motors is fundamentally important for their future rational design. In many molecular motors thermal ratcheting steps are comprised of helicity inversions, energetically stabilizing the initial photoproducts. In this work we investigated a series of five hemithioindigo (HTI) based molecular motors to reveal the influence of steric hindrance in close proximity to the rotation axle on this process. Applying a high yielding synthetic procedure, we synthesized constitutional isomeric derivatives to distinguish between substitution effects at the aromatic and aliphatic position on the rotor fragment. The kinetics of thermal helix inversions were elucidated using low temperature&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy and an&#160;in situ&#160;irradiation technique. In combination with a detailed theoretical description, a comparative analysis of substituent effects on the thermal helix inversions of the rotation cycle is now possible. Such deeper understanding of the rotational cycle of HTI molecular motors is essential for speed regulation and future applications of visible light triggered nanomachines.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Mechanism of Au&#8208;catalyzed Enynamide&#8208;Yne Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions: An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold&#8208;catalyzed dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of ynamide derivatives allows for an efficient access to a variety of  N  &#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles. A dual gold catalysis mechanism was postulated for transformations involving the formation of C&#8208;C bonds by reaction between a terminal alkyne and an enynamide fragment. In the present article, we report our complete experimental and computational investigations on the mechanism of such a transformation. Support for a dual gold catalysis has been found and it was shown that the concerted or stepwise nature of the cyclization event depends on the substitution of the ynamide moiety. The reaction was found to proceed in 3 stages: 1) formation of a &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex from the terminal alkyne, 2) cyclization to produce a  gem  &#8208;diaurated aryl complex, and 3) catalyst transfer to free the product and regenerate the &#963;,&#960;&#8208;digold complex.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein we reported the electrochemical hydroboration of alkynes using B  2  Pin  2  &#160;as the boron source.&#160; This unprecedented reaction manifold was applied to a broad range of alkynes, giving the hydroboration products in good to excellent yields without the need of a metal catalyst or a hydride source. This transformation relied on the the possible electrochemical oxidation of an&#160;  in situ  &#160;formed borate. This anodic oxidation performed in an undivided cell allowed the formation of a putative boryl radical, which reacted on the alkyne.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Disaccharides in Water: Preorganized Macrocyclic or Adaptive Acyclic?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When facing the dilemma of following a preorganized or adaptive design approach in conceiving the architecture of new biomimetic receptors for carbohydrates, shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic structures were most often chosen to achieve effective recognition of neutral saccharides in water. In contrast, acyclic architectures have been seldom explored, even though potentially simpler and more easily accessible. In this work, comparison of the binding properties of two structurally related diaminocarbazolic receptors, featuring a macrocyclic and an acyclic tweezers&#8208;shaped architecture, highlighted the advantages provided by the acyclic receptor in terms of selectivity in the recognition of 1,4&#8208;disaccharides of biological interest. Selective recognition of GlcNAc  2  , the core fragment of N&#8208;glycans exposed on the surface of enveloped viruses, stands as an emblematic example. NMR spectroscopic data and molecular modeling calculations were used to ascertain the differences in binding mode and to shed light on the origin of recognition efficacy and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Owing to their highly designable and tunable features, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively investigated and developed in a wide range of applications. However, due to their crystalline nature, poor manipulation and processability restrict their practical implementation. In this context, the development of membranous MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid materials is an effective approach to address these shortcomings. This minireview provides a systematic overview on the construction of MOF&#8208;polymer hybrid membranes and emphasizes their functions, including separation, ion conduction, and sensing, and points out a perspective on their future directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Fine Ligand Substitution Modification of the Isocyanidometal Bridge on Metal to Metal Charge Transfer Properties in Class II&#8208;III Mixed Valence Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of Class II&#8208;III mixed valence complexes have been an interesting topic due to their special intermediate behavior between localized and delocalized mixed valence complexes. To investigate the influence of the isocyanidometal bridge on metal to metal charge transfer (MMCT) properties, a family of new isocyanidometal&#8208;bridged complexes and their one&#8208;electron oxidation products cis&#8208;[Cp(dppe)Fe&#8208;CN&#8208;Ru(L)2&#8208;NC&#8208;Fe(dppe)Cp][PF6]n  (n = 2, 3) (Cp = 1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene, dppe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, L = 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine (bpy,  1[PF6]n), 5,5'&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl (5,5'&#8208;dmbpy,  2[PF6]n) and 4,4'&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl (4,4'&#8208;dmbpy,  3[PF6]n)) have been synthesized and fully characterized.&#160;The experimental results suggest that all the one&#8208;electron oxidation products may belong to Class II&#8208;III mixed valence complexes, supported by TDDFT calculations. With the change of the substituents of the bipyridyl ligand on the Ru center from H, 5,5'&#8208;dimethyl to 4,4'&#8208;dimethyl, the energy of MMCT for the one&#8208;electron oxidation complexes changes in the order:  13+  &lt;  23+  &lt;  33+  , and that for the two&#8208;electron oxidation complexes decreases in the order  14+  &gt;  34+  &gt;  24+  . The &#160;potential splitting (&#916;E1/2(2)) between the two terminal Fe centers for  N[PF6]2  are the largest potential splitting for the cyanido&#8208;bridged complexes reported so far. This work shows that the smaller potential difference between the bridging and the terminal metal centers would result in the more delocalized mixed valence complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Cs4B4O3F10: First Fluorooxoborate with [BF4] involving Heteroanionic Units and Extremely Low Melting Point</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a new congruently melting mixed&#8208;anion compound Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  has been characterized as the first fluorooxoborate with [BF  4  ] involving heteroanionic units. Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  possesses two highly fluorinated anionic clusters and therefore its formula can be expressed as Cs  3  (B  3  O  3  F  6  )&#183;Cs(BF  4  ). The influence of [BF  4  ] units on micro&#8208;symmetry and structural evolution was discussed based on the parent compound. More importantly, Cs  4  B  4  O  3  F  10  shows the lowest melting point among all the available borates and thus sets a new record for such system. This work is of great significance to enrich and tailor the structure of borates using perfluorinated [BF  4  ] units.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Spirobiacridine&#8208;based Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for High&#8208;performance Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, researchers have focused on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) for efficient future lighting and displays. Among TADF emitters, a combination of triazine and acridine is a promising candidate for realizing high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). However, simultaneous development of perfect horizontal orientation (&#920;  &#160;  = 100%) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 40% is still challenging. Here, to obtain insights for further improvements of a triazine/acridine combination, we developed various asymmetric spirobiacridine (SBA)&#8208;based TADF emitters with a unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high &#920; ratio of over 80%. Furthermore, we studied the substitution effects of the triazine acceptor unit on the photophysical properties, including molecular orientations and OLED performance. The corresponding OLED exhibited sky&#8208;blue emission with a high EQE of over 30%.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired and Eco&#8208;friendly Synthesis of 3D Spongy Meso&#8208;Microporous Carbons from CO2 for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the spongy bone structures, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sponge&#8208;like carbons with meso&#8208;microporous structures are synthesized through one&#8208;step electro&#8208;reduction of CO  2  in molten carbonate Li  2  CO  3  &#8208;Na  2  CO  3  &#8208;K  2  CO  3  at 580&#176;C. SPC4&#8208;0.5 (spongy porous carbon obtained by electrolysis of CO  2  at 4 A for 0.5 h) is synthesized with the current efficiency of 96.9%. SPC4&#8208;0.5 possesses large electrolyte ion accessible surface area, excellent wettability and electronical conductivity, ensuring the fast and effective mass and charge transfer, which make it an advcanced supercapacitor electrode material. SPC4&#8208;0.5 exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 373.7 F g  &#8208;1  at 0.5 A g  &#8208;1  , excellent cycling stability (retaining 95.9 % of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ), as well as high energy density. The applications of SPC4&#8208;0.5 in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state flexible devices for energy storage and wearable piezoelectric sensor are investigated. Both devices show considerable capacitive performances. This work not only presents a controllable and facile synthetic route for the porous carbons but also provides a promising way for effective carbon reduction and green energy production.</dc:description>

         <title>Hollow POM@MOF&#8208;derived porous NiMo6@Co3O4 for superlative biothiol colorimetric detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing highly active and sensitive peroxidase mimics for  L  &#8208;cysteine (  L  &#8208;Cys) colorimetric detection is very important for biotechnology and medical diagnosis. Herein, polyoxometalate&#8208;doped porous Co  3  O  4  composite (NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  ) was designed and prepared for the first time. Compared with pure and commercial Co  3  O  4  , NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (n) composites exhibit the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities and stabilities due to the strong synergistic effect between porous Co  3  O  4  and multi&#8208;electron NiMo  6  clusters. Moreover, the peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (n) composites are heavily dependent on the doping mass of NiMo  6  , and the optimized NiMo  6  @Co  3  O  4  (2) exhibits the superlative peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. More importantly, a sensitive  L  &#8208;Cys colorimetric detection is developed with the sensitivity of 0.023 &#956;M  &#8208;1  and the detection limit at least 0.018 &#956;M in the linear range of 1&#8722;20 &#956;M, which is by far the best enzyme&#8208;mimetic performances, to the best our knowledge.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Nanosheets Stacked Hierarchical &#8220;Honey Stick&#8208;like&#8221; MFI Zeolite by Aromatic Heterocyclic Dual&#8208;functional Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soft template designing is the most promised strategy for synthesis of zeolites nanosheets. So far, MFI nanosheets directed by soft templates (containing long chain alkyl groups or aromatic groups as hydrophobic component), can be found frequently. However, the MFI nanosheets synthesized by soft template with aromatic heterocycle groups (e.g. s&#8208;triazine groups) are rare. Herein, nanosheets stacked hierarchical MFI zeolite (NSHM) has been synthesized utilizing a triply branched s&#8208;triazine based surfactant as a bifunctional organic structure&#8208;directing agent. On the basis of geometrical match relationship, a formation model has been proposed. Synthesized NSHM was endowed with abundant mesopores stacked by nanosheets and exhibited a high surface area (430 m  2  &#8236;&#183;g  &#8208;1  ). The 1 wt% Pd/NSHM attained a significant increase in cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone mixture yield (from 66% to 85%) in oxidation of cyclohexane compared with Silicalite&#8208;1 and SBA&#8208;15 as supports.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing Bright GFP&#8208;Like Fluorogens for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging with Nonpolar Protein&#8208;Chromophore Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence&#8208;activating proteins (FAPs) that bind a chromophore and activate its fluorescence have gained popularity in bioimaging. The fluorescence&#8208;activating and absorption&#8208;shifting tag (FAST) is a light&#8208;weight FAP that enables fast reversible fluorogen binding, thus advancing multiplex and super&#8208;resolution imaging. However, the rational design of FAST&#8208;specific fluorogens with large fluorescence enhancement (FE) remains challenging. Here, we report a novel fluorogen directly engineered from green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore by a unique double&#8208;donor&#8208;one&#8208;acceptor strategy, which exhibits an over 550&#8208;fold FE upon FAST binding and a high extinction coefficient of ~100,000 M  &#8722;1  &#183;cm  &#8722;1  . Correlation analysis of the excited state nonradiative decay rates and environmental factors reveal that the large FE is caused by nonpolar protein&#8208;fluorogen interactions. Our deep insights into structure&#8208;function relationships could guide the rational design of bright fluorogens for live&#8208;cell imaging with extended spectral properties such as redder emissions.</dc:description>

         <title>Consequences of amide connectivity in the supramolecular polymerization of porphyrins: spectroscopic observations rationalized by theoretical modelling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The correlation between molecular structure and mechanism of supramolecular polymerizations is a topic of great interest, with a special focus on the pathway complexity of porphyrin assemblies. Their cooperative polymerization typically yields highly ordered, long 1D polymers and is driven by a combination of &#960;&#8208;stacking due to solvophobic effects and hydrogen bonding interactions. Subtle changes in molecular structure, however, have significant influence on the cooperativity factor and yield different aggregate types (J&#8208; versus H&#8208;aggregates) of different lengths. In this study we investigate the influence of amide connectivity on the self&#8208;assembly behavior of porphyrin based supramolecular monomers. While in apolar solvents C=O centered monomers readily assemble into helical supramolecular polymers via a cooperative mechanism, their NH centered counterparts form short, non&#8208;helical J&#8208;type aggregates via an isodesmic pathway. With a combination of spectroscopy and density functional theory modelling, we shed light on the molecular origins causing this stunning difference in assembly properties and demonstrate the importance of molecular connectivity in the design of supramolecular systems. Finally, we present their mutual interference in copolymerization experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Endohedral Mixed Aggregates: Sodium Alkoxide Cages with Organic or Inorganic Central Anions and Variable Hull</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali metal alkoxides are widely used in chemistry due to their Br&#248;nsted basic and nucleophilic properties. Potassium alkoxides assist alkyllithium in the metalation of hydrocarbons in Lochmann&#8208;Schlosser&#8208;bases. Both compounds form mixed aggregates, which enhance the thermal stability, solubility, and the basic reactivity of these mixtures. A very unusual spherical mixed alkoxy aggregate was discovered by Gr&#252;tzmacher et al., where a central dihydrogen phosphide anion is surrounded by a highly dynamic shell of thirteen sodium atoms and a hull of twelve tert &#8208;butoxide groups. This structural motif can be reproduced by a reaction of trimethylsilyl compounds of methane, halogens, or pseudo&#8208;halogens with excess sodium tert &#8208;butoxide. A nucleophilic substitution releases the corresponding anion, which is then encapsulated by the sodium alkoxide units. The compounds are soluble in hydrocarbon solvents, enabling studies of solutions by high resolution NMR spectroscopy and IR/Raman studies of the crystalline materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Organic Polysulfides from Disulfides via Sulfur Insertion from S8 and an Unexpected Solvent Effect on the Product Distribution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical synthesis of organic polysulfides via sulfur insertion from elemental sulfur to disulfides or thiols was introduced. The highly economic, insensitive and low&#8208;priced reaction gives a mixture of polysulfides, whose distribution can be influenced by the addition of different amounts of carbon disulfide as co&#8208;solvent. To describe the variable distribution function of the polysulfides, a novel parameter, the &#8220;  absorbance average  s  ulfur  a  mount in  p  olysulfides&#8221; (SAP) was introduced and defined on the basis of the &#8220;number average molar mass&#8221; used in polymer chemistry. Various organic polysulfides were synthesized with variable volume fractions of carbon disulfide and the yield of each polysulfide was determined by quantitative  13  C NMR. Also, by using two symmetrical disulfides or a disulfide and a thiol as starting materials, a mixture of symmetrical and unsymmetrical polysulfides was obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Difluoroglycine Derivatives from Amines, Difluorocarbene, and CO2: Computational Design, Scope, and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A three&#8208;component reaction (3CR) for the synthesis of difluoroglycine derivatives has been achieved using amines, difluorocarbene (generated  in situ  ), and the abundant, inexpensive, and non&#8208;toxic C1 source CO  2  . Various  tert  &#8208;amines and pyridine, (iso)quinoline, imidazole, thiazole, and pyrazole derivatives were incorporated, and the corresponding products were isolated in solid form without purification using column chromatography on silica gel. Detailed reaction profiles of the 3CR were obtained via computational analysis using DFT calculations, and the results critically suggest that simple ammonia is not applicable to this reaction. In addition, strongly supported by computational predictions, a new reagent that can generate difluorocarbene at 0 &#176;C without any additives was discovered. Furthermore, radical substitution reactions of the obtained difluoroglycine derivatives under photoredox conditions, as well as a synthetic application as an  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand are shown.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction of  in situ  generated arynes with stannylated imines to provide  ortho  &#8208;stannyl&#8208;aniline derivatives is reported. The readily prepared trimethylstannyl benzophenone imine is introduced as an efficient reagent to realize the aryne &#963;&#8208;insertion reaction. The imine functionality is an established N&#8208;protecting group and insertions proceed with good yields and good to excellent regioselectivities. The product anilines are valuable starting materials for follow&#8208;up chemistry thanks to the rich chemistry offered by the trimethylstannyl moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Building an Iron Chromophore Incorporating Prussian Blue Analogue for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The replacement of traditional ruthenium&#8208;based photosensitizers with low&#8208;cost and abundant iron analogs is a key step for the advancement of scalable and sustainable dye&#8208;sensitized water splitting cells. Herein this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we utilize a pyridinium ligand coordinated pentacyanoferrate(II) chromophore to construct a cyanide&#8208;based CoFe extended bulk framework, in which the iron photosensitizer units are connected to cobalt water oxidation catalytic sites through cyanide linkers. The iron&#8208;sensitized photoanode exhibits exceptional stability for at least 5 hours at pH 7 and features its photosensitizing ability with an incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion capacity up to 500 nm with nanosecond scale excited state lifetime. Ultrafast transient absorption and computational studies reveal that iron and cobalt sites mutually support each other for charge separation via short bridging cyanide groups and for injection to the semiconductor in our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept photoelectrochemical device. The reorganization of the excited states due to the mixing of electronic states of metal&#8208;based orbitals subsequently tailor the electron transfer cascade during the photoelectrochemical process. This breakthrough in chromophore&#8208;catalyst assemblies will spark interest in dye&#8208;sensitization with robust bulk systems for photoconversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;transfer Dynamics of Photoacidic Merocyanines in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacids attract increasing scientific attention, as they are valuable tools to spatiotemporally control proton&#8208;release reactions and pH values of solutions. We present the first time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic study of the excited state and proton&#8208;release dynamics of prominent merocyanine representatives. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements of a pyridine merocyanine with two distinct protonation sites revealed dissimilar proton&#8208;release mechanisms: one site acts as a photoacid generator as its pK  a  value is modulated in the ground state after photoisomerization, while the other functions as an excited state photoacid which releases its proton within 1.1 ps. With a pK  a  drop of 8.7 units to &#8208;5.5 upon excitation, the latter phenolic site is regarded a super&#8208;photoacid. The 6&#8208;nitro derivative exhibits only a phenolic site with similar, yet slightly less photoacidic characteristics and both compounds transfer their proton to methanol and ethanol. In contrast, for the related 6,8&#8208;dinitro compound an intramolecular proton transfer to the  ortho  &#8208;nitro group is suggested that is involved in a rapid relaxation into the ground state.</dc:description>

         <title>Inherent Ethyl Acetate Selectivity in a&#160;Trianglimine Molecular Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethyl acetate is an important chemical raw material and solvent. It is also a key volatile organic compound in the brewing industry and a marker for lung cancer. Materials that are highly selective toward ethyl acetate are needed for its separation and detection. Here, we report a trianglimine macrocycle ( TAMC ) that selectively adsorbs ethyl acetate by forming a solvate. Crystal structure prediction showed this to be the lowest energy solvate structure available. This solvate leaves a metastable, &#8216;templated&#8217; cavity after solvent removal. Adsorption and breakthrough experiments confirmed that imprinted TAMC has adequate adsorption kinetics to separate ethyl acetate from azeotropic mixtures with ethanol, which is a challenging and energy&#8208;intensive industrial separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structures of AlCr2 and MoSi2: Same Structure Type vs Different Bonding Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a joint effort utilizing modified sample preparation, microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and micro&#8208;fabrication, it became possible to prepare single crystals of the &#8220;hidden&#8221; phase AlCr  2  . High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis is described in detail for two crystals with the similar overall composition, but different degree of disorder, which seems to be the main cause for the differing unit cell parameters. Chemical bonding analysis of AlCr  2  in comparison to prototypical MoSi  2  shows pronounced differences reflecting the interchange of main group element vs. transition metal as majority component.</dc:description>

         <title>An Environmentally Friendly, Photochemical Access to [N^C^N]Au(III) Pincer Complexes by Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Starting from commercially available DMSAuCl and diazonium salts, cationic [N^C^N]Au(III) complexes were synthesized in a selective, photosensitizer&#8208;free, photochemical reaction by irradiation with blue LED light. This new protocol represents the first easy synthesis of these types of pincer&#8208;complexes in moderate to excellent yield starting from a readily available gold(I) precursor with nitrogen as the only byproduct. Owing to the disadvantages of known protocols, especially the toxicity in case of a transmetallation with mercury or the necessity for a mostly twofold excess of a gold precursor, this method offers an attractive alternative towards this kind of gold(III) complexes. In addition, the first arylated [N^C^N]Au(III) pincer&#8208;complex was synthesized by using this technology.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;Hydride Shifts &#8211; What controls Guaiane Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A systematic computational study addressing the entire chemical space of guaianes in conjunction with an analysis of all known compounds shows that 1,3&#8208;hydride shifts are rare events in guaiane biosynthesis. As demonstrated here, 1,3&#8208;hydride shifts towards guaianes can only be realized for two stereochemically well defined out of numerous possible stereoisomeric skeletons. One example is given by the mechanism of guaia&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase from California poplar, an enzyme that yields guaiane sesquiterpenes with unusual stereochemical properties. The generalizing results from DFT calculations were experimentally verified through isotopic labeling experiments with guaia&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Guanidine&#8208;Based Hybrid Perovskite with Strong Dichroism for Multiwavelength Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites, benefiting from their natural anisotropy of quantum&#8208;well motifs and optical properties, have shown remarkable polarization&#8208;dependent responses superior to the 3D counterparts. Here, for the first time, we fabricated the multiwavelength polarization&#8208;sensitive detectors using single crystals of a guanidine&#8208;based 2D hybrid perovskite, (BA)  2  (GA)Pb  2  I  7  (where BA  +  is  n  &#8208;butylammonium and GA  +  is guanidium). Its unique 2D quantum&#8208;well structure results in strong crystallographic&#8208;dependence of optical absorption. Strikingly, our crystal&#8208;based photodetector exhibits a prominent photocurrent dichroic ratio (  I  max  /  I  min  ) of ~2.2 at 520 nm, higher than the typical 2D inorganic materials (GeSe, ~1.09, PdSe  2  , ~1.8). Besides, notable dichroic ratios of 1.29 and 1.23 at 405 nm and 637 nm are also created for the multiwavelength polarized&#8208;light detection. The prominent detecting performances, including low dark current (1.6&#215;10  &#8208;11  A), considerable on/off ratio (~2&#215;10  3  ), high photodetectivity (~3.3&#215;10  11  Jones) and responsivity (~12.01 mA&#183;W  &#8208;1  ), make (BA)  2  (GA)Pb  2  I  7  a promising candidate for polarized&#8208;light detection. This work sheds light on the rational engineering of new 2D hybrid perovskites for the high&#8208;performance optoelectronic device applications.</dc:description>

The prominent detecting performances, including low dark current (1.6&#215;10  &#8208;11  A), considerable on/off ratio (~2&#215;10  3  ), high photodetectivity (~3.3&#215;10  11  Jones) and responsivity (~12.01 mA&#183;W  &#8208;1  ), make (BA)  2  (GA)Pb  2  I  7  a promising candidate for polarized&#8208;light detection. This work sheds light on the rational engineering of new 2D hybrid perovskites for the high&#8208;performance optoelectronic device applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Enzyme Design without Structural Knowledge: A Sequence&#8208;Based Approach for Efficient Generation of Transglycosylases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycobiology is dogged by the relative scarcity of synthetic, defined oligosaccharides. Enzyme&#8208;catalysed glycosylation using glycoside hydrolases is feasible but is hampered by the innate hydrolytic activity of these enzymes. Protein engineering is useful to remedy this, but it usually requires prior structural knowledge of the target enzyme, and/or relies on extensive, time&#8208;consuming screening and analysis. Here we describe a straightforward strategy that involves rational rapid  in silico  analysis of protein sequences. The method pinpoints 6&#8210;12 single mutant candidates to improve transglycosylation yields. Requiring very little prior knowledge of the target enzyme other than its sequence, the method is generic and procures catalysts for the formation of glycosidic bonds involving various  d  /  l  &#8208;, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;pyranosides or furanosides, and  exo  &#8208; and  endo  &#8208;action. Moreover, mutations validated in one enzyme can be transposed to others, even distantly related enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic DNA&#8208; and protein&#8208;based recognition promote an RNA&#8208;templated bio&#8208;orthogonal reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomolecular assemblies composed of proteins and oligonucleotides play a central role in biological processes. While in nature, oligonucleotides and proteins usually assemble via non&#8208;covalent interactions, synthetic conjugates have been developed which covalently link both modalities. The resulting peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide conjugates have facilitated novel biological applications as well as the design of functional supramolecular systems and materials. However, despite the importance of concerted protein/oligonucleotide recognition in nature, conjugation approaches have barely utilized the synergistic recognition abilities of such complexes. Herein, we report the structure&#8208;based design of peptide&#8208;DNA conjugates which bind RNA through Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing combined with peptide&#8208;mediated major groove recognition. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics have been designed to adjacently bind a particular RNA sequence. In the resulting ternary complex, their peptide elements are located in proximity, a feature that was used to enable an RNA&#8208;templated click reaction. The introduced structure&#8208;based design approach opens the door to novel functional biomolecular assemblies.</dc:description>
