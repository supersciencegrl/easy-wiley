      <title>Synthesis of asparagine derivatives harboring a Lewis X type DC&#8208;SIGN ligand and evaluation of their impact on immunomodulation in multiple sclerosis</title>
      <dc:description>The protein myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a key component of myelin and an autoantigen in the disease multiple sclerosis (MS). The posttranslational N&#8208;glycosylation of Asn31 of MOG seems to play a key role in modulating the immune response towards myelin. This is mediated by the interaction of Lewis type glycan structures on the N&#8208;glycan of MOG to the DC&#8208;SIGN receptor on dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we report the synthesis of an unnatural Lewis X (LeX) containing Fmoc&#8208;SPPS compatible asparagine building block, as well as asparagine building blocks containing two LeX derived oligosaccharides: LacNAc and Fuc&#945;1&#8208;3GlcNAc. These building blocks were utilized for the synthesis of glycosylated MOG (MOG31&#8208;55) and were analyzed with respect to their ability to bind to DC&#8208;SIGN in different biological setups, as well as their ability to inhibit the citrullination induced aggregation of MOG31&#8208;55. Finally, a cytokine secretion assay was carried out on human moDCs, showing the ability of a neoglycopeptide decorated with a single LeX to alter the balance of pro&#8208; and antiinflammatory cytokines, inducing a tolerogenic response.</dc:description>

      <title>Similarities and differences between crystal and enzyme environmental effects on the electron density of drug molecules</title>

      <dc:description>Stabilization of DNA is beneficial for many applications in the fields of DNA therapeutics, diagnostics and material science. Now, this phenomenon is studied on heterochiral DNA, an autonomous DNA recognition system with complementary strands in &#945;&#8208;D and &#946;&#8208;D configuration showing parallel strand orientation. 12&#8208;mer heterochiral duplexes were constructed from anomeric (&#945;/&#946;&#8208;D) oligonucleotide single&#8208;strands. Purine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza&#8208;7&#8208;bromopurine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleosides having the capability to form tridentate base pairs with dT were used to strengthen the stability of the dA&#8208;dT base pair. Tm data and thermodynamic values obtained from UV melting profiles indicated that the 8&#8208;aza&#8208;7&#8208;deaza 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside decorated with a bromo substituent is so far the most efficient stabilizer for heterochiral DNA.

      <title>Aromaticity Survival in Hydrofullerenes: The Case of C66H4 with its &#960;&#8208;Aromatic Circuits</title>
      <dc:description>The isolated&#8208;pentagon rule (IPR) is a determining structural feature accounting for hollow fullerene stabilization and properties related to Cn (n &#8805; 60) cages. The recent characterization of an unprecedented non&#8208;IPR hydrofullerene, C2v&#8208;C66H4, bearing two heptagons with adjacent fused&#8208;pentagons motif, largely dismiss this feature. Herein, employing DFT calculations, we explore the 13C&#8208;NMR pattern and aromatic behavior of C2v&#8208;C66H4. Our results show the presence of three &#960;&#8208;aromatic circuits at the bottom boat section of C66H4 indicating the unique features of this hydrofullerene in comparison to pristine C60. In addition, under specific orientations of the external field, certain &#960;&#8208;aromatic circuits are enabled, resulting in a more aromatic fullerene than C60, but lower in comparison to the spherical aromatic C606&#8208; fulleride. Noteworthy, under a field&#8208;aligned along with the saturated carbon atoms, non&#8208;aromatic characteristics are exposed. This reveals that spherical&#8208;like cages can involve a complex magnetic response that heavily depends on the orientation of the applied field.</dc:description>

In addition, under specific orientations of the external field, certain &#960;&#8208;aromatic circuits are enabled, resulting in a more aromatic fullerene than C60, but lower in comparison to the spherical aromatic C606&#8208; fulleride. Noteworthy, under a field&#8208;aligned along with the saturated carbon atoms, non&#8208;aromatic characteristics are exposed. This reveals that spherical&#8208;like cages can involve a complex magnetic response that heavily depends on the orientation of the applied field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Make it switch: By combining the versatile electrochemical behavior of cobalt&#8208;based metallacarboranes with the excellent emission properties of perylenediimides, new fluorescent molecular switches were prepared that respond to redox stimuli. These systems not only surpass the performance of previous switches based on other metal complexes, but also allow the preparation of supramolecular fluorescent gels by taking advantage of the self&#8208;assembly capabilities of their constituting units.

      <title>Attempts to Synthesize a Thiirane, Selenirane, and Thiirene by Dealkylation of Chalcogeniranium and Thiirenium Salts</title>
      <dc:description>
The Apollonian spirit of art and knowledge flows over the ancient house on Delos. However, even these forces cannot bridge the difference in reactivity: Thiiranium ions [Ad2SCH2CH2SiMe3]+ are fragmented by the fluoride ion to form thiirane Ad2S, Me3SiF, and C2H4 through attack on Si. In the case of seleniranium ions [Ad2SeCH2CH2SiMe3]+, the attack of the fluoride ion takes place on the Se and the three&#8208;membered ring is cleaved. Reaction products are the alkene Ad=Ad and the unstable selenenyl fluoride Me3SiCH2CH2SeF, but no selenirane Ad2Se are formed. We thank Harald Hirsch, Potsdam, for his help with the picture design. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Poleschner and K. Seppelt. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003461).

A facile way of accessing the second lone pair of carbodicarbene through &#8220;turn off&#8221; of the &#960;&#8208;accepting ability of the flanking NHC is reported. The formation of gem&#8208;double dative bimetallic of carbodicarbene from versatile mononuclear Pd and Ni complexes contributes to serve as a paradigm shift away from relying on traditionally tedious synthetic methods to access the second &#8220;hidden&#8221; lone pair.

      <dc:description>
A new class of DNA intercalating metallodrug is reported. These agents contain a polypyridyl caging ligand called DPA which is bound to a copper ion ligated to a phenanthrene (Phen) DNA intercalator. The lead agent is Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;DPPZ and it can recognize the minor groove of G&#8211;C rich DNA sequences and displays promising activity against several pancreatic cancer cell lines. The graphic shows the Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;DPPZ complex intercalating the minor groove of a G&#8211;C DNA sequence taken from the protein data bank (2ANA). The modeling was completed using PyMOL together with the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the complex. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Kellett et&#8197;al.

      <title>Ni[B2(SO4)4] and Co[B2(SO4)4]: Unveiling Systematic Trends in Phyllosilicate Analogue Borosulfates</title>
      <dc:description>
Borosulfates &#8211; structurally analogue to silicates: Ni[B2(SO4)4] and Co[B2(SO4)4] are two new borosulfates with phyllosilicate&#8208;like topology. While the anionic subunits of both structures are homeotypic, the positions of the cations differ. NiII cations are located between the layers, while the CoII cations are embedded within. By means of in silico investigation of other borosulfates with divalent cations, trends in phyllosilicate analogues are uncovered and lead to the prediction of new species.

      <title>Twofold C&#8211;H Activation Enables Synthesis of a Diazacoronene&#8208;type Fluorophore with Near Infrared Emission through Isosteric Replacement</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis and photophysical properties of a soluble amide&#8208;embedded coronene is reported. The key step in this synthesis is the twofold C&#8211;H activation of diazaperylene by a rhodium(III)Cp* catalyst. This unprecedented structural motif shows intense fluorescence in the near infrared region with a small Stokes shift and a distinct vibronic structure, which exhibits a slight extent of negative solvatochromism. Comparison of this compound with some relevant compounds revealed the importance of the amide incorporation in the peripheral concave region including an angular position to retain high aromaticity reflecting that of parent coronene. Treatment of this compound with Lewis acid B(C6F5)3  formed a bis&#8208;adduct, which exhibited enhanced aromaticity as a consequence of the increased double bond character of the amide C&#8211;N bonds.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical C&#8211;H Amidation of Heteroarenes with N&#8208;Alkyl Sulfonamides in Aqueous Medium</title>
      <dc:description>The construction of C&#8211;N bonds by free radical reactions represents a powerful synthetic approach for direct C&#8211;H amidations of arenes or heteroarenes. Developing efficient and more environmentally&#8208;friendly synthetic methods for C&#8211;H amidation reactions remains highly desirable. Herein, metal&#8208;free electrochemical oxidative dehydrogenative C&#8211;H amidations of heteroarenes with N &#8208;alkylsulfonamides have been accomplished. The catalyst&#8208; and chemical oxidant&#8208;free C&#8211;H amidation features an ample scope, and employes electricity as the green and sole oxidant. A variety of heteroarenes, including indoles, pyrroles, benzofuran and benzothiophene, thereby underwent this C(sp 2 )&#8211;H nitrogenation. Cyclic voltammetry studies and control experiments provided evidence for nitrogen&#8208;centered radicals being directly generated under metal&#8208;free electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Strong Equatorial Crystal Field Enhances the Axial Anisotropy and Energy Barrier for Spin Reversal Process in Yb2 SMMs</title>
      <dc:description>The importance of equatorial crystal fields on magnetic anisotropy of ytterbium SMMs is observed for the first time. Herein, we report three similar dinuclear ytterbium complexes of formula [Yb  2  (3&#8208;OMe&#8208;L)  2  (DMF)  2  (NO  3  )  2  ]&#183;DMF (  1  ), [Yb  2  (3&#8208;H&#8208;L)  2  (DMF)  2  (NO  3  )  2  ]&#183;DMF&#183;H  2  O (  2  ) and [Yb  2  (3&#8208;NO  3  &#8208;L)  2  (DMF)  2  (NO  3  )  2  ] (  3  ), [where 3&#8208;X&#8208;H  2  L= N'&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;X&#8208;benzylidene)picolinohydrazide, X = OMe(  1  ), H(  2  ) NO  2  (  3  )]. The detailed magnetic measurements display the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interaction between the Yb centers and field induced slow relaxation of magnetization in all the complexes.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The importance of equatorial crystal fields on magnetic anisotropy of ytterbium SMMs is observed for the first time. Herein, we report three similar dinuclear ytterbium complexes of formula [Yb  2  (3&#8208;OMe&#8208;L)  2  (DMF)  2  (NO  3  )  2  ]&#183;DMF (  1  ), [Yb  2  (3&#8208;H&#8208;L)  2  (DMF)  2  (NO  3  )  2  ]&#183;DMF&#183;H  2  O (  2  ) and [Yb  2  (3&#8208;NO  3  &#8208;L)  2  (DMF)  2  (NO  3  )  2  ] (  3  ), [where 3&#8208;X&#8208;H  2  L= N'&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;X&#8208;benzylidene)picolinohydrazide, X = OMe(  1  ), H(  2  ) NO  2  (  3  )]. The detailed magnetic measurements display the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interaction between the Yb centers and field induced slow relaxation of magnetization in all the complexes. The higher energy barrier for spin reversal was observed for complex  1  (U  eff  = 50 K) and it dercreases in the order of  2  (47 K) to  3  (40 K).

      <title>Enhancing magnetic communication between metal centres: the role of s&#8208;tetrazine based radicals as ligands</title>
      <dc:description>Although 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines or  s  &#8208;tetrazines have been known in the literature for more than a century, their coordination chemistry has become increasingly popular in recent years due to their unique redox activity, multiple binding sites and their various applications. The electron&#8208;poor character of the ring and stabilization of the radical anion through all four nitrogen atoms in their metal complexes provide new aspects in molecular magnetism towards the synthesis of new high performing Single Molecule Magnets (SMMs). The scope of this review is to examine the role of  s  &#8208;tetrazine radical ligands in transition metal and lanthanide based SMMs and provide a critical overview of the progress thus far in this field. As well, general synthetic routes and new insights for the preparation of  s  &#8208;tetrazines are discussed, along with their redox activity and applications in various fields. Concluding remarks along with the limitations and perspectives of these ligands are discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Dithieno[a,e]pentalenes: Highly Antiaromatic Yet Stable &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems without Bulky Substituents</title>
      <dc:description>Dithieno[a,e]penalenes (DTPs) with various substituents were synthesized as a class of antiaromatic compounds. Annulation of thiophene rings imparts the pentalene moiety with high thermal stability even without bulky substituents, while retaining antiaromaticity. The higher magnitude of antiaromaticity in DTPs, in addition to the differences in the electronic structures of the fused aromatic rings, resulted in a narrower HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap than that of the corresponding dibenzo[a,e]pentalene analog, giving rise to red&#8208;shifted electronic absorption that reaches the near&#8208;infrared region. Moreover, systematic investigations on the solid&#8208;state packing structure revealed that DTPs prefer offset face&#8208;to&#8208;face packing motifs rather than face&#8208;centered &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. In particular, the thienyl&#8208;substituted DTP bearing hydrophilic side chains exhibited thermochromic behavior in polar solvents, which was ascribed to the formation of aggregates.</dc:description>

      <title>Quantification of Non&#8208;covalent Interactions in Azide&#8208;Pnictogen, &#8208;Chalcogen, and &#8208;Halogen Contacts</title>
      <dc:description>The non&#8208;covalent interaction between azide and oxygen containing moieties is investigated by a computational study based on&#160; experimental findings. Targeted synthesis of organic compounds with close intramolecular azide&#8208;oxygen contacts yielded six new representatives, for which X&#8208;ray structures were determined. Two of those compounds were investigated with respect to their potential conformations in the gas&#8208;phase and a possible significantly short azide&#8208;oxygen contact. Furthermore, a set of 44 high&#8208;quality gas&#8208;phase computational model systems with intermolecular azide&#8208;pnictogen (N, P, As, Sb), chalcogen (O, S, Se, Te), and &#8208;halogen (F, Cl, Br, I) contacts is compiled and investigated by semi&#8208;empirical quantum mechanical methods, density functional approximations and wave function theory. A local energy decomposition analysis is applied to study the nature of the non&#8208;covalent interaction. The special role of electrostatic and London dispersion interactions is discussed in detail. London dispersion is identified as a dominant factor of the&#160;azide&#8208;donor interaction with mean London dispersion energyinteraction energy ratios of 1.3. Electrostatic contributions enhance the azide&#8208;donor coordination motif. The association energies range from &#8208; 1.00 to &#8208; 5.5 kcal &#183; mol  &#8208; 1  .</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Morpholine&#8208;Based Analogs of (&#8722;)&#8208;Zampanolide and Their Biological Activity</title>

The synthesis of the common functionalized morpholine building block involved two consecutive epoxide openings with tosylamide and the product of the first opening reaction, respectively, as nucleophiles.

      <title>Towards Photochromic Azobenzene&#8208;Based Inhibitors for Tryptophan Synthase</title>
      <dc:description>Light&#8208;regulation of drug molecules has gained growing interest in the fields of biochemical and pharmacological research in recent years. In addition, a serious need for novel molecular targets of antibiotics has emerged presently. Here, we present the development of a photo&#8208;controllable, azobenzene&#8208;based antibiotic precursor towards tryptophan synthase (TS), an essential metabolic multienzyme complex in bacteria. The compound exhibited a medium&#8208;strong inhibition of TS in its  E  configuration, and a 5&#8208;fold lower inhibition strength in its  Z  configuration. Using a combination of biochemical, crystallographic, and computational analyses we characterized the inhibition mode of this compound. Remarkably, binding of the inhibitor to a hitherto not considered cavity causes an unproductive conformation of TS leading to non&#8208;competitive inhibition of tryptophan production. In conclusion, we created a promising lead compound for the combat of bacterial diseases, which targets an essential metabolic enzyme, and whose inhibition strength can be controlled with light.</dc:description>

The materials [FeL2][BF4]2&#183;solv (1[BF4]2&#183;solv) and [FeL2][ClO4]2&#183;solv (1[ClO4]2&#183;solv; solv = MeNO2, MeCN or Me2CO) exhibit a variety of structures and spin&#8208;state behaviors including thermal spin&#8208;crossover (SCO). Solvent loss on heating  1[BF4]2&#183;xMeNO2&#160;(x  &#8776; 2.3) occurs in two steps. The intermediate phase exhibits hysteretic SCO around 250 K, involving a &#8220;reverse&#8208;SCO&#8221; step in its warming cycle at a scan rate of 5 Kmin&#8210;1. The reverse&#8208;SCO is not observed in a slower 1 Kmin&#8210;1  measurement, however, confirming its kinetic nature. The final product [FeL2][BF4]2&#183;0.75MeNO2  was crystallographically characterized, and shows abrupt but incomplete SCO at 172 K which correlates with disorder of an  L  ligand. The asymmetric unit of  1[BF4]2&#183;yMe2CO (y  &#8776; 1.6) contains five unique complex molecules, four of which undergo gradual SCO in at least two discrete steps. Low&#8208;spin  1[ClO4  ]2&#183;0.5Me2CO is not isostructural with its BF4&#8722;  congener, and undergoes single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal solvent loss with a tripling of the crystallographic unit cell volume, while retaining the  P  &#8208;1&#160;space group. Three other solvate salts undergo gradual thermal SCO. Two of these are isomorphous at room temperature, but transform to different low&#8208;temperature phases when the materials are fully low&#8208;spin.</dc:description>

The intermediate phase exhibits hysteretic SCO around 250 K, involving a &#8220;reverse&#8208;SCO&#8221; step in its warming cycle at a scan rate of 5 Kmin&#8210;1. The reverse&#8208;SCO is not observed in a slower 1 Kmin&#8210;1  measurement, however, confirming its kinetic nature. The final product [FeL2][BF4]2&#183;0.75MeNO2  was crystallographically characterized, and shows abrupt but incomplete SCO at 172 K which correlates with disorder of an  L  ligand. The asymmetric unit of  1[BF4]2&#183;yMe2CO (y  &#8776; 1.6) contains five unique complex molecules, four of which undergo gradual SCO in at least two discrete steps. Low&#8208;spin  1[ClO4  ]2&#183;0.5Me2CO is not isostructural with its BF4&#8722;  congener, and undergoes single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal solvent loss with a tripling of the crystallographic unit cell volume, while retaining the  P  &#8208;1&#160;space group. Three other solvate salts undergo gradual thermal SCO. Two of these are isomorphous at room temperature, but transform to different low&#8208;temperature phases when the materials are fully low&#8208;spin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The Comet assay was used to determine their ability to damage DNA, and results show dose dependent damage which correlates well with the cytotoxicity results.

      <title>Generation of oxidoreductases with dual alcohol dehydrogenase and amine dehydrogenase activity</title>
      <dc:description>The l&#8208;lysine&#8208;&#949;&#8208;dehydrogenase (LysEDH) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus naturally catalyzes the oxidative deamination of the &#949;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine. We previously engineered this enzyme to create amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) variants that possess a new hydrophobic cavity in their active site such that aromatic ketones can bind and be converted into &#945;&#8208;chiral amines with excellent enantioselectivity. We also recently observed that LysEDH was capable of reducing aromatic aldehydes into primary alcohols. Herein, we harnessed the promiscuous alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity of LysEDH to create new variants that exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for the reduction of substituted benzaldehydes and arylaliphatic aldehydes to primary alcohols. Notably, these novel engineered dehydrogenases also catalyzed the reductive amination of a variety of aldehydes and ketones with excellent enantioselectivity, thus exhibiting a dual AmDH/ADH activity. We envisioned that the catalytic bi&#8208;functionality of these enzymes could be applied for the direct conversion of alcohols into amines. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, we performed an unprecedented one&#8208;pot &#8220;hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8221; cascade to convert benzyl alcohol to benzylamine using a single enzyme. Conducting the same biocatalytic cascade in the presence of cofactor recycling enzymes (i.e., NADH&#8208;oxidase and formate dehydrogenase) increased the reaction yields.

      <title>Dynamic Helicates Self&#8208;Assembly from Homo&#8208; and Heterotopic Dynamic Covalent Ligand Strands</title>
      <dc:description>
Keep it dynamic: The dynamic nature of the helical systems offers an additional level of complexity by combining self&#8208;sorting on two levels: 1)&#8197;the build&#8208;up of the ligand strand constituents from their components through dynamic covalent chemistry; 2)&#8197;the assembly of the helicates from the ligands and the metal cations through dynamic metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry.







Abstract
The understanding and the application of reversible covalent reactions and coordination chemistry together with the proper design of the molecular frameworks, allow to achieve not only well&#8208;defined output architectures but also different grades of complex behavior. In this work, the dynamic nature of the helical systems offers an additional level of complexity by combining self&#8208;sorting on two levels: 1)&#8197;the build&#8208;up of the ligand strand constituents from their components through dynamic covalent chemistry; 2)&#8197;the assembly of the helicates from the ligands and the metal cations through dynamic metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry. The information encoded in the ligands constituent molecule was read differently (and accurately at the same time) by metal cations that varied in the coordination algorithms. It enabled the selective formation of a specific type of helicates from a wide library of helicates formed by the possible combination of subcomponents. Ligands containing dynamic tridentate and/or bidentate binding motifs in the same strand were studied to explore the helicates self&#8208;assembly with appropriate metal cations.

      <title>Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks on Flexible Carbon Paper for Electrocatalytic Nitrite Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrochemical conversion of toxic nitrite using thin film MOF: A thin film of metalloporphyrin MOF was deposited on Carbon Fiber Paper (CFP) for electrochemical oxidation of nitrite. Metalloporphyrinic MOFs with Ni2+ active species at porphyrin ligand provided the highest electrochemical performance with a current density of 950&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The reaction mechanism and role of the active metal species at the porphyrin ligand were elucidated by XANES and XPS techniques. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Kongpatpanich et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003206).

      <title>Combining Photodeprotection and Ligation into a Dual&#8208;Color Gated Reaction System</title>
      <dc:description>
Key wavelengths controlling a dual&#8208;gated one&#8208;pot reaction are paramount for the development of novel printing techniques. The visible&#8208;light gate activates the photocatalyzed deprotection of a dithioacetal leading to a o&#8208;methylbenzaldehyde. Upon the opening of the UV light gate, the o&#8208;methylbenzaldehyde undergoes a light&#8208;mediated Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with a dienophile. This dual&#8208;gated system represents a step closer to two&#8208;color wavelength&#8208;activated photoresists. More information can be found in the Communication by J.&#8197;P. Blinco, C.

      <title>Enhancement of Photocatalytic Activity for Hydrogen Production by Surface Modification of Pt&#8208;TiO2 Nanoparticles with a Double Layer of Photosensitizers</title>
      <dc:description>To investigate the effect of the surface structure of dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalyst nanoparticles, we prepared three types of Ru(II)&#8208;photosensitizer(PS)&#8208;double&#8208;layered Pt&#8208;cocatalyst&#8208;loaded TiO  2  nanoparticles with different surface structures, Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  ,  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  , and  RuCP  2  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  (  N  = 0.2, 1, and 5), and evaluated their photocatalytic H  2  evolution activity in the presence of redox&#8208;reversible iodide (I  &#8208;  ) as the electron donor. Although the driving force of the electron injection from I  &#8208;  to the photooxidized Ru(III) PS is comparable, the activity increased in the following order:  RuCP  2  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  &lt;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  &lt; Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  .

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To investigate the effect of the surface structure of dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalyst nanoparticles, we prepared three types of Ru(II)&#8208;photosensitizer(PS)&#8208;double&#8208;layered Pt&#8208;cocatalyst&#8208;loaded TiO  2  nanoparticles with different surface structures, Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  ,  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  , and  RuCP  2  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  (  N  = 0.2, 1, and 5), and evaluated their photocatalytic H  2  evolution activity in the presence of redox&#8208;reversible iodide (I  &#8208;  ) as the electron donor. Although the driving force of the electron injection from I  &#8208;  to the photooxidized Ru(III) PS is comparable, the activity increased in the following order:  RuCP  2  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  &amp;lt;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  &amp;lt; Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  . The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  in the first hour reached 1%.

      <dc:description>The chemistry of transition metal carbynes, LnM&#8801;CR, has historically been dominated by species bearing hydrocarbyl or amino &#8216;R&#8217; substituents, with other elements appearing only sporadically. In recent years carbynes and related &#8216;C1&#8217; species bearing other main&#8208;group substituents, particularly heavier elements of the p&#8208;block, have begun to emerge. This review details the chemistry of heavier pnictogen&#8208;functionalised C1 ligands, MCARn (A = P, As, Sb, Bi; n = 0&#8208;3), including their syntheses, properties and reactivities, and how these are distinguished from more traditional carbyne complexes. Recent developments in the closely related phosphaisonitrile, cya&#8208;phosphide and cya&#8208;arside ligands, LnM(C&#8801;A) (A = P, As), are also discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>A nanoprobe based on gated mesoporous silica nanoparticles for the selective and sensitive detection of benzene metabolite t,t&#8208;muconic acid in urine</title>

      <dc:description>A number of technologies would benefit from developing inorganic compounds and materials with specific electronic and magnetic exchange properties.

Substantial changes in the pre&#8208;edge peak intensities were observed that tracked with the V 3d&#8208;electron count. The data also suggested substantial delocalization between the vanadium cations. Meanwhile, the FeIII cations were electronically isolated from the polyoxovanadate core.</dc:description>

      <title>Photocontrolled DNA origami assembly using two photoswitches</title>
      <dc:description>Stimuli responsive switching molecules have been widely investigated for the purpose of mechanical control of biomolecules. The recently developed arylazopyrazole (AAP) shows photoisomerization activity, displaying faster response to light induced conformational change and unique absorption spectral properties different from the conventionally used azobenzene. Here, we demonstrate that AAP can be used as a photoswitching molecule to control photo&#8208;induced assembly and disassembly of DNA origami nanostructures. We designed and constructed AAP&#8208;modified DNA origami. We observed the repeated assembly and disassembly of AAP&#8208;modified X&#8208;shaped DNA origami and hexagonal origami with counterpart complementary strands using alternative UV and visible light irradiation. Closed and linear assemblies of AAP&#8208;modified X&#8208;shaped origami were successfully formed by photoirradiation, and more than 1 &#181;m linear assemblies were formed. Finally, we showed that the two photoswitches, AAP and azobenzene, can be used in tandem to independently control different assembly configurations using different irradiation wavelengths. AAP can extend the variety of available wavelengths of photoswitches and stably work for assembly and disassembly of various DNA origami nanostructures.</dc:description>

      <title>High Efficiency Sky&#8208;Blue Gold(III)&#8208;TADF Emitters</title>
      <dc:description>Highly efficient sky&#8208;blue luminescent gold(III) complexes with emission quantum yields up to 82%, lifetimes down to 0.67 &#956;s and emission peak maxima at 470&#8208;484 nm were prepared through a consideration of pincer gold(III) donor&#8208;acceptor complexes. Photophysical studies and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations revealed that the emission nature of these gold(III) complexes is most consistent with TADF. Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs with these gold(III) complexes as dopants afforded electroluminescence maxima at 465&#8208;473 nm with FWHM of 64&#8208;67 nm and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 15.25%. This research demonstrates the first example of gold(III)&#8208;OLEDs showing electroluminescence maxima smaller than 470 nm, and highlights the potential of using gold(III)&#8208;TADF emitters in the development of high efficiency blue OLEDs and blue emissive dopant in WOLEDs.</dc:description>

Photophysical studies and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations revealed that the emission nature of these gold(III) complexes is most consistent with TADF. Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs with these gold(III) complexes as dopants afforded electroluminescence maxima at 465&#8208;473 nm with FWHM of 64&#8208;67 nm and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 15.25%. This research demonstrates the first example of gold(III)&#8208;OLEDs showing electroluminescence maxima smaller than 470 nm, and highlights the potential of using gold(III)&#8208;TADF emitters in the development of high efficiency blue OLEDs and blue emissive dopant in WOLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Flexible yet Robust Framework of Tin(II) Oxide Carbodiimide for Reversible Lithium Storage</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can become promising electrode materials for advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), because their loosely&#8208;packed porous structures may mitigate volume expansion and metal atom aggregation which occur to the respective metal oxides. However, they suffer from poor electrical conductivity and irreversible structural degradation upon charge/discharge processes, which impede their practical utilization. Herein, we investigate MOF&#8208;like Sn2O(CN2) as a new electrode material. The conductive yet flexible [N=C=N] linkers are tilted between [Sn4O] nodes and cross&#8208;linked into a porous quasi&#8208;layered structure. Such structure offers abundant channels for fast Li&#8208;ion transport and tolerance of enormous volume expansion. Notably, anisotropic [N=C=N]2&#8722; arrays hardly migrate so that Sn0 nanodots are physically separated via robust [N=C=N]2&#8722; framework during discharge process, thereby effectively preventing the formation of large Sn islands. Owing to the structural advantage, the Sn2O(CN2) electrode exhibits high initial Coulombic efficiency as ~80%. With the addition of graphite as conductive supporter, the electrode provides 978 mA h g&#8722;1 at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 even after 300 cycles. Such MOF&#8208;like carbodiimides hold potential for the advanced electrodes in LIBs and other battery systems.</dc:description>

      <title>N&#8208;truncated A&#946; peptides impact on Cu and Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;generated ROS: Cu(I) matters !</title>
      <dc:description>The  in vitro  Cu(A&#946;  1&#8208;x  ) induced ROS production has been extensively and thoroughly studied. Conversely, the ability of N&#8208;truncated isoforms of A&#946; to alter the Cu&#8208;induced ROS production has been overlooked even though they are main constituents of amyloid plaques found in the human brain. N&#8208;truncated peptides at the positions 4 and 11 (A&#946;  4&#8208;x  and A&#946;  11&#8208;x  ) contain an amino&#8208;terminal copper and nickel (ATCUN) binding motif (NH  2  &#8208;Xxx&#8208;Zzz&#8208;His) that confer them different coordination sites and higher affinities for Cu(II) compared to the A&#946; peptide. It has further been proposed that the role of A&#946;  4&#8722;x  peptide is to quench Cu(II) toxicity in the brain. However, the role of Cu(I) coordination has never been investigated so far. In contrast to Cu(II), the Cu(I) coordination is expected to be the same for N&#8208;truncated and N&#8208;intact peptides. Here, we report in&#8208;depth spectroscopic characterizations (Cu(II) and Cu(I)) complexes of the A&#946;  4&#8208;16  and A&#946;  11&#8208;16  N&#8208;truncated peptides and ROS production studies with copper (Cu(II) and Cu(I)) complexes of the A&#946;  4&#8208;16  and A&#946;  11&#8208;16  N&#8208;truncated peptides. Our findings show that the N&#8208;truncated peptides do produce ROS when Cu(I) in present in the medium, although to a lesser extent than the unmodified counterpart. In addition, when used as a drug&#8208;candidate molecule (  id est  , in the presence of A&#946;  1&#8208;16  ), the N&#8208;truncated peptides are not able to fully preclude Cu(A&#946;  1&#8208;16  ) induced ROS production.</dc:description>

      <title>Tunable Phosphorescence&#8208;Fluorescence Dual Emissions of Organic Isoquinoline&#8208;Benzophenone Doped System by Alkoxy Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>The dual/multi&#8208;component organic doped system with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties has been developed. However, the unknown luminescence mechanism still greatly limits the development of the doped materials. Herein, a new doped system exhibiting phosphorescence&#8208;fluorescence dual emissions (&#1060;Phos.= 4&#8208;24% and &#964;phos. = 101&#8208;343 ms) is successfully constructed through prediction and design. A series of isoquinoline derivatives with different alkoxy chains were selected as the guests. Benzophenone was chosen as the host due to the characteristic of low melting point and good crystallinity. The alkoxy chain lengths of the guests are first reported to be used to control the fluorescence and phosphorescence intensities of the doped materials, which results in different prompt emission colors. Additionally, the doped ratio of the guest and host can also control the luminous intensities of the materials. In particular, the doped materials still exhibit phosphorescent properties even if the ratio of guest&#8208;host is as low as 1:100000.</dc:description>

      <title>Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene (CAAC) Gold(I) Complexes as Chemotherapeutic Agents.</title>
      <dc:description>Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbenes (CAACs) have become forceful ligands for gold due to their ability to form very strong ligand&#8208;metal bonds. Inspired by the success of Auranofin and other gold complexes as antitumor agents, we have studied the cytotoxicity of bis&#8208; and mono&#8208;CAAC&#8208;gold complexes on different cancer cell lines: HeLa (cervical cancer), A549 (lung cancer), HT1080 (fibrosarcoma) and Caov&#8208;3 (ovarian cancer). Further investigations aimed at elucidating their mechanism of action are described. This includes quantification of affinities for TrxR, evaluation of their bioavailability and determination of associated cell death process. Moreover, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was used to study morphological changes upon exposure. Noticeably, a significant reduction in non&#8208;specific binding to serum proteins was observed with CAAC complexes when compared to Auranofin. These results confirm the potential of CAAC&#8208;gold complexes in biological environments, which may result in more specific drug&#8208;target interactions and decreased side effects.</dc:description>

      <title>Competition of ligands and the 18&#8208;mer binding domain of the RHAU helicase for G&#8208;quadruplexes &#8211; orthosteric or allosteric binding mechanism?</title>
      <dc:description>Stabilizing particular DNA and RNA structures called G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) using specific ligands (L) is a strategy proposed to fight cancer. However, while G4:L interactions are often investigated, whether or not ligands are able to disrupt interactions between G4s and proteins (P) remains poorly studied. Here, using native mass spectrometry, we investigated ternary G4:L:P complexes formed by G4s, some of the highest affinity ligands, and the binding domain of the RHAU helicase. First, our results suggest that RHAU binds not only preferentially to parallel G4s but to free external G&#8208;quartets. We also found that, depending on the G4, ligands could prevent the binding of the peptide, either by direct competition for the binding sites (orthosteric inhibition) or by inducing conformational changes (allosteric inhibition). Notably, the ligand Cu&#8208;ttpy induced a conformational change that increased the binding of the peptide. This study illustrates that it is important to not only characterize drug&#8208;target interactions but also how the binding to other partners is affected.</dc:description>

      <title>Sulfur Precursor Reactivity Affecting the Crystal Phase and Morphology of Cu2&#8208;xS Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>For plasmonic copper&#8208;deficient Cu2&#8208;xS nanoparticles (NPs), accurate control of crystal phase and morphology is highly desirable since both of which are known to determine the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelength and amplitude. Here, we examine how sulfur precursor reactivity in the synthesis of Cu2&#8208;xS NPs affects the resulting crystal phase and morphology. Djurleite Cu1.94S, roxbyite Cu1.8S, digenite Cu1.8S as well as covellite CuS nanodisks were synthesized by 1&#8208;dodecanethiol,  N,N  &#8208;dibutylthiourea and crystal sulfur 1&#8208;octadecene/oleylamine solutions and their crystal phase dependent LSPR properties were exhaustively discussed. In addition, crystal phase interconversion between covellite CuS and djurleite/roxbyite Cu2&#8208;xS was realized in the presence of above sulfur sources. On the other hand, djurleite Cu1.94S nanorods rather than nanodisks were prepared by replacing 1&#8208;dodecanethiol with more reactive  tert&#8208;dodecanethiol. The structural and morphological Cu2&#8208;xS NPs here holds great promise in the application of photothermal therapy, photocatalysis, SERS and many others.</dc:description>

      <title>Mimicking Biological Recognition: Lessons in Binding Hydrophilic Guests in Water</title>
      <dc:description>Selective molecular recognition of hydrophilic guests in water plays a fundamental role in a vast number of biological processes, but synthetic mimicry of biomolecular recognition in water still proves challenging both in terms of achieving comparable affinities and selectivities. This review highlights strategies that have been developed in the field of supramolecular chemistry to selectively and non&#8208;covalently bind three classes of biologically relevant molecules: nucleotides, carbohydrates, and amino acids. As several groups have systematically modified receptors for a specific guest, an evolutionary perspective is also provided in some cases.

      <title>A Promising Approach for Controlling the 2nd Coordination Sphere of Biomimetic Metal Complexes: Encapsulation in a Dynamic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Capsule</title>
      <dc:description>The design of biomimetic models of metalloenzymes needs to take into account many factors and is therefore a challenging task. We propose in this work an original strategy to control the second coordination sphere of a metal centre and its distal environment. A biomimetic complex, reproducing the first coordination sphere, is encapsulated in a self&#8208;assembled hydrogen&#8208;bonded capsule. The cationic complex is co&#8208;encapsulated with its counter&#8208;anion or with solvent molecules. The capsule is dynamic allowing a fast in/out exchange of the co&#8208;encapsulated species. It also provides a hydrogen&#8208;bonding site in the second coordination sphere. The capsule is also a source of proton as it can be deprotonated in presence of the complex providing a globally neutral host&#8208;guest assembly. This simple and broad scope strategy is unprecedented in biomimetic studies. It appears as a very promising method for the stabilization of reactive species and for the study of their reactivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Interface amorphization of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus upon the treatment with diazonium salts</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) represents one of the most appealing 2D materials due to its electronic, optical, and chemical properties. Many strategies have been pursued to face its environmental instability, covalent functionalization being one of the most promising. However, the extremely low functionalization degrees and the limitations in proving the nature of the covalent functionalization still represent challenges in many of these sheet architectures reported to date. Here we shine light on the structural evolution of 2D&#8208;BP upon the addition of electrophilic diazonium salts. We demonstrated the absence of covalent functionalization in both the neutral and the reductive routes, observing in the latter case an unexpected interface conversion of BP to red phosphorus (RP), as characterized by Raman,&#160;  31  P&#8208;MAS NMR, and X&#8208;Ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS). Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (TG&#8208;GC&#8208;MS), as well as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) gave insights into the potential underlying radical mechanism, suggesting a Sandmeyer&#8208;like reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of an Advanced Intermediate of (+)&#8208;Sarain A&#8203;</title>
      <dc:description>We report the first  organocatalytic asymmetric synthesis  of an advanced intermediate of (+)&#8208;sarain A. This approach features the employment of an  organocatalytic asymmetric  Michael addition reaction and a nitrogen to carbon chirality transfer to forge three chiral centers, a catalytic hydrosilylation for the chemoselective reduction of a key lactam intermediate. The tricyclic intermediate contains all the required functionalities for elaborating into (+)&#8208;sarain A.</dc:description>
