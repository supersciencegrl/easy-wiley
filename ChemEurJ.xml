      <title>Spin state tunes oxygen atom transfer towards FeIVO formation in FeII complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Oxo&#8208;iron(IV) complexes bearing tetradentate ligands have been extensively studied as models for the active oxidants in non heme iron dependent enzymes. These species are commonly generated by oxidation of their ferrous precursors. The mechanisms of these reactions have been seldom investigated. In this work, the kinetics of reaction of&#160;[Fe  II  (CH  3  CN)  2  L](SbF  6  )  2  ([  1  ]  (SbF  6  )  2  and [  2  ]  (SbF  6  )  2  ) and [Fe  II  (CF  3  SO  3  )  2  L] ([  1  ]  (OTf)  2  and [  2  ]  (OTf)  2  (  1  , L =  Me,H  Pytacn,  2  , L =  nP,H  Pytacn) with Bu  4  NIO  4  to form the&#160;[Fe  IV  (O)(CH  3  CN)L]  2+  (  3  , L =  Me,H  Pytacn,  4  , L =  nP,H  Pytacn) species has been studied. The reactions occur in a single&#160;step with activation parameters independent of the&#160;anion and similar to those&#160;for&#160;substitution&#160;using Cl  &#8208;  , which indicates that formation of [Fe  IV  (O)(CH  3  CN)L]  2+  is kinetically controlled by substitution&#160;to form [Fe  II  (IO  4  )(CH  3  CN)L]  +  intermediates that convert rapidly to the oxo complexes . The kinetics of the reaction is strongly dependent on the spin state of the starting complex. A detailed analysis of the magnetic&#160;susceptibility and kinetic data&#160;reveals that the experimental&#160;activation parameters&#160;are the result of a partial compensation of the contributions from the&#160;spin crossover equilibrium and the substitution. The observation of these opposite and compensating effects by modifying the steric hindrance at the ligand illustrates&#160;unconsidered factors governing the mechanism&#160;leading to high valent iron&#8208;oxo species.</dc:description>

      <title>Benzothiadiazole substituted aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes: two&#8208;photon absorption enhancement for improved optical limiting performances in the SWIR range.</title>
      <dc:description>Aza&#8208;boron dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPYs) presenting a benzothiadiazole substitution on upper positions are described. The strong electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the benzothiadiazole moiety permits to enhance the accepting strength and improve the delocalisation of the aza&#8208;BODIPY core to attain a significant degree of electronic communication between the lower donating groups and the upper accepting groups. The nature of the intramolecular charge transfer is studied both experimentally and theoretically. Linear spectroscopy highlighted the strongly red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission of the synthesized molecules with recorded fluorescence spectra over 1000 nm. Nonlinear optical properties were also investigated. Strong enhancement of the two&#8208;photon absorption of the substituted dyes compared to the unsubstituted one (up to 4520 GM at 1300 nm) results in a ca. 15 &#8208; 20% improvement of the optical power limiting performances. These dyes are therefore a good starting point for further improvement of optical power limiting in the SWIR range.</dc:description>

      <title>Cyclo&#8208;Ketal Xanthene Dyes: A New Class of Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores for Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Live Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Newly emerging super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques provide opportunities for precise observations on cellular microstructures. However, they also impose severe demands on fluorophores. Here, we develop a new series of NIR xanthene dyes, named as KRhs, by replacing the 10&#8208;position O of rhodamines with a cyclo&#8208;ketal. KRhs display intense NIR emission peaked at 700 nm with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.64. More importantly, they, without the aid of any enhancing buffer, exhibit stochastic fluorescence off&#8208;on switches to support time&#8208;resolved localization of single&#8208;fluorophore. KRhs are functionalized into KRh&#8208;MitoFix, KRh&#8208;Mem and KRh&#8208;Halo that demonstrate mitochondria, plasma membrane and fusion protein targeting ability respectively. Consequently, these KRh probes demonstrate straightforward usage for super&#8208;resolution imaging of these targets in live cells. Therefore, KRhs merit future development for fluorescence labeling and super&#8208;resolution imaging in the NIR region.</dc:description>

      <title>Cationic Bismuth Aminotroponiminates: Charge Controls Redox Properties</title>
      <dc:description>The behavior of redox&#8208;active aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligand sets in the coordination sphere of bismuth has been investigated in neutral and cationic compounds, [Bi(ATI)3] and [Bi(ATI)2Ln][A] (L = neutral ligand; n = 0, 1; A = counteranion). Their coordination chemistry in solution and in the solid state has been analyzed through (VT&#8208;)NMR spectroscopy, line&#8208;shape analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, and their Lewis acidity has been evaluated using the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method (and modifications thereof). Cyclic voltammetry in combination with DFT calculations indicates that switching between ligand&#8208;centered and metal&#8208;centered redox events is possible by altering the charge of the compounds from 0 in neutral species to +1 in cationic compounds.

Almost 50&#8201;% part of solar energy lies in the IR region. NIR light (&gt;1000&#8197;nm) has several biological and medical applications. Organic molecules designed for solar cell applications should possess light harvesting property in UV, visible and NIR regions of the spectrum. Extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules with low band gap energy have potential applications in different research fields such as organic solar cells, bioimaging, thermal imaging, photography, optical recording, etc. A variety of NIR molecules have been developed. All NIR absorbing molecules are classified based on different types of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units such as BODIPY, BBTD, rylene, porphyrin and squaraine.

      <title>Frontispiece: Towards More Photostable, Brighter, and Less Phototoxic Chromophores: Synthesis and Properties of Porphyrins Functionalized with Cyclooctatetraene</title>
      <dc:description>
Free bases and zinc porphyrins were substituted with cyclooctatetraene, a triplet quencher, in three different fashions in order to enhance their photostability. Large decrease of the lifetime of porphyrin triplet state was observed. Photostability has been significantly improved in oxygen&#8208;free solutions. In non&#8208;degassed solutions, the improvement has been achieved for zinc porphyrins, but not for the free bases. For more details see the Full Paper by J. Waluk, J. Ostapko et&#8197;al. on page 16666.

      <title>Triggering G&#8208;quadruplex conformation&#8208;switching with [7]helicenes</title>
      <dc:description>The dynamic interplay between two types of chiral structures; fully conjugated racemic hetero[7]helicenes and DNA strands prone to fold into G&#8208;quadruplex structures is described. Both the [7]helicenes and the G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structures exist in more than one conformation in solution. We show that the structures interact with and stabilise each other, mutually amplifying and stabilising certain conformations at increased temperatures. The [7]helicene ligands  L1  and  L2  stabilise the parallel conformation of  k&#8208;ras  significantly, whereas hybrid (K  +  ) and antiparallel (Na  +  )  h&#8208;telo  G&#8208;quadruplexes are stabilised upon conformational switching into altered G&#8208;quadruplex conformations. Both  L1  and  L2  induce parallel G&#8208;quadruplexes from hybrid structures (K  +  ) and  L1  induce hybrid G&#8208;quadruplexes from antiparallel conformations (Na  +  ). Enantioselective binding of one helicene enantiomer is observed for helicene ligand  L2  , and VTCD melting experiments are used to estimate the racemisation barrier of the helicene.</dc:description>

      <title>Structurally Modelling the 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;Carboxylate Facial Triad with a Bulky N,N,O Phenolate Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>We present the synthesis and coordination chemistry of a bulky, tripodal  N,N,O  ligand,  Im  Ph2  NNO  tBu  (  L  ), designed to model the 2&#8208;His&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylate facial triad (2H1C) by means of two imidazole groups and an anionic 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208;subtituted phenolate. Reacting  K&#8208;L  with MCl  2  (M = Fe, Zn) affords the isostructural, tetrahedral non&#8208;heme complexes [Fe(L)(Cl)] (  1  ) and [Zn(L)(Cl)] (  2  ) in high yield. The tridentate  N,N,O  ligand coordination observed in their X&#8208;ray crystal structures remains intact and well&#8208;defined in MeCN and CH  2  Cl  2  solution. Reacting  2  with NaSPh affords a non&#8208;heme zinc thiolate complex, [Zn(L)(SPh)] (  4  ), that is relevant to isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) biomimicry. Cyclic voltammetry studies demonstrate the ligand&#8217;s redox non&#8208;innocence, where phenolate oxidation is the first electrochemical response observed in  K&#8208;L  ,  2  and  4  . However, the first electrochemical oxidation in  1  is iron&#8208;centred, the assignment of which is supported by DFT calculations. Overall,  Im  Ph2  NNO  tBu  provides access to well&#8208;defined mononuclear, monoligated,  N,N,O  &#8208;bound metal complexes, enabling more accurate structural modelling of the 2H1C to be achieved.</dc:description>

      <title>Generation of Oxidoreductases with Dual Alcohol Dehydrogenase and Amine Dehydrogenase Activity</title>
      <dc:description>
The catalytic promiscuity of LysEDH&#8212;which naturally catalyzes the oxidative deamination of l&#8208;lysine at the &#1013;&#8208;amino group&#8212;was harnessed to create variants that exhibited alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) activities.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The catalytic promiscuity of LysEDH&lt;/b&gt;&#8212;which naturally catalyzes the oxidative deamination of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;lysine at the &#1013;&#8208;amino group&#8212;was harnessed to create variants that exhibited alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) activities. These ADH and AmDH activities could be switched by changing the reaction conditions. The dual ADH&#8208;AmDH activity (i.e., alcohol aminase) was applied to convert benzyl alcohol to benzylamine using a single enzyme.

      <title>Metastability and seeding effects in the mechanochemical hybrid lead(II) iodide formation</title>
      <dc:description>We present the mechanism for the mechanochemical synthesis of (C(NH  2  )  3  )  3  PbI  5  3  and (C(NH  2  )  3  )  4  PbI  6  4  and their conversion into each other. We investigated the syntheses of  3  at different frequencies and energies using in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. By splitting the reaction into single parts we could prove that the formation of  3  is simply dependent on the energy and mixing speed. The nucleation of  4  instead is slightly negative dependent on the energy but dependent on the mixing speed, while its growth is mostly independent of any influence. We were able to influence the reaction pathways by seeding the mixture with a small amount of powdery  4  . The formation of  4  is very likely an auto&#8208;catalytic process.  3  instead is metastable. It can be stabilized by energy, which beside mechanochemistry can also be achieved by temperature. The results showcases the complex nature of mechanochemical reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective cleavage of cyclobutanols through Ir&#8208;catalyzed&#160;C&#8208;C bond activation: Mechanistic and synthetic aspects</title>
      <dc:description>The Ir&#8208;catalyzed conversion of prochiral&#160;  tert  &#8208;cyclo&#173;butanols to&#160; b &#8208;methyl&#8208;substituted ketones proceeds under comparably mild conditions in toluene (45&#8211;110&#176;C) and is particularly suited for the enantio&#173;selective desymmetrization of&#160; b &#8208;oxy&#8208;substituted substrates to give products with a quaternary chirality center with up to 95%&#160;  ee  &#160;using DTBM&#8208;SegPhos as a chiral ligand. Deuteration experi&#173;ments and kinetic isotope effect measurements revealed major mechanistic differences to related Rh(I)&#8208;catalyzed transformations. Supported by DFT calculations we propose the initial formation of an Ir(III) hydride intermediate which then undergoes a&#160; b &#8208;C elimination (C&#8208;C bond activation) prior to reductive C&#8208;H elimination. The computational model also allows the prediction of the stereochemical outcome. The Ir&#8208;catalyzed cyclobutanol cleavage is broadly applicable but fails for substrates bearing strongly coordinating groups. The method is of particular value for the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of substituted chromanes related to the tocopherols and other natural products.</dc:description>

      <title>A series of bisamide&#8208;substituted diacetylenes exhibiting terminal alkyl odd&#8208;even parity effect on mechano&#8208;activation for the subsequent photopolymerization property</title>
      <dc:description>Diacetylene derivatives exhibit solid&#8208;state polymerization to polydiacetylene initiated by UV light or &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation. The activation of the photopolymerization highly relies on the monomer diynes arrangement. Recently, we have demonstrated the first mechanoresponsive bisamide substituted diacetylenes (DAs) showing dramatic switching from light&#8208;inert to light&#8208;reactive state upon a given pressure. The origin of this unique phenomenon was apparently related to the pressure&#8208;sensitive crystalline transition in DAs, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. To obtain the insight, we herein present a series of DAs with varying terminal alkyl spacer length, and their molecular structural effect on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and steric repulsion. In pristine states, even&#8208;parity DAs were inactive upon UV irradiation (&#955;=254 nm) unless external pressure was given. By contrast, odd&#8208;parity DAs were easily polymerized upon UV irradiation without pressure application. However, the pressure&#8208;induced crystalline phase transition exhibiting photopolymerization was valid for all DAs regardless of their alkyl spacer length. A systematic investigation revealed that the terminal alkyl spacer length, especially its odd&#8208;even parity plays a key role to determine the intrinsic intermolecular hydrogen bonding nature of DA crystals and resultant molecular packing. In addition, the relevant thermochromic behaviour was also observed from photopolymerized polydiacetylenes.</dc:description>

      <title>An Antimony(III) Fluoride Oxalate With Large Birefringence</title>
      <dc:description>Birefringent materials play a key role in modulating the polarization of light and thus in optical communication as well as the laser techniques and science. Designing new, excellent birefringent materials remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and synthesized the first antimony(III) fluoride oxalate birefringent material, KSb  2  C  2  O  4  F  5  , by a combination of delocalized  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated [C  2  O  4  ]  2&#8208;  groups, stereochemical active Sb  3+  cations, and the most electronegative F element. The [C  2  O  4  ]  2&#8208;  groups are not in an optimal arrangement in the crystal structure of KSb  2  C  2  O  4  F  5  . Remarkably, KSb  2  C  2  O  4  F  5  exhibits a large birefringence (&#916;  n  = 0.170 @546 nm) that is even better than the well&#8208;known commercial birefringent material  &#945;  &#8208;BaB  2  O  4  , whereas the latter features an optimal arrangement of  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated [B  3  O  6  ]  3&#8208;  groups. Based on the first&#8208;principles calculations, this prominent birefringence should be attributed to the alliance of planar  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated [C  2  O  4  ]  2&#8208;  anions, highly distorted SbO  2  F  2  and SbOF  3  polyhedra with stereochemical activity lone pair. Combination of lone pair electrons and  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated systems enables to boost the birefringence to a large extent and will help to develop high&#8208;performance birefringent materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanical modulation of the solid&#8208;state luminescence of tricarbonyl rhenium(I) complexes through the interplay between two triplet excited states</title>
      <dc:description>Mechanoresponsive luminescence (MRL) active materials promise smart devices for sensing, optoelectronics, and security. Herein is the first report on the MRL&#8208;activity of two Re(I) complexes, opening up new opportunities for applications in this field. Both complexes exhibit marked solid&#8208;state luminescence enhancement (SLE) effect. Pristine microcrystalline powders emit in the yellow&#8208;green region, grinding led to an amorphous phase with concomitant emission red&#8208;shift and shrinking of photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields and lifetimes. Quantum chemical calculations revealed the existence of two low&#8208;lying triplet excited states of very close energy levels, i.e. 3IL and 3MLCT, having respectively almost pure intraligand and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer character. Transition between these states could be promoted by rotation around the pyridyltriazole&#8208;phenylbenzoxazole (pyta&#8208;PBO) bond. In microcrystals, where rotations are hindered, the 3IL state induces prominent PL emission at short wavelengths. Upon grinding, rotation is facilitated and the transition to the 3MLCT state results in a larger proportion of long&#8208;wavelength PL. FTIR spectroscopic analyses and variable temperature PL spectroscopy showed that the opening of vibrational modes favours non&#8208;radiative deactivation of the triplet states in the amorphous phase. In solutions, PL only arises from the 3MLCT state. The same mechanism accounts for the spectroscopic differences observed when passing from crystals to amorphous powders, and then to solutions, clarifying the link between SLE and MRL for these complexes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Conventional histology is a destructive technique based on the evaluation of 2D slices of a 3D biopsy. By using 3D X&#8208;ray histology these obstacles can be overcome, but their application is still restricted due to the inherently low attenuation properties of soft tissue. In order to solve this problem, the tissue can be stained before X&#8208;ray computed tomography (CT) imaging to enhance the soft tissue X&#8208;ray contrast. Evaluation of brominated fluorescein salts revealed a mutual influence of the number of bromine atoms and the cations applied on the achieved contrast enhancement. The dibromo fluorescein barium salt turned out to be the ideal X&#8208;ray contrast agent, allowing for 3D imaging and subsequent complementing counterstaining applying standard histological techniques.</dc:description>

      <title>Enthalpically and Entropically Favorable Self&#8208;Assembly: Synthesis of&#160;C4h&#8208;Symmetric Tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes by Regioselective Introduction of Pyridine Rings</title>
      <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in solution generally occurs due to either an enthalpic or an entropic gain; however, designing &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems that simultaneously exhibit enthalpically and entropically favorable self&#8208;assembly behavior is challenging. Herein, we disclose the self&#8208;assembly behavior of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes, which is driven by both enthalpy and entropy. A single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that molecules of these tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes form face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked dimers&#160; with a 1D columnar structure due to the circularly arranged dipole moments. Importantly, concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent&#160;  1  H NMR spectra revealed that the formation of self&#8208;assemblies of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes in chloroform and methanol is favored by both enthalpic and entropic factors. The unique association behavior is due to the presence of sp  2  &#8208;hybridized nitrogen atoms, which weakly coordinate to the hydrogen atoms of these solvents and reduce the&#160; &#960; &#8208;electron density of the circulene cores.</dc:description>

      <title>Boron&#8208;Ligand Cooperation: The Concept and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>The term boron&#8208;ligand cooperation was introduced to describe a specific mode of action by which certain metal&#8208;free systems activate chemical bonds. The main characteristic of this mode of action is that one covalently bound substituent at the boron is actively involved in the bond activation process and changes to a datively bound ligand in the course of the bond activation. Within this review, we reflect on how the term boron&#8208;ligand cooperation evolved and discuss examples of bond activation by boron&#8208;ligand cooperation. We furthermore show that systems that operate via boron&#8208;ligand cooperation can complement the reactivity of classic intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs and summarize applications of this new concept for metal&#8208;free catalysis.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We introduce the hybrid bidentate 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole (pyb) ligand in well&#8208;characterized 3d&#8208;transition metal catalysis.

Experimental and high&#8208;level theoretical calculations suggest that the bridging N atom of the ligand imposes exclusive  trans  &#8208;coordination at Cu and allows ligand rotation, while the N atom of the pyridine group modulates charge distribution and flux, thus orchestrating structural and electronic pre&#8208;catalyst control permitting alkyne binding with simultaneous activation of the C&#8211;H bond via a transient Cu(I) species.</dc:description>

      <title>In Situ Corrosion Fabrication of NaNbO3/Nb3O7F Heterojunctions with Optimized Band Realignment for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Heterostructured photocatalysis is a significant issue&#160;due to the unique band alignment, improved spectrum absorption and enhanced photocatalytic activity. However, constructing uniform, controllable and effective heterojunctions still keeps a huge challenge&#160;up to now. Herein, NaNbO3/Nb3O7F&#160;heterojunctions were fabricated by an  in situ  &#160;corrosion technique for the first time. The influence of phase transformation on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity was investigated systematically&#160;  via  &#160;the photocatalytic water splitting for H2  production. Interestingly, the band realignment and good interfacial contact endowed NaNbO3/Nb3O7F&#160;heterojunctions with higher HER activity (43.3 mmol&#8226;g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  ), about 2.4 times of pure Nb3O7F&#160;(mmol&#8226;g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  ) and 1.36 times of pure NaNbO3  (mmol&#8226;g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  ). The results&#160;may provide some new insights into the corrosion&#160;technique and HER activity&#160;of novel heterostructured&#160;catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Personalized Reusable Face Masks with Smart Nano&#8208;Assisted Destruction of Pathogens for COVID&#8208;19: a Visionary Road</title>
      <dc:description>The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) emergency has demonstrated that the utilization of face masks plays a critical role in limiting the outbreaks. Healthcare professionals utilize masks all day long without replacing them very frequently, thus representing a source of cross&#8208;infection for patients and themselves. Nanotechnology is a powerful tool with the capability to produce nanomaterials with unique physicochemical and anti&#8208;pathogen properties. Here, we outline how to realize non&#8208;disposable and highly comfortable respirators with light&#8208;triggered self&#8208;disinfection ability by bridging bioactive nanofiber properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomaterials. The visionary road highlighted in this Concept is based on the possibility to develop a new generation of masks based on multifunctional membranes where the presence of nanoclusters and plasmonic nanoparticles arranged in a hierarchical structure enables the realization of a chemically&#8208;driven and on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;pathogen activities. Multilayer electrospun membranes have the ability to dissipate humidity present within the mask, enhancing the wearability and usability. The photo&#8208;thermal disinfected membrane is the core of these 3D printed and reusable masks with moisture pump capability. Personalized face masks with smart nano&#8208;assisted destruction of pathogens will bring enormous advantages to the entire global community, especially for front&#8208;line personnel, and will open up great opportunities for innovative medical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Ditopic Chelators of Dicopper Centers for an Enhancement of Tyrosinases Inhibition</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosinase enzymes (Tys) are involved in the key steps of melanin (protective pigments) biosynthesis and molecules targeting the binuclear copper active site on tyrosinases represent a relevant strategy to regulate enzyme activities. In this work, we studied the possible synergic effect generated by combination of known inhibitors. For this, derivatives containing kojic acid (KA) and 2&#8208;Hydroxypyridine&#8208;  N  &#8208;oxide (HOPNO) combined with a thiosemicarbazone (TSC) moiety were synthetized. Their inhibition activities were evaluated on purified tyrosinases from different sources (mushroom, bacterial and human) as well as on melanin production by lysats from human melanoma MNT&#8208;1 cell line. Results showed significant enhancement of the inhibitory effects compared to the parent compounds, in particular for HOPNO&#8208;TSC. In order to elucidate the interaction mode with the dicopper(II) active site, we investigated the binding studies towards a tyrosinase bio&#8208;inspired model of the dicopper(II) center. The structure of the isolated adduct between one ditopic inhibitor (KA&#8208;TSC) and the model complex reveals that the binding to a dicopper center can occur with both chelating sites. Computational studies on model complexes and docking studies on enzymes led to the identification of KA and HOPNO moieties as interacting groups with the dicopper active site.</dc:description>

The MOF microcrystals from solvethermol synthesis (bottom&#8208;up) enable to evolve from microrods via microtubes to nanowires through a chelating agent&#8208;assisted etching process (top&#8208;down). The three types of MOF 1D&#8208;microstructures with high crystallinity and smooth surfaces all exhibit efficient optical waveguide performance. Furthermore, MOF nanowire with lowest propagation loss served as low&#8208;threshold pure&#8208;MOF nanolasers with Fabry&#8722;P&#233;rot resonance.

      <title>How Oriented External Electric Fields Modulate Reactivity</title>
      <dc:description>A judiciously oriented external electric field (OEEF) can catalyze a wide range of reactions and can even induce&#160;endo/exostereoselectivity of cycloaddition reactions. We study the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride using quantitative activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory to pinpoint the origin of these catalytic and stereoselective effects. Our quantitative model reveals that an OEEF along the reaction axis induces an enhanced electrostatic and orbital interaction between the reactants, which in turn lowers the reaction barrier. The stronger electrostatic interaction originates from an increased electron density difference between the reactants at the reactive center, while the enhanced orbital interaction arises from the promoted normal electron demand donor&#8211;acceptor interaction driven by the OEEF. An OEEF perpendicular to the plane of the reaction axis solely stabilizes the&#160;exo&#160;pathway of this reaction while the&#160;endo&#160;pathway remains unaltered and efficiently steers the&#160;endo/exo&#160;stereoselectivity.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A judiciously oriented external electric field (OEEF) can catalyze a wide range of reactions and can even induce&#160;endo/exostereoselectivity of cycloaddition reactions. We study the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride using quantitative activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory to pinpoint the origin of these catalytic and stereoselective effects. Our quantitative model reveals that an OEEF along the reaction axis induces an enhanced electrostatic and orbital interaction between the reactants, which in turn lowers the reaction barrier. The stronger electrostatic interaction originates from an increased electron density difference between the reactants at the reactive center, while the enhanced orbital interaction arises from the promoted normal electron demand donor&#8211;acceptor interaction driven by the OEEF. An OEEF perpendicular to the plane of the reaction axis solely stabilizes the&#160;exo&#160;pathway of this reaction while the&#160;endo&#160;pathway remains unaltered and efficiently steers the&#160;endo/exo&#160;stereoselectivity. Furthermore, we have also investigated the influence of OEEFs on the inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, which, unexpectedly, inhibits the reaction, as the electric field now suppresses the critical inverse electron demand donor&#8211;acceptor interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Exploring the Reactivity of a Frustrated Sn/P Lewis Pair: the Highly Selective Complexation of the cis&#8208;Azobenzene Photoisomer</title>
      <dc:description>The reactivity of the geminal frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) (F  5  C  2  )  3  Sn&#173;CH  2  &#173;P(tBu)  2  &#160;(  1  ) was explored by reacting it with a variety of small molecules (PhOCN, PhNCS, PhCCH, tBuCCH, H  3  CC(O)&#173;CH=CH  2  , Ph[C(O)]  2  Ph, PhN=NPh and Me  3  SiCHN  2  ), featuring polar or non&#8208;polar multiple bonds and/or represent &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated systems. While most adducts are formed readily, the binding of azobenzene requires UV&#8208;induced photoisomerization, which results in the highly selective complexation of cis&#8208;azobenzene. In case of benzil, the reac&#173;tion does not lead to the expected 1,2&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;addition products, but to the non&#8208;stereoselective (tBu)  2  PCH  2  &#8208;transfer to a prochiral keto func&#173;tion of benzil. All adducts of  1  were characterised by means of multi&#173;nuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analyses and X&#8209;ray diffraction experiments.</dc:description>

      <title>Ni2P Nanoalloy as an Air&#8208;Stable and Versatile Hydrogenation Catalyst in Water: P&#8208;Alloying Strategy for Designing Smart Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based hydrogenation catalysts have limited practical applications because they exhibit low activity, require harsh reaction conditions, and are unstable in air. To overcome these limitations, herein we propose the alloying of non&#8208;noble metal nanoparticles with phosphorus as a promising strategy for developing smart catalysts that exhibit both excellent activity and air stability. We synthesized a novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano&#8208;Ni2P) with coordinatively unsaturated Ni active sites. Unlike conventional air&#8208;unstable non&#8208;noble metal catalysts, nano&#8208;Ni2P retained its metallic nature in air, and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of various substrates with polar functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, and nitroarenes to the desired products in excellent yields in water. Furthermore, the used nano&#8208;Ni2P catalyst was easy to handle in air and could be reused without pretreatment, providing a simple and clean catalyst system for general hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Covalency in Actinide Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>Covalency in actinides has emerged as a resounding research topic on account of the technological importance in separating minor actinides from lanthanides for spent nuclear fuel processing, and utilization of their distinct bonding properties has been realized as a route towards overcoming this challenge. Because of the&#160; limited radial extent of the 4  f  orbitals , there is almost no 4  f  &#160;electron participation in bonding in lanthanides; this is not the case for the actinides, which have extended 5  f  &#160;orbitals that are capable of overlapping with ligand orbitals, although not to the degree of overlap as in the&#160;  d  &#160;orbitals of transition metals. In this concept paper, we provide a general description of covalency in actinide compounds. After introducing two main approaches to enhance covalency, either by exploiting increased orbital overlap or decreasing energy differences between the orbitals causing orbital energy degeneracy, we show the current state of the field using several examples from the recent literature. We will conclude by proposing the use of actinide chalcogenides as a convenient auxiliary tool to study covalency in actinide compounds.</dc:description>

These species undergo a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed allylation reaction of aldehydes to produce the E isomers of anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols. On the other hand, the corresponding Z isomers of anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols are obtained when a dimeric palladium(I) complex is employed as the catalyst for this double&#8208;bond transposition. Thus, both E and Z isomers can be synthesized from the same starting materials. A B&#8211;C(sp2) bond remaining with the allylation product undergoes the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction to furnish a propionate&#8208;derived trisubstituted alkene motif in a stereo&#8208;defined form.

      <dc:description>Direct targeting of intrinsically disordered proteins, including MYC by small&#8208;molecules for biomedical applications will resolve a longstanding issue in chemical biology and medicine.

      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;mediated base pairs have widespread applications, such as in DNA&#8208;metal nanodevices and sensors.

The X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure was successfully obtained at a resolution of 1.5 &#197;. A novel type of AgI&#8208;mediated base pair between the N1 positions of  anti&#8208;conformation of adenines in the duplex was observed. In the central non&#8208;canonical region, a hexad nucleobase structure containing AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs between the N7 positions of guanines was formed. A highly bent non&#8208;canonical structure was formed at the origin of AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs in the central region. The bent duplex structure induced by the addition of AgI  ions might become a powerful tool for dynamic structural changes in DNA nanotechnology applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling Spin&#8208;Correlated Radical Pairs with Donor&#8722;Acceptor Dyads: A New Concept to Generate Reduced Metal Complexes for More Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>One&#8208;electron reduced metal complexes derived from photoactive ruthenium or iridium complexes are important intermediates for substrate activation steps in photoredox catalysis and for the photocatalytic generation of solar fuels. However, owing to the heavy atom effect, direct photochemical pathways to these key intermediates suffer from intrinsic efficiency problems resulting from rapid geminate recombination of radical pairs within the so&#8208;called solvent cage. In this study, we prepared and investigated molecular dyads capable of producing reduced metal complexes via an indirect pathway relying on a sequence of energy and electron transfer processes between a Ru complex and a covalently connected anthracene moiety. Our test reaction to establish the proof of concept is the photochemical reduction of ruthenium(tris)bipyridine by the ascorbate dianion as sacrificial donor in aqueous solution. The photochemical key step in the Ru&#8208;anthracene dyads is the reduction of a purely organic (anthracene) triplet excited state by the ascorbate dianion, yielding a spin&#8208;correlated radical pair whose (unproductive) recombination is strongly spin&#8208;forbidden. By carrying out detailed laser flash photolysis investigations, we provide clear evidence for the indirect reduced metal complex generation mechanism and show that this pathway can outperform the conventional direct metal complex photoreduction. The further optimization of our approach involving relatively simple molecular dyads might result in novel photocatalysts that convert substrates with unprecedented quantum yields.</dc:description>

      <title>Surface Termination Layer Dominating the Moisture Degradation Pathway in CH3NH3PbI3 Perovskite Film</title>
      <dc:description>Theoretical studies have disclosed that the surface terminations such as MAI&#8208; or PbI&#8208;layers affect greatly on the environmental stability of organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite. However, until now, there have been rarely direct evidence trying to experimentally detect the existence of MAI or PbI terminations on MAPbI3  grains, let along disclosing their effects on the humidity degradation pathway of perovskite solar cell. Here, we successfully modified and detected the surface terminations of MAI and PbI species on the polycrystalline MAPbI3  films. For the MAI&#8208;terminated perovskite film, it followed the moisture degradation process from MAPbI3  to hydrate MAPbI3&#183;H2O and then into PbI2, penetration of water molecules was the main driving force to lead the degradation of MAPbI3  layer by layer. While, for the PbI&#8208;terminated perovskite film in humidity, a deprotonation degradation pathway was confirmed, in which it preferred to directly degrade from MAPbI3  into PbI2, while the iodine defects here played a key role in promoting the dissociation of water molecules into hydroxyl OH&#8208;  and further catalyzing the decomposition of perovskite.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Chemiluminescent Formaldehyde Probes</title>
      <dc:description>A first&#8208;generation pair of chemiluminescent formaldehyde (FA) probes&#160;(CFAP540 and CFAP700) was reported recently. CFAP540 and CFAP700 with high selectivity and sensitivity to FA, are respectively suitable in cell and in vivo. Experimentalists have confirmed that both probes utilize a general 2&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope FA&#8208;reactive trigger and a chemiluminogenic phenoxydioxetane scaffold. The mechanism and detailed process of CFAP chemiluminescence (CL) remain largely unknown. In the present paper, we performed (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations on the entire reaction process of CFAP540 with FA to produce CL. The calculations elucidated the CL producing process: FA initiates the decomposition of CFAP540 by dehydration condensation, and a phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane is formed through a series of reactions of aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, hydrolysis of imine, and &#946;&#8208;elimination of alkoxyl group. Afterwards, the produced phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane decomposes to produce m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative at the first singlet state (S1) via two crossings between potential energy surfaces of the ground state (S0) and S1 state. This m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative was assigned to the light emitter of the CFAP540 CL. The CL producing process and assignment of the light emitter of CFAP700 CL are similar with the corresponding ones of CFAP540. By analyzing the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture of the light emitters of CFAP540 and CFAP700, we theoretically designed a series of CFAPs and proposed a scheme to modulate their CL from visible to near&#8208;infrared region by adjusting the length and structure of the &#960;&#8208;bridge.</dc:description>

The calculations elucidated the CL producing process: FA initiates the decomposition of CFAP540 by dehydration condensation, and a phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane is formed through a series of reactions of aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, hydrolysis of imine, and &#946;&#8208;elimination of alkoxyl group. Afterwards, the produced phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane decomposes to produce m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative at the first singlet state (S1) via two crossings between potential energy surfaces of the ground state (S0) and S1 state. This m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative was assigned to the light emitter of the CFAP540 CL. The CL producing process and assignment of the light emitter of CFAP700 CL are similar with the corresponding ones of CFAP540. By analyzing the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture of the light emitters of CFAP540 and CFAP700, we theoretically designed a series of CFAPs and proposed a scheme to modulate their CL from visible to near&#8208;infrared region by adjusting the length and structure of the &#960;&#8208;bridge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Direct Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Dithioacetals</title>
      <dc:description>Dithioacetals are a frequently used motif in synthetic organic chemistry and have recently seen increasing attention as structural motif in promising antiviral agents against plant pathogens. Most existing reports, however, only discuss symmetrical dithioacetals. Examples of mixed dithioacetals are scarce and no general method for the selective synthesis of these compounds exists. Herein, we present a synthetically simple general one&#8208;step protocol for the synthesis of a broad range of unsymmetrical dithioacetals consisting of one aromatic and one aliphatic thiol moiety from the corresponding aldehyde/thiol mixture. The mixed  S  ,  S  &#8208;acetals are obtained is high yields and a great variety of functional groups is tolerated. Kinetic control enables an excellent selectivity in regard to the unsymmetrical dithioacetal.</dc:description>

      <title>D&#8208;A Interactions Induced Interfacial Synthesis of Ultrathin Fluoric Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer via Photochemical [2 + 2] Cycloaddition</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) have attracted much interest due to their unique 2D atomic&#8208;thick covalent network with periodically linked monomers. The preparation of mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layered 2DPs with highly ordered structures is still a big challenge. Here, we report a preparation of ultrathin 2DP film based on photo&#8208;triggered [2 + 2] cycloaddition at the air/water interface. The pre&#8208;assembly process induced by the D&#8208;A interactions before the polymerization plays a key role in constructing highly ordered structure. The precise structure and chemical compositions of the continuous 2DP films were proved by selected area electron diffraction (SAED), tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) and molecular&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based structural simulation.</dc:description>
