         <title>Combining Enantioselective Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition and Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Alkylation in Stereodivergent, Multicomponent Coupling Reactions to Form Three Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stereodivergent dual catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to selectively prepare all four stereoisomers in molecules containing two chiral centers from common starting materials. Most processes involve the use of two substrates, and it remains challenging to use dual catalyst approaches to generate molecules having three newly formed stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Here we report a multicomponent, stereodivergent method for the synthesis of targets containing three contiguous stereocenters by the combination of enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition and Ir&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation methodologies. Both cyclic and acyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones undergo &#946;&#8208;arylation using aryl boron reagents to form an enolate nucleophile that can be subsequently allylated at the &#945;&#8208;position. The reactions proceed often with &gt;95% ee and with &gt;90:10 dr. Epimerization at the &#945;&#8208;carbonyl center enables the preparation of any of the eight possible stereoisomers from common starting materials, as demonstrated for cyclohexanone products.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement of Assemblies of Peptides by Chemical Reactions in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confinement of peptide assemblies by chemical reactions in a specific location of living cells is a big challenge. This article introduces the peptide self&#8208;assembly triggered by chemical factors inside cancer cells, which could be helpful in designing functional materials selectively for cancer therapy, drug delivery, and biological imaging.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of peptides plays an important role in optics, catalysis, medicine, and disease treatment. In recent years, peptide&#8208;based materials have exhibited great potential for cancer therapy and disease imaging due to their excellent biocompatibility, structural tenability, and ease of functionality. Peptides could self&#8208;assemble into diverse nanostructures in&#8197;vivo triggered by endogenous stimuli, which initiated chemical reactions and self&#8208;assembled to achieve desired biological functions in the tumor microenvironment. This concept introduces the utilization of endogenous triggers to construct functional nanostructures in&#8197;vivo and their corresponding biological applications. After briefly discussing the representative example of chemical reactions induced self&#8208;assembly of peptides in the living system, we describe the several stimuli triggered self&#8208;assembly for constructing therapeutic assemblies and serving as an imaging probe. Finally, we give a brief outlook to discuss the future direction of this exciting new field.

A new method for the efficient synthesis of diarylmethanes via a radical process involving thermolysis of bis(arylmethyl)tin dichlorides in the presence of arenes is reported. The intermediate arylmethyl radical can be trapped with TEMPO.







Abstract
The oxidative&#8208;addition reaction between an arylmethyl chloride (RCH2Cl; R=1&#8208;C10H7, 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, 4&#8208;MeC6H4, 3&#8208;MeC6H4, C6H5, 4&#8208;ClC6H4) and tin powder in boiling toluene produces bis(arylmethyl)tin dichlorides, [(RCH2)2SnCl2] in good yields. At 160&#8201;&#176;C in mesitylene bis(1&#8208;naphthylmethyl)tin dichloride undergoes Sn&#8722;C homolytic cleavage to generate two 1&#8208;naphthylmethyl radicals (1&#8208;C10H7CH2&#8901;) which were trapped by TEMPO (C9H8NO&#8901;). Subsequently, the radicals (RCH2&#8901;) produced in this manner were utilized for efficient substitution reactions with electron&#8208;rich arenes (R&#8242;H; R&#8242;=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, 1,2,4,5&#8208;Me4C6H, 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;Me5C6) to obtain a variety of unsymmetrical diarylmethanes (RR&#8242;CH2). The addition of one equivalent of iodine (I2) to the reaction mixture resulted in a significant increase in the yields of coupled products.

         <title>Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide to Acetate using Heterogenized Hydrophilic Manganese Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable catalysts: Heterogeneous Mn&#8208;porphyrin molecular electrocatalysts are used to efficiently reduce CO2 to acetate in an aqueous environment with a selectivity of 62&#8201;% when immobilized on a glassy carbon electrode using a one&#8208;pot electrografting method. The vertical alignment and higher loading of the electrografted molecules is enabled by the hydrophilic sulfonate groups.







Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value&#8208;added chemicals is a promising strategy to mitigate climate change. Metalloporphyrins have been used as a promising class of stable and tunable catalysts for the electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR) but have been primarily restricted to single&#8208;carbon reduction products. Here, we utilize functionalized earth&#8208;abundant manganese tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;based (Mn&#8208;TPP) molecular electrocatalysts that have been immobilized via electrografting onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to convert CO2 with overall 94&#8201;% Faradaic efficiencies, with 62&#8201;% being converted to acetate. Tuning of Mn&#8208;TPP with electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfonate groups (Mn&#8208;TPPS) introduced mechanistic changes arising from the electrostatic interaction between the sulfonate groups and water molecules, resulting in better surface coverage, which facilitated higher conversion rates than the non&#8208;functionalized Mn&#8208;TPP. For Mn&#8208;TPP only carbon monoxide and formate were detected as CO2 reduction products. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the additional sulfonate groups could alter the C&#8722;C coupling pathway from *CO&#8594;*COH&#8594;*COH&#8208;CO to *CO&#8594;*CO&#8208;CO&#8594;*COH&#8208;CO, reducing the free energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling in the case of Mn&#8208;TPPS. This opens a new approach to designing metalloporphyrin catalysts for two carbon products in CO2RR.

         <title>Magnetic Anisotropy and Relaxation of Pseudotetrahedral [N2O2] Bis&#8208;Chelate Cobalt(II) Single&#8208;Ion Magnets Controlled by Dihedral Twist Through Solvomorphism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt(II)&#8208;based single&#8208;ion magnet is described, for which the zero&#8208;field splitting could be increased by driving the dihedral twist distortion between the planes of the chelate ligands to a new record level. FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR experiments were used to validate the corroborating ab initio calculations and susceptibility data, and enabled magnetic relaxation analysis identifying spin&#8208;phonon coupling processes.







Abstract
The methanol solvomorph 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MeOH of the cobalt(II) complex [Co(LSal,2&#8722;Ph)2] (1) with the sterically demanding Schiff&#8208;base ligand 2&#8208;(([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;ylimino)methyl)phenol (HLSal,2&#8722;Ph) shows the thus far largest dihedral twist distortion between the two chelate planes compared to an ideal pseudotetrahedral arrangement. The cobalt(II) ion in 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MeOH exhibits an easy&#8208;axis anisotropy leading to a spin&#8208;reversal barrier of 55.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which corresponds to an increase of about 17&#8201;% induced by the larger dihedral twist compared to the solvent&#8208;free complex 1. The magnetic relaxation for 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2MeOH is significantly slower compared to 1. An in&#8208;depth frequency&#8208;domain Fourier&#8208;transform (FD&#8208;FT) THz&#8208;EPR study not only allowed the direct measurement of the magnetic transition between the two lowest Kramers doublets for the cobalt(II) complexes, but also revealed the presence of spin&#8208;phonon coupling. Interestingly, a similar dihedral twist correlation is also observed for a second pair of cobalt(II)&#8208;based solvomorphs, which could be benchmarked by FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR.

         <title>3,11&#8208;Diaminodibenzo[a,j]phenazine: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications to Tr&#246;ger's Base&#8208;Forming Ladder Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new aminophenazine functional molecule: It displays efficient photoluminescence and positive luminochromism in organic solvent. Not only useful it is as luminophore, but also does it serve as a building block for Tr&#246;ger's base regioregular ladder polymer. The ladder polymer nicely shows reversible adsorption/desorption behavior of carbon dioxide molecule.







Abstract
A new class of diamino&#8208;substituted &#960;&#8208;extended phenazine compound was synthesized, and its photophysical properties were investigated. The U&#8208;shaped diaminophenazine displayed photoluminescence in solution with moderate quantum yield. The diamino aromatic compound was found applicable to the poly&#8208;condensation with formaldehyde to form Tr&#246;ger's base ladder polymer. The obtained microporous ladder polymer features high CO2 adsorption selectivity against N2, most likely due to the presence of basic nitrogen atoms in the phenazine rings.

         <title>Red&#8208;to&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting PyrrolylBODIPY Dyes: Synthesis, Photophysical Properties and Bioimaging Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Series of pyrrolylBODIPYs were regioselectively synthesized through SNAr reactions between pyrroles and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrachloroBODIPYs or 3,5&#8208;dibromoBODIPY. The resulting pyrrolylBODIPYs with 5&#8208;Cl substituent can be further functionalized to give a series of red&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared emitting dyes and a mitochondrial localization fluorescent probe was further developed.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores with characteristics such as deep tissue penetration, minimal damage to the biological samples, and low background interference, are highly sought&#8208;after materials for in&#8197;vivo and deep&#8208;tissue fluorescence imaging. Herein, series of 3&#8208;pyrrolylBODIPY derivatives and 3,5&#8208;dipyrrolylBODIPY derivatives have been prepared by a facile regioselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (SNAr) on 3,5&#8208;halogenated BODIPY derivatives (3,5&#8208;dibromo or 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrachloroBODIPYs) with pyrroles. The installation of a pyrrolic unit onto the 3&#8208;position of the BODIPY chromophore leads to a dramatic red shift of both the absorption (up to 160&#8197;nm) and the emission (up to 260&#8197;nm) in these resultant 3&#8208;pyrrolylBODIPYs with respect to that of the BODIPY chromophore. Their further 5&#8208;positional functionalization provides a facile way to fine tune their photophysical properties, and these resulting dipyrrolylBODIPYs and functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs show strong absorption in the deep red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR regions (595&#8211;684&#8197;nm) and intense NIR fluorescence emission (650&#8211;715&#8197;nm) in dichloromethane. To demonstrate the applicability of these functionalized pyrrolylBODIPYs as NIR fluorescent probes for cell imaging, pyrrolylBODIPY 6&#8201;a containing mitochondrion&#8208;targeting butyltriphenylphosphonium cationic species was also prepared. It selectively localized in mitochondria of HeLa cells, with low cytotoxicity and intense deep red fluorescence emission.

         <title>Azatriseptanes: Strained Framework Analogs of [7,7,7]Circulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain on the properties: A [7,7,7]circulene analog, azatriseptane, has been synthesized, and its highly strained structure confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and computational studies. The distortion of the typical propeller&#8208;like conformation that is observed for triarylamine significantly affects the &#960;&#8208;electronics as well as the inherent self&#8208;assembly properties of these bridged systems.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of heptagon&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic compounds are essential for understanding the effect of negative curvature on carbon allotropes such as fullerenes and graphenes that have applications in functional organic materials. However, owing to the synthetic difficulties in functionalizing and embedding seven&#8208;membered rings, these strain&#8208;challenged structures are relatively unexplored. We report here the synthesis, characterization, and properties of a triarylamine core bridged with ethano chains at the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;positions. In doing so, we provide access to the first heterocycle containing three fused heptagon rings with a nitrogen at its core (BATA&#8208;NHAc). X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and DFT calculations revealed a remarkably strained structure wherein two of the bridged aryl units approach coplanarity, while the third ring is twisted out of plane at 70&#176;. UV&#8208;vis and emission spectroscopies identify red&#8208;shifted absorption and concentration&#8208;dependent emission profiles, respectively, as a result of the unique conformation and self&#8208;assembly properties of BATA&#8208;NHAc. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry shows a decrease in the oxidation potential for BATA&#8208;NHAc in comparison to the non&#8208;bridged analog. This study opens new avenues in understanding the structure&#8211;property relationships of curved &#960;&#8208;aromatics and the construction of &#960;&#8208;frameworks of increasing complexity.

         <title>Buried Interface Regulation by Bio&#8208;Functional Molecules for Efficient and Stable Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for planar&#8208;type perovskite solar cells by natural bio&#8208;functional interfaces that uses a buried electron&#8208;transport layer made of cobalamin complexed tin oxide (SnO2@B12) is provided. Cobalamin could chemically link SnO2 layer and perovskite layer, resulting in improved perovskite film quality and interfacial defect passivation.







Abstract
Among the factors that lead to the reduction of the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) the difficulty involved in realizing a high&#8208;quality film and the efficient charge transfer that takes place at the interface between electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and perovskite is worth mentioning. Here, a strategy for planar&#8208;type devices by natural bio&#8208;functional interfaces that uses a buried electron&#8208;transport layer made of cobalamin complexed tin oxide (SnO2@B12) is demonstrated. Having systematically investigated the effects of SnO2@B12 interfacial layer in perovskite solar cells, it can be concluded that cobalamin can chemically link the SnO2 layer and the perovskite layer, resulting in improved perovskite film quality and interfacial defect passivation. Utilizing SnO2@B12 improves the efficiency of planar&#8208;type PSCs by 20.60&#8201;%. Furthermore, after 250&#8197;h of exposure to an ambient atmosphere, unsealed PSCs containing SnO2@B12 degrade by 10&#8201;%. This research provides a viable method for developing bio&#8208;functional molecules that will increase the effectiveness and durability of planar&#8208;perovskite solar cells.

Ring contraction: m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) and m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) were synthesized as ring&#8208;contracted carbaporphyrins with Pd coordination ability. PdII complexes of these carbaporphyrins exhibit red&#8208;shifted absorption bands and small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps despite their small &#960;&#8208;electronic networks, probably due to the extremely short Pd&#8722;C bonds.







Abstract
m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) and m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) were prepared as ring&#8208;contracted carbaporphyrins. While m&#8208;Benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) was unstable, m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) was fairly stable. Both of their PdII complexes showed distorted coordination structures with extremely short Pd&#8722;C bonds. As compared with the reported m&#8208;benziporphyrin PdII complexes, these PdII complexes showed considerably small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps, despite their smaller molecular size. PdII metalation of the m&#8208;pyreniporphyrin(1.1.0.0) dimer gave the corresponding PdII complex, which showed similar distorted coordination and a smaller HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Finally, PdII metalation of a pyrene&#8208;sharing formal p&#8208;benziporphyrin(1.1.1.1) dimer gave a nonaromatic PdII dimer, which rearranged to an aromatic PdII complex upon treatment with alumina.

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Dependent Photoexcitation Processes of &#960;&#8208;Stacked Ion Pairs</title>

Various combinations of porphyrin ions with controlled electronic states were achieved by ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory. The transient absorption spectra of the porphyrin ion pairs revealed photoinduced electron transfer from the anion to the cation through substituent&#8208;dependent photoexcitation processes.







Abstract
Porphyrin ion pairs, the charge of which is delocalized in core units, form tightly associated structures through i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions. 5,10,15&#8208;Triphenyl&#8208;substituted porphyrin&#8211;AuIII complex, which is favorable for forming stacked structures in the form of a stable ion, has been synthesized. Ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the hard and soft acids and bases theory enabled combination with porphyrin anions possessing electronic states controlled by electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Transient absorption spectroscopy suggested that the lifetimes of the radical pairs generated by photoinduced electron transfer of the ion pairs could be controlled by a judicious combination of the anions and cations.

         <title>Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by a De Novo Designed Metalloprotein that Undergoes Ni&#8208;Mediated Oligomerization Shift</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo H2 evolving metallopeptide is constructed from first principles, which undergoes oligomerization change in the presence of NiII. Under white light, the metallopeptide produces H2 via a reductive quenching pathway. The timescales of ET and the role of thiol pKa is determined from TAS kinetics and pH titration experiments, respectively. Outer sphere steric modulation shows preferential binding of H+ to Ni from N&#8208;termini.







Abstract
De novo metalloprotein design involves the construction of proteins guided by specific repeat patterns of polar and apolar residues, which, upon self&#8208;assembly, provide a suitable environment to bind metals and produce artificial metalloenzymes. While a wide range of functionalities have been realized in de novo designed metalloproteins, the functional repertoire of such constructs towards alternative energy&#8208;relevant catalysis is currently limited. Here we show the application of de novo approach to design a functional H2 evolving protein. The design involved the assembly of an amphiphilic peptide featuring cysteines at tandem a/d sites of each helix. Intriguingly, upon NiII addition, the oligomers shift from a major trimeric assembly to a mix of dimers and trimers. The metalloprotein produced H2 photocatalytically with a bell&#8208;shape pH dependence, having a maximum activity at pH&#8197;5.5. Transient absorption spectroscopy is used to determine the timescales of electron transfer as a function of pH. Selective outer sphere mutations are made to probe how the local environment tunes activity. A preferential enhancement of activity is observed via steric modulation above the NiII site, towards the N&#8208;termini, compared to below the NiII site towards the C&#8208;termini.

         <title>Absolute Configuration Determination of Chiral API Molecules by MicroED Analysis of Cocrystal Powders Formed Based on Cocrystal Propensity Prediction Calculations
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new and robust pipeline for absolute configuration determination is presented here. First, virtual screening selects chiral probes compatible with the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Second, crystallization trials produce microcrystals suitable for analysis without further optimization. Finally, MicroED is used to determine the crystal structure. The absolute configuration of the API can be confidently assigned relative to the chiral probe.







Abstract
Establishing the absolute configuration of chiral active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is of great importance. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (scXRD) has traditionally been the method of choice for such analysis, but scXRD requires the growth of large crystals, which can be challenging. Here, we present a method for determining absolute configuration that does not rely on the growth of large crystals. By examining microcrystals formed with chiral probes (small chiral compounds such as amino acids), absolute configuration can be unambiguously determined by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED). Our streamlined method employs three steps: (1) virtual screening to identify promising chiral probes, (2) experimental cocrystal screening and (3) structure determination by MicroED and absolute configuration assignment. We successfully applied this method to analyze two chiral API molecules currently on the market for which scXRD was not used to determine absolute configuration.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new and robust pipeline&lt;/b&gt; for absolute configuration determination is presented here. First, virtual screening selects chiral probes compatible with the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Second, crystallization trials produce microcrystals suitable for analysis without further optimization. Finally, MicroED is used to determine the crystal structure. The absolute configuration of the API can be confidently assigned relative to the chiral probe.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Intermolecular Covalent Interactions: Nature and Directionality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>

There is a hole in the model! The directionality of intermolecular pnictogen, chalcogen, and halogen bonds comes forth from minimizing closed&#8208;shell Pauli repulsion between bond donor and acceptor. The &#963;&#8208;hole model lacks the fundamental physics behind intermolecular electrostatic interactions and consequently attributes their directionality erroneously to maximizing the electrostatic attraction.







Abstract
Quantum chemical methods were employed to analyze the nature and the origin of the directionality of pnictogen (PnB), chalcogen (ChB), and halogen bonds (XB) in archetypal FmZ&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722; complexes (Z=Pn, Ch, X), using relativistic density functional theory (DFT) at ZORA&#8208;M06/QZ4P. Quantitative Kohn&#8208;Sham MO and energy decomposition analyses (EDA) show that all these intermolecular interactions have in common that covalence, that is, HOMO&#8722;LUMO interactions, provide a crucial contribution to the bond energy, besides electrostatic attraction. Strikingly, all these bonds are directional (i.e., F&#8722;Z&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722; is approximately linear) despite, and not because of, the electrostatic interactions which, in fact, favor bending. This constitutes a breakdown of the &#963;&#8208;hole model. It was shown how the &#963;&#8208;hole model fails by neglecting both, the essential physics behind the electrostatic interaction and that behind the directionality of electron&#8208;rich intermolecular interactions. Our findings are general and extend to the neutral, weaker ClI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NH3, HClTe&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NH3, and H2ClSb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NH3 complexes.

         <title>Origin of Stereoselectivity in SE2&#8242; Reactions of Six&#8208;membered Ring Oxocarbenium Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>

Bottoms up! Quantum chemical analyses of the transition states of SE2&#8242; reactions between substituted six&#8208;membered oxocarbenium ions and allyltrimethylsilane have provided quantitative insight into the stereoelectronic effects of the ring substituents, which dictate the stereoselectivity of the additions.







Abstract
Oxocarbenium ions are key reactive intermediates in organic chemistry. To generate a series of structure&#8208;reactivity&#8208;stereoselectivity principles for these species, we herein investigated the bimolecular electrophilic substitution reactions (SE2&#8242;) between allyltrimethylsilane and a series of archetypal six&#8208;membered ring oxocarbenium ions using a combined density functional theory (DFT) and coupled&#8208;cluster theory approach. These reactions preferentially proceed following a reaction path where the oxocarbenium ion transforms from a half chair (3H4 or 4H3) to a chair conformation. The introduction of alkoxy substituents on six&#8208;membered ring oxocarbenium ions, dramatically influences the conformational preference of the canonical 3H4 and 4H3 conformers, and thereby the stereochemical outcome of the SE2&#8242; reaction. In general, we find that the stereoselectivity in the reactions correlates to the &#8220;intrinsic preference&#8221; of the cations, as dictated by their shape. However, for the C5&#8208;CH2OMe substituent, steric factors override the &#8220;intrinsic preference&#8221;, showing a more selective reaction than expected based on the shape of the ion. Our SE2&#8242; energetics correlate well with experimentally observed stereoselectivity, and the use of the activation strain model has enabled us to quantify important interactions and structural features that occur in the transition state of the reactions to precisely understand the relative energy barriers of the diastereotopic addition reactions. The fundamental mechanistic insight provided in this study will aid in understanding the reactivity of more complex glycosyl cations featuring multiple substituents and will facilitate our general understanding of glycosylation reactions.

A green and efficient strategy for synthesizing phosphorus modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is proposed by grinding phosphorus source, silicon source and aluminum source with the solvent&#8208;free conditions. Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited higher light olefin selectivity and longer catalytic lifetime (33&#8197;h) in methanol to olefin reaction when the weight hourly space velocity was 4&#8197;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The traditional hydrothermal synthesis strategy of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is energy&#8208;consumption accompanying by pollution issues. Herein, phosphorus&#8208;modified layered ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites (PZ) were obtained by one&#8208;pot synthesis under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The synthesized samples were fully characterized by XRD, SEM, BET, NH3&#8208;TPD and FTIR. The effect of phosphorus addition on the morphology and catalytic activity of ZSM&#8208;5 was investigated. The results showed that phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited higher light olefin (ethylene and propylene) selectivity (above 50&#8201;%) and longer catalytic lifetime (33&#8197;h) in methanol to olefin (MTO) reaction when the weight hourly space velocity was 4&#8197;h&#8722;1. Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite synthesized by in&#8197;situ solvent&#8208;free method, which not only reduced the discharge of sewage but also showed a simple method to realize the introduction of phosphorous species, which provided a new idea for phosphorus modification of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite.

         <title>An Efficient, Site&#8208;Selective and Spontaneous Peptide Macrocyclisation During in&#8197;vitro Translation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cyclisation approach for peptides, derived from in&#8197;vitro translation, is developed that is highly selective for N&#8208;terminal cysteines. This approach allows other cysteine residues to be exploited for further peptide diversification. A model peptide showed a large impact from this cyclisation on binding and biological activity, and molecular dynamics was used to illustrate how this cyclisation change can influence peptide conformation.







Abstract
Macrocyclisation provides a means of stabilising the conformation of peptides, often resulting in improved stability, selectivity, affinity, and cell permeability. In this work, a new approach to peptide macrocyclisation is reported, using a cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;containing amino acid that can be incorporated into peptides by both in&#8197;vitro translation and solid phase peptide synthesis, meaning it should be applicable to peptide discovery by mRNA display. This cyclisation proceeds rapidly, with minimal by&#8208;products, is selective over other amino acids including non N&#8208;terminal cysteines, and is compatible with further peptide elaboration exploiting such an additional cysteine in bicyclisation and derivatisation reactions. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the new cyclisation group is likely to influence the peptide conformation as compared to previous thioether&#8208;based approaches, through rigidity and intramolecular aromatic interactions, illustrating their complementarity.

This approach allows other cysteine residues to be exploited for further peptide diversification. A model peptide showed a large impact from this cyclisation on binding and biological activity, and molecular dynamics was used to illustrate how this cyclisation change can influence peptide conformation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrocyclisation provides a means of stabilising the conformation of peptides, often resulting in improved stability, selectivity, affinity, and cell permeability. In this work, a new approach to peptide macrocyclisation is reported, using a cyanobenzothiazole-containing amino acid that can be incorporated into peptides by both in&#8197;vitro translation and solid phase peptide synthesis, meaning it should be applicable to peptide discovery by mRNA display. This cyclisation proceeds rapidly, with minimal by-products, is selective over other amino acids including non &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-terminal cysteines, and is compatible with further peptide elaboration exploiting such an additional cysteine in bicyclisation and derivatisation reactions. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the new cyclisation group is likely to influence the peptide conformation as compared to previous thioether-based approaches, through rigidity and intramolecular aromatic interactions, illustrating their complementarity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quinoid Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles with NIR&#8208;II Absorption Peak Toward Efficient Photothermal Therapy
</title>

Quinoid conjugated polymer PIS with broad absorption in the NIR&#8208;II region is developed based on multiple strategies. Benefiting from its remarkable photothermal conversion behavior under NIR&#8208;II laser (1064&#8197;nm), PIS nanoparticles show excellent antitumor performances in both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies. This work presents a rational design strategy to explore NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents for hyperthermia therapy.







Abstract
Recently, extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of the second near&#8208;infrared bio&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) theranostic agents owing to the excellent tissue&#8208;penetration capability of NIR&#8208;II light. The exploration of organic NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy materials, especially those with absorption peak over 1000&#8197;nm, is an appealing yet significantly challenging task. Herein, we have designed conjugated polymer nanoparticles (PIS NPs) with NIR&#8208;II absorption peak at 1026&#8197;nm through a combined strategy of introducing quinoid donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structures, constructing intramolecular &#8220;conformational locks&#8221; and extending the conjugation area to narrow the band gap. Irradiated at 1064&#8197;nm, PIS NPs showed remarkable photothermal conversion performance for efficient photothermal ablation of tumor cells in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. This study provides useful insights into the rational design of organic NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents based on multiple strategies.

         <title>Heteroaryl&#8208;Substituted Bis&#8208;Anils: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE) Derivatives with Tunable ESIPT Emission Color and pH Sensitivity</title>

A series of heteroaryl&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;anil derivatives is described which present aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) coupled with an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process.







Abstract
The two&#8208;step synthesis, structural, and photophysical properties of a series of heteroaryl&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;anil derivatives presenting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) coupled with an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process is described. The fluorescence color of the aggregates can be fine tuned by changing the electronic nature of the peripheral substitution, leading to a wide range of emission wavelengths (from green to the near infra&#8208;red). Moreover, upon introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as cyano (CN), a competition between ESIPT and deprotonation is observed leading to the emission of the anionic species at low water percentage. This observation led to the synthesis of an additional mixed AIE fluorophore, functionalized by methoxy groups on one side and cyano groups on the other side. Upon addition of water, this dye displays first anionic emission, followed by typical AIE/ESIPT red fluorescence upon formation of the aggregates. TD&#8208;DFT calculations on selected AIE dyes were performed to rationalize the nature of the emissive transitions in these derivatives.

         <title>The Role of the Redox Non&#8208;Innocent Hydroxyl Ligand in the Activation of O2 Performed by [Ni(H)(OH)]+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism of dioxygen activation by [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was studied by a state&#8208;of&#8208;art multiconfigurational calculations. The role of redox&#8208;non&#8208;innocent hydroxyl in [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was elucidated, that is an energy reservoir instead of being the reaction center as what most of bioinorganic complexes show.







Abstract
The cationic complex [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was previously found to activate dioxygen and methane in gas phase under single collision conditions. These remarkable reactivities were thought to originate from a non&#8208;classical electronic structure, where the Ni&#8208;center adopts a Ni(II), instead of the classically expected Ni(III) oxidation state by formally accepting an electron from the hydroxo ligand, which formally becomes a hydroxyl radical in the process. Such radicaloid oxygen moieties are envisioned to easily react with otherwise inert substrates, mimicking familiar reactivities of free radicals. In this study, the reductive activation of dioxygen by [Ni(H)(OH)]+ to afford the hydroperoxo species was investigated using coupled cluster, multireference ab initio and density functional theory calculations. Orbital and wave function analyses indicate that O2 binding tranforms the aforementioned non&#8208;classical electronic structure to a classical Ni(III)&#8208;hydroxyl system, before O2 reduction takes place. Remarkably, we found no evidence for a direct involvement of the radicaloid hydroxyl in the reaction with O2, as is often assumed. The function of the redox non&#8208;innocent character of the activator complex is to protect the reactive electronic structure until the complex engages O2, upon which a dramatic electronic reorganization releases internal energy and drives the chemical reaction to completion.

         <title>Ability of Azathiacyclen Ligands To Stop Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Induced Production of Reactive Oxygen Species: [3N1S] Is the Right Donor Set</title>

Speedy silencer: Five 12&#8208;membered macrocycles ranging from the [4N] to the [1N3S] binding set were challenged for their ability to stop and prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species induced by the Cu(A&#946;) complex, where A&#946; is the Alzheimer&#8208;related peptide. The most appropriate ligand was [3N1S], which combines redox silencing of the copper ion with the speed of Cu removal from A&#946;.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that leads to the progressive and irreversible loss of mental functions. The amyloid beta (A&#946;) peptide involved in the disease is responsible for the production of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) when bound to Cu ions. A therapeutic approach that consists of removing Cu ions from A&#946; to alter this deleterious interaction is currently being developed. In this context, we report the ability of five different 12&#8208;membered thiaazacyclen ligands to capture Cu from A&#946; and to redox silence it. We propose that the presence of a sole sulfur atom in the ligand increases the rate of Cu capture and removal from A&#946;, while the kinetic aspect of the chelation was an issue encountered with the 4N parent ligand. The best ligand for removing Cu from A&#946; and inhibiting the associated ROS production is the 1&#8208;thia&#8208;4,7,10&#8208;triazacyclododecane [3N1S]. Indeed the replacement of more N by S atoms makes the corresponding Cu complexes easier to reduce and thus able to produce ROS on their own. In addition, the ligand with three sulfur atoms has a weaker affinity for CuII than A&#946;, and is thus unable to remove Cu from CuA&#946;.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations in a Mixed Porphyrin(Cu2+)/Trityl Spin System: Magnitude, Sign, and Distribution of the Exchange Coupling Constant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of multi&#8208;frequency continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance and density functional theory calculations were used to determine the magnitude, sign, and distribution of the exchange coupling constant J in a biradical consisting of a trityl radical and a copper(II)tetraphenylporphyrin. The ferromagnetic exchange coupling and its distribution are related to the structure and dynamics of the biradical.







Abstract
Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals (TAM or trityl) are receiving increasing attention in various fields of magnetic resonance such as imaging, dynamic nuclear polarization, spin labeling, and, more recently, molecular magnetism and quantum information technology. Here, a trityl radical attached via a phenyl bridge to a copper(II)tetraphenylporphyrin was synthesized, and its magnetic properties studied by multi&#8208;frequency continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic measurements. EPR revealed that the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling constant J between the trityl and Cu2+ spin centers is ferromagnetic with a magnitude of &#8722;2.3&#8197;GHz (&#8722;0.077&#8197;cm&#8722;1, 
 convention) and a distribution width of 1.2&#8197;GHz (0.040&#8197;cm&#8722;1). With the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the obtained ferromagnetic exchange coupling, which is unusual for para&#8208;substituted phenyl&#8208;bridged biradicals, could be related to the almost perpendicular orientation of the phenyl linker with respect to the porphyrin and trityl ring planes in the energy minimum, while the J distribution was rationalized by the temperature weighted rotation of the phenyl bridge about the molecular axis connecting both spin centers. This study exemplifies the importance of molecular dynamics for the homogeneity (or heterogeneity) of the magnetic properties of trityl&#8208;based systems.

         <title>Molecular Design and Crystal Chemistry of Polyfluorinated Naphthalene&#8208;bis&#8208;phenylhydrazimides with Superior Thermal and Polymorphic Stability and High Solution Processability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyfluorinated naphthalene&#8208;bis&#8208;phenylhydrazimides show high chemical and thermal inertness, possess rather low LUMO energies (down to &#8722;4.37&#8197;eV) and significantly high solubilities. All these features indicate that they are promising n&#8208;type semiconductors for a variety of organic electronics applications.







Abstract
Naphthalene tetracarboxylic diimides (NDIs) are highly promising air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type molecular semiconductor candidates for flexible and cost&#8208;effective organic solar cells and thermoelectrics. Nonetheless, thermal and polymorphic stabilities of environmentally stable NDIs in the low&#8208;to&#8208;medium temperature regime (&lt;300&#8201;&#176;C) remain challenging properties. Structural, thermal, spectroscopic, and computational features of polyfluorinated NDI&#8208;based molecular solids (with up to 14 F atoms per NDI molecule) are discussed upon increasing the fluorination level. Slip&#8208;stacked arrangement of the NDI cores with suitable &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and systematically short interplanar distances (&lt;3.2&#8197;&#197;) are found. All these materials exhibit superior thermal stability (up to 260&#8201;&#176;C or above) and thermal expansion coefficients indicating a response compatible with flexible polymeric substrates. Optical bandgaps increase from 2.78 to 2.93&#8197;eV with fluorination, while LUMO energy levels decrease down to &#8722;4.37&#8197;eV, as shown per DFT calculations. The compounds exhibit excellent solubility of 30&#8197;mg mL&#8722;1 in 1,4&#8208;dioxane and DMF.

         <title>Hierarchically Organized Cocrystal of Tetra&#8208;Anionic Porphyrin and Di&#8208;Cationic Viologen: Ion Conformations, Supramolecule Interactions, and Porphyrin Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>

A hierarchically organized cocrystal of meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TSPP4&#8722;) and N, N&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;viologen (DEV2+) is reported, wherein wave&#8208;like and saddle&#8208;like TSPP4&#8722; ions co&#8208;aggregate at a stoichiometric ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 to form unique J&#8208;type porphyrin arrays. The crystal incorporates six ionic conformations which lead to intricate supramolecular interactions.







Abstract
Ionic co&#8208;assembly of tetra&#8208;anionic porphyrins has been extensively researched in the construction of hierarchically organized architectures with potential application value in organic semiconductors, sunlight catalysts and supramolecular chirality systems. However, such architectures are difficult to grow to a size suitable for single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD); the lack of single&#8208;crystal structures of these architectures leads to challenges in gaining deeper comprehension about that. This study reports a hierarchically organized cocrystal of meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonato&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TSPP4&#8722;) and N, N&#8242;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;viologen (DEV2+), wherein wave&#8208;like and saddle&#8208;like TSPP4&#8722; ions co&#8208;aggregate at a stoichiometric ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 to form unique porphyrin arrays; the spectrum characteristics and calculated coulombic exciton coupling energy show that these porphyrin arrays are J&#8208;aggregates. We prove that the distortion of porphyrin ring of TSPP4&#8722; strongly correlates with the deflection of its phenyl groups. The crystal comprises six different ionic conformations, and the multiplicity of ionic conformation leads to intricate supramolecular interactions.

         <title>Molecular Insights into Bifunctional Ambruticin DH3 for Substrate Specificity and Catalytic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The theoretical study uncovers both the structural rationale for substrate specificity of the first bifunctional dehydratase&#8208;cyclase AsmDH3 and a complete one&#8208;base catalytic mechanism including dehydration and cyclization.







Abstract
Dehydratase (DH), a domain located at polyketide synthase (PKS) modules, commonly catalyzes the dehydration of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy to an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl intermediate. As a unique bifunctional dehydratase, AmbDH3 (the DH domain of module 3 of the ambruticin PKS) is verified to be responsible for both dehydration and the following pyran&#8208;forming cyclization. Besides, in&#8197;vitro studies showed that its catalytic efficiency varies with different chiral substrates. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of AmbDH3 remains unclear. In this work, the structural rationale for the substrate specificity (2R/2S&#8208; and 6R/6S&#8208;substrates) in AmbDH3 was elucidated and the complete reaction pathways including dehydration and cyclization were presented. Both MD simulations and binding free energy calculations indicated AmbDH3 had a stronger preference for 2R&#8208;substrates (2R6R&#8208;2, 2R6S&#8208;3) than 2S&#8208;substrates (2S6R&#8208;1), and residue H51 and G61 around the catalytic pocket were emphasized by forming stable hydrogen bonds with 2R&#8208;substrates. In addition, AmbDH3&#8217;s mild tolerance at C6 was explained by comparison of substrate conformation and hydrogen bond network in 6S&#8208; and 6R&#8208;substrate systems. The QM/MM results supported a consecutive one&#8208;base dehydration and cyclization mechanism for 2R6S&#8208;3 substrate with the energy barrier of 25.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and 24.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively. Our computational results uncover the substrate recognition and catalytic process of the first bifunctional dehydratase&#8208;cyclase AmbDH3, which will shed light on the application of multifunctional DH domains in PKSs for diverse natural product analogs and benefit the chemoenzymatic synthesis of stereoselective pyran&#8208;containing products.

Our computational results uncover the substrate recognition and catalytic process of the first bifunctional dehydratase-cyclase AmbDH3, which will shed light on the application of multifunctional DH domains in PKSs for diverse natural product analogs and benefit the chemoenzymatic synthesis of stereoselective pyran-containing products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dinitrogen Activation in the Gas Phase: Spectroscopic Characterization of C&#8722;N Coupling in the V3C++N2 Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of V3C+ with N2 is studied using IRPD spectroscopy. The cleavage of N&#8801;N bond and the subsequent C&#8722;N coupling is undoubtedly confirmed by the observed IR&#8208;active C=N stretching fundamental in the fingerprint region of the vibrational action spectrum. This work represents the first spectroscopic observation of the formed C&#8722;N bond directly from N2 in gas phase.







Abstract
We report on cluster&#8208;mediated C&#8722;N bond formation in the gas phase using N2 as a nitrogen source. The V3C++N2 reaction is studied by a combination of ion&#8208;trap mass spectrometry with infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy and complemented by electronic structure calculations. The proposed reaction mechanism is spectroscopically validated by identifying the structures of the reactant and product ions. V3C+ exhibits a pyramidal structure of C1&#8208;symmetry. N2 activation is initiated by adsorption in an end&#8208;on fashion at a vanadium site, followed by spontaneous cleavage of the N&#8801;N triple bond and subsequent C&#8722;N coupling. The IRPD spectrum of the metal nitride product [NV3(C=N)]+ exhibits characteristic C=N double bond (1530&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and V&#8722;N single bond (770, 541 and 522&#8197;cm&#8722;1) stretching bands.

         <title>Engineering Sandwiched Nanochannel Aptasensor for Efficiently Screening Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aptamer sandwiched nanochannel electrochemical sensor was constructed for the highly selective determination of cancer cells. The structure design of nanochannel composite aptasensor not only presents an efficacious and reliable approach for cancer cell detection but also provides advantage for preventing electrode passivation in the process of biomarkers analysis.







Abstract
Cancer cells are a class of important tumor biomarkers and are closely related to tumorous progression. It is urgent to develop a sensitive and highly efficient method for the rapid and accurate detection of cancer cells. Herein, an aptamer sandwiched nanochannel electrochemical sensor was established for the highly selective determination of cancer cells. By virtue of the porous nanochannels as the filter platform and immobilized with DNA aptamers for specifically capturing the cancer cells, the nanochannel&#8208;based electrochemical sensor denotes excellent performance for MCF&#8208;7 screening, and allowing a low limit of detection of 36&#8197;cells&#8201;mL&#8722;1. The nanochannels&#8208;based sandwich structure aptasensor not only presents an efficacious and reliable approach for cancer cell detection but also provides great advantage for preventing electrode passivation in the process of biomarkers analysis.

Unearthing azatriseptane: Explore the properties and potential of a newly synthesized, highly strained carbon framework with a nitrogen core, containing three fused heptagon rings. This heterocycle could serve as an encouraging platform from which to explore the supramolecular behavior of these contorted hydrogen&#8208;bonding systems or to obtain negatively curved nanographenes.

         <dc:description>
Some organic molecules undergo cooperative photoreaction processes in crystals, which have received little attention. An appropriate understanding of the basic reaction process is important for a dynamic understanding of property changes. In this Review article, K. Morimoto et&#8197;al. summarize multiple examples of photochemical reactions in the crystalline phase that do not follow classical kinetic behavior. They also discuss different theoretical methods that can be used to describe this behavior.

         <title>Cover Feature: Ability of Azathiacyclen Ligands To Stop Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Induced Production of Reactive Oxygen Species: [3N1S] Is the Right Donor Set (Chem. Eur. J. 14/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>

Cu bound to A&#946; (heads of the meteorites) produces reactive oxygen species (tails) that attack the brain. In the presence of the azamacrocyclic ligand 3N1S (the green belt), the Cu ions are removed by the ligand (the head of the meteorite is broken) and the ROS production is abolished (the tail disappears). Hence, the brain is safe behind its shield. In absence of 3N1S, the ROS produced by Cu(A&#946;) attack the brain, which is &#8220;destroyed&#8221;. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Esmieu, C. Hureau, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203667).

Various combinations of charged porphyrins with controlled electronic states were achieved by ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the HSAB theory. The transient absorption spectra of the porphyrin ion pairs revealed photoinduced electron transfer from the anion to the cation through substituent&#8208;dependent photoexcitation processes. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Kobayashi, H. Maeda, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203957).

         <title>Hybrid Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: Structures and Functional Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simply HOF! This work reviewed the recent development progress of hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), including ionic HOFs and metallized HOFs. The rational design synthesis principles of stable, porous, and functional hybrid HOFs by using charged or metallized building blocks are discussed. Their front applications in selective inclusion, proton conduction, gas separation, and catalysis are highlighted.







Abstract
As a new class of porous crystalline materials, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) assembled from building blocks by hydrogen bonds have gained increasing attention. HOFs benefit from advantages including mild synthesis, easy purification, and good recyclability. However, some HOFs transform into unstable frameworks after desolvation, which hinders their further applications. Nowadays, the main challenges of developing HOFs lie in stability improvement, porosity establishment, and functionalization. Recently, more and more stable and permanently porous HOFs have been reported. Of all these design strategies, stronger charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds and coordination bonds have been proven to be effective for developing stable, porous, and functional solids called hybrid HOFs, including ionic and metallized HOFs. This Review discusses the rational design synthesis principles of hybrid HOFs and their cutting&#8208;edge applications in selective inclusion, proton conduction, gas separation, catalysis and so forth.

         <title>Cooperative Photochemical Reaction Kinetics in Organic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 14, March 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In organic molecular crystals, many photoreactions do not obey simple kinetic models, but instead follow nucleation&#8208;growth kinetics. This kind of reaction is often called a cooperative reaction because the reaction of an individual molecule is facilitated (or inhibited) by its neighbors.







Abstract
Photoreactive molecular crystals have been intensively investigated as next&#8208;generation functional materials. Changes in physicochemical properties are usually interpreted in terms of static pre&#8208; and post&#8208;reaction molecular structures and packings determined by X&#8208;ray structure analysis. However, to elucidate the dynamic properties, it is necessary to understand the dynamic nature of photochemical kinetics in crystals. Reaction dynamics in the crystal phase can be dramatically different from those in dilute solution because the local molecular environment evolves as the surrounding reactant molecules are transformed into products. In this Review article, we summarize multiple examples of photochemical reactions in the crystalline phase that do not follow classical kinetic behavior. We also discuss different theoretical methods that can be used to describe this behavior. This Review article should help provide a foundation for future workers to understand and analyze photochemical reaction kinetics in crystals.

         <title>Rationalizing the Optimization of Detergents for Membrane Protein Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane protein purification by means of detergents is key to isolating membrane&#8208;bound therapeutic targets. The role of the detergent structure in this process, however, is not well understood. Detergents are optimized empirically, leading to failed preparations, and thereby raising costs. Here we evaluate the utility of the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB) concept, which was introduced by Griffin in 1949, for guiding the optimization of the hydrophobic tail in first&#8208;generation, dendritic oligoglycerol detergents ([G1] OGDs). Our findings deliver qualitative HLB guidelines for rationalizing the optimization of detergents. Moreover, [G1] OGDs exhibit strongly delipidating properties, regardless of the structure of the hydrophobic tail, which delivers a methodological enabling step for investigating binding strengths of endogenous lipids and their role for membrane protein oligomerization. Our findings will facilitate the analysis of challenging drug targets in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>A BF2 Chelate Exhibiting Excimer&#8208;like Fluorescence with an Unusually Large Stokes Shift in the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The target mono&#8208;BF2 complex is weakly emissive in fluid solution because radiationless decay of the excited&#8208;singlet state is promoted through an intramolecular N&#8230;H&#8211;N hydrogen bond. The lack of mirror symmetry for this compound is attributed to vibronic effects, as reported previously for the bis&#8208;BF2 complex (BOPHY). Red&#8208;shifted fluorescence is observed from single crystals, the emission quantum yield approaching 30% with a fluorescence lifetime of 2 ns. The large Stokes shift of 5,700 cm&#8208;1 helps minimize self&#8208;absorption. Crystallography indicates that the internal fold and twist angles are increased substantially in the crystal, but the hydrogen bond is weakened relative to solution. The crystal structure is compiled from pairs of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail molecules having a shift of ca. 4.1 &#197; and closest approach of ca. 3.5 &#197;. These molecular pairs are arranged in columns, which, in turn, assemble into sheets. The proximity favours excitonic coupling between individual molecules, with the coupling strength obtained by analysis of the absorption spectrum reaching ca. 1,000 cm&#8208;1. Both the ideal dipole approximation and the extended dipole methodology seriously overestimate the coupling strength, but the atomic transition charge density procedure leads to good agreement with experiment. Emission is attributed to the closely coupled molecular pair functioning in an excimer&#8208;like manner with the exciton trapped in a local minimum. Increasing temperature causes a slight blue shift and loss of fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Shell and Kernel Modifications of Atomically Precise Pd/Ag Superatomic Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first 8&#8208;electron Pd/Ag superatomic alloys with an interstitial hydride [PdHAg19(dtp)12] (dtp = S2P(O i Pr)2&#8208;) 1 and [PdHAg20(dtp)12]+2 are reported. The targeted addition of a single Ag atom to 1 is achieved by the reaction of one equivalent of trifluoroacetic acid, resulting in the formation of 2 in 55% yield. Further modification of the shell results in the formation of [PdAg21(dtp)12]+3 via an internal redox reaction, with the system retaining an 8&#8208;electron superatomic configuration. The interstitial hydride in 1 and 2, contributes its 1s1 electron to the superatomic electron count, and occupies a PdAg3 tetrahedron. The distributions of isomers corresponding to different dispositions of the outer capping Ag atoms are investigated by multinuclear VT&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. The emissive state of 3 has a lifetime of 200 &#956;s (&#955;ex =448; &#955;em =842), while 1 and 2 are non&#8208;emissive. The catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol is demonstrated with 1&#8208;3 at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of Chiroptical and Photophysical Properties in Helicenic Rhenium(I) Systems: The Use of an N&#8208;(Aza[6]helicenyl)&#8208;NHC Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel example of circularly polarized rhenium(I) phosphor bearing chiral helicene&#8208;NHC ligand is presented and the comparative study with its helicenic Re(I) congeners highlighted the modulation of the emissive properties by the change in the complex design.







Abstract
The photophysical and chiroptical properties of a novel, chiral helicene&#8208;NHC&#8722;Re(I) complex bearing an N&#8208;(aza[6]helicenyl)&#8208;benzimidazolylidene ligand are described, showing its ability to emit yellow circularly polarized luminescence. A comparative analysis of this new system with other helicene&#8208;Re(I) complexes reported to date illustrates the impact of structural modifications on the emissive and absorptive properties.

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyridinium Salts by Annulation of Enamines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and facile synthesis of highly substituted pyridinium salts through annulation of enamines with alkynes is reported. The keys to this advancement are: 1) one&#8208;pot, mild reaction conditions; 2) broad substrate scope; and 3) selective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization.







Abstract
An efficient and facile synthesis of highly substituted pyridinium salts through the annulation of enamines with alkynes is reported herein. A Ag2CO3/HNTf2 synergistically acting catalyst system was developed and used in a condensation reaction between carbonyl substrates and propargylamine to afford structurally diverse pyridinium salts. A mechanistic investigation shows that this one&#8208;pot transformation proceeded via selective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of the in situ generated propargylenamine and protonolysis of the resulting vinyl&#8211;silver intermediate. The reaction conditions are mild, and the substrate scope is broad. During the cyclization, an unusual inversion of the normal reactivity of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems was observed.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective cyclization of cationic alkynes is a useful tool for the synthesis of biomolecules such as steroids. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202204028), A. de&#8197;C&#243;zar, A. Arrieta and F.&#8197;P. Coss&#237;o analyze computationally how the nature of the alkyne determines the size of the ring and why the conformation of the fused rings dictates the stereoselectivity of the cyclization process.

         <title>Elemental Magnesium as an Early Transition Metal Substitute: From Pentafulvene Coordination to Deprotonation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of magnesium turnings and 6,6&#8208;di&#8208;para&#8208;tolylpentafulvene was investigated. Under mild conditions, the magnesium dissolves, forming the MgII complex 1 with a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5:&#963;&#8208;&#954;1 coordinating ligand of the dimerized pentafulvene, analyzed by NMR and XRD investigations. As a magnesium pentafulvene complex was a possible intermediate, amines were employed as intercepting agents. Thereby, the amines were formally deprotonated by elemental magnesium, yielding the first examples of Cp&#8217;Mg(THF)2NR2 complexes. This reaction competes with the formation of 1 and a consecutive formal [1,5]&#8208;H&#8208;shift forming an ansa&#8208;magnesocene. Employing amines with low basicity gave quantitative conversion to the amide complexes.</dc:description>

Boost the capability of photocatalysts: We report here a family of highly efficient composite photocatalysts composed of terephthalic acid (TPA) ligand and TiO2 with various morphologies (e.&#8201;g., nanoparticles, nanosheets, and nanorods) synthesized by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method in various solvents (i.&#8201;e., H2O, HF, H2SO4, HCl, and HNO3) using Ti&#8208;based MOF (MIL&#8208;125(Ti)) as the precursor.







Abstract
It has been rarely reported the morphological control of derivatives of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in hydrothermal conditions for photocatalytic applications. We report here a family of highly efficient composite photocatalysts composed of terephthalic acid/terephthalate (TPA) ligand and TiO2 with various morphologies (e.&#8201;g., nanoparticles, nanosheets, and nanorods). The composites are synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step hydrothermal method in various solvents (i.&#8201;e., H2O, HF, H2SO4, HCl, and HNO3) using Ti&#8208;based MOF (MIL&#8208;125(Ti)) as precursor. The formation mechanism of composite materials with different morphological features is discussed. Impressively, the composite of TiO2 nanoparticles/TPA synthesized using H2O as solvent under hydrothermal condition exhibits the highest photocatalytic H2 activity among the studied materials, with a photocatalytic H2 production rate of 6.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is approximately 7.5&#8208;fold higher than pure TiO2 (Degussa, P25) and prominent apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 65&#8201;% at 365&#8197;nm. Furthermore, the mechanism of boosted photocatalytic H2 production is discussed.

Molecular interactions are a combination of different attractive and repulsive forces. We have studied the delicate balance within a supramolecular [10]cycloparaphenylene&#8211;fullerene complex&#8212;both functionalized with alkyl esters&#8212;to evaluate the attractive and repulsive interplay between the substituents on the components.

         <title>Syntheses and Biofilm Reducing Effects of l&#8208;Dopa&#8208;Derived Analogues of the Fungal Macrocidins A and Z</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Variations on ring size and polarity: Four hydroxy analogues of the fungal metabolites macrocidin A and Z were synthesised from fully and orthogonally protected l&#8208;dopa derivatives. They showed lesser growth inhibitory and dispersive effects on Staphylococcus aureus biofilms than the l&#8208;tyrosine derived natural leads or the new synthetic (S,S,S)&#8208;normacrocidin A. The more lipophilic hydroxymacrocidin Z analogues were generally more active than the polar hydroxymacrocidin A analogues, regardless of their para&#8208; or metacyclophane connectivity.







Abstract
Four analogues of the fungal metabolites macrocidin A and Z, featuring [13]para&#8208; or [13]metacyclophanes, were synthesised from fully and orthogonally protected l&#8208;dopa instead of l&#8208;tyrosine. They were tested for antibiotic activities and for effects on the growth and persistence of microbial biofilms. Tentative structure&#8208;activity relationships and distinct differences when compared with the natural lead compounds were identified.

         <title>Enabling Long&#8208;Lived Polymeric Room Temperature Phosphorescence Material in Abominable Solvent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient long&#8208;lived polymeric room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent material was achieved based on the rigid structure provided by aromatic and piperidine rings of mBPipQ and the dense molecular arrangement of an epoxy resin, which stabilized triplet excitons. More importantly, these materials exhibit stable yellow&#8208;green phosphorescence emission after being immersed in strong acid or alkali solutions for 10&#8197;days.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lived polymeric room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have drawn more attention due to their convenient preparation process and equally efficient phosphorescence performance in recent years. As the polymer matrix is sensitive to air and humidity, some non&#8208;covalent interactions in the matrix are easily decomposed in water or air, which means that it is difficult for this material to be stored stably for a long time in the atmospheric environment or under harsh conditions. In this work, polymer powder mBPipQ contains aromatic and piperidine rings that are designed and synthesized successfully. Then the polymer is uniformly dispersed into epoxy resin matrix to form long&#8208;lived polymeric RTP material with efficient afterglow properties. The stiff backbone structure of mBPip and dense molecular arrangement of epoxy resin provide a rigid environment to stabilize triplet excitons, the RTP performance is greatly enhanced. The lifetime of mBPipQ in epoxy resin is 2&#8197;times higher than that of small molecule chromophore in that one. Interestingly, after soaking in strong acid or alkali solution for 10&#8197;days, the material can still emit stable and efficient long&#8208;lived phosphorescence. It is thanks to the hard matrix after full curing, which can provide a protective layer to prevent external quenchers from interfering with phosphorescence emission. Utilizing the efficient phosphorescence emission and excellent abominable&#8208;solvent resistance of this RTP material, multilevel information encryption has been successfully demonstrated. This work broadens the application scope of polymeric RTP materials in harsh environments and provides a new idea for achieving efficient RTP emission.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the reversible metal coordination behavior of metallothionine, we hypothesized that a similar strategy could be used to protect and stabilize the reactive functionality of the drug gossypol for its stimuli&#8208;responsive release. The reactive functionalities can be masked in two&#8208;stages by introducing pH&#8208;activatable imine bonds followed by metal ion coordination stabilizing and forming confined molecular structures to release the active drug at the site of action.







Abstract
The major hurdle to the success of many potent chemotherapeutic drugs is the lack of stability of their active form suited for a particular mode of action. Efforts are needed to stabilize such functionalities by employing new and novel strategies to overcome challenges. In this study, tumor&#8208;environment&#8208;specific, pH&#8208;activatable prodrug and metal&#8208;prodrug conjugate has been developed to ameliorate the side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs bearing reactive functionalities. As a proof of concept, a pre&#8208;clinically tested natural compound, gossypol, was modified to form a pH&#8208;responsive prodrug by incorporating an imine linkage amenable to form confined molecular structures through coordination with a bio&#8208;relevant and nontoxic zinc metal ion. Detailed photophysical, computational, and nanoscopic studies revealed the unique zinc ion coordination behavior and its effect on molecular confinement. Computational studies demonstrated that an increasing degree of complexation, with Zn&#8208;N&#8722;Py coordination, gradually turns off fluorescence by reducing the band gap that allows nonradiative decay. In&#8208;vitro prodrug activation and release of gossypol from gossyzid and gossyzid&#8208;Zn were assessed by ESI&#8208;MS and RP&#8208;HPLC studies. The gossyzid and gossyzid&#8208;Zn demonstrated pH&#8208;specific cytotoxicity validated by the number of in&#8208;vitro cellular assays. Such a strategy can essentially be adapted to strengthen many chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance their efficacy and reduce side effects.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Masked Terminal Nickel&#8208;Oxide Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel(II) complex reacted with peroxyphenylacetic acid to yield a nickel(III)&#8211;(hydr)oxide adduct (stabilized through a hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction to an acetate co&#8208;ligand) that displayed all the reactivity properties of a terminal nickel&#8208;oxide oxidant.







Abstract
In exploring terminal nickel&#8208;oxo complexes, postulated to be the active oxidant in natural and non&#8208;natural oxidation reactions, we report the synthesis of the pseudo&#8208;trigonal bipyramidal NiII complexes (K)[NiII(LPh)(DMF)] (1[DMF]) and (NMe4)2[NiII(LPh)(OAc)] (1[OAc]) (LPh=2,2&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;nitrilo&#8208;tris&#8208;(N&#8208;phenylacetamide); DMF=N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide; &#8722;OAc=acetate). Both complexes were characterized using NMR, FTIR, ESI&#8208;MS, and X&#8208;ray crystallography, showing the LPh ligand to bind in a tetradentate fashion, together with an ancillary donor. The reaction of 1[OAc] with peroxyphenyl acetic acid (PPAA) resulted in the formation of [(LPh)NiIII&#8722;O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;OAc]2&#8722;, 2, that displays many of the characteristics of a terminal Ni=O species. 2 was characterized by UV&#8208;Vis, EPR, and XAS spectroscopies and ESI&#8208;MS. 2 decayed to yield a NiII&#8208;phenolate complex 3 (through aromatic electrophilic substitution) that was characterized by NMR, FTIR, ESI&#8208;MS, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. 2 was capable of hydroxylation of hydrocarbons and epoxidation of olefins, as well as oxygen atom transfer oxidation of phosphines at exceptional rates. While the oxo&#8208;wall remains standing, this complex represents an excellent example of a masked metal&#8208;oxide that displays all of the properties expected of the ever elusive terminal M=O beyond the oxo&#8208;wall.

         <title>Melt Castable Derivatives of Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energetic materials: In this work, the pentaerythritol backbone was modified with amine, nitramine and tetrazole functionalities leading to powerful melt castable pentaerythritol tetranitrate derivatives that outperform TNT. Exciting insights into the influence of these functionalities on mechanical sensitivities and melting behavior are observed and discussed.







Abstract
In the search for high&#8208;performance and environmentally friendly energetic materials, the derivatization of known materials is an often&#8208;applied concept to fulfill modern&#8208;day demands. Surprisingly, the long know pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) has only been derivatized to a limited extent. PETN shows a brought application in energetic materials or pharmaceutics. In this work, the PETN backbone is modified by introducing nitramine, ionic nitramine, amine, ionic amine and tetrazole functionalities. The obtained and structurally similar compounds allow good comparability and insights into functional group effects on sensitivity, thermal behavior and performance. The functionalizations result in melting points in the range of 64 to 126&#8201;&#176;C. Some compounds are therefore potential candidates to replace toxic TNT.

         <title>Anion Modulated Expression of Chirality in Hydrogen Bond Templated Mechanically Chiral [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion recognition promotes the shuttling of the macrocyclic ring in mechanically chiral [2]rotaxanes. The position of the macrocycle is reported by changes in the diastereotopic behaviour in the 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum. The macrocycle can be returned to its initial station upon removal of the anion.







Abstract
The syntheses of two novel mechanically chiral rotaxanes containing urea and squaramide motifs (in yields of 33&#8201;% and 22&#8201;%, respectively) are presented. 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic titrations reveal shuttling of the macrocycle &#8211; detectable by modulation of the expression of mechanical chirality in the NMR spectrum &#8211; is possible through the addition of achiral chloride anions, a process which is reversed by the addition of sodium cations.

         <dc:description>Deracemization extended to racemic&#8208;compound&#8208;forming systems is demonstrated. We present here the first results of an alternative for the resolution of systems that exhibit a stable racemic compound but also a closely related conglomerate&#8208;forming system. If the couples of enantiomers forming the racemic compound and the enantiomers of the stable conglomerate can syncrystallize in mirror related partial solid solutions, it is possible to deracemize the racemic mixture of mixed crystals to access to a single handedness. The evidence of that possibility is given on three examples by using Temperature Cycling Induced Deracemization.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Requirements of a Glycolipid MPIase for Membrane Protein Integration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MPIase is a glycolipid involved in membrane protein integration in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. To overcome the trace amounts and heterogeneity of natural MPIase, we systematically synthesized MPIase analogs. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies revealed the contribution of distinctive functional groups and the effect of the MPIase glycan length on membrane protein integration activity. In addition, both the synergistic effects of these analogs with the membrane chaperone/insertase YidC, and the chaperone&#8208;like activity of the phosphorylated glycan were observed. These results verified the translocon&#8208;independent membrane integration mechanism in the inner membrane of E. coli, in which MPIase captures the highly hydrophobic nascent proteins via its characteristic functional groups, prevents protein aggregation, attracts the proteins to the membrane surface, and delivers them to YidC in order to regenerate its own integration activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Construction Of Molecular Borromean Rings And [2]catenane Utilizing Ether Bipyridyl Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of Cp*Rh&#8208;based discrete architectures were constructed through selecting four ether bipyridyl ligands and three half&#8208;sandwich rhodium(III) bimetallic construction units, respectively. This study demonstrates a strategy for making the transition from a binuclear D&#8208;shaped ring to a tetranuclear [2]catenane by adjusting the length of bipyridyl ligands. In addition, changing the position on the naphthyl group of the bipyridyl ligand from 2,6&#8208; to 1,5&#8208;position substitution can realize the selective synthesis of [2]catenane and Borromean Rings under a similar condition. The above&#8208;mentioned constructions have been determined via the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, the detailed NMR techniques, electrospray ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight/mass spectrometry analysis and the elemental analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene oxide&#8208;BODIPY conjugates as bright fluorescent material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) with boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) was achieved through a facile synthesis, affording two different GO&#8208;BODIPY conjugates where the main difference lies in the nature of the spacer and the type of bonds between the two components. The use of a long but flexible spacer afforded strong electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. This drastically altered the light absorption of the BODIPY structure and impeded its selective excitation. In contrast, the utilisation of a short, but rigid spacer based on boronic esters resulted in a perpendicular geometry of the phenyl boronic acid BODIPY (PBA&#8208;BODIPY) with respect to the GO plane, which enables only minor electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. In this case, selective excitation of PBA&#8208;BODIPY was easily achieved, allowing to investigate the excited state interactions. A quantitative ultrafast energy transfer from PBA&#8208;BODIPY to GO was observed. Furthermore, due to the reversible dynamic nature of the covalent GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY linkage, some PBA&#8208;BODIPY is free in solution and, hence, not quenched from GO. This resulted in a weak, but detectable fluorescence from the PBA&#8208;BODIPY that will allow to exploit GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY for slow release and imaging purposes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in a New Family of Photoactive Diimine&#8208;Diphosphine Copper(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of heteroleptic diimine&#8208;diphosphine copper(I) complexes is reported, with six new complexes compared to benchmark [Cu(bcp)(DPEPhos)]PF6. These new complexes are based on 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraazaphenanthrene (TAP) ligands with representative electronic properties as well as substitution patterns and DPEPhos and XantPhos as diphosphine ligands. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties were investigated and correlated with the number and position of substituents on the TAP ligands. Stern&#8208;Volmer studies using H&#252;nig&#8217;s base as reductive quencher demonstrated the influence of the complex photoreduction potential and of the excited state lifetime on the photoreactivity. This study refines the structure&#8208;property relationship profile for heteroleptic copper(I) complexes and confirms that such profiles are of high interest to design new copper complexes as optimized photoredox catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Regioselective E&#8594; Z Isomerization of Trienones with Cascade Sequences under Photosensitizer&#8208;Free Direct Irradiation at 390 nm</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regioselective E &#8594; Z isomerization of a target olefin unit embedded in a conjugated polyene is challenging. Examples are limited only with retinal and its derivatives. The problem is further amplified when such an isomerization is integrated into cascade sequences, among which the regioselectivity and subsequent directionality are the major bottlenecks. Indeed, there are no reports till date for such a transformation. Herein, we report that such a controlled isomerization and subsequent cyclization cascade can be enabled by photosensitizer&#8208;free direct irradiation of linearly conjugated acyclic polyenes in dichloromethane solvent using a 390 nm LED. The directionality results from deconjugation of the extended &#960;&#8208;system in the transient Z&#8208;isomer due to stabilizing n &#8594; &#960;* interactions between 1,4&#8210;dicarbonyls (C=O&#8594;C=O) or 1,4&#8210;carbonyl/&#8210;aryl (C=O&#8594;aryl) groups. The involvement of such noncovalent interactions has been supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography and control experiments. Thus, conjugated trienones can be converted into the oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes stereoselectively in an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic manner, including the first example via regioselective isomerization of a tetrasubstituted alkene. The reaction conditions are very general (&gt;46 examples) and can be conducted in an open air at ambient temperature. Such a cascade cyclization can also be realized in the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Effect of Stabilizers on Anticancer and Antibacterial Activity of AgBiS2 Nanomaterial</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;absorbing AgBiS2 nanoparticles can be excited by single&#8208;wavelength light, which is the primary characteristic of a photoresponsive platform. Chemical synthesis of nanomaterials inevitably requires long&#8208;chain organic surfactants or polymers to stabilize them in the nano regime. These stabilizing molecules barricade the interaction of nanomaterials with biological cells. We have produced stabilizer&#8208;free (sf&#8208;AgBiS2) and polymer&#8208;coated (PEG&#8208;AgBiS2) nanoparticles; and assessed their anticancer and antibacterial activity to evaluate the effect of stabilizers. sf&#8208;AgBiS2 showed better antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and displayed excellent cytotoxicity against HeLa cells compared to PEG&#8208;AgBiS2. The photothermal therapy (PTT) results illustrated the tumor ablation ability of sf&#8208;AgBiS2, which converted light into heat effectively up to 53.3&#176;C under NIR irradiation. This work demonstrates the importance of synthesizing stabilizer&#8208;free nanoparticles to produce safe and highly active PTT agents.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Anionic Ligands on Photoreactivity in Mo(VI) Dioxo Complexes of the Form MoO2X2(NN); NN= 2,2&#180;&#8208;Bipyridyl Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoreactivity of d0 metal dioxo complexes in activating C&#8211;H bonds has been recently studied.1&#8211;3 We have previously reported that MoO2Cl2(bpy&#8208; t Bu) is an effective platform for light initiated C&#8211;H activation with unique product selectivity for the overall functionalization.1 Herein we expand on these studies and report the synthesis and photoreactivity of several new Mo(VI) dioxo complexes with the general formula MoO2(X)2(NN); where X= F&#8211;, Cl&#8211;, Br&#8211;, CH3&#8211;, PhO&#8211;,  t BuO&#8211; and NN= 2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) or 4,4'&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#180;bipyridine (bpy&#8208; t Bu). Among these compounds, MoO2Cl2(bpy&#8208; t Bu) and MoO2Br2(bpy&#8208; t Bu) are able to participate in bimolecular photoreactivity with several substrates containing C&#8211;H bonds of various types such as allyls, benzyls, aldehydes (RCHO) and alkanes. MoO2(CH3)2bpy and MoO2(PhO)2bpy do not participate in bimolecular photoreactions and instead they undergo photodecompositions. Computational studies indicate that the nature of the HOMO and LUMO is critical in supporting photoreactivity, with access to an LMCT (bpy&#224;Mo) being necessary for tractable hydrocarbon functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Healable Elastomeric Network with Dynamic Disulfide, Imine, and Hydrogen Bonds for Flexible Strain Sensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain sensor (PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT&#8208;3) composed of self&#8208;repairable crosslinked elastomer substrate and conductive layer was prepared. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri elastomer had excellent self&#8208;healing ability and good mechanical integrity. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT&#8208;3 sensor had high sensitivity, short response time, and long&#8208;term durability.







Abstract
Self&#8208;healable and stretchable elastomeric material is essential for the development of flexible electronics devices to ensure their stable performance. In this study, a strain sensor (PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT&#8208;3) composed of self&#8208;repairable crosslinked elastomer substrate (PIH2T1&#8208;tri, containing multiple reversible repairing sites such as disulfide, imine, and hydrogen bonds) and conductive layer (carbon nanotube, CNT) was prepared. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri elastomer had excellent self&#8208;healing ability (healing efficiency=91&#8201;%). It exhibited good mechanical integrity in terms of elongation at break (672&#8201;%), tensile strength (1.41&#8197;MPa). The Young's modulus (0.39&#8197;MPa) was close to that of human skin. The PIH2T1&#8208;tri/CNT&#8208;3 sensor also demonstrated an effective self&#8208;healing function for electrical conduction and sensing property. Meanwhile, it had high sensitivity (gauge factor (GF)=24.1), short response time (120&#8197;ms), and long&#8208;term durability (4000&#8197;cycles). This study offers a novel self&#8208;healable elastomer platform with carbon based conductive components to develop flexible strain sensors towards high performance soft electronics.

         <title>Preparation of Ropivacaine Encapsulated by Zeolite Imidazole Framework Microspheres as Sustained&#8208;Release System and Efficacy Evaluation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ropivacaine microspheres encapsulated by zeolite imidazole framework (RVC@ZIF&#8208;8) as sustained&#8208;release system was prepared for the first time. This novel material exhibits a high drug loading rate and superior biological safety, with a continuously release in&#8197;vitro for at least 96&#8197;h, and the sensory block time was more than 72&#8197;h in&#8197;vivo pharmacodynamic.







Abstract
The management of persistent postoperative pain still remains a clinical challenge currently. Although ropivacaine (RVC) is widely used for postoperative analgesia as a local anesthetic, the short half&#8208;life makes it difficult to achieve the desired duration of analgesia. Herein, a RVC sustained&#8208;release microspheres encapsulated by zeolite imidazole framework&#8208;8 (RVC@ZIF&#8208;8) was synthesized for the first time, which prolonged the sustained&#8208;release of RVC and decreased the resulting drug toxicity. RVC can continuously release in&#8197;vitro for at least 96&#8197;h with high drug loading of 30.6&#8201;% and RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 had excellent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity. In sciatic nerve block model, the sensory block time of RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 was significantly prolonged compared with RVC, achieving more than 72&#8197;h post injection and no inflammation or lesion were found. Based on high drug loading, ideal sustained&#8208;release and superior biological safety, RVC@ZIF&#8208;8 will be a novel delivery material for local anesthetic with potential application.

         <title>Reactivity of Oxygen&#8208;Bridged Geminal Al/P and Si/P Frustrated Lewis Pairs towards Heterocumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated pairs&#8217; different preferences: The geminal oxygen&#8208;bridged frustrated Lewis pairs tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2 (Bis=CH(SiMe3)2) and tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 show different reactivities towards heterocumulenes (PhNCO, PhOCN, PhNCS, CS2, PhNSO) and sulfur dioxide. Whereas the P&#8722;O&#8722;Al FLP forms stable adducts with all substrates except for SO2, the P&#8722;O&#8722;Si FLP does not form adducts with sulfur bound to silicon.







Abstract
The two oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;AlBis2 (Bis=CH(SiMe3)2; 1) and tBu2P&#8722;O&#8722;Si(C2F5)3 (2) were reacted with the heterocumulenes PhNCO, PhOCN, PhNCS, CS2 and PhNSO as well as SO2. With isocyanate and cyanate, both 1 and 2, form addition products under formation of five&#8208;membered rings. With CS2, isothiocyanate and sulfinylaniline, only 1 forms stable adducts, whereas 2 shows reactivity towards sulfinylaniline, but the product decomposed after a few minutes. The reaction of 1 with SO2 led to partial cleavage of the P&#8722;O&#8722;Al and Al&#8722;C units, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of a complex aggregate. The reaction of 2 with SO2 affords the 1,2&#8208;addition product. All adducts were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and CHN analyses.

The reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; led to partial cleavage of the P&#8722;O&#8722;Al and Al&#8722;C units, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies of a complex aggregate. The reaction of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affords the 1,2-addition product. All adducts were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and CHN analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Vivo Applications of Bioorthogonal Reactions: Chemistry and Targeting Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal chemistry refers to reactions that can proceed in biological systems without interfering with biological processes. It has enabled the study of biomolecules in their native environment and has facilitated advanced imaging and diagnostic applications. In their Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203942), M.&#8197;M.&#8197;A. Mitry, F. Greco and H.&#8197;M.&#8197;I. Osborn critically appraise the suitability of bioorthogonal reactions for in vivo applications. Areas of focus are chemical reactions and the targeting mechanisms used to deliver the bioorthogonal reactions&#8217; components.

         <title>Regulating Antifreeze Activity through Water: Latent Functions of the Sugars of Antifreeze Glycoprotein Revealed by Total Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sugar moiety of the antifreeze glycoprotein AFGP can form a unique dynamic water phase that includes disordered water molecules thereby inhibiting the freezing process. The property of this water phase seems to depend on both the structure and the number of sugar moieties. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Okamoto, Y. Kajihara, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203553).

         <title>Ultrafast Electron Transfer Dynamics of Organic Polymer Nanoparticles with Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene nanoparticles with graphene oxide (p3ht NPs&#8208;GO &amp; p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO) were prepared, and revealed the properties of charge transfer complexes. Notably, ultrafast electron transfer in those composites was reported for the first time, and faster electron transfer in p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO implied that p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO might have higher application values for organic polymer solar cells.







Abstract
We prepared organic polymer poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene (p3ht) nanoparticles (NPs) and graphene oxide (GO)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composites p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO by using the reprecipitation method. We demonstrated that GO/RGO could improve the ordering and planarity of p3ht chains as well as the formation of p3ht NPs, and confirmed the effects of GO/RGO on the fluorescence and carrier transport dynamics of p3ht NPs by using femtosecond fluorescence upconversion and transient absorption (TA) techniques. Ultrafast electron transfer (&#8764;1&#8197;ps) between GO/RGO and p3ht NPs quenched the fluorescence of p3ht NPs, indicating excellent properties of p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO as the charge transfer complexes. Efficient electron transfer may promote the applications of p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO composites in organic polymer solar cells and photocatalysis. Moreover, RGO had stronger interfacial interactions and more matched conduction band energy levels with p3ht NPs than GO did, which implied that p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO might have greater application values than p3ht NPs&#8208;GO.

         <title>Zigzag&#8208;Edged Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons from Benzo[m]tetraphene Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthetic strategy was developed to achieve zigzag&#8208;edged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation from &#8220;U&#8208;shaped&#8221; benzo[m]tetraphene&#8208;based precursors. The experimental and theoretical investigations elucidated the edge&#8208; and size&#8208;dependent effect on the electronic structures and optical properties. Moreover, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy disclosed the modulation of the photophysical properties upon &#960;&#8208;extension.







Abstract
A series of zigzag&#8208;edged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Z1&#8208;Z3) were synthesized from 2,12&#8208;dibromo&#8208;7,14&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;benzo[m]tetraphene (9) as a versatile building block. Their structures were unambiguously confirmed by laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, 1H NMR, Raman, and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies as well as scanning tunneling microscopy. The fingerprint vibrational modes were elucidated with theoretical support. The edge&#8208; and size&#8208;dependent optical properties were characterized by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Moreover, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy revealed distinct modulation of the photophysical properties upon &#960;&#8208;extension from Z1 to Z2, the latter having a gulf edge.

         <title>Selective Chelation of the Exotic Meitner&#8208;Auger Emitter Mercury&#8208;197&#8201;m/g with Sulfur&#8208;Rich Macrocyclic Ligands: Towards the Future of Theranostic Radiopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three sulfur&#8208;rich macrocyclic chelators were synthesized; their ability to bind Hg2+ was studied. The validity of these chelators for 197m/gHg2+ radiopharmaceutical incorporation was investigated through radiolabeling studies and in&#8197;vitro stability assays. The importance of sulfur coordinating atoms was rationalized, thus helping to design 197m/gHg2+ chelators for nuclear medicine applications.







Abstract
Mercury&#8208;197&#8197;m/g are a promising pair of radioactive isomers for incorporation into a theranostic as they can be used as a diagnostic agent using SPECT imaging and a therapeutic via Meitner&#8208;Auger electron emissions. However, the current absence of ligands able to stably coordinate 197m/gHg to a tumour&#8208;targeting vector precludes their use in&#8197;vivo. To address this, we report herein a series of sulfur&#8208;rich chelators capable of incorporating 197m/gHg into a radiopharmaceutical. 1,4,7,10&#8208;Tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecane (NS4) and its derivatives, (2&#8208;(1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecan&#8208;13&#8208;yl)acetic acid (NS4&#8208;CA) and N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrathia&#8208;13&#8208;azacyclopentadecan&#8208;13&#8208;yl)acetamide (NS4&#8208;BA), were designed, synthesized and analyzed for their ability to coordinate Hg2+ through a combination of theoretical (DFT) and experimental coordination chemistry studies (NMR and mass spectrometry) as well as 197m/gHg radiolabeling studies and in&#8197;vitro stability assays. The development of stable ligands for 197m/gHg reported herein is extremely impactful as it would enable their use for in&#8197;vivo imaging and therapy, leading to personalized treatments for cancer.

The development of stable ligands for &lt;sup&gt;197m/g&lt;/sup&gt;Hg reported herein is extremely impactful as it would enable their use for in&#8197;vivo imaging and therapy, leading to personalized treatments for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper (I) Chloride&#8208;Catalyzed Photoredox Synthesis of Multifunctionalized Compounds at Room Temperature and Their Antifungal Activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and highly efficient copper photoredox&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of BQ, alkyl/aryl alcohols, and alkyl/aryl terminal/internal alkynes forms highly functionalized products at room temperature. The late&#8208;stage functionalized compounds show good anti&#8208;Candida krusei and anti&#8208;Candida glabrata activities with lower cytotoxicities than that of fluconazole, the standard antifungal medicine.







Abstract
A simple visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced CuCl&#8208;catalyzed synthesis was developed for highly functionalized carbon&#8208;centered compounds (&#945;&#8208;alk/aryloxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diaryl/alkylaryl&#8208;acetaldehydes/ketones) at room temperature using benzoquinone, alkyl/aryl alcohol, and alkyl/aryl terminal/internal alkynes. Late&#8208;stage functionalized compounds show good antifungal activities, especially against Candida krusei fungal strain, in in&#8197;vitro experiments (the Broth microdilution method). Moreover, toxicity tests (zebrafish egg model experiments) indicated that these compounds had negligible cytotoxicity. The green chemistry metrics (E&#8208;factor value is 7.3) and eco&#8208;scale (eco&#8208;scale value is 58.8) evaluations show that the method is simple, mild, highly efficient, eco&#8208;friendly, and environmentally feasible.

         <title>Widening the Landscape of Small Molecule Activation with Gold&#8208;Aluminyl Complexes: A Systematic Study of E&#8722;H (E=O, N) Bonds, SO2 and N2O Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exceptional properties of gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes are predicted to lead to thermodynamically and kinetically feasible activation of E&#8722;H (E=N, O) bonds of ammonia and water, as well as SO2 capture and N2O reduction (all reactions are exergonic with barriers lower than 15&#8197;kcal/mol at 298&#8197;K). The N2O reduction is also predicted to lead to feasible catalytic redox cycles using N2O as an O&#8208;atom source and, unprecedently, the gold&#8208;aluminyl complex as a catalyst.







Abstract
The electronic features of gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes have been thoroughly explored. Their similarity with Group&#8197;14 dimetallenes and other metal&#8208;aluminyl complexes suggests that their reactivity with small molecules beyond carbon dioxide could be accessed. In this work, the reactivity of the [tBu3PAuAl(NON)] (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6 diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;ditert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) complex towards water, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide is computationally explored. The reaction mechanisms computed for each substrate strongly suggest that all activation processes are in principle experimentally feasible. Electronic structure analysis highlights that, in all cases, the reactivity is driven by the presence of the poorly polarized electron&#8208;sharing gold&#8208;aluminyl bond, which induces a radical&#8208;like reactivity of the complex towards all the substrates. A flat topology of the potential energy surface (PES) has been found for the reaction with N2O, where two almost isoenergetic transition states can be located along the same reaction coordinate with different geometries, suggesting that the N2O binding mode may not be a good indicator of the nature of N2O activation in a cooperative bimetallic reactivity. In addition, the catalytic potentialities of these complexes have been explored in the framework of nitrous oxide reduction. The study reveals that the [tBu3PAuAl(NON)] complex might be an efficient catalyst towards oxidation of phosphines (and boranes) via N2O reduction. These findings underline recurring trends in the novel chemistry of gold&#8208;aluminyl complexes and call for experimental feedbacks.

         <title>Hexaphenyltriphenylene&#8208;Based Multicomponent Metallacages: Host&#8211;Guest Complexation for White&#8208;Light Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of hexaphenyltriphenylene(HPT)&#8208;based metallacages showing intense blue emission both in the solution and solid state were prepared via multicomponent self&#8208;assembly. They can serve as hosts to complex with three planar fluorescent dyes, and bright white light can be generated when they complex with PDI derivatives.







Abstract
A hexaphenyltriphenylene&#8208;based hexatopic pyridyl ligand is designed and used to prepare three hexagonal prismatic metallacages via metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. Owing to the planar conjugated structures of the hexaphenyltriphenylene skeleton, such metallacages show good host&#8211;guest complexation with a series of emissive dyes, which have been further used to tune their emission in solution. Interestingly, based on their complementary emission colors, white light emission is achieved in a mixture of the host metallacages and the guests.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Bis&#8208;pentafluoroarylated Anthracene Derivatives for N&#8208;type Organic&#8208;Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of two pentafluorophenyl groups into anthracene through direct C&#8722;H arylation is demonstrated. This facile method enabled the synthesis of various bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene derivatives with different substitution positions in a single step. Among them, 2,6&#8208;bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene (2,6&#8208;DPA&#8722;F) serves as an n&#8208;type semiconductor in OFETs, exhibiting an electron mobility of 0.12&#177;0.02&#8197;cm2/V.







Abstract
Diphenylanthracene (DPA) and its derivatives are promising semiconducting materials for p&#8208;type organic&#8208;field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). In this study, to develop n&#8208;type semiconducting materials with an anthracene core, pentafluorobenzene was introduced into anthracene by C&#8722;H direct arylation, enabling the synthesis of various bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene (DPA&#8722;F) derivatives. The high reactivity of the pentafluorobenzene C&#8722;H bond allows direct arylation for synthesizing DPA&#8722;F derivatives in a single step. The introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing pentafluorophenyl groups provides the anthracene derivatives with n&#8208;type semiconducting properties, in contrast to the p&#8208;type properties of the parent DPAs. Among the synthesized compounds, 2,6&#8208;bis(pentafluorophenyl)anthracene shows a high electron mobility of 0.12&#177;0.02&#8197;cm2/Vs and an on/off ratio&gt;106 in OFETs. The high crystallinity results in the smooth electron transport. This study provides a facile synthetic method for n&#8208;type semiconducting materials and insights into the molecular design of the positional effects of aromatic substituents on anthracene.

         <title>Toward a Comprehensive Understanding of Amorphous Photocatalysts: Fundamental Hypotheses and Applications in CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With amorphisation, a simple and effective approach, it is possible to introduce atomic defects and short&#8208;range ordering into catalyst materials. The abundance of defects and dangling bonds improves the intrinsic activity and photocatalytic stability. In their Perspective (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203810), S.&#8208;I. In and co&#8208;workers discuss how amorphisation offers a novel and powerful method to avoid the slow kinetics of CO2 reduction in rigid crystalline catalysis, resulting in higher performance for CO2 photoreduction.

         <title>Insight into the Evolution Track for the Metathesis of Alkenes within Hierarchical Zeolite&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The usage of hierarchical MFI zeolite enables the boosting catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based catalysts for the olefin&#8208;metathesis reaction. The harvest of active catalysts roots from a segmental evolution track between hierarchical zeolite and Al2O3 slices for the fabrication of active sites. The working evolution track requires the indispensable engagements from intracrystalline mesoporous surface, Al2O3 slices and zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites. The infilling of disaggregated Al2O3 slices into the intracrystalline mesopores triggers the creation of localized intrazeolite&#8208;Al2O3 interface, which enable the subsequent migration and trapping of surface molybdates into the micropores. The insulation of intrazeolite&#8208;Al2O3 interface or shielding of zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites leads to the break of the evolution track. Our findings disclose the hidden functionality of mesoporosity as intrazeolite interface boundary for the fabrication of active sites and supply the new strategy for the rational design of zeolite catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Photomodulation on Active Sites of Adsorbents: Controllable Adsorption Processes with Improved Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorption is a widely applied technique in producing high&#8208;purity chemicals with advantages of low energy consumption, high selectivity, and mild operating conditions. However, traditional adsorbents have inflexible properties and suffer from the trade&#8208;off between selective adsorption and efficient desorption. Recently, the emerging photoresponsive adsorbents have provided new avenues for adsorption techniques. Active sites of photoresponsive adsorbents can be regulated through steric hindrance or tunable adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interactions. Therefore, variation in adsorptive capacity is able to readily achieve through photomodulation, and the corresponding adsorption/desorption cycles are energy&#8208;saving. This concept mainly summarizes recent efforts on the fabrication and application of photoresponsive adsorbents with tunable active sites. Also, the future opportunities and critical challenges of photoregulation on adsorptive sites are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tuning the Properties of Stapled Peptides by Stereogenic &#945;&#8208;Amino Acid Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide stapling represents a versatile strategy to generate peptide derivatives with stable helical structures. While a wide range of skeletons have been investigated for cyclizing the side chains of peptides, the stereochemical outcomes from the linkers remain to be better understood. In this study, we incorporated &#945;&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;AAs) as bridges to construct side chain&#8208;stapled analogs of an interleukin&#8208;17A&#8208;binding peptide (HAP) and evaluated the impacts of the staples on the peptide's properties. While all AA&#8208;derived peptidyl staples drastically increase the enzymatic stability of HAP, our results indicate that compared to the D&#8208;amino acid bridges, the L&#8208;AA&#8208;based staples may generate more significant impacts in increasing the helicity and enhancing the IL&#8208;17A&#8208;binding affinity of the modified peptide. Using Rosetta modelling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we demonstrate that the chirality (L/D) possessed within the AAs substantially influences the conformation of stapled HAP peptides, providing either stabilizing or destabilizing effects. Based on the computational model, a modification of the stapled HAP leads to the discovery of a peptide with further enhanced helicity, enzymatic stability and IL&#8208;17A&#8208;inhibiting ability. This systematic study reveals that chiral AAs can serve as modulatory linkers for optimizing the structures and properties of stapled peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxymethylene Ether (OME) Fuel Catalyst Screening Using in&#8208;situ NMR spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Online NMR measurements are introduced in the current study as a new analytical setup for investigation of the oxymethylene dimethyl ether (OME) synthesis. For the validation of the setup, the newly established method is compared with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gas chromatographic analysis. Afterwards, the influence of different parameters, such as temperature, catalyst concentration and catalyst type on the OME fuel formation based on trioxane and dimethoxymethane is investigated. As catalysts, AmberlystTM 15 (A15) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) are utilized. A kinetic model is applied to describe the reaction in more detail. Based on these results, the activation energy (A15: 46.3 kJ mol &#8208;1 and TfOH: 79.8 kJ mol&#8208;1) and the order in catalyst (A15: 0.8 and TfOH: 2.2) are calculated and discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Vanadium Pentafulvene Complexes: Synthon for Unprecedented VanadoceneIII Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The benzene ligand at CpV(&#951;6&#8208;C6H6) (1) is exchanged for pentafulvenes. Using sterically demanding pentafulvenes gives a clean exchange reaction, yielding vanadium pentafulvene (2a and 2b) and benzofulvene complexes (3a and 3b). The molecular structures of the target compounds suggest a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5:&#963;&#8208;&#951;1 coordination mode with a vanadiumIII center. With the sterically low demanding 6,6&#8208;dimethylpentafulvene, a C&#8211;H activation at the leaving ligand is observed, yielding the ring&#8208;substituted vanadoceneII4. The reactivity of the pentafulvene complexes was investigated. A series of unprecedented vanadoceneIII compounds were synthesized: Under mild conditions, E&#8211;H splitting of 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenol, diphenylamine, and 2,6&#8208;diisopropylaniline yield well characterized examples of rare vanadoceneIII phenolate and amide complexes. Insertion reactions into the V&#8211;Cexo bond of the pentafulvene complexes by multiple bond containing substrates were found for acetone, 4&#8208;chlorobenzonitril and N,N&#8217;&#8208;dicyclohexylcarbodiimide.</dc:description>

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Chemistry of Complex Alkaloids: Combining Targeted Molecular Networking Approach and Semisynthetic Strategy to Access Rare Communesins in a Marine&#8208;Derived Penicillium expansum.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Communesins are rare alkaloids isolated from fungi of the genus Penicillium. In this work, the extract of a marine&#8208;derived Penicillium expansum strain was studied using targeted molecular networking approach allowing to detect 65 communesins including 55 novels. A fragmentation pattern for dimethylvinyl communesins was established and a script was implemented allowing to predict the structure and map all communesins in a global molecular network. A semisynthetic strategy was carried out to obtain some minor congeners from the two isolated communesins A and B. Nine communesins were then synthetised: two of them were already described as produced by the studied strain; four are new natural products which occurrence in the extracts was confirmed; three are new semi&#8208;synthetic analogues never described so far. These communesins were evaluated for their cytotoxicity on two human cancer cell lines KB and MCF&#8208;7 leading to a preliminary study of their structure&#8208;activity relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Cascade Synthesis of Enantioenriched Epoxides and Triols from Biomass&#8208;Derived Synthons Driven by Specifically Designed Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;enzymatic cascades exploiting engineered enzymes are a powerful tool for the tailor&#8208;made synthesis of complex molecules from simple inexpensive building blocks. In this work, we engineered the promiscuous enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an effective aldolase with 160&#8208;fold increased activity compared to 4OT wild type. Subsequently, we applied the evolved 4&#8208;OT variant to perform an aldol condensation, followed by an epoxidation reaction catalyzed by a previously engineered 4&#8208;OT mutant, in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step cascade for the synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides (up to 98% ee) from biomass&#8208;derived starting materials. For three chosen substrates, the reaction was performed at milligram scale with product yields up to 68% and remarkably high enantioselectivity. Furthermore, we developed a three&#8208;step enzymatic cascade involving an epoxide hydrolase for the production of chiral aromatic 1,2,3&#8208;prim,sec,sec&#8208;triols with high enantiopurity and good isolated yields. The reported one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step cascade, with no intermediate isolation and being completely cofactor&#8208;less, provides an attractive route for the synthesis of chiral aromatic triols from biomass&#8208;based synthons.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;line Multidimensional NMR Monitoring of Photochemical Flow Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the in&#8208;line monitoring of a flow photochemical reaction using 1D and ultrafast 2D NMR methods at high magnetic field. Ultrafast 2D NMR experiments acquired in&#8208;line yield useful quantitative information in just 40&#8197;s.







Abstract
This work demonstrates the in&#8208;line monitoring of a flow photochemical reaction using 1D and ultrafast 2D NMR methods at high magnetic field. The reaction mixture exiting the flow reactor is flown through the NMR spectrometer and directly analyzed. In the case of simple substrates, suitable information can be obtained through 1D 1H spectra, but for molecules of higher complexity the use of 2D experiments is key to address signal overlaps and assignment issues. Here we show the usefulness of ultrafast 2D COSY experiments acquired in 70&#8197;s or less, for the in&#8208;line monitoring of photochemical reactions, and the possibility to obtain reliable quantitative information. This is a powerful framework to, for example, efficiently screen reaction conditions.

         <title>Light&#8208;triggered Modulation of Supramolecular Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;triggered supramolecular chiral assemblies have aroused great attention. According to the different interaction ways between light and system, we mainly summarized non&#8208;polarized light and circularly polarized light (CP light) triggered chiral assemblies. Non&#8208;polarized light triggered systems were mainly assisted by the introduction of photoactive components. As a chiral light source, CP light can directly induce the asymmetric assembly of organic molecules and asymmetric photosynthesis of inorganic metal nanostructures. Besides, photoexcitation induced assembly based physical approach was also explored recently to regulate supramolecular chirality beyond photochemical reactions. Furthermore, many relevant functional applications were also presented.







Abstract
Dynamically controlling the supramolecular chirality is of great significance in development of functional chiral materials, which is thus essential for the specific function implementation. As an external energy input, light is remote and accurate for modulating chiral assemblies. In non&#8208;polarized light control, some photochemically reactive units (e.&#8201;g., azobenzene, &#593;&#8208;cyanostilbene, spiropyran, anthracene) or photo&#8208;induced directionally rotating molecular motors were designed to drive chiral transfer or amplification. Besides, photoexcitation induced assembly based physical approach was also explored recently to regulate supramolecular chirality beyond photochemical reactions. In addition, circularly polarized light was applied to induce asymmetric arrangement of organic molecules and asymmetric photochemical synthesis of inorganic metallic nanostructures, in which both wavelength and handedness of circularly polarized light have effects on the induced supramolecular chirality. Although light&#8208;triggered chiral assemblies have been widely applied in photoelectric materials, biomedical fields, soft actuator, chiral catalysis and chiral sensing, there is a lack of systematic review on this topic. In this review, we summarized the recent studies and perspectives in the constructions and applications of light&#8208;responsive chiral assembled systems, aiming to provide better knowledge for the development of multifunctional chiral nanomaterials.

         <title>Structurally Diverse Diterpenoids from the Sanya Bay Nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus and Its Sponge&#8208;Prey Chelonaplysilla sp.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical ecology: Investigation of the nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus from Sanya Bay afforded twelve diterpenoids, including nine new diterpenoids of the 5,19&#8208;cycloclerodane&#8208;, clerodane&#8208; and subersin&#8208; type. Interestingly, six of them were also found in the sponge Chelonaplysilla sp. from the same water region. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these diterpenoids, and the chemo&#8208;ecological implications of their co&#8208;occurrence in the two organisms, were discussed.







Abstract
Investigation of the South China Sea nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus from Sanya Bay afforded, in addition to three known compounds, nine new diterpenoids of the 5,19&#8208;cycloclerodane&#8208; (sanyanolides A&#8211;D), clerodane&#8208; (sanyanolide E) and subersin&#8208; (sanyanolides F&#8211;I) type. Remarkably, six diterpenoids aforementioned from H.&#8197;sanguineus were also isolated from the sponge Chelonaplysilla sp. from the same water region, suggesting a trophic relationship between H.&#8197;sanguineus and Chelonaplysilla sp. The structure and absolute configuration of new compounds were established by a combination of spectroscopic data, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and/or time&#8208;dependent density functional theory/electronic circular dichroism calculations. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these diterpenoids, along with the chemo&#8208;ecological implications of their co&#8208;occurrence in the two organisms investigated, was proposed and discussed. In in&#8197;vitro bioassays, echinoclerodane A exhibited a potent inhibitory effect (IC50=2.81&#8197;&#956;M) on LPS&#8208;induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. In addition, echinoclerodane A and oculatolide showed considerable antibacterial activities with MIC values ranging from 1.0 to 8.0&#8197;&#956;g/mL.

         <title>Thiophene&#8208;Based Ligands for Histological Multiplex Spectral Detection of Distinct Protein Aggregates in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple colors. A palette of fluorescent donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor thiophene&#8208;based ligands with distinct photo&#8208;physical properties was synthesized. Ligands with specific chemical composition displayed selectivity towards distinct protein aggregates in tissue sections with Alzheimer's disease pathology and by applying different combination of ligands, multiplex spectral detection of distinct protein aggregates could be afforded. We foresee that these ligands will aid in fluorescent assignment of disease&#8208;associated protein aggregates.







Abstract
The aggregation and accumulation of proteins in the brain is the defining feature of many devastating neurodegenerative diseases. The development of fluorescent ligands that bind to these accumulations, or deposits, is essential for the characterization of these neuropathological lesions. We report the synthesis of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) thiophene&#8208;based ligands with different emission properties. The D&#8208;A&#8208;D ligands displayed selectivity towards distinct disease&#8208;associated protein deposits in histological sections from postmortem brain tissue of individuals affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ability of the ligands to selectively identify AD&#8208;associated pathological alterations, such as deposits composed of aggregates of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptide or tau, was reduced when the chemical composition of the ligands was altered. When combining the D&#8208;A&#8208;D ligands with conventional thiophene&#8208;based ligands, superior spectral separation of distinct protein aggregates in AD tissue sections was obtained. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new fluorescent ligands that can distinguish between aggregated proteinaceous species, as well as offer novel strategies for developing multiplex fluorescence detection of protein aggregates in tissue sections.

         <title>Conversion of Ketones into Blue&#8208;Emitting Electron&#8208;Deficient Benzofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl&#8208;alkyl ketones act as double O,C&#8208;nucleophiles in reaction with perfluorobenzene leading to strongly blue&#8208;emissive tetrafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;arylbenzofurans.







Abstract
A novel heavy metal&#8208;free and safe synthetic methodology enabling one&#8208;step conversion of ketones into corresponding 4,5,6,7&#8208;tetrafluorobenzofurans (F4BFs) has been developed. The presented approach has numerous advantageous qualities, including utilization of readily available substrates, broad scope, scalability, and good reaction yields. Importantly, some of the benzofurans prepared by this method were heretofore inaccessible by any other known transformation. Importantly, furo[2,3&#8208;b]pyrazines and heretofore unexplored difuro[2,3&#8208;c:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;e]pyridazine can be prepared using this strategy. Spectroscopic studies reveal that for simple systems, absorption and fluorescence maxima fall within the UV spectral range, while &#960;&#8208;electron system expansion red&#8208;shifts both spectra. Moreover, the good fluorescence quantum yields observed in solution, up to 96&#8201;%, are also maintained in the solid state. Experimental results are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The presented methodology, combined with the spectroscopic characteristics, suggest the possibility of using F4BFs in the optoelectronic industry (i.&#8201;e., organic light emitting devices (OLED), organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFET), organic photovoltaics (OPV)) as inexpensive and readily available emissive or semiconductor materials.

         <title>Expanding the Horizon of Bio&#8208;Inspired Catalyst Design with Tactical Incorporation of Drug Molecules</title>

For both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic H2 production: A unique bio&#8208;inspired hydrogen production catalyst design with the rational incorporation of a proton&#8208;relaying drug molecule around a synthetic metal cobalt core.







Abstract
The development of potent H2 production catalysts is a key aspect in our journey toward the establishment of a sustainable carbon&#8208;neutral power infrastructure. Hydrogenase enzymes provide the blueprint for designing efficient catalysts by the rational combination of central metal core and protein scaffold&#8208;based outer coordination sphere (OCS). Traditionally, a biomimetic catalyst is crafted by including natural amino acids as OCS features around a synthetic metal motif to functionally imitate the metalloenzyme activity. Here, we have pursued an unconventional approach and implanted two distinct drug molecules (isoniazid and nicotine hydrazide) at the axial position of a cobalt core to create a new genre of synthetic catalysts. The resultant cobalt complexes are active for both electrocatalytic and photocatalytic H2 production in near&#8208;neutral water, where they significantly enhance the catalytic performance of the unfunctionalized parent cobalt complex. The drug molecules showcased a dual effect as they influence the catalytic HER by improving the surrounding proton relay along and exerting subtle electronic effects. The isoniazid&#8208;ligated catalyst C1 outperformed the nicotine hydrazide&#8208;bound complex C2, as it produced H2 from water (pH&#8197;6.0) at a rate of 3960&#8197;s&#8722;1 while exhibiting Faradaic efficiency of about 90&#8201;%. This strategy opens up newer avenues of bio&#8208;inspired catalyst design beyond amino acid&#8208;based OCS features.

         <title>Exciplex&#8208;Forming Cohost Systems with 2,3&#8208;Dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene&#8208;based Acceptors to Achieve Efficient Near Infrared OLEDs</title>

         <dc:description>
A yellow&#8208;orange emission exciplex&#8208;forming blend composed of a 2,3 dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene&#8208;based acceptor and a carbazole&#8208;based donor is employed as a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) cohost system for a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;configured organic near&#8208;infrared emitter to achieve an organic light&#8208;emitting device with electroluminescence centered at 743&#8197;nm and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 4.79&#8201;% by virtue of the effective energy transfer mechanism.







Abstract
Two new 2,3&#8208;dicyanopyrazinophenanthrene&#8208;based acceptors (A) p&#8208;QCN and m&#8208;QCN were synthesized to blend with a donor (D) CPTBF for the exciplex formation. The energy levels of p&#8208;QCN and m&#8208;QCN are modulated by the peripheral substituents 4&#8208; and 3&#8208;benzonitrile, respectively. Exciplex&#8208;forming blends were identified by the observation of the red&#8208;shifted emissions from various D&#8201;:&#8201;A blends with higher ratios of donor for suppressing the aggregation of acceptor. The two&#8208;component relaxation processes observed by time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence support the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) character of the exciplex&#8208;forming blends. The device employing CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;p&#8208;QCN and (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) and CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;QCN (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) blend as the emitting layer (EML) gave EQEmax of 1.76&#8201;% and 5.12&#8201;%, and electroluminescence (EL) &#955;max of 629&#8197;nm and 618&#8197;nm, respectively. The device efficiency can be further improved to 4.32&#8201;% and 5.57&#8201;% with CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;p&#8208;QCN and (4&#8201;:&#8201;1) and CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;QCN (4&#8201;:&#8201;1) as the EML, which is consistent with their improved photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). A new fluorescent emitter BPBBT with photoluminescence (PL) &#955;max of 726&#8197;nm and a high PLQY of 67&#8201;% was synthesized and utilized as the dopant of CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;QCN (4&#8201;:&#8201;1) cohost system. The device employing CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;QCN (4&#8201;:&#8201;1): 5&#8197;wt.% BPBBT as the EML gave an EQEmax of 5.02&#8201;% and EL &#955;max centered at 735&#8197;nm, however, the weak residual exciplex emission remains. By reducing the donor ratio, the exciplex emission can be completely transferred to BPBBT and the corresponding device with CPTBF&#8201;:&#8201;m&#8208;QCN (2&#8201;:&#8201;1): 5&#8197;wt.% BPBBT as the EML can achieve EL &#955;max of 743&#8197;nm and EQEmax of 4.79&#8201;%. This work manifests the high efficiency near infrared (NIR) OLED can be realized by triplet excitons harvesting of exciplex&#8208;forming cohost system, followed by the effective energy transfer to an NIR fluorescent dopant.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)indate Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the chemistry of perfluoroalkylindium compounds is rather unexplored, here, we report on the syntheses and full characterization of a variety of salts featuring the tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)indate anion, [In(C2F5)4]&#8722;. The reaction of InCl3 with LiC2F5 selectively yields [Li(thf)n][In(C2F5)4], which is used as starting material for the syntheses of various [In(C2F5)4]&#8722; salts.







Abstract
In the rising field of organoindium chemistry little is known about the perfluoroorganyl&#8208;substituted indium compounds. The increasing use of indium reagents is explained by their high stability and tolerance towards water and functional groups. Here we report on the synthesis of the novel tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)indate, [In(C2F5)4]&#8722;, and its characterization in salts with the cations [Li(thf)3]+, Cs+, [PPh4]+ and [H14O6]2+ (thf=tetrahydrofuran). To the best of our knowledge, these salts constitute the first perfluoroalkylindates and, in general, the first isolated perfluoroalkylindium compounds which are fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.

         <title>Diquat Based Dyes: A New Class of Photoredox Catalysts and Their Use in Aerobic Thiocyanation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From diquat to dye&#8208;cat. A series of push&#8211;pull dyes using diquat as the electron&#8208;acceptor moiety have been synthesized. Their photocatalytic abilities were tested in the aerobic thiocyanation of indoles and pyrroles, giving yields of up to 97&#8201;%.







Abstract
A series of new organic donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor dyes incorporating a diquat moiety as a novel electron&#8208;acceptor unit have been synthesized and characterized. The analytical data were supported by DFT calculations. These dyes were explored in the aerobic thiocyanation of indoles and pyrroles. Here they showed a high photocatalytic activity under visible light, giving isolated yields of up to 97&#8201;%. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of standalone diquat and methyl viologen through formation of an electron donor acceptor complex is presented.

         <title>Zinc Substituted Myoglobin&#8722;Albumin Fusion Protein: A Photosensitizer for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Myoglobin combined with human serum albumin, Mb&#8208;HSA, was prepared using a yeast host cell with secretion into the culture medium. The heme of Mb&#8208;HSA was replaced with a zinc protoporphyrin IX, yielding ZnMb&#8208;HSA. This fluorescent fusion protein showed a superior activity of photodynamic cancer therapy in&#8197;vitro. Its blood circulation half&#8208;life was 11&#8208;fold longer than free ZnMb in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Myoglobin combined with human serum albumin (Mb&#8208;HSA) can be produced using yeast Pichia pastoris as a host strain, with secretion into the culture medium. This Mb&#8208;HSA fusion protein possesses identical O2 binding affinity to that of naked Mb. The Mb unit is reconstituted with a zinc(II) protoporphyrin IX, yielding (zinc substituted Mb)&#8208;HSA, ZnMb&#8208;HSA. The photophysical property and singlet O2 generation ability of ZnMb&#8208;HSA are equivalent to those of ZnMb. In vitro cell experiments revealed that ZnMb&#8208;HSA acts as a superior photosensitizer for photodynamic cancer therapy. It is noteworthy that ZnMb&#8208;HSA shows long circulation lifetime in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Photophysical Characterization of Isoguanine in a Prebiotic&#8208;Like Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations reveal the photophysical feasibility of isoguanine as a nucleobase precursor under prebiotic conditions. Protonated isoguanine decays to the ground state in sub&#8208;ps time scales, consistently with the barrierless potential energy profiles connecting the Franck&#8208;Condon region with internal conversion funnels.







Abstract
It is intriguing how a mixture of organic molecules survived the prebiotic UV fluxes and evolved into the actual genetic building blocks. Scientists are trying to shed light on this issue by synthesizing nucleic acid monomers and their analogues under prebiotic Era&#8208;like conditions and by exploring their excited state dynamics. To further add to this important body of knowledge, this study discloses new insights into the photophysical properties of protonated isoguanine, an isomorph of guanine, using steady&#8208;state and femtosecond broadband transient absorption spectroscopies, and quantum mechanical calculations. Protonated isoguanine decays in ultrafast time scales following 292&#8197;nm excitation, consistently with the barrierless paths connecting the bright S1 (&#960;&#960;*) state with different internal conversion funnels. Complementary calculations for neutral isoguanine predict similar photophysical properties. These results demonstrate that protonated isoguanine can be considered photostable in contrast to protonated guanine, which exhibits 40&#8208;fold longer excited state lifetimes.

         <title>The Mechanochemical Fries Rearrangement: Manipulating Isomer Ratios in the Synthesis of p&#8208;Hydroxyacetophenone at Different Scales
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
para&#8208;Hydroxyacetophenone is prepared by the first mechanochemical Fries rearrangement. The reaction was optimized in the ball mill and then transferred to a continuous process in a twin&#8208;screw extruder. The isomer ratio can be influenced by reaction parameters such as LAG or temperature.







Abstract
Herein, the first mechanochemical Fries rearrangement for the industrially important synthesis of para&#8208;hydroxyacetophenone, inside a ball mill and a twin&#8208;screw extruder, is presented. Our approach leads to a yield of 62&#8201;% in as little as 90&#8197;minutes while liquid&#8208;assisted grinding can shift the isomer ratio resulting in an excess of the desired para&#8208;product. The multigram scale&#8208;up by extrusion leads to 61&#8201;% yield in only three minutes while completely avoiding solvents. The extrusion temperature can even further be reduced by combining extrusion with a subsequent ageing step.

         <title>A Cu+/Thiourea Dendrimer Achieves Excellent Cytosolic Protein Delivery via Enhanced Cell Uptake and Endosome Escape</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cuprous (I) ions coordinated polymer was synthesized via the coordination of phenylthiourea grafted dendrimer with either cuprous&#8197;(I) ions or copper&#8197;(II) ions, since the copper&#8197;(II) ions in the coordination polymer was reduced to cuprous&#8197;(I) ions. The coordinated polymer facilitates the protein binding, cellular uptake and endosomal escape, and thus enables efficient protein delivery.







Abstract
Intracellular protein delivery has attracted considerable attention in the development of protein&#8208;based therapeutics, however, the design of highly efficient materials for robust delivery of native proteins remains challenging. This study proposes a Cu+ &#8208;based coordination polymer for cytosolic protein delivery with high efficacy and robustness. The phenylthiourea grafted dendrimer is coordinated with cuprous ions to prepare the polymeric carrier, which efficiently bind cargo proteins via a combination of coordination, ionic and hydrophobic interactions. The incorporation of Cu+ ions in the polymer greatly improves its cellular uptake and endosomal escape. The cuprous&#8208;based coordination polymer successfully delivered a variety of structurally diverse proteins into various cell lines with reserved bioactivities. This study provides a new type of coordination polymers for cytosolic delivery of biomacromolecules.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Evolution Control and Luminescence Regulation in Multiple&#8208;Site Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;polarity effect on the framework/luminescence regulation was demonstrated based on the multiple&#8208;site hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks: distinct electrostatic forces controlled by solvent polarities (high/low) would benefit for the different framework (cage/channel) structures; the solvent polarity could further adjust the conformation of organic building unit to generate a broadband tunable luminescence.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have shown great potential in separation, sensing and host&#8208;guest chemistry, however, the pre&#8208;design of HOFs remains challenging due to the uncertainty of solvents&#8242; participation in framework formation. Herein, the polarity&#8208;evolution&#8208;controlled framework/luminescence regulation is demonstrated based on multiple&#8208;site hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks. Several distinct HOFs were prepared by changing bonding modes of building units via the evolution of electrostatic forces induced by various solvent polarities. High&#8208;polar solvents with strong electrostatic attraction to surrounding units showed the tendency to form cage structures, while low&#8208;polar solvents with weak electrostatic attraction only occupy hydrogen&#8208;bond sites, conducive to the channel formation. Furthermore, the conformation of optical building unit can be adjusted by affecting the solvent polarity, generating different luminescence outputs. These results pave the way for the rational design of ideal HOFs with on&#8208;demand framework regulation and luminescence properties.

         <title>Atroposelective Nenitzescu Indole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented enantioselective Nenitzescu: A simple Jacobsen&#8208;type chromium(III)&#8208;salen complex has been used as a chiral enantiopure Lewis acid catalyst for a highly atroposelective Nenitzescu indole synthesis. Its practicality should make C&#8722;N atroposelective synthesis more accessible.







Abstract
In the past decade, compounds bearing a stereogenic C&#8722;N axis have gained significant attention in fields ranging from ligand to drug design. Yet, the atroposelective synthesis of these molecules remains a considerable challenge. In contrast to recent methods using more advanced chiral catalysts, a very simply accessed Jacobsen&#8208;type chromium(III)&#8722;salen complex was used here as a chiral enantiopure Lewis acid catalyst for a highly atroposelective Nenitzescu indole synthesis. Mild reaction conditions afforded various 5&#8208;hydroxybenzo[g]indoles in up to 97&#8201;% yield. Moreover, through a simple work&#8208;up, very high enantiomeric excesses of up to 99&#8201;% could be obtained.

         <title>Divergent Construction of N&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Indole as the Nitrogen Source Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal catalyst&#8208;dependent divergent cascade reaction of alkyne&#8208;embedded diazoketones with indoles is reported, which offers expeditious access to benzo[i]phenanthridines and benzo[b]carbazoles in good yield under mild reaction conditions. N&#8208;embedded dienophiles are used rather than alkynes or olefins for cycloaddition with the isobenzopyrylium species, providing a concise and practical approach for the selective construction of N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with structural diversity and broad functional group compatibility.







Abstract
An Ag/Au&#8208;catalyzed divergent cascade reaction of alkyne embedded diazoketones with indoles has been described. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction goes through a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of an in&#8197;situ formed isobenzopyrylium intermediate with indole, followed by a sequential retro&#8208;Michael addition/carbene N&#8722;H insertion process to give the benzo[i]phenanthridines products with gold catalysis; whereas a dearomatization/rearomatization sequence occurs favourably when the reaction is catalyzed by a silver catalyst, delivering benzo[b]carbazoles in generally high to excellent yields. Notably, this is a rare example of using indole as the dienophile for cycloaddition with the isobenzopyrylium species, providing a concise and practical approach for the selective construction of N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with structural diversity and broad functional&#8208;group compatibility.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Carbon Confined NiCo Alloy Hollow Spheres as an Efficient and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalyst for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring cost&#8208;efficient/durability bifunctional electrocatalysts are of upmost importance for the practical application of metal&#8211;air batteries. However, preparing bifunctional electrocatalysts with the above three advantages remains conceptually challenging. This work reports the preparation of N&#8208;doped carbon confined NiCo alloy hollow spheres (NiCo@N&#8208;C HS) as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for Zn&#8208;air battery with a higher energy density (788.7 mWh gZn&#8208;1) and outstanding cycling stability (over 200 h), which are more durable than the commercialized Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;based device. Electrochemical results and theoretical calculation demonstrate that the synergy in the NiCo@N&#8208;C accelerates the electronic transmission for improving activation of O2* and OH* intermediates and optimizing reacted free energy pathways, while the hollow structures exposure more active sites for improving the reaction kinetics and enhancing the activity of ORR/OER reaction. This work provides crucial understanding for constructing low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based catalyst to overcome the e&#64259;ciency and durability barriers of metal&#8208;air batteries for widespread applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (cymantrene) is known to undergo photochemical reactions by releasing one of its CO ligands. Here we present the first example of a photorearrangement of a cymantrenylmethyl fragment, where it retains all its three CO ligands. A tandem experimental and DFT (density functional theory)&#8208;based computational investigation allows us to explain this unexpected behavior: the rearrangement, indeed, begins with the release of one CO ligand, but cage effect of the solvent (benzene or cyclohexane) captures this CO molecule, allowing it to rapidly reattach once the rearrangement takes place.</dc:description>

         <title>Quest of Quadruple Bonding Between Two Main&#8208;Group Atoms in AeB&#8208; and AeC (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba) and the Role of d Orbitals of Heavier Alkaline&#8208;Earth Atoms in Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum chemical calculations using ab initio methods at the MRCI+Q(6,8)/def2&#8208;QZVPP and CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;QZVPP levels as well as density functional theory are reported for the diatomic molecules AeB&#8208; and isoelectronic AeC (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba). The boride anions AeB&#8208; have an electronic triplet (3&#931;&#8208;) ground state. The quintet (5&#931;&#8208;) state is 5.8 &#8211; 12.3 kcal/mol higher in energy and the singlet (1&#916;) state is 13.1 &#8211; 15.3 kcal/mol above the triplet. The isoelectronic AeC molecules are also predicted to have a low&#8208;lying triplet (3&#931;&#8208;) state but the quintet (5&#931;&#8208;) state is only 2.2 kcal/mol (SrC) and 2.9 kcal/mol (CaC) above the triplet state. The triplet (3&#931;&#8208;) and quintet (5&#931;&#8208;) states of BaC are nearly isoenergetic. All systems have rather strong bonds. The calculated bond dissociation energies of the triplet (3&#931;&#8208;) state are between De = 38.3 &#8211; 41.7 kcal/mol for AeB&#8208; and De = 49.4 &#8211; 57.5 kcal/mol for AeC. The barium species have always the strongest bonds whereas the calcium and strontium compounds have similar BDEs. The bonding analysis indicates that there is little charge migration in AeB&#8208; in the direction Ae&#8594;B&#8208; where the alkaline earth atoms carry positive charges between 0.09 e &#8208; 0.22 e. The positive charges at the Ae atoms are much larger in AeC where the charge migration Ae&#8594;C is between 0.90 e &#8211; 0.91 e. A detailed analysis of the interatomic interactions with the EDA&#8208;NOCV method shows that all diatomic species AeB&#8208; and AeC are built from dative interactions between Ae (1S, ns2) and B&#8722; or C (3P, 2s22p&#960;12p&#960;&#8242;1). The eventually formed bonds in AeC are better described in terms of interactions between the ions Ae+ (2S, ns1) + C&#8722; (4S, 2s22p&#960;12p&#960;&#8242;12p&#963;1). Inspection of the orbital interactions suggests that the alkaline earth atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use mainly their (n&#8208;1)d AOs besides the (n)s AOs for the covalent bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral and structural polymorphism of fibril architectures of homologous lysozymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloid fibrils are fascinating and complex structures with the multilayered chiral organization. Using the multimodal methodology, including VCD, ECD, cryo&#8208;EM, and TEM, we characterized in detail different levels of organization (secondary structure/protofilament/mesoscopic structure) of amyloid fibrils prepared from proteins highly homologous in structure (hen egg white and human lysozymes). Our results demonstrate that small changes in the native protein structure or preparation conditions translate into significant differences in the handedness and architecture of the formed fibrils at various levels of their complexity. In particular, fibrils of hen egg white and human lysozymes obtained in vitro at the same preparation conditions, possess different secondary structure, protofilament twist and ultrastructure. Yet, formed fibrils adopted a relatively similar mesoscopic structure, as observed in high&#8208;resolution 3D cryo&#8208;EM, scarcely used up to now for fibrils obtained in vitro in denaturing condition. Our results add to other puzzling experiments implicating the indeterministic nature of fibril formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient K&#8208;storage of Fe&#8208;coupled organic molecule anode in ether&#8208;based electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given these advantages of widely designable structures and environmentally friendly characteristics, organic electrode materials (OEMs) are considered to be promising electrode materials for alkaline metal&#8208;ion batteries. However, their large&#8208;scale application is hampered by insufficient specific capacity and rate performance. Here, Fe2+ is coupled to the anhydride molecule NTCDA to form a novel K&#8208;storage anode Fe&#8208;NTCDA. In this way, the working potential of Fe&#8208;NTCDA anode is reduced, which makes it more suitable to be used as an anode material. Meanwhile, the electrochemical performance is significantly improved due to the increase in K&#8208;storage sites. Moreover, electrolyte regulation is implemented to optimize the K&#8208;storage behavior, resulting into a high specific capacity of 167 mAh/g after 100 cycles at 50 mA/g and 114 mAh/g even at 500 mA/g in the 3 M KFSI/DME electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Atropisomeric&#8208;NHC Catechodithiolate Ruthenium Complexes for Z&#8208;Selective Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Cross Metathesis of Exo&#8208;Norbornenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of 16 chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) ligands was synthesized from prochiral NHC precursors. After a rapid screening in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cross metathesis (AROCM), the most effective chiral  atrop BIAN&#8208;NHC Ru&#8208;catalyst (up to 97:3 er) was then converted to a Z&#8208;selective catechodithiolate complex. The latter proved to be highly efficient in Z&#8208;selective AROCM of exo&#8208;norbornenes affording valuable trans&#8208;cyclopentanes with excellent Z&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98%) and high enantioselectivity (up to 96.5:3.5 er).</dc:description>

         <title>Periodic Mesoporous Organosilica Nanomaterials with Unconventional Structures and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Periodic mesoporous organosilicas (PMOs) are high surface area organic&#8210;inorganic hybrid nanomaterials that have found broad applications in various fields of research such as in (bio)chemistry or in material science. By choosing suitable organic groups in the framework of these materials, their surface properties such as polarity, optical/electrical characteristics and adsorption capacity can be tuned. This critical review provides an overview of the current state of the art in the developments and applications of some PMO nanomaterials in diverse fields of research. We place this in the context of four leading areas of PMO nanomaterials, including chiral PMOs, plugged PMO nanomaterials, Janus PMOs and PMO&#8208;based nanomotors. The review briefly discusses the recent and key findings on these PMO nanomaterials as well as their potential applications for future developments.</dc:description>

         <title>Bismuth Cations: Fluoride Ion Abstraction, Isocyanide Coordination, and Impact of Steric Bulk on Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular compound [BiDipp2(SbF6)], containing the bulky, donor&#8208;free bismuth cation [BiDipp2]+ has been synthesized and fully characterized (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). Using its methyl analog [BiMe2(SbF6)] as a second reference point, the impact of steric bulk on bismuth&#8208;based Lewis acidity has been investigated in a combined experimental (Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and modified Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method) and theoretical approach (DFT calculations). Reactivity studies of the bismuth cations towards (PF6)&#8211; and neutral Lewis bases such as isocyanides C&#8801;NR&#8217; have revealed facile fluoride ion abstraction and straightforward Lewis pair formation, respectively. The first examples of compounds featuring bismuth&#8208;bound isocyanides have been isolated and fully characterized.</dc:description>

         <title>Peracid oxidation of unactivated sp3 C&#8212;H bonds: An important solvent effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The peracid oxidation of hydrocarbons in chlorinated solvents is a low yielding and poorly selective process. Through a combination of DFT calculations, spectroscopic studies and kinetic measurement we show the origins of this is electronic in nature and can be influenced through the addition of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). Performing the reaction of a cycloalkane with mCPBA in a fluorinated alcohol solvent such as nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butanol (NFTB) or hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), which act as strong HBD and poor HBA, leads to significantly higher yields and selectivities being observed for the alcohol product. Application of the optimised reaction conditions allows for the selective oxidation of both cyclic and linear alkane substrates delivering the corresponding alcohol in up to 86% yield. The transformation shows selectivity for tertiary centres over secondary centres and the oxidation of secondary centres is strongly influenced by stereoelectronic effects. Primary centres are not oxidised by this method. A simple computational model developed to understand this transformation provides a powerful tool to reliably predict the influence of substitution and functionality on reaction outcome.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Unprecedented &#945;/&#946;&#8208;Alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;Glucans via Stereoselective Iterative Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glucans are major biomaterials on the earth, with &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans (i.e., amylose) and &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans (i.e., cellulose) being the most abundant ones, which are relevant to energy storage and structural function, respectively. Interestingly, (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans with alternate &#945;/&#946;&#8208;linkages, namely herewith amycellulose, have never been disclosed in nature. Here we report a robust glycosylation protocol for the stereoselective construction of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosidic linkages, which employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates as donors, TMSNTf2 as promoter, CH2Cl2/nitrile or CH2Cl2/THF as solvents. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by coupling five imidate donors with eight glycosyl acceptors, in which most of the glycosylations lead to high yield and exclusively 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;selectivity. Applying this glycosylation protocol and with an iterative manner, the unprecedented &#945;/&#946;&#8208;alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans up to a 16&#8208;mer have been synthesized. Differently from amylose, that adopts a compact helicoidal arrangement, the synthetic amycellulose features an extended ribbon&#8208;like conformation, comparable to the extended shape of cellulose.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A DFT study of several L&#8594;Al(ORF)3 (L = Lewis bases) adducts allowed the identification of (iPr2S)&#8594;Al(ORF)3 1&#8209;SiPr  2  as a &#8220;stable yet reactive&#8221; adduct. 1&#8209;SiPr 2  was shown to act as a masked Lewis superacid able to release Al(ORF)3 under mild conditions. It could be used to abstract a ORF&#8208; ligand from (bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)2 (bipyMe2 : 6,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridyl) and generate the nickel alkoxide complex&#160; [(bipyMe2)Ni(ORF)(iPr2S)]+[(RFO)3Al&#8208;F&#8208;Al(ORF)3]&#8208; 5.

         <dc:description>Deriving diverse compound libraries from a single substrate in high yields remains to be a challenge in cycloparaphenylene chemistry. In here, a strategy for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of shape&#8208;persistent alkyne&#8208;containing cycloparaphenylene has been explored using readily available azides. The copper&#8208;free [3+2]azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition provided high yields (&gt;90%) in a single reaction step. Systematic variation of the azides from electron&#8208;rich to &#8208;deficient shines light on how peripheral substitution influences the characteristics of the resulting adducts. We find that among the most affected properties are the molecular shape, the oxidation potential, excited state features, and affinities towards different fullerenes.

         <title>Trapping of a Transient Base&#8208;Stabilised Alumylene and Alumylene&#8208;type Reactivity of a Self&#8208;Stabilising Dialumene towards Organic Azides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reduction of a carbene&#8208;coordinated, sterically encumbered terphenyl&#8208;substituted aluminium diiodide, (LRAlI2), yielded a "masked" dialumene (LRAl=AlRL), self&#8208;stabilised through [2+2] cycloaddition with a peripheral aromatic group. During the course of the reaction, a carbene&#8208;stabilised arylalumylene (LRAl:) was generated in situ, which was trapped using an alkyne, generating an aluminacyclopropene or a C&#8208;H activated product thereof, depending on the steric bulk of the alkyne. The masked dialumene also underwent intramolecular cycloreversion and dissociation into alumylene fragments, which reacted with various organic azides to yield monomeric or dimeric iminoalanes depending on the sterics of the azide substituent. The thermodynamics of monomeric and dimeric iminoalane formation were probed by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation of Experimental and Calculated Reaction Enthalpies with Ligand Donor Strengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines (YPhos) have recently proven to be strongly donating ligands that enable high catalyst activities in gold(I)&#8208;mediated transformations. We now report on a calorimetric study dealing with the [Au(YPhos)Cl] system and assess YPhos&#8208;Au bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE). Comparison with other commonly used phosphines confirmed the high binding strengths of the YPhos ligands. Furthermore, the values of the reaction enthalpies were shown to correlate with the electronic properties of the ligands measured via the Tolman electronic parameter or the calculated molecular electrostatic potential at phosphorus. Notably, the reaction enthalpies can conveniently be derived by computational methods, thus making these easy&#8208;to&#8208;obtain descriptors for ligand donor property quantification.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of the oxidase mimetic activity of ceria nanoparticles by buffer composition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) is an important typical nanozyme with multiple enzyme mimetic activities, which could facilitate the oxidation of organic dyes in acidic conditions, because of the oxidase mimetic activity. Usually, the regulation of oxidase mimetic activity is focused on the adjustment of the structure, morphology, composition, surface, and other factors of nanozymes. However, the influence of the surrounding environment is not considered, which is very important during the reaction process. In this work, the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs in buffer solutions including citric acid, acetic acid and glycine buffer solutions was investigated, with the results that carboxyl group in buffer solution could adsorb the CNPs on the surface to promote the oxidase mimetic activity. Due to the chelation with cerium ion, the enhancement is more significant by molecules with polycarboxylic groups, and the enhancement is more efficient by carboxyl molecules in buffer solution, compared with the modification of the carboxyl groups on the surface, because of the easier operation and smaller steric hindrance. From viewpoint of increasing the oxidase mimetic activity of CNPs, the work is expected to provide references for the selection of the reaction system to optimize the oxidase mimetic activity in bio&#8208;detection application.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Potent and Highly Selective Epoxyketone&#8208;Based Plasmodium Proteasome Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of epoxyketone&#8208;based proteasome inhibitors with low nanomolar in&#8197;vitro potency for blood&#8208;stage Plasmodium falciparum and low cytotoxicity for human cells. The best inhibitor irreversibly inactivates the &#946;5 subunit of the P.&#8197;falciparum proteasome and contains a hexanoyl group at P4, a D&#8208;amino acid at P3 and a fluorinated aromatic L&#8208;amino acid at P1. This compound represents a novel, potent and selective antimalarial drug lead.







Abstract
Here, we present remarkable epoxyketone&#8208;based proteasome inhibitors with low nanomolar in&#8197;vitro potency for blood&#8208;stage Plasmodium falciparum and low cytotoxicity for human cells. Our best compound has more than 2,000&#8208;fold greater selectivity for erythrocytic&#8208;stage P.&#8197;falciparum over HepG2 and H460 cells, which is largely driven by the accommodation of the parasite proteasome for a D&#8208;amino acid in the P3 position and the preference for a difluorobenzyl group in the P1 position. We isolated the proteasome from P.&#8197;falciparum cell extracts and determined that the best compound is 171&#8208;fold more potent at inhibiting the &#946;5 subunit of P.&#8197;falciparum proteasome when compared to the same subunit of the human constitutive proteasome. These compounds also significantly reduce parasitemia in a P. berghei mouse infection model and prolong survival of animals by an average of 6&#8197;days. The current epoxyketone inhibitors are ideal starting compounds for orally bioavailable anti&#8208;malarial drugs.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Thia&#8208;Michael Addition to &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylacrylates for 3D Network Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast and efficient catalyst&#8208;free thia&#8208;Michael addition onto &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylacrylates is thoroughly studied through experimental kinetic studies and DFT calculations in order to elucidate its mechanism. An application to a swift preparation of a thermoset is also reported.Catalyst&#8208;Free Thia&#8208;Michael Addition to alpha&#8208;Trifluoromethylacrylates for 3D Network Synthesis (Leclerc, Poli, et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Thia&#8208;Michael additions (1,4&#8208;additions of a thiol to a Michael acceptor) are generally catalyzed by an external Br&#248;nsted or Lewis base. A spontaneous (uncatalyzed) Michael addition of thiols to &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl acrylates is described, as well as its application to the very efficient preparation of a thermoset. A thorough mechanistic investigation, based on an experimental kinetic study and on DFT calculations, is presented for the addition of arene&#8208; and alkanethiols to tert&#8208;butyl trifluoromethyl acrylate in polar aprotic solvents, unveiling a probable solvent&#8208;assisted proton transfer in the rate&#8208;determining step and a considerable lowering of the energy barrier induced by the CF3 group.

         <title>Multifunctional Intrinsically Disordered Regions in Transcription Factors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical features of intrinsically disordered regions in transcription factors that endow them with structural plasticity central to their functions in the nucleus are dissected in this Review. It highlights recent studies that illustrate the involvement of disordered regions in processes such as protein interactions, DNA binding and specificity, chromatin opening, and phase separation.







Abstract
Eukaryotic transcription factors (TFs) are the final integrators of a complex molecular feedback mechanism that interfaces with the genome, consolidating information for transcriptional regulation. TFs consist of both structured DNA&#8208;binding domains and long intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) embedded with motifs linked to transcriptional control. It is now well established that the dynamic multifunctionality of IDRs is the basis for a wide spectrum of TF functions necessary to navigate and regulate the human genome. This review dissects the chemical features of TF IDRs that endow them with structural plasticity that is central to their functions in the nucleus. Sequence analysis of a set of over 1600 human TFs through AlphaFold was used to identify key features of their IDRs. Recent studies were then highlighted to illustrate IDR involvement in processes such as protein interactions, DNA binding and specificity, chromatin opening, and phase separation. To expand our understanding of TF functions, future directions are suggested for integrating experiments and simulations, from in vitro to living systems.

This review dissects the chemical features of TF IDRs that endow them with structural plasticity that is central to their functions in the nucleus. Sequence analysis of a set of over 1600 human TFs through AlphaFold was used to identify key features of their IDRs. Recent studies were then highlighted to illustrate IDR involvement in processes such as protein interactions, DNA binding and specificity, chromatin opening, and phase separation. To expand our understanding of TF functions, future directions are suggested for integrating experiments and simulations, from in vitro to living systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Aldehyde Oxidation by a Tungsten Dependent Aldehyde Oxidoreductase from Aromatoleum Aromaticum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bacterial W&#8208;dependent enzyme aldehyde oxidoreductase catalyses the oxidation of a broad range of aldehyde to their carboxylic acids driven by electrochemistry at low applied potentials.







Abstract
In contrast to their molybdenum dependent relatives, tungsten enzymes operate at significantly lower redox potentials, and in some cases they can carry out reversible redox transformations of their substrates and products. Still, the electrochemical properties of W enzymes have received much less attention than their Mo relatives. Herein we analyse the tungsten enzyme aldehyde oxidoreductase (AOR) from the mesophilic bacterium Aromatoleum aromaticum which has been immobilised on a glassy carbon working electrode. This generates a functional system that electrochemically oxidises a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes in the presence of the electron transfer mediators benzyl viologen, methylene blue or dichlorophenol indophenol. Simulation of the cyclic voltammetry has enabled a thorough kinetic analysis of the system, which reveals that methylene blue acts as a two&#8208;electron acceptor. In contrast, the other two mediators act as single electron oxidants. The different electrochemical driving forces imparted by these mediators also lead to significantly different outer sphere electron transfer rates with AOR. This work shows that electrocatalytic aldehyde oxidation can be achieved at a low applied electrochemical potential leading to an extremely energy efficient catalytic process.

         <dc:description>
A portfolio of photochemical transformations found in a variety of areas can be rationalized through consideration of either gain of 4n&#960;&#8208;electron aromaticity or relief of (4n+2)&#8201;&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromaticity in excited states of &#960;&#960;* character. These back&#8208;of&#8208;an&#8208;envelope tools provided by Baird's rule serve as a compass for excursions in electronically excited states. More information can be found in the Review by H.

         <title>Reduction of Nitrous Oxide by Light Alcohols Catalysed by a Low&#8208;Valent Ruthenium Diazadiene Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low valent diruthenium dihydride complex catalyses the reduction of nitrous oxide with primary alcohols or hydrogen. Light alcohols (methanol, ethanol) or benzylic alcohols are transformed in a dehydrogenative coupling reaction to carboxylate derivatives, while N2O is converted to N2 and H2O.The reaction proceeds under mild conditions achieving TON of up to 480 and TOF of 56&#8197;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Decomposition of the environmentally harmful gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is usually performed thermally or catalytically. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is currently the most promising technology for N2O mitigation, a multicomponent heterogeneous catalytic system that employs reducing agents such as ammonia, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, or a combination thereof. This study reports the first homogenous catalyst that performs the reduction of nitrous oxide employing readily available and cheap light alcohols such as methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol derivatives. During the reaction, these alcohols are transformed in a dehydrogenative coupling reaction to carboxylate derivatives, while N2O is converted to N2 and H2O, later entering the reaction as substrate. The reaction is catalysed by the low&#8208;valent dinuclear ruthenium complex [Ru2H(&#956;&#8208;H)(Me2dad)(dbcot)2] that carries a diazabutadiene, Me2dad, and two rigid dienes, dbcot, as ligands. The reduction of nitrous oxide proceeds with low catalyst loadings under relatively mild conditions (65&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C, 1.4&#8197;bar N2O) achieving turnover numbers of up to 480 and turnover frequencies of up to 56&#8197;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Orientational Control of Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Pyrene Clusters by Using a DNA Scaffold</title>

Not just any which way: Circularly polarized luminescence from a pyrene cluster in DNA duplexes has been systematically investigated. CPL properties varied depending not only on the distance but also on the relative orientation between two pyrene dimers.







Abstract
We have investigated the chiroptical activities of pyrene clusters incorporated within a DNA duplex. Three pyrene derivatives were prepared on d&#8208;threoninol linkers to allow incorporation within a DNA strand. DNA scaffolds containing dimers, tetramers, and hexamers of the pyrene derivatives were prepared. The homodimers of 1&#8208; and of 4&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, but not 2&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, emitted intense circularly polarized luminescence signals. Although increasing the number of pyrene units weakened the signal, insertion of natural base pairs between two dimers enhanced its intensity. Interestingly, circularly polarized luminescence intensities varied non&#8208;monotonically depending on the number of intervening base pairs, thus indicating the importance of orientation between pyrene dimers. The results presented here could lead to the development of bright circularly polarized luminescence materials and probes.

         <title>Structural Dissection of Epsin&#8208;1 N&#8208;Terminal Helical Peptide: The Role of Hydrophobic Residues in Modulating Membrane Curvature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporal structural alterations in cellular membranes are the hallmark of many vital processes. In these cellular events, the induction of local changes in membrane curvature often plays a pivotal role. Many amphiphilic peptides are able to modulate membrane curvature, but there is little information on specific structural factors that direct the curvature change. Epsin&#8208;1 is a representative protein thought to initiate invagination of the plasma membrane upon clathrin&#8208;coated vesicles formation. Its N&#8208;terminal helical segment (EpN18) plays a key role in inducing positive membrane curvature. This study aimed to elucidate the essential structural features of EpN18 in order to better understand general curvature&#8208;inducing mechanisms, and to design effective tools for rationally controlling membrane curvature. Structural dissection of peptides derived from EpN18 revealed the decisive contribution of hydrophobic residues to (i) enhancing membrane interactions, (ii) helix structuring, (iii) inducing positive membrane curvature, and (iv) loosening lipid packing. The strongest effect was attained by substitution with leucine residues, as this EpN18 analog showed a marked ability to promote the influx of octa&#8208;arginine cell&#8208;penetrating peptides into living cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tuning the bridging fashion of anilato ligand in dinuclear DyIII complexes, reveals a sizable effect on the slow relaxation of magnetization. Combined experimental and theoretical studies divulge that the geometry with high order axial symmetry (pseudo square antiprism) reduces the transverse crystal fields corresponding to QTM resulting in a significant increase in energy barrier (Ueff = 518 cm&#8208;1) through the Orbach relaxation process whereas the geometry with lower symmetry (triangular dodecahedron, pseudo D2d) enhances the transverse crystal fields that accelerate the ground state QTM process. Notably, the value 518 cm&#8208;1 represents the highest energy barrier among anilato ligand based SMMs.</dc:description>

         <title>[ReH3(PPh3)4] &#8211; A Key Compound in the Rhenium Hydride Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key to rhenium hydride chemistry: The preparation of crystalline [ReH3(PPh3)4] allows for the preparation of defined rhenium(III) polyhydrido complexes through ligand exchange procedures with more basic phosphines. Azavinylidene complexes of the type [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)R)] are the final products of reactions with nitriles. Potential proton or hydride donors react with [ReH3(PPh3)4] in toluene to give the pentahydride [ReH5(PPh3)3].







Abstract
The chemistry of the rhenium trihydrido complex [ReH3(PPh3)4] (1) has been reinvestigated. An improved synthesis and the solid&#8208;state structure of the compound as well as several reactions are reported. The solid&#8208;state structure of 1 is similar to that of [TcH3(PPh3)4] having a capped&#8208;octahedral coordination sphere. The PPh3 ligands surround the Re atom in a trigonal&#8208;pyramidal mode with a short apical Re&#8722;P bond (2.300(2)&#8197;&#197;) and three longer basal bonds (2.429(2)&#8211;2.449(2)&#8197;&#197;). Reactions of 1 with monodentate phosphines such as PMe3 or PBu3 give the mono&#8208;substituted complexes [ReH3(PPh3)3(PMe3)] (2) and [ReH3(PPh3)3(PBu3)] (3) under retention of the apical PPh3 ligand and substitution of one of the basal PPh3 ligands. The stability of the phosphine trihydride complexes decreases in the order PPh3&gt;PMe3&gt;PBu3. Treatment of [ReH3(PPh3)4] with trityl hexafluorophosphate in CH3CN does not result in a hydride abstraction, but gives the tetrahydrido cation [ReH4(NCCH3)(PPh3)3]+ (4), while reactions with nitriles give unstable azavinylidene complexes of the composition [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)R)] (5). They are formed by an insertion of the nitrile into a Re&#8722;H bond. The solid&#8208;state structure of the methyl derivative [ReH2(PPh3)3(NC(H)CH3)] (5&#8201;a) was determined showing a linear Re&#8722;N&#8722;C unit with rhenium&#8722;nitrogen and nitrogen&#8722;carbon double bonds, while the N=CH&#8722;C bond is clearly bent with an angle of 124&#176;. Two previously unknown polymorphs of [ReH5(PPh3)3] were isolated from reactions of 1 with HOC6H3(CH3)2 and thiourea after prolonged heating in toluene and characterized by IR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Antimicrobial Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes Containing Triphenylphosphonium Solubilizing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PPh3 helps protect against pathogens: Conjugated oligoelectrolytes are a modular molecular platform for the design of novel antimicrobial agents. Substituting terminal alkylammonium cationic groups with more lipophilic triphenylphosphonium counterparts enabled bactericidal activity towards ESKAPE pathogens and clinically relevant mycobacteria. In vivo efficacy was verified in a murine wound model, at clinically relevant dosages.







Abstract
Conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are an emerging class of amphiphilic antimicrobial compounds with a modular molecular framework suitable for simple chemical derivatization. Here, a series of COE derivatives with a stilbene&#8208;conjugated segment and triphenylphosphonium (TPP) pendant groups was designed and synthesized to understand how lipophilic cationic groups impact antimicrobial activity. In vitro evaluations against ESKAPE pathogens showed broad&#8208;spectrum activity towards multi&#8208;drug resistant (MDR) bacteria and mycobacteria, with TPP groups enhancing antimicrobial activity towards clinically relevant Gram&#8208;negative strains compared to their ammonium analogues. We studied the interactions of DM6P, the most active TPP&#8208;COE compound, with various membrane assays. Treatment of bacterial cells with DM6P showed enhanced permeability of cell membranes without inducing the development of significant bacterial resistance. Moreover, DM6P eliminated 99.99&#8201;% of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA) in an in&#8197;vivo wound model. These results represent a promising chemical strategy for increasing the activity spectrum of membrane&#8208;active COE antibiotics to tackle challenging drug&#8208;resistant targets.

         <title>Diastereoselectivity Switch During Alkene Reductions: Diastereodivergent Syntheses of Molecular Fossils via MHAT or Homogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a diastereoselective and robust strategy we prepared a set of 16 molecular fossils (MF) and confirmed the presence of 6 of them in a 120&#8208;million&#8208;year&#8208;old geological sample. Unlike structural fossils, MF came from soft tissues, and during their (dia)catagenesis they suffer framework and stereochemical modifications exposing their geological history. Such changes and concentration differences helped us to prove an ancient oil migration event.







Abstract
Sixteen geosterane derivatives were synthesized in up to 57&#8201;% overall yields in four steps harnessing the olefin cross&#8208;metathesis (OCM) and Metal hydride H atom transfer (MHAT) or homogeneous hydrogenation reactions as key steps. Drawing on this strategy, the diastereomeric ratio (d.&#8201;r.) reached up to 24&#8201;:&#8201;1 for the thermodynamic isomer and 7&#8201;:&#8201;1 for the other isomer in the hydrogenation step. In a geological sample from northeast Brazil, we confirmed the putative structures previously assumed as methyl 2&#8208;(3&#945;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan) acetate, methyl 2&#8208;(3&#946;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)acetate, and methyl 6&#8208;(3&#946;&#8208;5&#945;H&#8208;cholestan)hexanoate, as well three new molecular fossils of approximately 120&#8197;million years old. We also proved the migration marking ability of those carboxylic acids derived from forerunner geosteranes during an oil migration event, which suggests their aptitudes as molecular odometers. Our approach demonstrated swiftness and effectiveness in preparing a molecular library of geological biomarkers would also be appropriate to generate stereochemical diversity in molecular libraries for medicinal chemistry and natural product anticipation.

         <title>Metal Complex Molecular Junctions as Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule junctions and self&#8208;assembled monolayer junctions are attractive architectures for thermoelectric devices. However, given the poor thermoelectric performance of common organic molecules, molecules characterized by high conductance and Seebeck coefficient values have been extensively explored. Metal complexes are promising possible active components of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric devices given that metal&#8211;ligand combinations and functions can be made to vary to modulate the transmission functions, thus strongly influencing conductance and Seebeck coefficient. In this concept article are described recent studies wherein thermoelectric measurements were conducted on metal complex junctions. Furthermore, the potential for the use of the junctions in thermoelectric devices is discussed.</dc:description>

Metal complexes are promising possible active components of high-performance thermoelectric devices given that metal&#8211;ligand combinations and functions can be made to vary to modulate the transmission functions, thus strongly influencing conductance and Seebeck coefficient. In this concept article are described recent studies wherein thermoelectric measurements were conducted on metal complex junctions. Furthermore, the potential for the use of the junctions in thermoelectric devices is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Organocatalysis and Superacid Activation: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the pioneer reports of Akiyama and Terada on Br&#248;nsted acid organocatalysis, this field never stopped growing with the development of ingenious strategies for the activation of challenging poorly reactive substrates. If the development of superacidic organocatalysts is an important way to selectively functionalize reluctant electrophiles, other approaches have emerged such as the combination of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids as well as the consecutive organocatalysis and superacid activation. This concept aims to highlight these different strategies and demonstrate their complementarity.</dc:description>

         <title>Differently N&#8208;Capped Analogues of Fmoc&#8208;FF.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Short and ultra&#8208;short peptides have been recently envisioned as excellent building blocks for the formulation of hydrogels with appealing properties. Due to its simplicity and capability to gel under physiological conditions, Fmoc&#8208;FF (N&#945;&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;diphenylalanine), remains one of the most studied low molecular&#8208;weight hydrogelators. Since its first identification in 2006, a plethora of its analogues were synthetized and investigated for the fabrication of novel supramolecular materials. Here we report a description of the Fmoc&#8208;FF analogues in which the aromatic Fmoc group is replaced with other substituents. These analogues are distinguished into five different classes including derivatives: i) customized with solid phase peptide synthesis protecting groups; ii) containing non&#8208;aromatic groups, iii) containing aromatic groups, iv) derivatized with metal complexes and v) containing stimuli&#8208;responsive groups. The morphological, mechanical, and functional effects caused by this modification on the resulting material are also pointed out.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8208;H Functionalization of Heterocycles with Triplet Carbenes by means of an Unexpected 1,2&#8208;Alkyl Radical Migration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The C&#8208;H functionalization of indole heterocycles constitutes a key strategy to leverage the synthesis of endogenous signaling molecules such as tryptamine or tryptophol. Herein, we report on the photocatalytic reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with indole, which shows an unusual solvent dependency. While C2&#8208;functionalization occurs under protic conditions, the use of aprotic solvents leads to a complete reversal of selectivity and exclusive C3&#8208;functionalization occurs. To rationalize for this unexpected reactivity switch, we have conducted detailed theoretical and experimental studies, which suggest the participation of a triplet carbene intermediate that undergoes initial C2&#8208;functionalization. A distinct cationic [1,2]&#8208;alkyl radical migration then leads to formation of C3&#8208;functionalized indole. We conclude with the application of this photocatalytic reaction to access oxidized tryptophol derivatives including gram&#8208;scale synthesis and derivatization reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Heterobiaryls through Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atropisomeric heterobiaryls play a vital role in natural products, chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and other research fields, which has aroused great interest from chemists in recent years. Up until now, a growing number of optically active heterobiaryls based on indole, quinoline, isoquinoline, pyridine, pyrrole, azole, and benzofuran&#8208;skeletons have been successfully synthesized through metal or organic catalytic cross&#8208;coupling, functionalization of prochiral or racemic hererobiaryls, and ring formation. Among different strategies for the atroposelective synthesis of heterobiaryls, the strategy of ring formation has become a vital tool toward this goal. In this review, we summarized the enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral heterobiaryls through a ring formation approach, such as cycloaddition, cyclization, and chirality conversion. Meanwhile, the reaction mechanism and the corresponding applications of the chiral heterobiaryls are also involved.</dc:description>

         <title>The Adsorptive Separation of Ethylene from C2 Hydrocarbons by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separating ethylene (C2H4) from the C2 hydrocarbons is of prime industrial importance for the process of high&#8208;purity C2H4 as an essential raw material in the petrochemical industry. Due to their similar physicochemical properties, the separation of C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons typically entails high&#8208;energy separation technologies such as cryogenic distillation and extraction. Alternatively, adsorption separation using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are low&#8208;energy separation technologies that manufacture high&#8208;purity gas under mild conditions. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in MOFs for the separation and purification of C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons. The mechanisms underlying separating C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons using MOFs are also highlighted. This review also discussed the major challenges and developments of MOFs to separate C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Open&#8208;Close Motion of a Chiral Molecular Plier to Modulate Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chiral molecular plier&#8217;s design, synthesis, characterisation and operations are presented. The molecular plier encompasses three units: a BINOL unit which acts as a pivot as well as a chiral inducer, an azobenzene unit, which acts as a photo&#8208;switchable component and two zinc porphyrin, acting as a reporter. E to Z isomerisation persuaded by irradiating with 370 nm light alters the dihedral angle of the pivot BINOL unit, which adjusts the distance between two porphyrin units. The plier can be switched to its initial state by exposure to 456 nm light or heating at 50 &#186;C. NMR, CD and molecular modelling supported the reversible switching and change in dihedral angle and distance between reporter moiety, which was further exploited for binding with several ditopic guests. The longest guest was found to form the strongest complex, R,R&#8208;isomer formed a stronger complex than S,S&#8208;isomer, Z&#8208;isomer of the plier formed stronger complex than the E&#8208;isomer with the guest. Moreover, complexation also increased the E&#8208;to&#8208;Z switching efficiency and decreased the thermal back isomerisation of the azobenzene unit.</dc:description>

         <title>Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Supercapacitor of Organohydrogel Electrolyte and Its Combined Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogel&#8208;based flexible supercapacitors possess the merits of highly ionic conductivity and superior power density, but the existence of water limits their application in the extreme temperature scenarios. Noticeably, it is a challenge for people to design more extremely temperature adaptable systems for flexible supercapacitor based on hydrogel with wide&#8208;temperature region. In this work, a wide&#8208;temperature flexible supercapacitor that can operate at &#8208;20&#8208;80 &#176;C is fabricated by the organohydrogel electrolyte and its combined electrode (also known as electrode/electrolyte composite). By introducing highly hydratable LiCl into ethylene glycol (EG)/H2O binary solvent, owning to the ionic hydration effect of LiCl and hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between EG and H2O molecules, the organohydrogel electrolyte exhibits satisfactory freezing resistance (&#8208;113.9 &#176;C of freezing point), anti&#8208;drying capability (78.2% of weight retention after vacuum drying at 60 &#176;C for 12 hours) and excellent ionic conductivity both at room temperature (13.9 mS/cm) and low temperature (6.5 mS/cm after 31 days at &#8208;20 &#176;C). By using organohydrogel electrolyte as binder, the prepared electrode/electrolyte composite effectively reduces interface impedance and enhances specific capacitance due to the uninterrupted ion transport channels and extended interface contact area. The assembled supercapacitor delivers a specific capacitance of 149 F/g, power density of 160 W/kg and energy density of 13.24 Wh/kg at the current density of 0.2 A/g. The initial capacitance can maintain 100% after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A/g. More importantly, the specific capacitances can be well maintained even at &#8208;20 &#176;C and 80 &#176;C. With other advantages such as excellent mechanical property, the supercapacitor is an ideal power source suitable for various working conditions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hydrogel-based flexible supercapacitors possess the merits of highly ionic conductivity and superior power density, but the existence of water limits their application in the extreme temperature scenarios. Noticeably, it is a challenge for people to design more extremely temperature adaptable systems for flexible supercapacitor based on hydrogel with wide-temperature region. In this work, a wide-temperature flexible supercapacitor that can operate at -20-80 &#176;C is fabricated by the organohydrogel electrolyte and its combined electrode (also known as electrode/electrolyte composite). By introducing highly hydratable LiCl into ethylene glycol (EG)/H2O binary solvent, owning to the ionic hydration effect of LiCl and hydrogen-bond interaction between EG and H2O molecules, the organohydrogel electrolyte exhibits satisfactory freezing resistance (-113.9 &#176;C of freezing point), anti-drying capability (78.2% of weight retention after vacuum drying at 60 &#176;C for 12 hours) and excellent ionic conductivity both at room temperature (13.9 mS/cm) and low temperature (6.5 mS/cm after 31 days at -20 &#176;C). By using organohydrogel electrolyte as binder, the prepared electrode/electrolyte composite effectively reduces interface impedance and enhances specific capacitance due to the uninterrupted ion transport channels and extended interface contact area. The assembled supercapacitor delivers a specific capacitance of 149 F/g, power density of 160 W/kg and energy density of 13.24 Wh/kg at the current density of 0.2 A/g. The initial capacitance can maintain 100% after 2000 cycles at 1.0 A/g. More importantly, the specific capacitances can be well maintained even at -20 &#176;C and 80 &#176;C. With other advantages such as excellent mechanical property, the supercapacitor is an ideal power source suitable for various working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Synthesis of Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A facile and efficient synthesis of polysubstituted indoles from &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;enamides, &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;amides, or their tautomeric mixture via electrophilic activation strategy is described. The salient feature of this methodology is the use of either combined Hendrickson reagent and triflic anhydride (Tf2O) or triflic acid (TfOH) to control the chemoselectivity in the intramolecular cyclodehydration to provide a predictable approach to these valuable indoles with flexible substituent patterns. Moreover, the mild reaction conditions, simple execution, high chemoselectivity, excellent yields, and wide range of synthetic potential of products make this protocol much attractive for academic research and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold Teflates Revisited: From the Lewis Superacid [Au(OTeF5)3] to the Anion [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic route to the gold(III) pentafluoroorthotellurates [Au(OTeF5)3] and [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; based on commercially available gold chlorides is presented. The former was classified as a Lewis superacid, with an enhanced Lewis acidity yet better manageability compared to AuF3, underlining the potential of the &#8722;OTeF5 group to also stabilize highly reactive transition&#8208;metal compounds.







Abstract
A new synthetic access to the Lewis acid [Au(OTeF5)3] and the preparation of the related, unprecedented anion [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; with inorganic or organic cations starting from commercially available and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle gold chlorides are presented. In this first extensive study of the Lewis acidity of a transition&#8208;metal teflate complex by using different experimental and quantum chemical methods, [Au(OTeF5)3] was classified as a Lewis superacid. The solid&#8208;state structure of the triphenylphosphine oxide adduct [Au(OPPh3)(OTeF5)3] was determined, representing the first structural characterization of an adduct of this highly reactive [Au(OTeF5)3]. Therein, the coordination environment around the gold center slightly deviates from the typical square planar geometry. The [Au(OTeF5)4]&#8722; anion shows a similar coordination motif.

         <title>CryoEM Structure with ATP Synthase Enables Late&#8208;stage Diversification of Cruentaren A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cruentaren A is a natural product that exhibits potent antiproliferative activity against various cancer cell lines, yet its binding site within ATP synthase remained unknown, limiting the development of improved analogues as anticancer agents. Herein, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of cruentaren A bound to ATP synthase, which allowed for the design of new inhibitors via semisynthetic modification. Examples of cruentaren A derivatives include a trans&#8208;alkene isomer, which was found to exhibit similar activity as cruentaren A against three cancer cell lines as well as several other analogues that retained potent inhibitory activity. Together, these studies provide a foundation for the generation of cruentaren A derivatives as potential therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Photooxygenation of Anthracene Carboxyimide for Singlet Oxygen Formation: Mechanistic Study and Efficient Nitrite Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic aromatic endoperoxides are important sources of singlet oxygen (1O2) and their formation from polyacenes is well established. Anthracene carboxyimides are of particular interest as they exhibit excellent antitumor activity and possess unique photochemical properties. However, the photooxygenation of the synthetically versatile anthracene carboxyimide moiety has not been reported due to its competing [4+4] photodimerization reaction. Herein, we describe the reversible photo&#8208;oxidation of an anthracene carboxyimide. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis surprisingly revealed the formation of a racemic mixture of chiral hydroperoxides, rather than the expected endoperoxide. The photoproduct undergoes both photo&#8208; and thermolysis to form 1O2. Activation parameters were derived for the thermolysis and the mechanisms of photooxygenation and thermolysis are discussed. The anthracene carboxyimide also showed high selectivity and sensitivity for nitrite anions in acidic aqueous media and possessed stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface Regulation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells through Potassium Citrate Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficiency and stability are key factors determining the final cost of electricity that perovskite solar cells (PSCs) generate. To date, effective strategy to progress in achieving efficient and stable PSCs is still a difficult problem that researchers continue to explore. Here, we report a useful way to improve the quality of SnO2 film by introducing potassium citrate (PC) into SnO2 nanoparticles solution. PC passivates interface defects between perovskite and SnO2 layers via the interactions of functional groups&#160;(K+, &#8208;COO&#8208;) in PC with undersaturated Pb and I ions in perovskite and Sn4+ in SnO2. The resultant photovoltaic (PV) device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.79%. The introduction of PC interface also significantly suppress the degradation of PSCs, by which 87.6% of initial PCE is maintained after 2850 hours storage in ambient environment. Moreover, the devices retained 95.5% of initial PCE under 1&#8208;sun continuous illumination for 1000 hours.</dc:description>

Abstract
A chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective aza&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction of 5&#8208;aminopyrazole derivatives with cyclic ketimines attached to a neutral functional group is reported. This protocol allows the formation of pyrazole&#8208;based C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones with high enantioselectivities and regioselectivities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed enantioselective aza-Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction of 5-aminopyrazole derivatives with cyclic ketimines attached to a neutral functional group is reported. This protocol allows the formation of pyrazole-based C2-quaternary indolin-3-ones with high enantioselectivities and regioselectivities. Moreover, gram-scale synthesis of the 5-aminopyrazole-based C2-quaternary indolin-3-ones was performed, with no decrease in the yield and enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Piezoelectric Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Mediated Mechanoredox Borylation and Arylation Reactions by Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon mechanical agitation, piezoelectric metal&#8208;organic frameworks UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can act as electron donors to promote mechanoredox reactions, enabling both borylation and arylation reactions between aryl diazonium salts and bis(pinacolato)diborane or heteroarenes with high efficiencies.







Abstract
Herein, metal&#8208;organic frameworks UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 were synthesized, and their piezoelectric properties were characterized by piezoresponse force microscopy. Under mechanical agitation, the highly polarized UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 can act as electron donors to reduce aryl diazonium salts, forming the aryl radical species, which further react with bis(pinacolato)diborane or heteroarenes to generate the desired products with broad substrate scope. For all substrates, it was found that the reactions mediated by UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which exhibited better piezoelectric property, were more efficient than those promoted by UiO&#8208;66. Moreover, it was shown that the convenient regeneration of spent catalysts can be reused for promoting mechanoredox reactions without loss of activities by taking advantage of the unmatched repairability of metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Mechanistic studies revealed that a radical pathway was involved in these transformations.

         <title>The Prominence of Facilitator&#160;&#960;&#8208;Holes: The Classic N&#8592;N Pnictogen Bonding in Nitrobenzene&#8208;Ammonia Dimer with its Structural Elucidation and Experimental Characterization at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct correlation between the magnitude of potential at the &#960;&#8208;hole over nitrogen in &#8208;NO2 moiety and the strength of the pnictogen bond hosted by nitrogen is obtained by infrared spectroscopy of matrix isolated heterodimers of nitromethane and nitrobenzene with ammonia. The pivotal role of &#960;&#8208;hole over nitrogen as a facilitator of pnictogen bonds is demonstrated.







Abstract
The nitrogen of nitro group is a paradigmatic pnictogen due the presence of a&#160;&#960;&#8208;hole and a number of studies have been performed recently on prototypical nitromethane (NM). Homodimers and heterodimers of NM are sustained by&#160;&#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bonds hosted by nitrogen. To understand the effect of substitution on this &#960;&#8208;hole and thus the pnictogen bond, heterodimers of nitrobenzene (NB; phenyl substitution in place of methyl) with ammonia (AM) have been probed, as a test case, using matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy and&#160;ab initio&#160;computations. Of the four structures optimized on the potential energy surface the energetically dominant global minimum, stabilized by &#960;&#8208;hole driven O=N&#8592;N pnictogen bonding with co&#8208;operative N&#8722;H&#8592;O hydrogen bonding, was experimentally identified at low temperatures. A comparison of the pnictogen bonding of NB&#8208;AM dimers with NM counterpart (NM&#8208;AM dimers) divulged the dominance of electrostatic origin of pnictogen bonding in both the class of dimers. The reduced strength of pnictogen bonding in NB&#8208;AM dimers in comparison to NM&#8208;AM dimers was discerned, which has been established to be a consequence of the reduced electrostatic potential at the &#960;&#8208;hole of NB relative to that in NM. The strength of&#160;&#960;&#8208;hole driven pnictogen bond was directly correlated with the binding energy and the infrared shifts in the signature vibrational bands of the NB, NM and AM submolecules due to dimerization under matrix isolated conditions at low temperatures.

         <title>Base Pair Stacking Modulates Solid&#8208;State Charge Transport in DNA Hairpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge transport in a series of thymine&#8208;thymine mismatched DNA hairpins is fine&#8208;tuned. Surprisingly, the solid&#8208;state charge transport enhancement exhibits a semi&#8208;quantitative linear relationship with the integrity changes of DNA base pair stacking, which is modulated by the Hg ion chelation and DNA sequence. Such a deep mechanistic understanding will guide the design of future DNA&#8208;based electronics and bio/chemical sensors.







Abstract
Particular interest has been focused on modulation of solid&#8208;state charge transport (CT) in DNA. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to do so in a sensitive and predictive manner due to the lack of a definite relationship between DNA base pair stacking and DNA CT. The challenges can be mainly attributed to the ill&#8208;defined systems, which may lead to ambiguous and even contradictory conclusions. Here, we use DNA hairpins to construct the well&#8208;defined self&#8208;assembled monolayers. We reveal nearly positive&#8208;linear correlations between DNA conformation and CT in the DNA hairpins regulated with metal ion chelation and DNA sequence. The correlations have been confirmed by the solid&#8208;state current&#8208;voltage characteristics and circular dichroism in solution. The enhanced CT via metal ion chelated DNA hairpins is mainly from the improved DNA energy coupling to electrodes, not the almost unchanged energy barrier when Hg ion&#8208;induced DNA conformational switches toward the canonical B&#8208;form.

         <title>An Innovative Bi12SiO20 Multistage Cubic Nanospheres Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Bi//Zn Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique multistage cubic nanospheres Bi12SiO20 architecture is prepared by a simple calcination method and used as a cathode for high&#8208;performance Bi//Zn battery. The battery fabricated by the MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20 cathode and Zn foil anode shows superior energy density (247.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) and excellent cycling durability (100&#8201;% capacity retention after 5000 cycles).







Abstract
Alkaline Bi//Zn batteries with superb safety, low cost, and high power density are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. However, their developments are severely limited by the Bi&#8208;based cathode as the unsatisfying capacity and cycle life. Herein, an innovative multistage cubic nanospheres Bi12SiO20 (MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20) is successfully synthesized by a simple calcination method, which shows excellent energy storage performances of superior specific capacity (294&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and outstanding rate capability (134&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 12&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). When coupled with Zn anode a superior MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn is fabricated, which delivers a high energy density of 247.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 375&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Additionally, the MCS&#8208;Bi12SiO20//Zn battery shows excellent cycle life, which reserves more than 100&#8201;% of its original capacity after 5000 cycles. Such performance is higher than previously reported Bi//Zn battery and most other Zn batteries. This is the first example of using Bi12SiO20 as cathode for RAZBs, which may provide highly promising material towards better Bi//Zn battery.

         <title>Electrochemical and Structural Characterization of Soft Landed Tungsten&#8208;Substituted Lindqvist Polyoxovanadate&#8208;Alkoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion soft&#8208;landing enables accurate characterization of compound features using high&#8208;quality separation power. Using a quadrupole mass filter, ions are mass&#8208;selected and deposited onto a surface maintaining structural integrity. Doped and undoped polyoxovandates synthesized using solvothermal conditions are accurately characterized using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and cyclic voltammetry.







Abstract
Lindqvist polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide (POV&#8208;alkoxide) clusters are excellent candidates for applications in energy storage and conversion due to their rich electrochemical profiles. One approach to tune the redox properties of these cluster complexes is through substitutional cationic doping within the hexavanadate core. Here, we report the synthesis of a series of tungsten&#8208;substituted POV&#8208;alkoxide clusters with one and two tungsten atoms. Soft landing of mass&#8208;selected ions was used to purify heterometal POV&#8208;alkoxides that cannot be readily separated using conventional approaches. The soft landed POV&#8208;alkoxides are characterized using infrared reflection&#8208;absorption spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The redox properties of the isolated ions are examined using an in&#8197;situ electrochemical cell which enables traditional in vacuo electrochemical measurements inside of an ion soft landing instrument. Although the overall cluster core retains redox activity after tungsten doping, vanadium&#8208;based redox couples (VV/VIV) are shifted substantially, indicating a pronounced effect of a heteroatom on the electronic structure of the core.

         <title>Green Synthesis and Analytical Characterization of Core&#8208;Shell Copper Sub&#8208;Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green procedure for the preparation of Cu particles is here described, exploiting the stabilizing efficacy of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to obtain Cu@PVP core&#8208;shell particles. A simple washing and immobilization protocol allows modifying a polymer matrix without altering its physicochemical properties. Composite thin films show a controlled ionic release with promising antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
This study demonstrates a simple and reproducible approach to synthesize green core&#8208;shell copper sub&#8208;microparticles stabilized by poly(n&#8208;vinyl)pyrrolidone (PVP). Cu@PVP colloids were here prepared using copper sulfate pentahydrate as precursor and glucose as reducing agent. The presence of PVP in the synthetic medium eliminates the need for an inert atmosphere during the process, thus simplifying the whole method. Both the morphology and the spectroscopic properties of Cu@PVP colloids were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, and infrared, UV&#8208;Vis and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Size distributions and average shell thickness were obtained by statistical analysis on TEM micrographs, and spectroscopies demonstrated the formation of a PVP layer around the copper core. The produced colloids were employed in composite thin films for potential antimicrobial application, in association with a highly&#8208;recyclable polymer: polycarbonate (4,4&#8217;&#8208;(1&#8208;methylethylidene)bis(phenol)).

         <title>Bioinspired Design of an Uncharged Ambipolar Helical Scaffold To Achieve Efficient Solid&#8208;State Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereo&#8208;divergent packing of helical scaffolds based on pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide is observed in two different solid forms obtained from solvents of different polarity. Efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction is observed in the yellow form, which has a homochiral molecular arrangement with closer intermolecular proximity, and spatial alignment of polar residues.







Abstract
This work demonstrates highly efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction in helical organic scaffolds inspired by the biomolecule gramicidin&#8197;A. The scaffold, 1, derived from a pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide (PDC) residue adopts a helical conformation that is stabilized by a network of strong bifurcated intramolecular H&#8208;bonds between the polar residues that align the inner (concave) face of the molecule, while the aromatic units in 1 are oriented outwards. As a result, the helix attains an ambipolar nature just like gramicidin&#8197;A. Two different solid forms of 1 could be isolated: a yellow solid from high&#8208;polarity solvents and an orange solid from low&#8208;polarity solvents. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies showed that in the former, molecules of 1 are stacked in a homochiral fashion, while in the latter heterochiral stacks of 1 were present. The yellow form exhibited an almost &#8764;300&#8208;fold higher conductivity (of up to 0.12&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 95&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;% relative humidity) than the orange form as a result of closer intermolecular proximity and lower activation energy of 0.098&#8197;eV, thus indicating a Grotthus mechanism of proton transport. This study establishes the key role of bioinspired design and controlled stereo&#8208;organization of such discrete uncharged organic molecules in achieving efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction.

         <title>No Transition Metals Required &#8211; Oxygen Promoted Synthesis of Imines from Primary Alcohols and Amines under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of imines denotes a cornerstone in organic chemistry. The use of alcohols as renewable substituents for carbonyl&#8208;functionality represents an attractive opportunity. Consequently, carbonyl moieties can be in situ generated from alcohols upon transition&#8208;metal catalysis under inert atmosphere. Alternatively, bases can be utilized under aerobic conditions. In this context, we report the synthesis of imines from benzyl alcohols and anilines, promoted by KOtBu under aerobic conditions at room temperature in the absence of any transition&#8208;metal catalyst. A detailed investigation of the radical mechanism of the underlying reaction is presented. This reveals a complex reaction network fully supporting the experimental findings.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tuning of Quantum Dots Photocatalysts for the Synthesis of Tropane Alkaloid Skeletons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several types of Quantum Dots (QDs) (CdS, CdSe and InP, as well as core&#8208;shell QDs such as type I InPZnS, quasi type&#8208;II CdSe&#8208;CdS and inverse type&#8208;I CdS&#8208;CdSe) were considered for generating &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl free radicals. The feasibility of the oxidation of the N&#8208;aryl amines and the generation of the desired radical was evidenced experimentally by quenching of the photoluminescence of the QDs and by testing a vinylation reaction using an alkenylsulfone radical trap. The QDs were tested in a radical [3+3]annulation reaction giving access to tropane skeletons and that requires the completion of two consecutive catalytic cycles. Several QDs such as CdS core, CdSe core and inverted type I CdS&#8208;CdSe core&#8208;shell proved to be efficient photocatalysts for this reaction. Interestingly, the addition of a second shorter chain ligand to the QDs appeared to be essential to complete the second catalytic cycle and to obtain the desired bicyclic tropane derivatives. Finally, the scope of the [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction was explored for the best performing QDs and isolated yields that compares well with classical iridium photocatalysis were obtained.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A detailed chemical investigation of the Sanya Bay nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus yielded thirteen new sesquiterpenoids, namely sanyagunins A&#8722;H, sanyalides A&#8722;C, and sanyalactams A and B, along with eleven known related ones. Sanyalactams A and B feature an unprecedented hexahydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3'&#8208;pyrrolidine] core. The structures of new compounds were established by a combination of extensive spectroscopic data analysis, quantum mechanical&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance methods, the modified Mosher's method, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Based on analysis of NOESY correlations and the modified Mosher's method, the stereochemistry of two known furodysinane&#8208;type sesquiterpenoids were revised. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these sesquiterpenoids were proposed and discussed, and a chemo&#8208;ecological relationship of the title animal and its possible sponge preys has been analyzed. In bioassays, sanyagunin B showed moderate antibacterial activity, whereas 4a&#8208;formamidogorgon&#8208;11&#8208;ene exhibited potent cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 0.87 to 1.95 &#956;M.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSBs) hold great promise for their merits in low&#8208;cost, high energy density, and safety. However, developing solid electrolyte (SE) materials for SSBs with high performance is still a great challenge. Here, we successfully synthesizehigh&#8208;entropy Na4.9Sm0.3Y0.2Gd0.2La0.1Al0.1Zr0.1Si4O12 atcomparatively low sintering temperature of 950 &#176;C with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 6.7&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 and a low activation energy of 0.22 eV. More importantly, the Na symmetric cells using high&#8208;entropy SE show a high critical current density of 0.6 mA cm&#8208;2, outstanding rate performance with fairly flat potential profiles at 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2 and steady cycling over 700 h under 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2. Solid&#8208;state Na3V2(PO4)3||high&#8208;entropy SE||Na batteries are further assembled manifesting a desirable cycling stability with almost no capacity decay after 600 cycles and high Columbic efficiency over 99.9%. The findings presented opportunities forthe design of high&#8208;entropy Na&#8208;ion conductors toward the development of SSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Determinative Effect of Axial Linearity on Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Performance in Dinuclear Dysprosium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report two dichloride&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) complexes based on salen ligands, namely, [Dy(L1)(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(thf)]2 (1; H2L1 = N,N&#697;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)phenylenediamine) and [Dy2(L2)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2]2 (2; H2L2 = N,N&#697;&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylidene)ethylenediamine). These two complexes have two short Dy&#8722;O(PhO) bonds that have angles of ~90&#176; for 1 and ~143&#176; for 2, leading to clear slow relaxation of the magnetization for 2 and not for 1. Compound 2 has a near&#8208;identical core to the recently reported compound [Dy2(L3)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2] (3; H2L3 = N&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;bis(2&#697;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#697;,5&#697;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzyl)amine), the only substantial difference being the relative angle of the two O(PhO)&#8722;Dy&#8722;O(PhO) vectors, which are collinear in 2 owing to inversion symmetry and make an angle of ~68&#176; in 3 owing to a molecular C2 axis. We show that this subtle structural difference leads to large differences in the dipolar ground states, giving rise to open magnetic hysteresis for 3 and not for 2.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards a Rational Design of Antibody&#8208;Recruiting Molecules Through a Computational Microscopy View of Their Interactions with the Target Antibody</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibody recruiting molecules (ARMs) are an innovative class of chimeric molecules, consisting of an antibody&#8208;binding ligand (ABL) and a target&#8208;binding ligand (TBL). ARMs mediate ternary complex formation between a target cell of interest for elimination and endogenous antibodies that are present in human serum. Clustering of fragment crystallizable (Fc) domains on the surface of antibody&#8208;bound cells mediate destruction of the target cell by innate immune effector mechanisms. ARMs are typically designed by conjugating small molecule haptens to a (macro)molecular scaffold, without considering the structure of the respective anti&#8208;hapten antibody. Here we report on a computational molecular modeling methodology that allows for studying the close contacts between ARMs and the anti&#8208;hapten antibody, considering (1) the spacer length between ABL and TBL; (2) the number of ABL and TBL, and (3) the molecular scaffold onto which these are positioned. Our model predicts the difference in binding modes of the ternary complex and predicts which ARMs are optimal recruiters. Avidity measurements of the ARM&#8208;antibody complex and ARM&#8208;mediated antibody recruitment to cell surfaces&#160; in vitro &#160;confirmed these computational modeling predictions. This kind of multiscale molecular modelling holds potential for design of drug molecules that rely on antibody binding for their mechanism of action.</dc:description>
