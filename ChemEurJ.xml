         <title>Epoxy Resins with Controllable "Thermally Conductive&#8208;Self&#8208;Healing" Synergies: a New Material to Meet the Needs of Flexible Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the popularization of 5G technology and artificial intelligence, thermally conductive epoxies with self&#8208;healing ability will be widely used in flexible electronic materials. Although many compounds containing both performances have been synthesized, there is little systematic theory to explain this coordination mechanism. In this paper, alkyl chains of different lengths were introduced to epoxies for discussing the thermally conductive, the self&#8208;healing performance, and the synergistic effect. A series of electronic&#8208;grade biphenyl epoxies (4,4'&#8208;bis(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethoxy)&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl (1), 4,4'&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethoxy)&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl (2), 4,4'&#8208;bis(3&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propoxy)&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl (3), and 4,4'&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)butoxy)&#8208;1,1'&#8208;biphenyl (4) were synthesized and characterized. Furthermore, they were cured with decanedioic acid to produce polymers. Results showed that alkyl chains can both affect the two properties, and the epoxies suitable for specific application scenarios can be prepared by adjusting the length of alkyl chains. In terms of thermal conductivity, compound 1 was a most promising material. However, compound 4 was expected to be utilized in flexible electronic devices because of its acceptable thermal conductivity, self&#8208;healing ability, transparency, and flexibility.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Novel Water&#8208;Soluble Cationic Platinum(II) Organometallic Complexes with Phenanthroline and Imidazolic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutic agents are widely used in the treatment of cancer. However, their effectiveness is limited by severe adverse reactions, drug resistance, and poor water solubility. This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of new water&#8208;soluble cationic monofunctional platinum(II) complexes starting from the [PtCl(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)] (1, phen = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) precursor, specifically [Pt(NH3)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (2), [Pt(1&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (3), and [Pt(1&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (4), which deviate from traditional requirements for antitumor activity. These complexes were evaluated for their cytotoxic effects in comparison to cisplatin, using immortalized cervical adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa), human renal carcinoma cells (Caki&#8208;1), and normal human renal cells (HK&#8208;2). While complex 2 showed minimal effects on the cell lines, complexes 3 and 4 demonstrated higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin. Notably, complex 4 displayed the highest cytotoxicity in both cancer and normal cell lines. However, complex 3 exhibited the highest selectivity for renal tumor cells (Caki&#8208;1) among the tested complexes, compared to healthy cells (HK&#8208;2). This resulted in a significantly higher selectivity than that of cisplatin and complex 4. Therefore, complex 3 shows potential as a leading candidate for the development of a new generation of platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs, utilizing biocompatible imidazole ligands while demonstrating promising anticancer properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbohydrate&#8208;Functionalized Anthracene Carboximides as Multivalent Ligands and Bio&#8208;Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anthracene carboximides (ACIs) conjugated with gluco&#8208;, galacto&#8208; and mannopyranosides are synthesized, by glycosylation of N&#8208;hydroxyethylanthracene carboximide acceptor with glycosyl donors.&#160; Glycoconjugation of anthracene carboximide increases the aq. solubility by more than 3&#8208;fold.&#160; The glycoconjugates display red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission, as compared to anthracene.&#160;&#160; Large Stokes shift (&#955;abs/ &#955;em = 445/525 nm) and high fluorescence quantum yields (&#1060;) of 0.86 and 0.5 occur in THF and water, respectively. The ACI&#8208;glycosides undergo facile photodimerization in aqueous solutions, leading to the formation of the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer, as a mixture of syn and anti&#8208;isomers.&#160; Solution phase and solid&#8208;state characterizations by dynamic light scattering (DLS), microscopic imaging by atomic force (AFM) and transmission electron (TEM) microscopies reveal self&#8208;assembled vesicle structures of ACI glycosides. These self&#8208;assembled structures act as multivalent glycoclusters for ligand&#8208;specific lectin binding, as evidenced by the binding of Man&#8208;ACI to Con A, by fluorescence and turbidity assays. The conjugates do not show cellular cytotoxicity (IC50) till concentrations of 50 &#956;M with HeLa and HepG2 cell lines and are cell&#8208;permeable, showing strong fluorescence inside the cells.&#160; These properties enable the glycoconjugates to be used in cell imaging. The non&#8208;selective cellular uptake of the glycoconjugates suggests a passive diffusion through the membrane.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/Polyimide Mixed Matrix Membrane for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A&#160;novel defect&#8208;engineered MOF (quasi ZrFum or Q&#8208;ZrFum) was synthesized via a controlled thermal deligandation process and incorporated into a CO2&#8208;philic 6FDA&#8208;durene polyimide (PI) matrix to form Q&#8208;ZrFum loaded MMMs. Defect&#8208;engineered MOFs and fabricated MMMs were investigated in terms of their characteristic properties and separation performance. The incorporation of defects into the MOF structure increases the pore size and provides unsaturated active metal sites that positively affect CO2 molecule transport. After the deligandation process, the interfacial compatibility between the Q&#8208;ZrFum particles and the PI matrix increases, which improves the mechanical strength of Q&#8208;ZrFum loaded membranes. MMM containing 5 wt.% of defect&#8208;engineered Q&#8208;ZrFum exhibits excellent CO2 permeability of 1308 Barrer which increased by 99% compared to the pure PI membrane (656 Barrer) at a feed pressure of 2 bar. Moreover, CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivity reached 44 and 26.6 which increased by about 70 and 16%, respectively. This study emphasizes that defect&#8208;engineered MOFs can be promising candidates for use as filler in the preparation of MMMs for the future development of membrane&#8208;based gas separation applications.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Unspecific Peroxygenases (UPOs) are increasingly significant enzymes for selective oxygenations as they are stable, highly active and catalyze their reactions at the expense of only hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Their structural similarity to chloroperoxidase (CPO) means that UPOs can also catalyze halogenation reactions based upon the generation of hypohalous acids from halide and H2O2. Here we show that the halogenation and oxygenation modes of a UPO can be stimulated at different pH values. Using simple aromatic compounds such as thymol, we show that, at a pH of 3.0 and 6.0, either brominated or oxygenated products respectively are produced. Preparative 100 mg scale transformations of substrates were performed with 60&#8211;72% isolated yields of brominated products obtained. A one&#8208;pot bromination&#8208;oxygenation cascade reaction on 4&#8208;ethylanisole, in which the pH was adjusted from 3.0 to 6.0 at the halfway stage, yielded sequentially brominated and oxygenated products 1&#8208;(3&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)ethyl alcohol and 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy acetophenone with 82% combined conversion. These results identify UPOs as an unusual example of a biocatalyst that is tunable for entirely different chemical reactions, dependent upon the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>VCD spectra of chiral high&#8208;spin organic radicals are expected to show a strong intensity enhancement and are thought to be difficult to predict using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theoretical methods.

Thereby, this study demonstrates the general feasibility of studies on chiral high&#8208;spin organics by MI&#8208;VCD.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies for using Quaternary Ammonium Salts as Alternative Reagents in Alkylations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines strategies for using quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) as alternative and solid reagents in alkylation reactions, enabling safer chemical synthesis methods for researchers. Unlike traditional reagents, which entail notable health and safety hazards, QAS present a safer alternative, being non&#8208;carcinogenic, non&#8208;mutagenic, non&#8208;flammable, and non&#8208;corrosive.







Abstract
Alkylation reactions are pivotal in organic chemistry, with wide&#8208;ranging utilization across various fields of applied synthetic chemistry. However, conventional reagents employed in alkylations often pose substantial health and exposure risks. Quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) present a promising alternative for these transformations offering significantly reduced hazards as they are non&#8208;cancerogenic, non&#8208;mutagenic, non&#8208;flammable, and non&#8208;corrosive. Despite their potential, their use in direct organic transformations remains relatively unexplored. This review outlines strategies for utilizing QAS as alternative reagents in alkylation reactions, providing researchers with safer approaches to chemical synthesis.

         <title>Luminescent Supramolecular Metallogels: Drug Loading and Eu(III) as Structural Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu(III) is combined with iminodiacetic acid to create luminescent hydrogels, with tunable rheological properties. Utilizing Eu(III) luminescence as a structural probe, we propose molecular structures for the materials. We also assess their capacity for loading bioactive molecules. This research could inspire luminescent hydrogel development for optical and biomedical materials, leveraging Eu(III) luminescence for advanced material characterization.







Abstract
Supramolecular metallogels combine the rheological properties of gels with the color, magnetism, and other properties of metal ions. Lanthanide ions such as Eu(III) can be valuable components of metallogels due to their fascinating luminescence. In this work, we combine Eu(III) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) into luminescent hydrogels. We investigate the tailoring of the rheological properties of these gels by changes in their metal:ligand ratio. Further, we use the highly sensitive Eu(III) luminescence to obtain information about the chemical structure of the materials. In special, we take advantage of computational calculations to employ an indirect method for structural elucidation, in which the simulated luminescent properties of candidate structures are matched to the experimental data. With this strategy, we can propose molecular structures for different EuIDA gels. We also explore the usage of these gels for the loading of bioactive molecules such as OXA, observing that its aldose reductase activity remains present in the gel. We envision that the findings from this work could inspire the development of luminescent hydrogels with tunable rheology for applications such as 3D printing and imaging&#8208;guided drug delivery platforms. Finally, Eu(III) emission&#8208;based structural elucidation could be a powerful tool in the characterization of advanced materials.

         <title>Distinctive Chiral Conformations Induced to Poly (naphthalene&#8211;1,4&#8208;diyl) by Helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective Polymerization and Circularly Polarized Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8211;helical &#8220;biased&#8211;dihedral conformation&#8221; as a novel chiral structure and single&#8211;handed helical conformation as one of the well&#8211;known, ordered chiral structures are induced to poly (naphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) by circularly polarized light irradiation and asymmetric polymerization, respectively. The former conformation is stable only in the solid state while the latter resists racemization by aggregation in solution. Both conformations contribute to efficient circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Optically active poly(naphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) was prepared through helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization of the corresponding monomers and also through circularly polarized light (CPL) irradiation, resulting in distinctive circular dichroism (CD) spectral patterns. Chirality of the helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization &#8208;based polymer is ascribed to preferred&#8211;handed helicity while that of the CPL&#8211;based polymer to a non&#8211;helical, chiral conformation (&#8216;biased&#8211;dihedral conformation&#8217;) with preferred&#8211;handedness which was stable only in the solid state. The helix of the helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization&#8211;based polymer gradually racemized in tetrahydrofuran while it was stabilized by aggregate formation in a hexane&#8211;dichloromethane solution. Both helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization&#8208; and CPL&#8211;based polymers exhibited efficient circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Dinuclear Rhenium(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes as Anticancer Drug Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of dinuclear rhenium(I) complexes as potential chemotherapeutic drug candidates are presented. The metal complexes primarily accumulated in the mitochondria, causing cell death by apoptosis. The lead compound demonstrated to eradicate a pancreatic carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroid upon treatment with micromolar concentrations.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Chemotherapy remains one of the most dominant forms for anticancer treatment. Despite their clinical success, the used chemotherapeutic agents are associated with severe side effect and pharmacological limitations. To overcome these drawbacks there is a need for the development of new types of chemotherapeutic agents. Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of dinuclear rhenium(I) complexes as potential chemotherapeutic drug candidates are proposed. The metal complexes were found to be internalized by an energy dependent endocytosis pathway, primary accumulating in the mitochondria. The rhenium(I) complexes demonstrated to induce cell death against a variety of cancer cells in the micromolar range through apoptosis. The lead compound showed to eradicate a pancreatic carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroid at micromolar concentrations.

         <title>Syntheses of &#945;(2,8) Sialosides Containing NeuAc and NeuGc by Using Double Carbonyl&#8208;Protected N&#8208;Acyl Sialyl Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double carbonyl&#8208;protected N&#8208;acetyl and N&#8208;glycoyl sialyl donors underwent efficient &#945;(2,8) sialylation in dichloromethane, allowing for the chemical synthesis of &#945;(2,8) disialosides involving the compounds containing both NeuAc and NeuGc. The selective ring&#8208;opening of the N&#8208;glycolylcarbamate in these sialosides without losing the N&#8208;glycolyl group was accomplished under a lower reaction temperature than that required for N&#8208;acetyl carbamate.







Abstract
We report on the syntheses of NeuAc and NeuGc&#8208;containing glycosides via the use of double carbonyl&#8208;protected N&#8208;acetyl sialyl donors. The 7&#8208;O,9&#8208;O&#8208;carbonyl protection of an N&#8208;acyl&#8208;5&#8208;N,4&#8208;O&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;protected sialyl donor markedly increased the &#945;&#8208;selectivity during glycosylation, particularly when glycosylating the C&#8208;8 hydroxyl group of sialic acids. The N&#8208;acyl carbamates were selectively opened with ethanethiol under basic conditions to provide N&#8208;acyl amines. It is noteworthy that N&#8208;glycolyl carbamate was more reactive to nucleophiles by comparison with the N&#8208;acetyl carbamate due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing oxygen in the N&#8208;acyl group and however, allowed selective opening of the carbamates without the loss of N&#8208;glycolyl groups. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we began by synthesizing &#945;(2,3) and &#945;(2,6) sialyl galactosides. Glycosylation of the hydroxy groups of galactosides at the C&#8208;6 position with the NeuAc and NeuGc donors provided the corresponding sialyl galactoses in good yields with excellent &#945;&#8208;selectivity. However, glycosylation of the 2,3&#8208;diol galactosyl acceptor selectively provided Sia&#945;(2,2)Gal. Next, we prepared a series of &#945;(2,8) disialosides composed of NeuAc and NeuGc. Glycosylation of NeuGc and NeuAc acceptors at the C&#8208;8 hydroxyl group with NeuGc and NeuAc sialyl donors provided the corresponding &#945;(2,8) disialosides, and no significant differences were detected in the reactivities of these acceptors.

         <title>Construction of Supramolecular Polymers and Covalent Polymers via the Same Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of monomers were designed, which embodied diazonium salt units and phenolic hydroxyl groups respectively. First, supramolecular polymers were prepared driven by hydrogen bonds between diazonium salt and hydroxyl. Besides, covalent polymers could be obtained upon ultraviolet irradiation followed by the self&#8208;assembly process. In this way, both supramolecular polymers and covalent polymers were successfully synthesized using same monomers.







Abstract
Nature owns the ability to construct structurally different polymers from the same monomers. While polymers can be classified as covalent polymers (CPs) and supramolecular polymers (SPs), it is still difficult to synthesize CPs and SPs using same monomers like nature do. Herein, M1 with two diazo salts on both the ends was designed. Additionally, hydroquinone was chosen to be M2 for the existence of two hydroxyl groups. When mixing at room temperature, M1 and M2 self&#8208;assembled to SPs via N&#8230;H hydrogen bonds. In another way, upon the exposure to ultraviolet irradiation when blending M1 with M2, CPs were fabricated in the presence of covalent bonds. The excellent thermal stability of CPs was determined by TGA and DSC, while the great corrosion resistance of covalent polymers was detected by acid or alkali immersion. In this way, constructing two kinds of polymers using the same monomers was successfully achieved. This shows tremendous potential in fields of polymer science, supramolecular chemistry, which would boom the development of polymers.

         <title>Accelerating Cellular Uptake with Unnatural Amino Acid for Inhibiting Immunosuppressive Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research demonstrates that the integration of unnatural amino acids (L&#8208; or D&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenylalanine) into peptide assemblies significantly accelerates their accumulation within prostate cancer cells, boosting their capacity to hinder cancer proliferation. This work paves a way for engineering supramolecular medicine, potentially heightening the efficacy of peptide&#8208;based treatments for prostate cancer. It may lead to more effective therapeutic strategies for treating other cancers.







Abstract
Targeting immunosuppressive metastatic cancer cells is a key challenge in therapy. We recently have shown that a rigid&#8208;rod aromatic, pBP&#8722;NBD, that responds to enzymes and kill immunosuppressive metastatic osteosarcoma (mOS) and castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells in mimetic bone microenvironment. However, pBP&#8722;NBD demonstrated moderate efficacy against CRPC cells. To enhance activity, we incorporated the unnatural amino acid L&#8208; or D&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenylalanine (L&#8208; or D&#8722;BiP) into pBP&#8722;NBD, drastically increasing cellular uptake and CRPC inhibition. Specifically, we inserted BiP into pBP&#8722;NBD to target mOS (Saos2 and SJSA1) and CRPC (VCaP and PC3) cells with overexpressed phosphatases. Our results show that the D&#8208;peptide backbone with an aspartate methyl diester at the C&#8208;terminal offers the highest activity against these immunosuppressive mOS and CRPC cells. Importantly, imaging shows that the peptide assemblies almost instantly enter the cells and accumulate primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum of Saos2, SJSA1, and PC3 cells and at the lysosomes of VCaP cells. By using BiP to boost cellular uptake and self&#8208;assembly within cancer cells, this work illustrates an unnatural hydrophobic amino acid as a versatile and effective residue to boost endocytosis of synthetic peptides for intracellular self&#8208;assembly.

         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent probe for visualizing Zn2+ in biological samples through microscopy has been designed. The probe was inspired by the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein, which was extended with an 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline ionophore. A probe&#8211;Zn2+ complex is shown glowing green inside a cell, lighting up the scene and illustrating how the sensor indicates the presence of the ion.

The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative annulation reaction of imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ium salts with alkynes via N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;directed C&#8722;H activation to obtain &#960;&#8208;expanded imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ium derivatives is reported. Methodology is compatible with a wide range of substrate scope including pharmacophere containing scaffolds. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculation complement the synthetic work.







Abstract
Ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated fused imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ium derivatives have been achieved via C&#8722;H activation of quinoline&#8208;functionalized NHC (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) and oxidative coupling with internal alkynes. The reaction occurred with high efficiency, broad substrate scope, tolerates a wide range of functional groups and utilized into a gram&#8208;scale.

&lt;p&gt;The ruthenium-catalyzed oxidative annulation reaction of imidazo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]quinolin-2-ium salts with alkynes &lt;i&gt;via N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene-directed C&#8722;H activation to obtain &#960;-expanded imidazo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]quinolin-2-ium derivatives is reported. Methodology is compatible with a wide range of substrate scope including pharmacophere containing scaffolds. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculation complement the synthetic work.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruthenium(II)-catalyzed synthesis of &#960;-conjugated fused imidazo[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]quinolin-2-ium derivatives have been achieved &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; C&#8722;H activation of quinoline-functionalized NHC (NHC&lt;i&gt;=N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene) and oxidative coupling with internal alkynes. The reaction occurred with high efficiency, broad substrate scope, tolerates a wide range of functional groups and utilized into a gram-scale. Synthetic applications of the coupled product have been exemplified in the late-stage derivatization of various highly functionalized scaffolds. Moreover, most of the annulated products exhibit intense fluorescence and have potential applications in optoelectronic devices. Mechanistic studies have provided insights into the spectroscopic characterization of key five-membered ruthenacycle intermediate and Ru(0) sandwich species. Based on several control experiments, deuterium-kinetic isotope effect, and thermodynamic activation parameters the mechanistic finding demonstrated that fused imidazo-[1,5-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]quinolin-2-ium C(2)&#8722;H bond cleavage is the rate-determining step and ruling out the possibility of reductive elimination for controlling the rate of reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extended Reichardt's Dye&#8211;Synthesis and Solvatochromic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new pyridinium phenolate dyes with phenylene &#960;&#8208;extension were synthesised and all exhibited strong negative solvatochromism similar to the well&#8208;known Betaine 30 dye. This contrasts with the &#960;&#8208;extended Betaine 21 previously reported to show poor solvatochromism. We found Betaine 21 to be significantly more solvatochromic than reported, with its alleged insensitivity attributed to degradation in certain solvents.







Abstract
Three new pyridinium&#8208;phenolate dyes based on the benchmark solvatochromic dye Betaine 30 were synthesised. The dyes contained phenylene spacers between the donor and acceptor groups. Their UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectra were measured, with the dyes showing strong negative solvatochromic behaviour comparable to that of Betaine 30. These results stood in contrast to the behaviour of the &#960;&#8208;extended dye Betaine 21, originally reported in 1963. This dye was synthesised and found to be significantly more solvatochromic than previously reported but prone to degrade. All &#960;&#8208;extended dyes synthesised were found to be unstable in certain solvents. Although the increased distance between donor and acceptor did not enhance solvatochromism to the extent predicted, it was still determined that the reduced planarity caused by a phenylene spacer is not as detrimental as believed.

         <title>Elucidation of Design Criteria for V&#8208;based Redox Mediators: Structure&#8208;Function Relationships that Dictate Rates of Heterogeneous Electron Transfer</title>

Structure function relationships of vanadium oxide complexes (V1=[V(acac)3]; V6=[V6O7(OMe)12] or [V6O13(TRISNO2)2]&#8722;3; V18=V18O46(NO3)]&#8722;5) in acetonitrile that dictate heterogeneous rate constants. Elucidation of design criteria for redox mediators.







Abstract
Redox mediators are attractive solutions for addressing the stringent kinetic stipulations required for efficient energy conversion processes. In this work, we compare the electrochemical properties of four vanadium complexes, namely [V(acac)3], [V6O7(OMe)12], [nBu4N]3[V6O13(TRISNO2)2], and [nBu4N]5[V18O46(NO3)] in non&#8208;aqueous solutions on glassy carbon electrodes. The goal of this study is to investigate the electron transfer kinetics and diffusivity of these compounds under identical experimental conditions to develop an understanding of structure&#8208;function relationships that dictate the physicochemical properties of vanadium oxide assemblies. Complex selection was dictated by two criteria &#8211; (1)&#8197;nuclearity of the transition metal complexes (2)&#8197;distribution of electron density in the native electronic configuration. Our analyses establish that electronic communication between metal centers significantly impacts charge transfer kinetics of these vanadium&#8208;based compounds.

         <title>Exploring a De Novo Route to Bradyrhizose: Synthesis and Isomeric Equilibrium of Bradyrhizose Diastereomers&#8800;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de&#8197;novo approach to synthesize d&#8208;bradyrhizose diastereomers from an achiral ketoenolester is presented. The strategy uses transfer hydrogenation, an Achmatowicz rearrangement and alkene oxidations as key steps in the synthesis. The effect of the configuration at C&#8208;2, C&#8208;4 and C&#8208;9 on the isomeric composition of the reducing sugars in water was analyzed and compared with the natural product.







Abstract
A de&#8197;novo asymmetric strategy for the synthesis of d&#8208;bradyrhizose diastereomers from an achiral ketoenolester precursor is described. Key transformations used in the stereodivergent approach include two Noyori asymmetric reductions, an Achmatowicz rearrangement, diastereoselective alkene oxidations, and the first example of a palladium(0)&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation of a vinylogous pyranone. The isomeric composition of the bicyclic reducing sugars obtained was analyzed and their behaviour was compared to the natural product, revealing key stereocentres that impact the overall distribution.

         <title>Influence of Lattice Defects on Trans&#8208;Oligoene Substructure Formation in Graphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Statistical Raman spectroscopy of iodinated graphene reveals a clear correlation between trans&#8208;oligoene substructure&#8208;Raman modes and the number of defects that indicates strong interaction within the graphene lattice. An upper limit of chain length of ~1&#8197;nm was thus determined for substructures probed at 532&#8197;nm.







Abstract
The photochemical reaction of iodine and graphene induces strong new Raman modes due to the formation of trans&#8208;oligoene substructures in graphene domains. This unique reactivity was demonstrated before on defect&#8208;free graphene, however leaving the influence of e.&#8201;g. carbon vacancies, unexplored. Here, we investigate the photochemical reaction applied on graphene with varying average distances of lattice defects and statistically analyze the characteristic Raman modes which develop with the iodination reaction. We show that the iodination reaction does not lead to Raman&#8208;active defects and thus, the newly formed trans&#8208;oligoene substructures do not contribute to the D&#8208;mode of graphene. A statistical analysis reveals the correlation between the average distance of lattice defects and the intensity of the v1&#8208;mode. For defective graphene with average defect distances below ~1&#8197;nm no new Raman modes evolve, which is the lower limit of the substructure size probed at 532&#8197;nm and explains why this observation was not possible before using common graphene oxide as graphene source.

We have established a convenient method for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzazaphosphole oxides, which exhibit the characteristic optical properties reflecting the electronic effects of the &#946; nitrogen atom. The ortho&#8208;hydroxyphenyl derivative underwent ESIPT in solution to emit considerably Stokes&#8208;shifted fluorescence in the range of 600&#8211;800&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Inclusion of a heteroatom to the phosphole ring is a promising strategy to intrinsically modulate the optical properties of phosphole derivatives. We report on a series of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3H&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzazaphosphole oxides that were efficiently prepared via sequential C&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling, dehydrative [3+2] cycloaddition, and ring&#8208;oxidation reactions. The inclusion of one nitrogen atom into the benzophosphole framework caused red shifting of the absorption and emission maxima, reflecting the greater stabilization of the LUMO level. 2&#8208;(2&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl)benzazaphosphole oxide underwent excited state intramolecular proton transfer and emitted a weak fluorescence from the excited state of the N&#8722;H tautomer.

         <title>Selective Transition Enhancement in a g&#8208;Engineered Diradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diradical formed by functionalizing the yttrium(III)&#8208;phthalocyaninato radical with a nitroxide radical, is characterized by an engineered g&#8208;tensor asymmetry and a weak exchange coupling. Interestingly, its behavior is reminiscent of a spin qutrit, exhibiting two EPR transitions characterized by different Rabi frequencies and whose amplitudes can be selectively enhanced by proper choice of microwave power or magnetic field.







Abstract
A diradical with engineered g&#8208;asymmetry was synthesized by grafting a nitroxide radical onto the [Y(Pc)2]&#8901; radical platform. Various spectroscopic techniques and computational studies revealed that the electronic structures of the two spin systems remained minimally affected within the diradical system. Fluid&#8208;solution Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) experiments revealed a weak exchange coupling with |J| ~ 0.014&#8197;cm&#8722;1, subsequently rationalized by CAS&#8208;SCF calculations. Frozen solution continuous&#8208;wave (CW) EPR experiments showed a complicated and power&#8208;dependent spectrum that eluded analysis using the point&#8208;dipole model. Pulse EPR manipulations with varying microwave powers, or under varying magnetic fields, demonstrated that different resonances could be selectively enhanced or suppressed, based on their different tipping angles. In particular, Field&#8208;Swept Echo&#8208;Detected (FSED) spectra revealed absorptions of MW power&#8208;dependent intensities, while Field&#8208;Swept Spin Nutation (FSSN) experiments revealed two distinct Rabi frequencies. This study introduces a methodology to synthesize and characterize g&#8208;asymmetric two&#8208;spin systems, of interest in the implementation of spin&#8208;based CNOT gates.

         <title>Unrevealing the Nitrogen Elusive Chirality of 3&#8208;Sulfanyl and 3&#8208;Sulfinyl N&#8208;Tosyl Isoindolinones by ECD Spectra: An Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chirality of sp2 nitrogen atoms in organic compounds is a somewhat unexpected and subtle effect already detected in the crystal state. However, revealing this effect in solution is rather challenging. A theoretical&#8208;computational study, supported by electronic circular dichroism spectra has captured such an elusive feature. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Palombi, M. Aschi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400232).

         <dc:description>
A tight&#8208;bite bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene) is involved in two distinct reactions. The first reaction, featuring the organic aniline p&#8208;toluidine, forms cyclodisilazane through the oxidative addition of both N&#8722;H bonds across two SiII atoms. Conversely, reaction with Fe(CO)5 yields a four&#8208;membered NSi2Fe2 ring featuring a Fe&#8722;Fe bond length of 2.6892(13)&#8197;&#197;. This investigation sheds light on the diverse reactivity of bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene) compounds, providing valuable insights into their potential applications in main&#8208;group chemistry.

A series of cobalt polynitrides has been discovered by using laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells under high pressure that demonstrate an increasing degree of nitrogen polymerization with increasing pressure. Synthesis under high pressure and high temperature, coupled with single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and micro&#8208;Raman imaging spectroscopy, offers significant advantages in elucidating the crystal structures of these nitrides along with the prospect of recovering of these materials under ambient conditions.

         <title>Chiral Induction in a Self&#8208;Assembled Pd4 Coordination Cage with Chiral Guests</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic interplay of coordination bonds within metal&#8208;organic cages offers a unique avenue for structural evolution in response to external stimuli, presenting a promising strategy for the construction of chiral assemblies. This adaptability is crucial for the selective synthesis of homochiral assemblies and advancement of asymmetric catalysis. In this study, we report the self&#8208;assembly of an achiral square&#8208;planar Pd(II) acceptor with a C2&#8208;symmetric tetrapyridyl donor resulted in the formation of a racemic mixture of the chiral octahedral cage Pd4L2. The existence of this racemic mixture was confirmed using circular dichroism spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. We encoded chiral information into the asymmetric cavity of the cage by encapsulating chiral aromatic guests through efficient &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions in aqueous media. The inclusion of a chiral guest induces a preference for one enantiomeric conformation of the cage over the other, effectively shifting the equilibrium towards a single, enantiopure host&#8208;guest complex. While the concept of chiral guest recognition by a chiral host is well&#8208;established, this work constitutes a remarkable example of guest&#8208;mediated chirality transfer leading to the formation of a single enantiopure coordination complex from achiral building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2,3&#8208;Triazole&#8208;containing azamacrocycles from chiral triazolopeptoids: synthesis and solid&#8208;state studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new chiral 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;containing macrocyclic oligoamides (i.e.: triazolopeptoid 4 and 5) were obtained through solid&#8208;phase synthesis of linear precursors followed by high dilution macrocyclization reaction. Theoretical (DFT) and spectroscopic (NMR) studies revealed the intricate interplay between the Na&#8208;chiral side chains and their conformational attitudes. BH3&#8208;mediated reduction of the tertiary amide groups of known 1&#8208;3 and newly synthesized 4 gave novel azamacrocycles 6&#8208;9. Detection of borane complexes of azamacrocycles 6 and 9 (i.e.: 10 and 11), corroborated by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, demonstrated the peculiar properties of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;containing macrorings.</dc:description>

         <title>New architecture based on Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks and spin crossover complexes to detect volatile organic compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here the encapsulation of a spin crossover complex C1 [FeII(L)] (L: 4&#8208;amino&#8208;, 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinylmethylene)hydrazide) inside MOF&#8208;808(Zr), a chemically robust Metal&#8211;Organic Framework. The compound C1&#8834;MOF&#8208;808 retains its crystallinity as well as a partial porosity compared to pristine MOF and shows solvatochromism under Volatile Organic compounds (VOCs) sorption associated to a spin state change of the guest complex. More specifically, this compound shows an interesting reversible color change under formaldehyde and formic acid vapor sorption and can therefore be considered as a new kind of optical VOCs chemosensor, opening new doors for developing a broad range of VOCs optical sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cu/MnOx Composite with Copper&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Oxygen Vacancies as a Cathode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are anticipated to be the next generation of important energy storage devices to replace lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the ongoing use of lithium resources and the safety hazards associated with organic electrolytes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Manganese&#8208;based compounds, including MnOx materials, have prominent places among the many zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. Additionally, Cu doping can cause the creation of an oxygen vacancy, which increases the material's internal electric field and enhances cycle stability. MnOx also has great cyclic stability and promotes ion transport. At a current density of 0.2 A g&#8722;1, the Cu/MnOx nanocomposite obtained a high specific capacitance of 304.4 mAh g&#8722;1. In addition, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites showed A high specific capacity of 198.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g&#8722;1. Therefore, Cu/MnOx nanocomposites are expected to be a strong contender for the next generation of zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode materials in high energy density storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) Amphiphilicity Tunes the Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer of Pyrenol&#8208;based Polyphotoacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of light to change the properties of light&#8208;responsive polymers opens avenues for targeted release of cargo with a high degree of spatial and temporal control. Recently, we established photoacid polymers as light&#8208;switchable macromolecular amphiphiles. In these systems, light&#8208;induced excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) causes changes in amphilicity. However, as the intermolecular process itself critically depends on the local environment of the photoacid unit within the polymer, the overall amphiphilicity directly influences ESPT. Thus, understanding the impact of the local environment on the photophysics of photoacidic side chains is key to material design. In this contribution we address both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of ESPT in oxazoline&#8208;based amphiphilic polymers with pyrenol&#8208;based photoacid side chains. We will compare the effect of polymer design, i.e. statistical and block arrangements, i.e. in poly[(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;co&#8208;(1&#8208;(6/8&#8208;hydroxyperene)sulphonylaziridine)] and poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;block&#8208;poly[(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;co&#8208;(2&#8208;(3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxypyrene)sulphona mide)propyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline), on the intermolecular proton transfer reaction by combining steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. ESPT appears more prominent in the statistical copolymer compared to a block copolymer with overall similar pyrenol loading. We hypothesize that the difference is due to different local chain arrangements adopted by the polymers in the two cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Uptake and Release of Semiochemicals in Channel&#8208;type Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks through Pore Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semiochemicals can be used to manipulate insect behaviour for sustainable pest management strategies, but their high volatility is a major issue for their practical implementation. Inclusion of these molecules within porous materials is a potential solution to this issue, as it can allow for a slower and more controlled release. In this work, we demonstrate that a series of Zr(IV) and Al(III) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with channel&#8208;type pores enable controlled release of three semiochemicals over 100 days by pore size design, with the uptake and rate of release highly dependent on the pore size. Insight from Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations indicates that this is due to weaker MOF&#8208;guest interactions per guest molecule as the pore size increases. These MOFs are all stable post&#8208;release and can be reloaded to show near&#8208;identical re&#8208;release profiles. These results provide valuable insight on the diffusion behaviour of volatile guests in MOFs, and for the further development of porous materials for sustainable agriculture applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkene Cross&#8722;Metathesis with 2,5&#8722;Dimethyl&#8722;2,4&#8722;Hexadiene Enables Isobutylenyl / Prenyl Functionalizations and Rubber Valorization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,5&#8722;Dimethyl&#8722;2,4&#8722;hexadiene is a readily available and easily managable compound, whose symmetric and polymethylated dienic structure should be prone to engage in cross&#8722;metathesis reactions with other alkenes, but this has not been apparently exploited so far. Here we show that this reactant enables the easy synthesis of tri&#8722; and tetra&#8722;susbtituted alkenes (i.e. isobutylenyl and prenyl groups) from simple alkenes under mild reaction conditions, not only with the conventional 2nd generation Grubbs catalyst but also with other Grela&#8722;type catalysts such as StickyCat,TM AquaMetTM and GreenCat.TM The use of liquid and low volatile 2,5&#8722;dimethyl&#8722;2,4&#8722;hexadiene avoids the use of gaseous alkene reactants and, besides, showcases the reactivity of polyisoprene (rubber), thus allowing to optimize the reaction conditions for rubber upcycling, after metathesis reaction of the pristine or used polymer with simple alkenes. These results bring low volatile isoprene&#8722;type compounds as privileged poly&#8722;substituted reactants for alkene cross&#8722;metathesis reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Control Over Nitric Oxide Photorelease via a Molecular Keypad Lock</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on Boolean logic, molecular keypad locks secure molecular information, typically with an optical output. Here we investigate a rare example of a molecular keypad lock with a chemical output. To this end, the light&#8208;activated release of biologically important nitric oxide from a ruthenium complex is studied, using proton concentration and photon flux as inputs. In a pH&#8208;dependent equilibrium, a nitritoruthenium(II) complex is turned into a nitrosylruthenium(II) complex, which releases nitric oxide under irradiation with visible light. The precise prediction of the output nitric oxide concentration as function of the pH and photon flux is achieved with an artificial intelligence approach, namely the adaptive neuro&#8208;fuzzy inference system. In this manner an exceptionally high level of control over the output concentration is obtained. Moreover, the provided concept to lock a chemical output as well as the output prediction may be applied to other (photo)release schemes.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Conjugate Addition of Alcohols to &#946;&#8208;Fluoroalkyl Vinylsulfones by Bifunctional Phosphonium Salt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral secondary alcohols, serving as essential structural motifs, hold significant potential for diverse applications. The exploration of effective synthetic strategies toward these compounds is both attractive and challenging. Herein, we present an asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael reaction involving aliphatic alcohols as nucleophiles and &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl vinylsulfones catalyzed by bifunctional phosphonium salt (BPS), achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% yield and 98% ee). Additionally, a sequential process including asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael and debenzylation, facilitated by BPS/Lewis acid cooperation, was revealed for synthesizing diverse chiral secondary alcohol compounds in high yields (81&#8208;88%) with consistent stereoselectivities. Furthermore, mechanistic explorations and subsequent results unveiled that the enantioselectivity originates from hydrogen&#8208;bonding and ion&#8208;pair interactions between the BPS catalyst and the substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Fusion Elevates the Electronic Mobility of Azabenzannulated Perylene Diimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The backwardness of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors still exists compared with the p&#8208;type counterparts. Thus, the development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is of great importance for organic electronic devices and their integrated circuits. In recent years, azabenzannulated perylene diimide (PDI), as one of immense bay&#8208;region&#8208;annulated PDI derivatives, has drawn considerable attentions. However, the electronic mobilities of azabenzannulated PDI derivatives are barely satisfactory. In this contribution, the peripheral benzene ring in azabenzannulated PDI 2 was fused to the ortho position by intermolecular C&#8722;H arylation cyclization. This endows the resultant azabenzannulated PDI 4 a planar configuration as well as electron deficient pentagonal ring. As a result, the electronic mobility of 4 is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of the nonfused azabenzannulated PDI 2. This work shall pave a new avenue in elevating the performance of azabenzannulated PDI in organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>RuPHOX&#8208;Ru Catalyzed Asymmetric Cascade Hydrogenation of 3&#8208;Substituted Chromones for the Synthesis of Corresponding Chiral Chromanols&#8203;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient RuPHOX&#8208;Ru catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydrogenation of 3&#8208;substituted chromones has been achieved under mild reaction conditions, affording the corresponding chiral 3&#8208;substituted chromanols in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (up to 99% yield, &gt;99% ee and &gt;20:1 dr). Control reactions and deuterium labelling experiments revealed that a dynamic kinetic resolution process occurs during the subsequent hydrogenation of the C=O double bond, which is responsible for the high performance of the asymmetric cascade hydrogenation. The resulting products allow for several transformations and it was shown that the protocol provides a practical and alternative strategy for the synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;substituted chromanols and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes, which are recognized as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platforms applied in various separation processes, have attracted widespread attention. Nonetheless, to overcome the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, which is crucial for achieving efficient separation, it is important to rationally design and manipulate MOF membrane structure. Given remarkable advances in the past decade, a timely summary of recent advancement in this field has become indispensable. This review introduces major strategies for fabricating oriented MOF membranes, including in situ growth, contra&#8208;diffusion method, interface&#8208;assisted approach, and laminated nanosheet assembly. New insights into their updated progress and potential are elucidated. Of particular note, recent development and emerging applications of oriented MOF membranes, illustrating their potential to address environmental and energy challenges, are highlighted. Finally, remaining challenges facing their bath production and practical applications are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>When is an Imine Directing Group a Transient Imine Directing Group in C&#8722;H Functionalization?</title>

Building on the pioneering works using imines to form metallacycle with transition metals, recent developments have realized the potential of using transient directing group (TDG) to direct C&#8722;H functionalization. This article discusses factors defining a transient directing group and strategies to achieve catalytic processes with low directing group loading by highlighting recent advancements in this field.







Abstract
&#8216;Transient&#8217; C&#8722;H functionalization has emerged in recent years to describe the use of a dynamic linkage, often an imine, to direct cyclometallation and subsequent functionalization. As the field continues to grow in popularity, we consider the features that make an imine directing group transient. A transient imine should be i) formed dynamically in&#8197;situ, ii) avoid discrete introduction or cleavage steps, and iii) offer the potential for catalysis in both the directing group and metal. This concept article contrasts transient imines with pioneering early studies of imines as directing groups for the formation of metallacycles and the use of preformed imines in C&#8722;H functionalization. Leading developments in the use of catalytic additives to form transient directing groups (as aldehyde or amine) are covered including selected highlights of the most recent examples of catalytic imine directed C&#8722;H functionalization with transition metals.

         <title>Mesoporous Metal Nanomaterials: Developments and Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept, we primarily summarized the design and synthetic strategies of mesoporous metal nanomaterials (MPMNs), aligning with the dynamic requirements of diverse electrocatalytic applications. MPMNs successfully make up for the unsatisfactory of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials by exposing more active sites and providing channels through interconnected pores for efficient mass transfer.







Abstract
Mesoporous metal nanomaterials (MPMNs) are pivotal in nanotechnology, especially in electrochemical applications, due to their unique structure. Unlike traditional nanomaterials, MPMNs possess hierarchical and mesoporous characteristics, providing more active sites for improved mass and electron transfer. This distinctive composition offers dual benefits, enhancing activity, stability, and selectivity for specific reactions. The intricate architecture, featuring interconnected pores, amplifies surface area, ensuring efficient use of active sites and boosting reactivity in electrocatalytic processes. Additionally, the mesoporous nature promotes superior diffusion kinetics, facilitating better transport of reactants and products. This intricate interplay of structural elements contributes not only to the increased efficiency of electrochemical reactions but also to the extended durability of MPMNs during prolonged usage. This concept focus on the synthesis and design strategies of MPMNs, aligning with the dynamic requirements of diverse electrocatalytic applications. The synergy resulting from these advancements not only accentuates the intrinsic properties of MPMNs but also broadens their scope for practical implementation in emerging fields of electrochemistry.

MPMNs successfully make up for the unsatisfactory of low-dimensional nanomaterials by exposing more active sites and providing channels through interconnected pores for efficient mass transfer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesoporous metal nanomaterials (MPMNs) are pivotal in nanotechnology, especially in electrochemical applications, due to their unique structure. Unlike traditional nanomaterials, MPMNs possess hierarchical and mesoporous characteristics, providing more active sites for improved mass and electron transfer. This distinctive composition offers dual benefits, enhancing activity, stability, and selectivity for specific reactions. The intricate architecture, featuring interconnected pores, amplifies surface area, ensuring efficient use of active sites and boosting reactivity in electrocatalytic processes. Additionally, the mesoporous nature promotes superior diffusion kinetics, facilitating better transport of reactants and products. This intricate interplay of structural elements contributes not only to the increased efficiency of electrochemical reactions but also to the extended durability of MPMNs during prolonged usage. This concept focus on the synthesis and design strategies of MPMNs, aligning with the dynamic requirements of diverse electrocatalytic applications. The synergy resulting from these advancements not only accentuates the intrinsic properties of MPMNs but also broadens their scope for practical implementation in emerging fields of electrochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Charge Separation in Covalently Linked BODIPY&#8208;Quinone&#8208;Alkyne Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of bodipy&#8208;quinone dyads and their photoinduced charge separation is reported using a complementary set of experimental and theoretical methods. Dyads feature an additional alkyne group as potential anchor group for further functionalizations, featuring electron storing or catalytic behaviors.







Abstract
Visible light&#8208;induced charge separation and directional charge transfer are cornerstones for artificial photosynthesis and the generation of solar fuels. Here, we report synthetic access to a series of noble metal&#8208;free donor&#8208;acceptor dyads based on bodipy light&#8208;absorbers and redox&#8208;active quinone/anthraquinone charge storage sites. Peripheral functionalization of the quinone/anthraquinone units with alkynes primes the dyads for integration into a range of light&#8208;harvesting systems, e.&#8201;g., by Cu&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions (CLICK chemistry) or Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Initial photophysical, electrochemical and theoretical analyses reveal the principal processes during the light&#8208;induced charge separation in the reported dyads.

The asymmetric construction of an oxa&#8208;quaternary stereocenter via an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael reaction in &#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone is being disclosed. Both the (E&#8208; and Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone produce (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the 1,1&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran using two pseudo&#8208;enantiomeric cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based chiral amino&#8208;squaramide catalysts, demonstrating excellent stereospecificity, high yields, and enantioselectivity. The resulting phthalan can undergo conversion into corresponding phthalides followed by oxidation.







Abstract
Herein, we disclosed the asymmetric construction of an oxa&#8208;quaternary stereocenter via an intramolecular oxa&#8208;Michael (IOM) reaction in &#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone by the formation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran using cinchona alkaloid&#8208;based chiral amino&#8208;squaramide catalyst. Both the (E&#8208; and Z)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;hydroxymethyl chalcone provide (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;enantiomers of the 1,1&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroisobenzofuran with excellent stereospecificity. In general, excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 98&#8201;% ee) were obtained. Furthermore, the resulting 1,1&#8208;disubstituted isobenzofuran or phthalan was converted to corresponding chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted phthalides without losing the enantioselectivity. This methodology provides the core moiety of the (S)&#8208;citalopram drug.

         <title>Toward Lung Ventilation Imaging Using Hyperpolarized Diethyl Ether Gas Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas was produced via heterogeneous pairwise parahydrogen addition to ethyl vinyl ether (a.k.a. vinamar) anesthetic gas and employed for a pilot feasibility demonstration to record sub&#8208;second 2D ventilation MRI of excised rabbit lungs on a clinical 0.35 T MRI scanner without any modifications to the scanner's hardware or software.







Abstract
Hyperpolarized 129Xe gas was FDA&#8208;approved as an inhalable contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of a wide range of pulmonary diseases in December 2022. Despite the remarkable success in clinical research settings, the widespread clinical translation of HP 129Xe gas faces two critical challenges: the high cost of the relatively low&#8208;throughput hyperpolarization equipment and the lack of 129Xe imaging capability on clinical MRI scanners, which have narrow&#8208;bandwidth electronics designed only for proton (1H) imaging. To solve this translational grand challenge of gaseous hyperpolarized MRI contrast agents, here we demonstrate the utility of batch&#8208;mode production of proton&#8208;hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas via heterogeneous pairwise addition of parahydrogen to ethyl vinyl ether. An approximately 0.1&#8208;liter bolus of hyperpolarized diethyl ether gas was produced in 1 second and injected in excised rabbit lungs. Lung ventilation imaging was performed using sub&#8208;second 2D MRI with up to 2&#215;2&#8197;mm2 in&#8208;plane resolution using a clinical 0.35&#8197;T MRI scanner without any modifications. This feasibility demonstration paves the way for the use of inhalable diethyl ether as a gaseous contrast agent for pulmonary MRI applications using any clinical MRI scanner.

         <dc:description>
A new family of 16&#8208;membered macrocycles comprising two indole (In) and two quinoline (Q) units, coined In2Q2, was synthesized. Each unit is diagonally located and concatenated in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion, furnishing a non&#8208;flat saddle&#8208;shaped architecture with C2 symmetry. The In2Q2 derivatives and their Zn2+ complexes were emissive in both solution phase and solid state. While the entire architecture of In2Q2 is similar to that of quinoline tetramer TEtraQuinoline, a couple of contrasting properties were revealed.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Binuclear Copper(I) Alkynyl Complexes with Cuprophilic Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binuclear copper(I) alkynyl complexes with ultrashort Cu&#8722;Cu distance are designed and synthesized, which show thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and mechanochromic luminescence (MCL). The cuprophilic interactions can promote spin&#8208;orbit coupling and ligand engineering can achieve adjustable luminescence, which provide design ideas for the building of stimuli&#8208;responsive Cu(I)&#8208;based TADF materials.







Abstract
Copper(I)&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been conceived to be promising candidates for display and lighting applications because of their multifarious structures and strong photoluminescence. Herein a string of binuclear Cu(I) complexes bearing pronounced cuprophilic interactions have been designed and synthesized. [Cu2(dppb)2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ph)2] (1&#8201;a) and [Cu2(dppb)2(&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;PPXZ)2] (1&#8201;b) display photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 67&#8201;% in doped films and solid states via TADF and exhibit reversible bicolor luminescence switching upon mechanical stimuli. Computational studies manifest that the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer predominant transitions ensure a small energy splitting (&#916;EST) between the lowest singlet (S1) and triplet (T1) excited states and cuprophilic interactions promote the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC), favoring the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. This study provides a new strategy for the construction of stimuli&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;based TADF materials.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Catalytic Application of Colloidal and Supported Manganese Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal manganese nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized and characterized, with the reaction parameters optimized to yield small and well&#8208;dispersed NPs. Immobilization of the manganese NPs on a supported ionic liquid phase and application in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones showed that the oxidation state of manganese strongly influences the catalytic activity.







Abstract
Colloidal and supported manganese nanoparticles were synthesized following an organometallic approach and applied in the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) of aldehydes and ketones. Reaction parameters for the preparation of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) were optimized to yield small (2&#8211;2.5&#8197;nm) and well&#8208;dispersed NPs. Manganese NPs were further immobilized on an imidazolium&#8208;based supported ionic phase (SILP) and characterized to evaluate NP size, metal loading, and oxidation states. Oxidation of the Mn NPs by the support was observed resulting in an average formal oxidation state of +2.5. The MnOx@SILP material showed promising performance in the CTH of aldehydes and ketones using 2&#8208;propanol as a hydrogen donor, outperforming previously reported Mn NPs&#8208;based CTH catalysts in terms of metal loading&#8208;normalized turnover numbers. Interestingly, MnOx@SILP were found to lose activity upon air exposure, which correlates with an additional increase in the average oxidation state of Mn as revealed by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic studies.

         <title>Constructing Hollow Microcubes SnS2 as Negative Electrode for Sodium&#8208;ion and Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microcubes SnS2 were prepared through sacrificial MnCO3 template&#8208;assisted and a facile solvothermal reaction strategy and their performance was investigated in Na and K&#8208;based cells. The unique hollow cubic structure and well&#8208;confined SnS2 nanosheets play an important role in Na+/K+ rapid kinetic and alleviating volume change.







Abstract
Sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs and KIBs) are considered the most promising candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries in energy storage fields. Tin sulfide (SnS2) is regarded as an attractive negative candidate for NIBs and KIBs thanks to its superior power density, high&#8208;rate performance and natural richness. Nevertheless, the slow dynamics, the enormous volume change and the decomposition of polysulfide intermediates limit its practical application. Herein, microcubes SnS2 were prepared through sacrificial MnCO3 template&#8208;assisted and a facile solvothermal reaction strategy and their performance was investigated in Na and K&#8208;based cells. The unique hollow cubic structure and well&#8208;confined SnS2 nanosheets play an important role in Na+/K+ rapid kinetic and alleviating volume change. The effect of the carbon additives (Super P/C65) on the electrochemical properties were investigated thoroughly. The in operando and ex&#8208;situ characterization provide a piece of direct evidence to clarify the storage mechanism of such conversion&#8208;alloying type negative electrode materials.

         <title>Near&#8208;IR Capturing N&#8208;Methylbenzene Sulfonamide&#8208;Phenothiazine Incorporating Strong Electron Acceptor Push&#8208;Pull Systems: Photochemical Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of symmetrical and asymmetrical ynamide&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores exhibiting strong intramolecular charge transfer have been designed, synthesized, and insight into their ultrafast carrier dynamics is investigated. Broadly tunable absorption extending even in the near&#8208;infrared region coupled with novel excited state dynamical processes brightens their prospect of utilization in advanced photonic applications.







Abstract
Unraveling the intriguing aspects of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomenon of multi&#8208;modular donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based push&#8211;pull systems are of paramount importance considering their promising applications, particularly in solar energy harvesting and light&#8208;emitting devices. Herein, a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores 1&#8211;6, are designed and synthesized by the Corey&#8208;Fuchs reaction via Evano's condition followed by [2+2] cycloaddition retroelectrocyclic ring&#8208;opening reaction with strong electron acceptors TCNE and TCNQ in good yields (~60&#8211;85&#8201;%). The photophysical, electrochemical, and computational studies are investigated to explore the effect of incorporation of strong electron acceptors 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) and dicyanoquinodimethane (DCNQ) with phenothiazine (PTZ) donor. An additional low&#8208;lying broad absorption band extended towards the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region suggests charge polarization after the introduction of the electron acceptors in both symmetrical and asymmetrical systems, leading to such strong ICT bands. The electrochemical properties reveal that reduction potentials of 3 and 6 are lower than those of 2 and 5, suggesting DCNQ imparts more on the electronic properties and hence largely contributes to the stabilization of LUMO energy levels than TCBD, in line with theoretical observations. Relative positions of the frontier orbitals on geometry&#8208;optimized structures further support accessing donor&#8208;acceptor sites responsible for the ICT transitions. Eventually, ultrafast carrier dynamics of the photoinduced species are investigated by femtosecond transient absorption studies to identify their spectral characteristics and target analysis further provides information about different excited states photophysical events including ICT and their associated time profiles. The key findings obtained here related to excited state dynamical processes of these newly synthesized systems are believed to be significant in advancing their prospect of utilization in solar energy conversion and related photonic applications.

Insert text for Table of Contents here: We proposed a novel continuous process for the synthesis of macrocyclic polyethylene glycol sulfite (PEG&#8208;MCSi), which is a versatile building block for many PEG derivatives. In contrast to batch reactions, continuous production for this intermediate proves to be stable in terms of yield over a long course, and is therefore suitable for bulk production of PEG&#8208;MCSi.







Abstract
Many macrocyclic compounds are attractive drug&#8208;like molecules or intermediates due to their special properties. However, the bulk synthesis of such compounds are hindered by the necessity of using diluted solutions, in order to prevent intermolecular reactions that yields oligomer impurities, thereby resulting in a low production efficiency. Such challenge can be adequately addressed by using continuous reactors, allowing improved efficiency with smaller space footprints. In this work, we proposed a novel continuous process for the synthesis of a macrocyclic sulfite of tetraethylene glycol (PEG4&#8208;MCSi), which is a precursor to a very useful building block, PEG4&#8208;macrocyclic sulfate (PEG4&#8208;MCS). The basic reaction parameters, including stoichiometry and temperature, were first confirmed with small batch reactions, and the effectiveness of coiled reactors and continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) were compared. Cascaded CSTRs were proven to be suitable, and the reaction parameters were subject to further optimization to give a robust continuous process. The process was then tested with 4&#8197;parallel runs for up to 64&#8197;h. Finally, the merits and demerits of batch and continuous reactions were also compared, demonstrating the suitability of latter in the bulk production of macrocyclic PEG&#8208;MCSi compounds.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Eosin Y&#8208;Based Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for Organic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed Eosin Y was prepared by radical photopolymerization to obtain new heterogeneous photocatalyst with a well&#8208;defined morphology. Taking advantage of the 3D&#8208;printing technology, the heterogeneous EY was designed to fit around the magnetic stirring bar to facilitate both implementation of various organic transformations and catalyst recovery. This very robust photocatalyst is easily recycled and the efficiency was still very high even after 8 reactions.







Abstract
Heterogenization of Eosin Y by 3D&#8208;printing and its application in photocatalysis are reported. The approach allows a fine tuning of the photocatalyst morphology and its rapid preparation. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated through model organic reactions involving oxidation, reduction, and photosensitization pathways. The efficiency, recyclability and stability of 3D printed EY is remarkable paving the way to new generation of heterogeneous photocatalysts with a perfect control of their shape and adaptable to any photoreactors.

         <title>Electrochemically Driven para&#8208;Selective C(sp2)&#8722;H Alkylation Enabled by Activation of Alkyl Halides without Sacrificial Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemically driven para&#8208;selective C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes (aryl esters, aldehydes, nitriles, and ketones) has been achieved with alkyl halides (I, Br, Cl) as a coupling partner. Under mild electrolytic conditions, a variety of alkylated arenes are obtained in one step through the formation of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds. Notably, the reaction enables the activation of alkyl halides in the absence of sacrificial anodes.







Abstract
With alkyl halides (I, Br, Cl) as a coupling partner, an electrochemically driven strategy for para&#8208;selective C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of electron&#8208;deficient arenes (aryl esters, aldehydes, nitriles, and ketones) has been achieved to access diverse alkylated arenes in one step. The reaction enables the activation of alkyl halides in the absence of sacrificial anodes, achieving the formation of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds under mild electrolytic conditions. The utility of this protocol is reflected in high site selectivity, broad substrate scope, and scalable.

         <title>Internal Vanadium Doping and External Modification Design of P2&#8208;Type Layered Mn&#8208;Based Oxides as Competitive Cathodes toward Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

We propose a composite cathode material, Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@Na3V2O2(PO4)2F, featuring synergistic modification through doping and coating. The optimized Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@5wt&#8201;%Na3V2O2(PO4)2F exhibited a high discharge capacity of 176&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the 1.5&#8211;4.1&#8197;V range at a low current density of 17&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. At an increased current density of 850&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the same voltage window, it still delivered a substantial initial discharge capacity of 112&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
P2&#8208;type layered manganese&#8208;based oxides have attracted considerable interest as economical, cathode materials with high energy density for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Despite their potential, these materials still face challenges related to sluggish kinetics and structural instability. In this study, a composite cathode material, Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@Na3V2O2(PO4)2F was developed by surface&#8208;coating P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2 with a thin layer of Na3V2O2(PO4)2F to enhance both the electrochemical sodium storage and material air stability. The optimized Na0.67Ni0.23Mn0.67V0.1O2@5wt&#8201;%Na3V2O2(PO4)2F exhibited a high discharge capacity of 176&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the 1.5&#8208;4.1&#8197;V range at a low current density of 17&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. At an increased current density of 850&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 within the same voltage window, it still delivered a substantial initial discharge capacity of 112&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. These findings validate the significant enhancement of ion diffusion capabilities and rate performance in the P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 material conferred by the composite cathode.

Stable main&#8208;group element&#8208;centered radicals have attracted tremendous attention. We report here the synthesis and molecular structures of both an arsenic&#8208;centered radical anion and a radical cation. In addition, the synthesis of base&#8208;coordinated and base&#8208;free diarsene dications is presented.







Abstract
Diarsene [L(MeO)GaAs]2 (L=HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2, Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, 4) reacts with MeOTf and MeNHC (MeNHC=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetra&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) to the diarsene [L(TfO)GaAs]2 (5) and the carbene&#8208;coordinated diarsene [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)Ga(OMe)L] (6). The NHC&#8208;coordination results in an inversion of the redox properties of the diarsene 4, which shows only a reversible reduction event at E1/2=&#8722;2.06&#8197;V vs Fc0/+1, whereas the carbene&#8208;coordinated diarsene 6 shows a reversible oxidation event at E1/2=&#8722;1.31&#8197;V vs Fc0/+1. Single electron transfer reactions of 4 and 6 yielded [K[2.2.2.]cryp][L(MeO)GaAs]2 (8) and [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)&#8208;Ga(OMe)L][B(C6F5)4] (9) containing the radical anion [L(MeO)GaAs]2&#8901;&#8722; (8&#8901;&#8722;) and the NHC&#8208;coordinated radical cation [L(MeO)GaAsAs(MeNHC)Ga(OMe)L]&#8901;+ (9&#8901;+), respectively, while the salt&#8208;elimination reaction of the triflate&#8208;coordinated diarsene 5 with Na[B(C6F5)4] gave [LGaAs]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (11) containing the dication [LGaAs]22+ (112+). Compounds 1&#8211;11 were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, EPR (8, 9), IR, and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). DFT calculations provided a detailed understanding of the electronic nature of the diarsenes (4, 6) and the radical ions (8&#8901;&#8722;, 9&#8901;+), respectively.

         <title>Pd(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular Grignard&#8208;Type Reaction of Vinyl Iodide&#8208;Carbonyl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Grignard&#8208;type reaction of vinyl iodide&#8208;aldehyde is realized for the first time, which provides facile access to cyclic allylic alcohols with high level of enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. The key to success is the use of HCO2H as additive, which preferentially facilitates protonation of the involved secondary alkyloxyl&#8208;Pd(II) intermediate over the &#946;&#8208;H elimination.







Abstract
The insertion of carbonyl into C(sp2)&#8722;Pd(II) &#963;&#8208;bond (Grignard&#8208;type addition) was not established until the 1990s. While this elemental reaction has been well explored since then, its application in Pd(0) asymmetric catalysis remain elusive. Herein, we report the Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular Grignard&#8208;type reaction of vinyl iodide&#8208;carbonyl in the presence of HCO2H additive, affording cyclic allylic alcohol with good to excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggested that besides serving as an efficient reductant, HCO2H is also capable of facilitating protonation of the involved secondary alkoxyl&#8208;Pd(II), thus completely suppressing the &#946;&#8208;H elimination. Moreover, no KIE was found in the competing reaction between vinyl iodide&#8208;aldehyde and 1&#8208;deuterated one, demonstrating the facile step of aldehyde insertion.

         <title>Exploring Spin&#8208;Orbit Effects in a [Cu6Tl]+ Nanocluster Featuring an Uncommon Tl&#8722;H Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [Cu6Tl]+ cluster, [Cu6TlH6(PPh3)6][OTf], exhibits a rare Tl&#8722;H orbital interaction, as ascertained by 1H NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. According to DFT, the 1H chemical shift of the Tl&#8208;adjacent hydride ligands includes 7.7&#8197;ppm of deshielding due to spin&#8208;orbit (SO) effects mainly originating from the heavy Tl atom, which represent an important confirmation of SO effects in heavy element main group hydrides.







Abstract
Reaction of [CuH(PPh3)]6 with 1 equiv. of Tl(OTf) results in formation of [Cu6TlH6(PPh3)6][OTf] ([1]OTf]), which can be isolated in good yields. Variable&#8208;temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy, in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, confirms the presence of a rare Tl&#8722;H orbital interaction. According to DFT, the 1H chemical shift of the Tl&#8208;adjacent hydride ligands of [1]+ includes 7.7&#8197;ppm of deshielding due to spin&#8208;orbit effects from the heavy Tl atom. This study provides valuable new insights into a rare class of metal hydrides, given that [1][OTf] is only the third isolable species reported to contain a Tl&#8722;H interaction.

         <title>Urea&#8208;Comprising Single Core Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives: Exploring the Synthesis, Self&#8208;Assembly and Charge Transport Properties</title>

We explore the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly and charge transport properties of two urea&#8208;containing single core thiophene&#8208;capped diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives. The subtle differences in molecular design dictate the superior electronic properties of the lactam&#8208;functionalized analogue







Abstract
Supramolecular electronics exploits the distinctive features stemming from noncovalent interactions, guiding the self&#8208;assembly of molecules to craft materials endowed with customized electronic functionalities. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded materials, characterized by their capacity to establish dynamic and stable networks, introduce an extra dimension to the development of supramolecular electronic systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of two remarkably small semiconductors utilizing diketopyrrolopyrrole functionalized with urea units as hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs, strategically positioned at opposing ends of the conjugated core. We show how the subtle distinction in functionalization not only influences morphology and self&#8208;assembly dynamics via hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking formation, but also holds significant consequences for ultimate charge transport properties. Our observations into the interplay of noncovalent interactions provide valuable insights and strategic pathways for the design of novel materials with enhanced electronic characteristics.

         <title>para&#8211;Phenylenediamine Dimer as a Redox&#8211;Active Guest for Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Para&#8211;phenylenediamine dimers with the biphenyl centrepieces form supramolecular complexes with multiple units of &#945;/&#946;/&#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins and/or cucurbit[7/8]urils. Several redox agents were tested for switching between fully reduced colourless and partially oxidised deep blue diradical forms. The reducing effect of some agents was selectively inhibited by complexation with cucurbit[7]uril.







Abstract
Redox&#8211;active components are highly valuable in the construction of molecular devices. We combined two p&#8208;phenylenediamines (p&#8208;PDA) with a biphenyl (BiPhe) unit to prepare a supramolecular guest 4 consisting of three binding sites for cucurbit[7/8]uril (CBn) and/or cyclodextrins (CD). Supramolecular properties of 4 were investigated using NMR, UV&#8208;vis, mass spectrometry and isothermal titration calorimetry. Our analysis revealed that 4 forms higher&#8211;order host&#8211;guest complexes, wherein a CD unit occupies the central BiPhe site, secured by two CBn units at the terminal p&#8208;PDA sites. Additionally, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with &#945;&#8208;CD and &#946;&#8208;CD, a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 complex with &#947;&#8208;CD and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with CB7 and CB8 were identified. Through UV&#8208;vis and cyclic voltammetry, redox processes leading to the formation of a stable, deep blue dication diradical of 4 are elucidated. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that CB7 selectively protects oxidised 4 from reduction in the presence of a reducing agent. The supramolecular and redox properties of the structural motif represented by 4 render it an interesting candidate for the construction of supramolecular devices.

         <title>Reversibly Tuning the Viscosity of Peptide&#8208;Based Solutions Using Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8211;switchable merocyanine photoacid has been used to induce reversible pH drops during the assembly of the modified dipeptide molecule 1ThNapFF. As the pH is decreased, protonation of 1ThNapFF leads to increased aggregation and increased viscosity. These reversible viscosity changes can be used to design systems where flow can be controlled in a non&#8211;invasive and localised way.







Abstract
Light can be used to design stimuli&#8211;responsive systems. We induce transient changes in the assembly of a low molecular weight gelator solution using a merocyanine photoacid. Through our approach, reversible viscosity changes can be achieved via irradiation, delivering systems where flow can be controlled non&#8208;invasively on demand.

         <title>From the Total Synthesis of Semi&#8211;Viriditoxin, Semi&#8211;Viriditoxic Acid and Dimeric Naphthopyranones to their Biological Activities in Burkitt B Cell Lymphoma</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various naphthopyranones were synthesized and tested for their cytotoxicity and apoptotic activity. The synthesis was carried out using two building blocks, which were prepared from enantiomerically pure oxiranes and methyl acetoacetate and then reacted with each other to form naphthopyranones. Monomeric and dimeric naphthopyranones were synthesized and then a structure&#8211;activity relationship study was carried out.







Abstract
Dimeric naphthopyranones are known to be biologically active, however, for the corresponding monomeric naphthopyranones this information is still elusive. Here the first enantioselective total synthesis of semi&#8208;viriditoxic acid as well as the synthesis of semi&#8211;viriditoxin and derivatives is reported. The key intermediate in the synthesis of naphthopyranones is an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8208;lactone, which we synthesized in two different ways (Ghosez&#8211;cyclization and Grubbs ring&#8211;closing metathesis), while the domino&#8211;Michael&#8211;Dieckmann reaction of the &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8208;lactone with an orsellinic acid derivative is the key reaction. A structure&#8208;activity relationship study was performed measuring the cytotoxicity in Burkitt B lymphoma cells (Ramos). The dimeric structure was found to be crucial for biological activity: Only the dimeric naphthopyranones showed cytotoxic and apoptotic activity, whereas the monomers did not display any activity at all.

         <title>Pnictogen&#8208;Rich Heterocycles Derived from a Phosphadiazonium Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a phosphadiazonium cation has been used to create functional heterocycles. DFT calculations confirm that the Mes*NP group is directly implicated in the generation of the unique photophysical and redox properties observed opening the door for the further development of new families of pnictogen&#8208;rich, &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocycles.







Abstract
Heterocycles that pair main group elements and nitrogen are extremely important within the &#960;&#8208;conjugated heterocycles research community. Compared to the vast number of boron&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles, those that include phosphorus are less common. Furthermore, the use of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen triple bonds of any type to prepare such compounds is unprecedented. Here, we pair pyridyl hydrazonide ligands with phosphadiazonium cations and demonstrate that the chelated Mes*NP group is directly implicated in the photophysical and redox properties observed for the resulting heterocycles. In doing so, we introduce a novel building block for the production of phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles that could find use in small molecule activation and catalysis or as the functional component of emerging organic electronics.

         <title>On Haptotropic Rearrangements of Diphosphene and Diarsene Ligands in Titanium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of simple Lewis basic ligands L, such as MeCN or CO among others, results in a shift of the hapticity of the dipnictene ligand in titanocene dipnictene complexes Cp2Ti(Pn2R2) (Pn=P, As) from &#951;2 to &#951;1. While the starting complexes are TiIV species the &#951;1 complexes are best described as singlet biradicals with antiferromagnetically coupled [Cp2TiIII]&#8901;+&#8901; and [Pn2R2]&#8901;&#8722; fragments as verified by computational studies.







Abstract
Dipnictenes of the type RE=ER (E=P, As, Sb, Bi) are the isovalence electronic heavier analogs of alkenes. Although diphosphenes and dipnictenes in general show a variety of binding modes in metal complexes, little is known about haptotropic shift reactions involving these ligands. Herein, we report an unprecedented &#951;2 to &#951;1 rearrangement of the dipnictene ligands in titanocene complexes of the type Cp2Ti(Pn2Ar2) (Pn=P, As; Ar=2,4,6&#8208;Me3&#8208;C6H2, Mes; 2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3, Dip; 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2, Tip), initiated by Lewis basic ligands (L=MeCN, PMe3, AdNC, CO). In the presence of L the dipnictene ligand changes its hapticity from &#951;2 to &#951;1 and complexes of the general form Cp2Ti(L)(Pn2Ar2) with a succinctly different electronic structure are obtained. Electronically, the new complexes are best described as biradicaloids with antiferromagnetically coupled (via a &#960;&#8208;bond) [Cp2TiIII]&#8901;+ and [Pn2Ar2]&#8901;&#8722; fragments. However, the biradical character of these systems is affected by the electronic features of the co&#8208;ligand and significantly decreases moving from PMe3/MeCN (&#963;&#8208;donors) to CNAd/CO (&#963;&#8208;donors/&#960;&#8208;acceptors).

         <title>Backside versus Frontside SN2 Reactions of Alkyl Triflates and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One way or another! Our quantum chemical calculations show how and why the well&#8208;established mechanistic preference for the backside SN2 pathway slowly erodes and can even be overruled by the unusual frontside SN2 substitution mechanism going from strong to weak alcohol nucleophiles in substitution reactions with alkyl triflates.







Abstract
Nucleophilic substitution reactions are elementary reactions in organic chemistry that are used in many synthetic routes. By quantum chemical methods, we have investigated the intrinsic competition between the backside SN2 (SN2&#8208;b) and frontside SN2 (SN2&#8208;f) pathways using a set of simple alkyl triflates as the electrophile in combination with a systematic series of phenols and partially fluorinated ethanol nucleophiles. It is revealed how and why the well&#8208;established mechanistic preference for the SN2&#8208;b pathway slowly erodes and can even be overruled by the unusual SN2&#8208;f substitution mechanism going from strong to weak alcohol nucleophiles. Activation strain analyses disclose that the SN2&#8208;b pathway is favored for strong alcohol nucleophiles because of the well&#8208;known intrinsically more efficient approach to the electrophile resulting in a more stabilizing nucleophile&#8211;electrophile interaction. In contrast, the preference of weaker alcohol nucleophiles shifts to the SN2&#8208;f pathway, benefiting from a stabilizing hydrogen bond interaction between the incoming alcohol and the leaving group. This hydrogen bond interaction is strengthened by the increased acidity of the weaker alcohol nucleophiles, thereby steering the mechanistic preference toward the frontside SN2 pathway.

         <title>Tandem Electrochemical Oxidation of Polycyclic Aromatic Amines Towards Carbazoles and Phenazine&#8208;based Aza&#8208;helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical study revealed that high activity of N&#8722;C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) region of the free radical hybrid determine the regioselectivity of polycyclic aromatic amines (PAAs) electrochemical oxidation towards carbazole and phenazine based aza&#8208;helicenes. This work would pave the way for precise construction of heteroatom fused helical large &#960;&#8208;conjugated system using direct splicing strategy from PAHs derivatives.







Abstract
Experimental and theoretical study of the regioselectivity and mechanism of polycyclic aromatic amine (PAA) electrochemical oxidation is important for designing nitrogen doped large &#960;&#8208;conjugated functional molecules. Herein, we used binary&#8208;, ternary&#8208;, and quaternary&#8208;fused PAAs as electro&#8208;oxidative reaction substrates to investigate the yield changes of carbazole and phenazine based aza&#8208;helicene other than oligomers, which were obtained through pyrrole and pyrazine annulation pathways. Combined with the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) and steric hindrance factor analysis of the substrate, the electron spin density distribution of free radical resonance hybrid and the spin population analysis of the atoms in the structure of each free radical tautomer indicate that the degree of delocalized dispersion of N free radical and the resulting change in the spin density distribution of C free radical tautomers determine the reaction regioselectivity. The potential charge of the K&#8208;region, Bay&#8208;region, and L&#8208;region adjacent to the C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) bond is higher than that of other regions within the molecule, and the charge in these high RESP regions tends to delocalize more strongly toward electron&#8208;deficient N free radicals. Thus, the activity of N&#8722;C(&#945;)&#8722;C(&#946;1) region is increased, which supports the proposed free radical addition and free radical coupling mechanism for the electro&#8208;oxidative reaction of PAA.

         <title>Stabilisation of the [SiH6]2&#8722; Anion within a Supramolecular Assembly</title>

Bring solid state chemistry into solution. Using a supramolecular assembly to mimic the coordination environment of [SiH6]2&#8722; in the solid&#8208;state, a molecular [SiH6]2&#8722; complex that is stable in solution is reported.







Abstract
The hypercoordinate [SiH6]2&#8722; anion is not stable in solution. Here, we report the room temperature, solution stable molecular [SiH6]2&#8722; complex, [{KCa(NON)(OEt2)}2][SiH6] (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene)), where the [SiH6]2&#8722; anion is stabilised within a supramolecular assembly that mimics the solid&#8208;state environment of the anion in the lattice of K2SiH6. Solution&#8208;state reactivity of the complex towards carbon monoxide, benzaldehyde, azobenzene and acetonitrile is reported, yielding a range of reduction and C&#8722;C coupled products.

         <title>Front Cover: Continuous Synthesis of a Macrocyclic Sulfite of Polyethylene Glycol by Cascaded Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs) (Chem. Eur. J. 25/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel continuous process is proposed for the synthesis of a macrocyclic sulfite of tetra(ethylene glycol), PEG4&#8208;MCSi, which is a precursor to the useful building block PEG4&#8208;macrocyclic sulfate, PEG4&#8208;MCS. The system at the core of this work is a set of cascaded continuously stirred tank reactors (portrayed aesthetically in the illustration) containing the reaction mixtures. The core features of this work are listed. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Pan and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304319).

         <title>Emergent Properties in Chemistry &#8208; Relating Molecular Properties to Bulk Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Certain physico&#8208;chemical properties like density or color emerge only when a sufficient number of atoms or molecules are combined in a suitable way. By discussing various case studies, such as the liquidity of water, we here investigate the fundamental types of emergence in chemistry. Studying how properties emerge enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of these properties.







Abstract
Certain properties of an object only emerge when a sufficient number of those objects are present in a definite arrangement. For example, one or two water molecules cannot said to be in a liquid state, but a drop of water can be. This concept of emergence has been studied extensively, but only occasionally discussed explicitly in the context of chemistry. In this paper, we aim to show the fruitfulness of the concept of emergence for chemical inquiry by considering four case studies of emergent chemical properties, i.&#8201;e., the liquidity and freezing of water, structural properties of crystals, thermodynamical phase transitions and quantum mechanical phenomena. We show that some of these properties emerge gradually, some at discrete points, and some should be taken to emerge only when the number of constituents tends to infinity. We argue that studying the way in which chemical properties emerge presents a useful avenue for research that promises greater insight into the nature of those properties.

         <title>Strategies for the Construction of Benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octane in Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthetic strategies for 11 complicated natural products containing (di)benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octane motif are reviewed as well as the synthetic studies on model compounds and analogs. The reaction types for the key cyclization step include Friedel&#8211;Crafts, aldol, and cascaded combination of similar processes.







Abstract
Benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octane is a cage&#8208;like unique motif containing a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane structure fused with at least one benzene ring. It is found in various natural products that exhibit structural complexities and important biological activities. The total synthesis of natural products possessing this challenging structure has received considerable attention, and great advances have been made in this field during the past 15&#8197;years. This review summarizes thus far achieved chemical syntheses and synthetic studies of natural compounds featuring the benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octane core. It focuses on strategic approaches constructing the bridged structure, aiming to provide a useful reference for inspiring further advancements in strategies and total syntheses of natural products with such a framework.

         <title>Artificial Processive Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A processive catalyst undergoes several rounds of catalysis before it is released from the substrate. The drawing shows possible ways (A&#8211;D) in which a synthetic catalyst can interact with the substrate to achieve processivity.







Abstract
Processive catalysts remain attached to a substrate and perform multiple rounds of catalysis. They are abundant in nature. This review highlights artificial processive catalytic systems, which can be divided into (A) catalytic rings that move along a polymer chain, (B) catalytic pores that hold polymer chains and decompose them, (C) catalysts that remain attached to and move around a cyclic substrate via supramolecular interactions, and (D) anchored catalysts that remain in contact with a substrate via multiple catalytic interactions (see frontispiece).

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Compounds in Carbohydrate Chemistry: Glycosylation, Functionalization and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 25, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini review article provides an overview on the advantages and versatility of hypervalent iodine compounds (HICs) in carbohydrate synthesis. We will focuse on the application of HICs in glycosylation, oxidation, functionalization, and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions.







Abstract
This mini review article provides an overview on the use of hypervalent iodine compounds (HICs) in carbohydrate synthesis, focusing on their chemistry and recent applications. HICs are similar to transition metals in their reactivity but have the added benefit of being environmentally benign, and are therefore commonly used as selective oxidants and eco&#8208;friendly reagents in organic synthesis. Herein, we summarize various synthetic uses of hypervalent iodine reagents in reactions such as glycosylation, oxidations, functionalization, and C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming reactions. The goal of this review is to illustrate the advantages and versatility of using HICs as an environmentally sustainable alternative to heavy metals in carbohydrate chemistry.

         <title>From Criegee to Breslow: How &#960;&#8208;Donors Steer the Route of Olefin Ozonolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ozonolysis of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins could lead to currently unknown urea O&#8208;oxide Criegee intermediates. However, our DFT computations predict that strongly polarized double bonds prefer to accept an oxygen atom from ozone rather than undergoing the usually encountered cycloaddition reaction. The product of this reaction is a precursor of the Breslow intermediate.







Abstract
While &#960;&#8208;bonds typically undergo cycloaddition with ozone, resulting in the release of much&#8208;noticed carbonyl O&#8208;oxide Criegee intermediates, lone&#8208;pairs of electrons tend to selectively accept a single oxygen atom from O3, producing singlet dioxygen. We questioned whether the introduction of potent electron&#8208;donating groups, akin to N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins, could influence the reactivity of double bonds &#8211; shifting from cycloaddition to oxygen atom transfer or generating lesser&#8208;known, yet stabilized, donor&#8208;substituted Criegee intermediates. Consequently, we conducted a comparative computational study using density functional theory on a series of model olefins with increasing polarity due to (asymmetric) &#960;&#8208;donor substitution. Reaction path computations indicate that highly polarized double bonds, instead of forming primary ozonides in their reaction with O3, exhibit a preference for accepting a single oxygen atom, resulting in a zwitterionic species formally identified as a carbene&#8208;carbonyl adduct. This previously unexplored reactivity potentially introduces aldehyde umpolung chemistry (Breslow intermediate) through olefin ozonolysis. Considering solvent effects implicitly reveals that increased solvent polarity further directs the trajectories toward a single oxygen atom transfer reactivity by stabilizing the zwitterionic character of the transition state. The competing modes of chemical reactivity can be explained by a bifurcation of the reaction valley in the post&#8208;transition state region.

         <title>Advances in the Continuous Flow Synthesis of 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;Membered Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This short review summarises key developments for the synthesis of strained 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered ring systems exploiting continuous flow synthesis. These important carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic scaffolds are readily accessed via photochemical, electrochemical and temperature sensitive strategies.







Abstract
Small carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic ring systems have experienced a significant increase in importance in recent years due to their relevance in modern pharmaceuticals, as building blocks for designer materials or as synthetic intermediates. This necessitated the development of new synthetic methods for the preparation of these strained ring systems focusing on effectiveness and scalability. The high ring strain of these entities as well as the use of high&#8208;energy reagents and intermediates has often challenged their synthesis. Continuous flow approaches have thus emerged as highly effective means to safely and reliably access these strained scaffolds. In this short review, key developments in this field are summarised showcasing the power of continuous flow approaches for accessing 3&#8208; and 4&#8208;membered ring systems via thermal, photo&#8208; and electrochemical processes.

         <title>Formation of Peroxynitrite, [O&#8722;N&#8722;O&#8722;O]&#8722;, via a Cascade of Reactions between Ozonide and Ammonia</title>

         <dc:description>
[ONOO]&#8722; has been encountered along a cascade of reactions between KO3 and ammonia in the presents of a partially fluorinated aniline&#8208;based cation. For the first time, high resolution structural data of the peroxynitrite ion have been obtained and single crystals were studied by Raman spectroscopy.







Abstract
We report on an unexpected reaction between ammonia and potassium ozonide dissolved in liq. NH3 resulting in the formation of peroxynitrite, [ONOO]&#8722;, which exclusively happens in the presence of a specific partially fluorinated aniline&#8208;based ammonium cation. High&#8208;resolution structural data of the peroxynitrite anion in cis&#8208;conformation have been obtained. We further studied this molecule anion by single crystal Raman spectroscopy. The cis and trans isomers of peroxynitrite were analysed computationally with respect to their relative energies, the cis&#8208;trans transition barrier and their decomposition pathways to the nitrate anion. By experimentally examining cations decorated with fluorine ligands to different degrees, we demonstrate that fluorine specific interactions play a crucial role in the unexpected formation of peroxynitrite and as a conspicuously structure directing factor for the underlying crystalline solid phases, exhibiting distinct micro&#8208;separations of fluorine and hydrogen enriched regions.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine(III) Mediated Halogen Bonded Supramolecular Chiral System with Cholesteryl Naphthalimides</title>

The introduction of I(III) as a halogen&#8208;bond donor regulates the aggregation of the donors, achieving amplification of chiroptical signals and inheriting solvent responsiveness from the self&#8208;aggregated assembly.







Abstract
Halogen bonding acknowledged as a noteworthy weak interaction, has gained growing recognition in the field of supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we selected structurally rigid diaryliodonium ions (I(III)) with two biaxial &#963;&#8208;holes as halogen&#8208;bond donors, to bind with three chiral acceptor molecules bearing cholesteryl and naphthalimides with distinct geometries. The abundant carbonyl oxygen atoms in side&#8208;arm substituents function as multiple acceptors for halogen bonding. The self&#8208;aggregation of chiral acceptor molecules demonstrates adaptiveness to solvent media, evidenced by the inversion of the Cotton effect and the morphological evolution from spherical to rod&#8208;like nanoarchitectures in different solvent systems. The distinct geometries of the acceptor molecules conferred various binding modes with I(III). The introduction of I(III) as a halogen&#8208;bond donor regulates the aggregation of the donors, achieving amplification of chiroptical signals and inheriting solvent responsiveness from the self&#8208;aggregated assembly. This study successfully utilized rational structural design and multimodal control strategies to achieve regulation of supramolecular chirality.

Framework and polymeric nanoreactor have been regarded for improving cascade chemical reaction in the tumor microenvironment. Nanoreactor&#8208;loaded oxidoreductase enzymes have been activated by tumor acidity to produce H2O2 by increasing tumor oxidative stress. In this review, we identify the significance of dual&#8208;enzyme cascade in the tumor microenvironment which regulated by ROS activity. Herein, we discuss tumor hypoxia, ROS formation, including cascaded enzymes along with synergistic therapy.







Abstract
Framework and polymeric nanoreactors (NRs) have distinct advantages in improving chemical reaction efficiency in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Nanoreactor&#8208;loaded oxidoreductase enzyme is activated by tumor acidity to produce H2O2 by increasing tumor oxidative stress. High levels of H2O2 induce self&#8208;destruction of the vesicles by releasing quinone methide to deplete glutathione and suppress the antioxidant potential of cancer cells. Therefore, the synergistic effect of the enzyme&#8208;loaded nanoreactors results in efficient tumor ablation via suppressing cancer&#8208;cell metabolism. The main driving force would be to take advantage of the distinct metabolic properties of cancer cells along with the high peroxidase&#8208;like activity of metalloenzyme/metalloprotein. A cascade strategy of dual enzymes such as glucose oxidase (GOx) and nitroreductase (NTR) wherein the former acts as an O2&#8208;consuming agent such as overexpression of NTR and further amplified NTR&#8208;catalyzed release for antitumor therapy. The design of cascade bioreductive hypoxia&#8208;responsive drug delivery via GOx regulates NTR upregulation and NTR&#8208;responsive nanoparticles. Herein, we discuss tumor hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and the effectiveness of these therapies. Nanoclusters in cascaded enzymes along with chemo&#8208;radiotherapy with synergistic therapy are illustrated. Finally, we outline the role of the nanoreactor strategy of cascading enzymes along with self&#8208;synergistic tumor therapy.

         <title>Engineered Nanomaterials for Tumor Immune Microenvironment Modulation in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays an important role in evading tumor immunity and conferring resistance to immunotherapy. Nanomaterials targeting various immune components in the suppressive TIME can alter the tumor inhibition state, promote the therapeutic effect of anti&#8208;tumor drugs, and enhance anti&#8208;tumor efficacy In this review, we provided an overview of key briefly viewed the key components within the suppressive TIME and various nanoparticles designed to target these components for applications in cancer immunotherapy. Through comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted roles of immune cells in sculpting anti&#8208;tumor immunity, next&#8208;generation nanoscale immunotherapies can be rationally designed to orchestrate a pro&#8208;immunogenic tumor microenvironment.







Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy, represented by immune checkpoint blocking and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, has achieved promising results in clinical applications. However, it faces challenges that hinder its further development, such as limited response rates and poor tumor permeability. The efficiency of tumor immunotherapy is also closely linked to the structure and function of the immune microenvironment where the tumor resides. Recently, nanoparticle&#8208;based tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) modulation strategies have attracted a great deal of attention in cancer immunotherapy. This is primarily due to the distinctive physical characteristics of nanoparticles, which enable them to effectively infiltrate the TIME and selectively modulate its key constituents. This paper reviews recent advances in nanoparticle engineering to improve anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. Emerging nanoparticle&#8208;based approaches for modulating immune cells, tumor stroma, cytokines and immune checkpoints are discussed, aiming to overcome current challenges in the clinic. In addition, integrating immunotherapy with various treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy can be facilitated through the utilization of nanoparticles, thereby enhancing the efficacy of cancer treatment. The future challenges and opportunities of using nanomaterials to reeducate the suppressive immune microenvironment of tumors are also discussed, with the aim of anticipating further advancements in this growing field.

         <title>Tunable Optical Anisotropy in Rare&#8208;earth Borates with Flexible [BO3] Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borates have garnered a lot of attention in the realm of solid&#8208;state chemistry due to their remarkable characteristics, in which the synthesis of borates with isolated [BO3] by adding rare&#8208;earth elements is one of the main areas of structural design study. Five new mixed&#8208;metal Y&#8208;based rare&#8208;earth borates, Ba2ZnY2(BO3)4, KNa2Y(BO3)2, Li2CsY4(BO3)5, LiRb2Y(BO3)2, and RbCaY(BO3)2, have been discovered using the high&#8208;temperature solution approach. Isolated [BO3] clusters arranged in various configurations comprise their entire anionic framework, allowing for optical anisotropy tuning between 0.024 and 0.081 under 1064 nm. In this study, we characterize the relative placements of their [BO3] groups and examine how their structure affects their characteristics. The origin of their considerable optical anisotropy has been proven theoretically. This study unequivocally demonstrates that even a slight alteration to borates' anionic structure can result in a significant improvement in performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Interaction of C60 with methylammonium lead iodide perovskite surfaces: Unveiling the Role of C60 in Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the interaction between fullerene (C60) and perovskite surfaces is pivotal for advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. In this study, we investigate the adsorption behavior of C60 on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) surfaces using periodic density functional theory calculations. We explore various surface terminations and defect configurations to elucidate the influence of surface morphology on the C60&#8208;perovskite interaction, computing the adsorption energy and transfer of charge. Our results reveal distinct adsorption energies and charge transfer mechanisms for different surface terminations, shedding light on the role of surface defects in modifying the electronic structure and stability of perovskite materials. Furthermore, we provide insights into the potential of C60 to passivate surface defects, playing a relevant role in the surface reconstruction after the formation of defects. This comprehensive understanding of C60&#8208;perovskite interactions offers valuable guidelines about the role of fullerenes on surface structure and reconstruction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We describe early and recent advances in the fascinating field of combined magnetic and optical properties of inorganic coordination compounds and in particular of 3d&#8208;4f single molecule magnets. We cover various applied techniques which allow for the correlation of results obtained in the frequency and time domain in order to highlight the specific properties of these compounds and the future challenges towards multidimensional spectroscopic tools. An important point is to understand the details of the interplay of magnetic and optical properties through performing time&#8208;resolved studies in the presence of external fields especially magnetic ones. This will enable further exploration of this fundamental interactions i.e. the two components of electromagnetic radiation influencing optical properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Natural light&#8208;responsive rhodopsins play a critical role in visual conversion, signal transduction, energy transmission, etc., which has aroused extensive interest in the past decade. Inspired by these gorgeous works of living beings, scientists have constructed various biomimetic light&#8208;responsive nanochannels to mimic the behaviors of rhodopsins. However, it is still challenging to build stimuli&#8208;responsive sub&#8208;nanochannels only regulated by visible light as the rhodopsins are always at the sub&#8208;nanometer level and regulated by visible light. Pillar[6]arenes have an open cavity of 6.7 &#197;, which can selectively recognize small organic molecules. They can be connected to ions of ammonium or carboxylate groups on the rims. Therefore, we designed and synthesized the amino and carboxyl&#8208;derived side chains of pillar[6]arenes with opposite charges. The sub&#8208;nanochannels were constructed through the electrostatic interaction of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembled amino and carboxyl&#8208;derived pillar[6]arenes. Then, the natural chromophore of the retinal with visible light&#8208;responsive performance was modified on the upper edge of the sub&#8208;nanochannel to realize the visible light switched on and off. Finally, we successfully constructed a visible light&#8208;responsive sub&#8208;nanochannel, providing a novel method for regulating the selective transport of energy&#8208;donating molecules of ATP.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterogeneous Porous Synergistic Photocatalysts for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent interest has surged in using heterogeneous carriers to boost synergistic photocatalysis for organic transformations. Heterogeneous catalysts not only facilitate synergistic enhancement of distinct catalytic centers compared to their homogeneous counterparts, but also allow for the easy recovery and reuse of catalysts. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advancements in developing heterogeneous carriers, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks, covalent&#8211;organic frameworks, porous organic polymers, and others, for synergistic catalytic reactions. The advantages of porous materials in heterogeneous catalysis originate from their ability to provide a high surface area, facilitate enhanced mass transport, offer a tunable chemical structure, ensure the stability of active species, and enable easy recovery and reuse of catalysts. Both photosensitizers and catalysts can be intricately incorporated into suitable porous carriers to create heterogeneous dual photocatalysts for organic transformations. Notably, experimental evidence from reported cases has shown that the catalytic efficacy of heterogeneous catalysts often surpasses that of their homogeneous analogues. This enhanced performance is attributed to the proximity and confinement effects provided by the porous nature of the carriers. It is expected that porous carriers will provide a versatile platform for integrating diverse catalysts, thus exhibiting superior performance across a range of organic transformations and appealing prospect for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Coordination Chemistry of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalytic Sites by Ru Species to Accelerate the Polysulfide Conversion Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is compromised by the loss of sulfur as dissolved polysulfides in the electrolyte and consequently the polysulfide redox shutting effect. Accelerating the conversion kinetics of polysulfide intermediates into sulfur or lithium sulfide through electrocatalysis has emerged as a root&#8208;cause solution. Co&#8208;N&#8208;C composite electrocatalyst is commonly used for this purpose. It is illustrated here that how the effectiveness can be improved by modulating the coordination chemistry of Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalytic sites through introducing Ru species (RuCo&#8208;NC). The well&#8208;dispersed Ru in the Co&#8208;NC carbon matrix altered the total charge distribution over the Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalytic sites and led to the formation of electron&#8208;rich Co&#8208;N, which is highly active for the polysulfide conversion reactions. Using Ru to modulate the electronic structure in the Co&#8208;N&#8208;C configuration and the additional catalytic sites over the Ru&#8208;Nx species can manifest optimal adsorption behavior of polysulfides. Consequently, the sulfur cathode with RuCo&#8208;NC can reduce the capacity fade rate from 0.11% per cycle without catalyst (initial capacity of 701 mAh g&#8208;1) to 0.054% per cycle (initial capacity of 1074 mAh g&#8208;1) over 400 cycles at 0.2 C rate. The results of this study provide the evidence for a feasible catalyst modification strategy for the polysulfide electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Indolines via Base&#8208;Mediated C&#8211;H Activation and Defluorinative C&#8211;N Coupling, with no Need for Transition&#8208;Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Syntheses of (partially) aromatic nitrogen heterocycles increasingly rely on transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8211;C&#8208; and C&#8211;N&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Here we describe a different approach to the synthesis of indolines by a domino C(sp3)&#8211;H activation, 1,2&#8208;addition, and defluorinative SNAr&#8208;cyclization sequence to provide the target 1,2&#8208;diarylindolines (1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydroindoles) from ortho&#8208;fluorinated methyl&#8208;arenes and N&#8208;aryl imines (benzylidene anilines) in a cyclocondensation that is mediated by potassium hexa&#173;methyl&#173;di&#173;silazide (KHMDS) as base exclusively. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free process via C&#8211;H and C&#8211;F bond activation provides a one&#8208;step entry into a wide array of indoline scaffolds (43 examples, up to 96% yield). This privileged substructure is common in natural products and pharmaceuticals alike, and cannot be accessed by traditional condensation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Single Acyclic Phosphonate Nucleotide (ZNA) Modifications on DNA Duplex Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An acyclic phosphonate&#8208;linked nucleic acid backbone (ZNA) demonstrated the capability to support duplex formation and propagate genetic information in vivo, unveiling its potential for evolution into a synthetic genetic system (XNA). To determine the structural impact of such modification, modified Dickerson Drew DNA dodecamers (DDDs) were prepared by solid phase synthesis, each containing either an (R) or (S) isomeric form of a cytosine ZNA nucleotide. While the DDD is known to adopt a stable duplex, both duplex and hairpin forms were simultaneously observed for both modified oligonucleotides by NMR spectroscopy over a broad temperature range (5&#8211;65 &#176;C). Diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments allowed to separate duplex and hairpin signals based on the different diffusion constants of both conformational states. For the oligomer containing (R)&#8208;ZNA, only the duplex form occurred at 5 &#176;C, while it was not possible to determine by NMR a single hairpin conformation at higher temperatures. In the case of the (S)&#8208;ZNA nucleoside modified oligomer, both hairpin and duplex forms were observable at 0 &#176;C, while a single hairpin conformation was detected at 37 &#176;C, suggesting a higher destabilizing effect on dsDNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect Engineering in Bi&#8208;based Photo/electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Main group Bi&#8208;based materials have gained popularity as N2 reduction reaction (NRR) photo/electrocatalysts due to their ability to inhibit competitive H2 evolution reactions (HER) and the unique N2 adsorption activities. The introduction of defects in Bi&#8208;based catalysts represents a highly effective strategy for enhancing light absorption, promoting efficient separation of photogenerated carriers, optimizing the activity of free radicals, regulating electronic structure, and improving catalytic performance. In this review, we outline the various applications of state of the defect engineering in Bi&#8208;based catalysts and elucidate the impact of vacancies on NRR performance. In particular, the types of defects, methods of defects tailoring, advanced characterization techniques, as well as the Bi&#8208;based catalysts with abundant defects and their corresponding catalytic behavior in NRR were elucidated in detail. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities for future development of defective Bi&#8208;based NRR catalysts are discussed, which provides a comprehensive theoretical guidance for this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Secondary Sites of the C&#8208;type Lectin&#8208;Like Fold</title>

C&#8208;type lectins, a large superfamily of proteins, are crucial in immunity and homeostasis. Their C&#8208;type lectin&#8208;like domain enables them to bind a wide range of ligands, including those not dependent on Ca2+ interactions. This adaptability is further enhanced by their variable domain architecture and conformational plasticity. Secondary binding sites, often located away from the primary site, contribute to the C&#8208;type lectin functional diversity by accommodating different ligands, thus offering potential for drug discovery by fine&#8208;tuning biological responses and increasing selectivity.







Abstract
C&#8208;type lectins are a large superfamily of proteins involved in a multitude of biological processes. In particular, their involvement in immunity and homeostasis has rendered them attractive targets for diverse therapeutic interventions. They share a characteristic C&#8208;type lectin&#8208;like domain whose adaptability enables them to bind a broad spectrum of ligands beyond the originally defined canonical Ca2+&#8208;dependent carbohydrate binding. Together with variable domain architecture and high&#8208;level conformational plasticity, this enables C&#8208;type lectins to meet diverse functional demands. Secondary sites provide another layer of regulation and are often intricately linked to functional diversity. Located remote from the canonical primary binding site, secondary sites can accommodate ligands with other physicochemical properties and alter protein dynamics, thus enhancing selectivity and enabling fine&#8208;tuning of the biological response. In this review, we outline the structural determinants allowing C&#8208;type lectins to perform a large variety of tasks and to accommodate the ligands associated with it. Using the six well&#8208;characterized Ca2+&#8208;dependent and Ca2+&#8208;independent C&#8208;type lectin receptors DC&#8208;SIGN, langerin, MGL, dectin&#8208;1, CLEC&#8208;2 and NKG2D as examples, we focus on the characteristics of non&#8208;canonical interactions and secondary sites and their potential use in drug discovery endeavors.

         <title>Design of Bright Chemogenetic Reporters Based on the Combined Engineering of Fluorogenic Molecular Rotors and of the HaloTag Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of bright chemogenetic reporters based on the HaloTag technology with green to red emission range were obtained by combining the molecular engineering of chemically&#8208;accessible fluorescent molecular rotors with mutations of the HaloTag protein. The reporters are suitable for wash&#8208;free live cell imaging with good contrast and the design strategy facilitates the future diversification and optimization of the properties.







Abstract
The combination of fluorogenic probes (fluorogens) and self&#8208;labeling protein tags represent a promising tool for imaging biological processes with high specificity but it requires the adequation between the fluorogen and its target to ensure a good activation of its fluorescence. In this work, we report a strategy to develop molecular rotors that specifically target HaloTag with a strong enhancement of their fluorescence. The divergent design facilitates the diversification of the structures to tune the photophysical and cellular properties. Four bright fluorogens with emissions ranging from green to red were identified and applied in wash&#8208;free live cell imaging experiments with good contrast and selectivity. A HaloTag mutant adapted from previous literature reports was also tested and shown to further improve the brightness and reaction rate of the most promising fluorogen of the series both in&#8197;vitro and in cells. This work opens new possibilities to develop bright chemogenetic reporters with diverse photophysical and biological properties by exploring a potentially large chemical space of simple dipolar fluorophores in combination with protein engineering.

         <title>Metal Free Functionalization of Saturated Heterocycles with Vinylarenes and Pyridine Enabled by Photocatalytic Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinylarenes as synthetic linchpins towards the pyridine and 3D fragments conjugation enabled by metal free photocatalytic hydrogen atom transfer is described, which exhibit broad substrate scope, mild conditions, and excellent regioselectivity. This reaction tolerates late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceutical molecules.







Abstract
Saturated heterocycles are important class of structural scaffolds in small&#8208;molecule drugs, natural products, and synthetic intermediates. Here, we disclosed a metal free, mild, and scalable functionalization of saturated heterocycles using vinylarenes as a linchpin approach. Key to success of this transformation is the employing of simple and cheap benzophenone as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst. This operationally robust process was used for the making of diverse functionalized saturated heterocycles. Furthermore, aldehydes, alkane, and alcohol have been functionalized under the optimized conditions. The potential pharmaceutical utility of the procedure has also been demonstrated by late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive natural compounds and pharmaceutical molecules. Initial mechanism studies and control experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanism of the reactions

         <title>Heptagonal Molecular Tiling via Self&#8208;Assembly of Heptagonal Phenylene&#8208;Ethynylene Macrocycle at the Liquid&#8211;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular&#8208;level heptagonal tiling has been demonstrated at the liquid&#8211;graphite interface by the self&#8208;assembly of a heptagonal meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle featuring long alkoxy substituents. The heptagonal molecules align in an antiparallel pattern, which resembles the densely packed pattern of heptagonal tiles, albeit with variations in the orientations and spacing of the heptagonal cores.







Abstract
The molecular&#8208;level scrutinization of on&#8208;surface tiling garners considerable interest among scientists. Herein, we demonstrate molecular&#8208;level heptagonal tiling using the self&#8208;assembly of a heptagonal meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle featuring 14 long alkoxy substituents at the liquid&#8211;graphite interface using scanning tunneling microscopy. This heptagonal macrocycle produces an antiparallel pattern at the 1&#8208;phenyloctane&#8211;graphite interface through van der Waals interactions between the alkoxy chains. This pattern resembles the densely packed pattern of heptagonal tiles, albeit with variations in the orientations and spacing of heptagonal cores owing to intermolecular interactions between the alkoxy chains. Conversely, at the 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene&#8211;graphite interface, the heptagonal molecule forms an oblique pattern composed of four independent molecular orientations. This phenomenon arises from core distortion induced by the coadsorption of the solvent molecules within the intrinsic macrocyclic pores. This study elucidates the design strategy &#8211; specifically, the choice of heptagonal molecular building block &#8211; for heptagonal tiling and fills a crucial gap in the field of two&#8208;dimensional crystal engineering.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkylation reactions of triarylamines with perfluoroalkyl iodides by visible&#8208;light irradiation of EDA complexes have been achieved. When these perfluoroalkylated triarylamines are subjected to acetone&#8208;sensitized irradiation, a highly stereospecific electrocyclization to endo perfluoroalkylated carbazoles is obtained. Mechanistic and photophysical insights are studied. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;M. Bonesi, A. Postigo and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400905).

         <title>Directed Evolution and Immobilization of Lactobacillus brevis Alcohol Dehydrogenase for Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Rivastigmine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To produce the key chiral intermediate of Rivastigmine, directed evolution was employed to enhance the specific activity of an alcohol dehydrogenase by over 100&#8208;fold under optimal conditions. Co&#8208;immobilization of this alcohol dehydrogenase with glucose dehydrogenase on magnetic nanoparticles yields easily recyclable biocatalysts. The biocatalytic reduction was combined with further chemical steps to achieve the chemoenzymatic synthesis of Rivastigmine with an overall yield of 66&#8201;%, demonstrating the synthesis of this important drug in an environmentally friendly and inexpensive manner.







Abstract
Rivastigmine is one of the several pharmaceuticals widely prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, its practical synthesis still faces many issues, such as the involvement of toxic metals and harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we report a chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of Rivastigmine. The key chiral intermediate was synthesized by an engineered alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbADH). A semi&#8208;rational approach was employed to improve its catalytic activity and thermal stability. Several LbADH variants were obtained with a remarkable increase in activity and melting temperature. Exploration of the substrate scope of these variants demonstrated improved activities toward various ketones, especially acetophenone analogs. To further recycle and reuse the biocatalyst, one LbADH variant and glucose dehydrogenase were co&#8208;immobilized on nanoparticles. By integrating enzymatic and chemical steps, Rivastigmine was successfully synthesized with an overall yield of 66&#8201;%. This study offers an efficient chemo&#8208;enzymatic route for Rivastigmine and provides several efficient LbADH variants with a broad range of potential applications.

In this work a family of multidimensional (2&#8208;(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)ethyl) amino acid coordination compounds have been synthesized and thoroughly characterized. For this purpose, glycine, valine, phenylalanine and tyrosine have been selected as starting amino acids and Mn2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+ as metallic nodes. From one side, for Mn2+ based dimer magnetic resonance imaging studies have been conducted, prompted by the number and disposition of the coordinated water molecules and taking into consideration the promising future of manganese&#8208;based coordination compounds as bio&#8208;compatible substitutes to conventional Gd based contrast agents. From another side, d10 block metal&#8208;based complexes allowed exploring photoluminescence properties derived by in&#8197;situ synthesized ligands. Finally, amino acid preserved structural chirality allowed us to examine chiroptical properties, particularly focusing on circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Spectroscopic Methods: Towards Chemical Sensor Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) have significant promise as chemical sensors for the differentiation of chiral analytes due to their highly tuneable nature. This review discusses the spectroscopic methods used for chiroptical sensing including photoluminescence, circular dichroism, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance. Future directions are highlighted with a view towards the incorporation of CMOFs into chemical sensor devices.







Abstract
Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) are a rapidly growing field reflecting their potential as selective and sensitive chemical sensors for chiral analytes. The highly tuneable nature of CMOFs enables the size, shape, and non&#8208;covalent interactions to be optimised towards specific analytes to engender strong intermolecular interactions and sensing responses. While CMOFs as chiral chemical sensor devices have been explored with electrochemical methods including differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), bipolar and chemiresistive sensing techniques, the CMOFs as chiral chemical sensors using spectroscopic methods has received significantly less attention. This review examines the synthesis of CMOFs for chemical sensors with spectroscopic methods such as photoluminescence, circular dichroism, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance with a view towards their incorporation into chemical sensor devices. Future directions of the field are highlighted for the generation of functional devices.

         <title>Polymeric Nanozyme with SOD Activity Capable of Inhibiting Self&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Induced &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite decades of research, Parkinson&#8217;s disease is still an idiopathic pathology for which no cure has yet been found. This is partly explained by the multifactorial character of most neurodegenerative syndromes, whose generation involves multiple pathogenic factors. Two of the most important ones are the aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and oxidative stress. In this work, we address both issues by synthesizing a multifunctional nanozyme based on grafting a pyridinophane ligand that can strongly coordinate CuII, onto biodegradable PEGylated polyester nanoparticles. The resulting nanozyme exhibits remarkable superoxide dismutase activity together with the ability to inhibit the self&#8208;induced aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein into amyloid&#8208;type fibrils. Furthermore, the combination of the chelator and the polymer produces a cooperative effect whereby the resulting nanozyme can also halve CuII&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the Effect of Methylglyoxal on the Conformation, Function, and Aggregation Propensity of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is well&#8208;known that people suffering from hyperglycemia have a higher propensity to develop Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD). One of the most plausible mechanisms linking these two pathologies is the glycation of neuronal proteins and the pathological consequences of it. &#945;&#8208;Synuclein, a key component in PD, can be glycated at its fifteen lysine. In fact, the end products of this process have been detected on aggregated &#945;&#8208;synuclein isolated from in vivo. However, the consequences of glycation are not entirely clear, which are of crucial importance to understand the mechanism underlying the connection between diabetes and PD. To better clarify this, we have here examined how methylglyoxal (the most important carbonyl compound found in the cytoplasm) affects the conformation and aggregation propensity of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, as well as its ability to cluster and fuse synaptic&#8208;like vesicles. The obtained data prove that methylglyoxal induces the Lys&#8208;Lys crosslinking through the formation of MOLD. However, this does not have a remarkable effect on the averaged conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, although it completely depletes its native propensity to form soluble oligomers and insoluble amyloid fibrils. Moreover, methylglyoxal has a disrupting effect on the ability of &#945;&#8208;synuclein to bind, cluster and fusion synaptic&#8208;like vesicles.</dc:description>

         <title>Control over Anion Coordination on Pd(II), Cu(I), and Ag(I) with Regioisomeric Phosphine&#8208;Carboxylate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination of anionic donors is involved at various stages of catalytic cycles in transition&#8208;metal catalysis, but control over the spatial positioning of anions around a metal center is a challenge in coordination chemistry. Here we show that regioisomeric phosphine&#8208;carboxylate ligands provide spatial anion control on palladium(II) centers by favoring either &#954;2, cis&#8208;&#954;1, or trans&#8208;&#954;1 coordination of the carboxylate donor. Additionally, the palladium(II) carboxylates, which contain a methyl donor, upon protonation, deliver metal&#8208;alkyl complexes that feature a coordinated carboxylic acid. Such complexes can be considered as models for the minima that follow the concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation transition state for C&#8211;H activation. The predictability of the coordination modes is further demonstrated on silver(I) and copper(I) centers, for which less common structures of mononuclear and binuclear complexes can be obtained by using spatial anion control. Our results demonstrate the potential for spatial control over carboxylate anions in coordination chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable CAAC&#8208;triazenes: A New Nitrogen Ligand System with Donor and Conformational Flexibility, and with Application in Olefin Activation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic imines such as pyridylidene amines impart high catalytic activity when coordinated to a transition metal, largely imposed by their electronic flexibility. Here, this donor flexibility has been applied for the first time to CAAC&#8208;based systems through the synthesis of CAAC&#8208;triazenes. These new ligands offer a larger &#960;&#8208;conjugating that extends from the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene through three nitrogens rather than just one, as observed in N&#8208;heterocyclic imines. We demonstrate the straightforward synthesis of three new CAAC&#8208;triazenes containing different substituents on the terminal triazene nitrogen. These compounds are remarkably stable up to 120 &#176;C without loss of N2&#160;as typically observed with similar triazenes.&#160;E&#8208;to&#8208;Z&#160;isomerization within the triazene is instigated by UV light and is partially reversible dependent on the triazene substituent. The quinoline&#8208;substituted CAAC&#8208;triazene&#160;1&#8208;Q&#160;has been applied as an&#160;L,L&#8217;&#8208;type ligand in the synthesis of [PdCl2(1&#8208;Q)], [PdCl(Me)(1&#8208;Q)] and [Pd(Me)(H2O(1&#8208;Q)]+.&#160;E&#8208;to&#8208;Z&#160;ligand isomerization also occurs when coordinated to PdCl2, providing access to on&#8208;metal manipulation. The cationic complex [PdMe(H2O)(1&#8208;Q)]+&#160;is a precatalyst for oligomerization of ethylene to form initially 2&#8208;butene and subsequently linear and branched C8&#8211;C12products from butene activation. Moreover, isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene takes place efficiently with exceptionally low catalyst loading (10 ppm) and up to 74,000 turnover numbers.</dc:description>

         <title>An Enantioselective Aminocatalytic Cascade Reaction Affording Bioactive Hexahydroazulene Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalysis opens up for a novel cascade reaction concept where 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines first undergo an enantioselective [6+4] cycloaddition with trienamines, followed by a spontaneously series of reactions to provide chiral hexahydraoazulenes, of which some show bioactivity.







Abstract
A novel cascade reaction initiated by an enantioselective aminocatalysed 1,3&#8208;dipolar [6+4] cycloaddition between catalytically generated trienamines and 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines is presented. The [6+4] cycloadduct spontaneously undergoes an intramolecular enamine&#8208;mediated aldol, hydrolysis, and E1cb sequence, which ultimately affords a chiral hexahydroazulene framework. In this process, three new C&#8722;C bonds and three new stereocenters are formed, enabled by a formal unfolding of the pyridine moiety from the dipolar reagent. The hexahydroazulenes are formed with excellent diastereo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and periselectivity (&gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1), up to 96&#8201;% ee, and yields up to 52&#8201;%. Synthetic elaborations of this scaffold were performed, providing access to a variety of functionalised hydroazulene compounds, of which some were found to display biological activity in U&#8208;2OS osteosarcoma cells in cell painting assays.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and (Photo)Catalytic Behavior of Ce&#8208;MOFs Containing Perfluoroalkylcarboxylate Linkers: Experimental and Theoretical Insights</title>

Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer potential for photodegradation of organic dyes in new perfluorinated Ce&#8208;MOFs.







Abstract
Cerium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic frameworks (Ce&#8208;MOFs) are attracting increasing interest due to their similar structural features to zirconium MOFs. The redox behavior of Ce(III/IV) adds a range of properties to the compounds. Recently, perfluorinated linkers have been used in the synthesis of MOFs to introduce new characteristic into the structure. We report the synthesis and structural characterization of Ce(IV)&#8208;based MOFs constructed using two perfluorinated alkyl linkers. Their structure, based on hexanuclear Ce6O4(OH)412+ clusters linked to each other by the dicarboxylate ions, has been solved ab&#8208;initio from X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data and refined by the Rietveld method. The crystallization kinetics and the MOF formation mechanism was also invesitigated by Synchrotron radiation with XAS spectroscopies (EXAFS and XANES). The MOFs present the same fcu cubic topology as observed in MOF&#8208;801 and UiO&#8208;66, and they showed good stability in water at different pH conditions. The electronic structure of these MOFs has been studied by DFT calculations in order to obtain insights into the density of states structure of the reported compounds, resulting in band gaps in the range of 2.8&#8211;3.1&#8197;eV. Their catalytic properties were tested both thermally and under visible light irradiation for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye.

         <title>Construction of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) Solid Solutions for Improving Solar Fuels Production in Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction by H2O Vapour</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a molten&#8208;salt approach to synthesize Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) solid solutions. Expand the light&#8208;harvesting wavelength range. Additionally, we found that with the introduction of ZnFe2O4, the photogenerated electrons transition from CoO4 tetrahedron to FeO6 octahedron, and the FeO6 octahedron becomes the photocatalytic reduction site. The introduction of more FeO6 octahedral active sites enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO2.







Abstract
Solid solutions are garnering substantial attention in the realm of solar energy utilization due to their tunable electronic properties, encompassing band edge positions and charge&#8208;carrier mobilities. In this study, we designed and synthesized Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 (0&lt;x&#8804;0.6) as a photocatalyst for CO2 conversion using H2O. Careful optical and photo/electrochemical characterizations unveiled that the relative content of CoGa2O4 and ZnFe2O4 not only substantially influences light absorption in the full solar spectrum but also modulates valence and conduction band positions. We thoroughly assessed the photocatalytic activity of Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 and found that when x=0.35, the solid&#8208;solution catalyst achieved a remarkable CO2 reduction rate to CH4 and CO (31.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Furthermore, this optimized solid&#8208;solution catalyst demonstrated impressive photostability. Characterization and DFT calculations revealed that the formation of a solid solution not only reduces the band gap and promotes the separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs to accelerate efficient CO2 photoreduction, but also the introduction of more FeO6 octahedral active sites in Co1&#8208;xZnxFe2xGa2&#8211;2xO4 solid solutions enhanced the effective photoreduction of CO2. This design results in high conversion efficiencies for producing solar fuels through CO2 reduction with H2O.

         <title>Indenoannulated Tridecacyclene: An All&#8208;Carbon Seven&#8208;Stage Redox&#8208;Amphoter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indenoannulated tridecacyclene, an unprecedented saddle&#8208;shaped non&#8208;benzenoid nanocarbon, has been synthesized. Under electrochemical conditions, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events facilitated by the aromatic stabilization provided by the non&#8208;benzenoid subunits in the charged states. Chemical oxidation and reduction afforded the corresponding dication and dianion, which were comprehensively characterized both in experiment and theory.







Abstract
We disclose an indenoannulated tridecacyclene comprising a central cyclooctatetraene moiety with multiple adjacent pentagonal rings which is accessible in a concise synthetic sequence. The saddle&#8208;shaped geometry of the non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic scaffold and its unique packing behavior in the solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In electrochemical studies, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events comprising five reductions and two oxidations. The dicationic and dianionic species obtained by chemical oxidation and reduction, respectively, were characterized spectroscopically in solution. Density functional theory calculations were applied to provide insights into aromaticity evolution in the respective charged species, highlighting the beneficial effect of the non&#8208;benzenoid moieties on charge stabilization

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Induced Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Binaphthyl&#8208;Bridged Tetrathiapyrenophanes</title>

         <dc:description>
D2&#8208;symmetric (R)&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes with thioether linkers exhibited the temperature&#8208;induced sign inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The peculiar excitation dynamics responsible for the inversion was revealed; the pyrenes form a kinetically trapped left&#8208;handed twist excimer at low temperatures, while they form a thermodynamically favored right&#8208;handed twist excimer at high temperatures.







Abstract
D2&#8208;symmetric (R)&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;bridged pyrenophanes containing thioether bonds were synthesized. The pyrenophanes exhibited the temperature&#8208;induced sign inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) while maintaining the emission wavelength and reversibility. The &#916;glum value reached 0.02, and the FL quenching by heat was negligible. The sign inversion of CPL originates from the inversion of intramolecular excimer chirality associated with excitation dynamics. The two pyrenes form a kinetically trapped left&#8208;handed twist excimer at low temperatures, while they form a thermodynamically favored right&#8208;handed twist excimer at high temperatures. The thioether linkers can impart flexibility suitable for the inversion of chirality of the excimers.

         <title>Control of Kinetic Pathways toward Supramolecular Chiral Polymorphs for Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

The chiral and amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dye (S)&#8208;1 exhibits kinetic&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly pathways toward three supramolecular polymorphs with distinct nanomorphologies and chiroptical properties. Temporal control of the kinetic transformation process from Agg. B to Agg. C leads to aggregate mixtures consisting of different ratios of Agg. B and Agg. C that show wavelength&#8208;tunable circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
An amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dye (S)&#8208;1 bearing two chiral hydrophilic side chains with S&#8208;stereogenic centers was synthesized. This dye exhibited kinetic&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly pathways and supramolecular chiral polymorphism properties in MeOH/H2O (9/1, v/v) mixed solvent. The (S)&#8208;1 monomers first aggregated into a kinetic controlled, off&#8208;pathway species Agg. A, which was spontaneously transformed into an on&#8208;pathway metastable aggregate (Agg. B) and subsequently into the thermodynamic Agg. C. The three aggregate polymorphs of dye (S)&#8208;1 displayed distinct optical properties and nanomorphologies. In particular, chiral J&#8208;aggregation characteristics were observed for both Agg. B and Agg. C, such as Davydov&#8208;split absorption bands (Agg. B), extremely sharp and intense J&#8208;band with large bathochromic shift (Agg. C), non&#8208;diminished fluorescence upon aggregation, as well as strong bisignated Cotton effects. Moreover, the AFM and TEM studies revealed that Agg. A had the morphology of nanoparticle while fibril or rod&#8208;like helical nanostructures with left&#8208;handedness were observed respectively for Agg. B and Agg. C. By controlling the kinetic transformation process from Agg. B to Agg. C, thin films consisting of Agg. B and Agg. C with different ratios were prepared, which displayed tunable CPL with emission maxima at 788&#8211;805&#8197;nm and g&#8208;factors between &#8722;4.2&#215;10&#8722;2 and &#8722;5.1&#215;10&#8722;2.

         <title>Utility of Triethyloxonium Tetrafluoroborate for Chloride Removal during Sarcosine N&#8208;Carboxyanhydride Synthesis: Improving NCA Purity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate enables efficient chloride removal during sarcosine N&#8208;carboxyanhydride synthesis allowing the controlled amine&#8208;initiated ring opening polymerization. This approach can avoid sublimation or other intensive purification of NCAs and NNCAs easing the synthesis of polypeptides, polypeptoids, and polypeptp(o)ides.







Abstract
The clinical translation of polysarcosine (pSar) as polyethylene glycol (PEG) replacement in the development of novel nanomedicines creates a broad demand of polymeric material in high&#8208;quality making high&#8208;purity sarcosine N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (Sar&#8208;NCA) as monomer for its production inevitable. Within this report, we present the use of triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate in Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis with focus on amino acid and chloride impurities to avoid the sublimation of Sar&#8208;NCAs. With a view towards upscaling into kilogram or ton scale, a new methodology of monomer purification is introduced by utilizing the Meerwein's Salt triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate to remove chloride impurities by covalent binding and converting chloride ions into volatile products within a single step. The novel straightforward technique enables access to monomers with significantly reduced chloride content (&lt;100&#8197;ppm) compared to Sar&#8208;NCA derived by synthesis or sublimation. The derived monomers enable the controlled&#8208;living polymerization in DMF and provide access to pSar polymers with Poisson&#8208;like molecular weight distribution within a high range of chain lengths (Xn 25&#8211;200). In conclusion, the reported method can be easily applied to Sar&#8208;NCA synthesis or purification of commercially available pSar&#8208;NCAs and eases access to well&#8208;defined hetero&#8208;telechelic pSar polymers.

         <title>Replacement of Toxic Hydrazines in Satellite Propulsion with Greener Dinitramide&#8208;Based Energetic Ionic Liquid Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazine&#8208;free liquid ionic candidate formulations for satellite propulsion have been identified and prepared. They are based on the dinitramide anion, which is environmentally more benign. An initial library of 37 ammonium dinitramides was first weened to 3 candidates, from which only one was retained that has acceptable sensitivities and melting point.







Abstract
Satellite propulsion uses liquid mono or bi&#8208;propellants composed of a hydrazine in combination with a strong oxidant. However, hydrazines are highly toxic. As a result, many research efforts for more environmentally compatible propellants have been made over the past decade. In this study we evidence green formulations that retain high propulsive performances. They are based on the dinitramide anion. From an initial library of 37 ammonium dinitramides 3 best candidates were selected after evaluation of their potential syntheses, calculated theoretical performances, experimental synthesis optimizations and decomposition temperatures. These three salts were then formulated to obtain acceptable sensitivities and melting points, which eventually led to only one formulation being retained: a 40&#8201;:&#8201;60 mixture of dimethylammonium dinitramide and ammonium dinitramide phlegmatized by 10&#8201;% of glycerol.

         <title>Mono&#8208;Ortho&#8208;Beryllated Carbodiphosphoranes: Synthesis, Structure, Bonding and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synopsis: Mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllated carbodiphosphoranes, which feature a double dative Be=C bond, have been synthesised. The bonding situation in these complexes was elucidated computationally, while their reactivity was investigated experimentally.







Abstract
The reaction of organoberyllium compounds with hexaphenylcarbodiphosphorane yields mono&#8208;ortho&#8208;beryllated complexes, which feature a double dative Be=C bond. The bonding situation in these compounds together with a simple carbodiphosphorane and an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene adduct was analysed with energy decomposition analysis in combination with natural orbital for chemical valence as well as with quantum theory of atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synopsis&lt;/b&gt;: Mono-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-beryllated carbodiphosphoranes, which feature a double dative Be=C bond, have been synthesised. The bonding situation in these complexes was elucidated computationally, while their reactivity was investigated experimentally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of organoberyllium compounds with hexaphenylcarbodiphosphorane yields mono-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-beryllated complexes, which feature a double dative Be=C bond. The bonding situation in these compounds together with a simple carbodiphosphorane and an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene adduct was analysed with energy decomposition analysis in combination with natural orbital for chemical valence as well as with quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules. Furthermore, the driving forces accountable for mono-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-beryllation were elucidated along with the reactivity of the Be=C bond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wireless Light&#8208;Emitting Electrode Arrays for the Evaluation of Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct visualization of the catalytic activity of electrode materials, represented by the labelled metal plates, via an array of light&#8208;emitting diodes, is symbolized by glowing eyes. Integrated into a bipolar electrochemical set&#8208;up, depicted by the &#948;&#8722; and &#948;+ polarization, such a system allows the efficiency of the anodic and cathodic catalysts for water splitting to be evaluated in a single image. The result is an instantaneous optical readout of catalytic information, complementary to classic electrochemical techniques. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Kuhn, G. Salinas and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400078).

         <title>A Photoswitchable Metallocycle Based on Azobenzene: Synthesis, Characterization, and Ultrafast Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spot on the first azobenzene&#8208;based metallocycle that reversibly undergoes photoisomerization without disassembly! The cover feature illustrates the reversible switching between the (E,E) and (Z,Z) isomers of [Cu2(3,3&#8217;&#8208;azobenz(metPA)2](BF4)2. The electronic spectra reflect the unique combination of femtosecond UV/Vis transient absorption in solution and femtosecond pump&#8211;probe photodissociation in the gas phase, which were used to characterize the primary switching dynamics. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Riehn, R. Diller, S. Becker and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400205).

         <title>Morphological Transformations of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein Biocondensates Mediated by Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8242;s nucleocapsid protein/RNA biocondensates with antimicrobial peptides is an effective strategy to block or slow down RNA transcription, thus preventing virions&#8217; assembly. Our biophysical results illustrate how peptides can modify the dynamics and morphology of such droplets. Depending on the peptides&#8217; characteristics, which regulate their partitioning into the droplets, various effects have been observed, including droplet clustering and the formation of fibrillar aggregates. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Oliva, R. Winter and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400048).

         <title>Temperature Control of the Self&#8208;Assembly Process of 4&#8208;Aminoquinoline Amphiphile: Selective Construction of Perforated Vesicles and Nanofibers, and Structural Restoration Capability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly process of the 4&#8208;aminoquinoline (4&#8208;AQ)&#8208;based amphiphile in neutral buffer can be temperature controlled. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) is important, and the selective construction of perforated vesicles or nanofibers is achieved by heating the same 4&#8208;AQ amphiphile to 80&#8201;&#176;C (&gt;LCST) or 60&#8201;&#176;C (&lt;LCST) and then cooling it to room temperature.

         <title>Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Dibromopyrene as Precursor of 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 8&#8208;Substituted Long&#8208;Axially Symmetric Pyrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pyrene derivatives bearing substituents at positions 1, 3, 6, and 8 find numerous applications, as exemplified by their use in lasers, sensors, and bioimaging probes. However, these derivatives typically have point&#8208;symmetric or short&#8208;axially symmetric structures, whereas long&#8208;axially symmetric derivatives remain underexplored because of the difficulty in obtaining their precursor, 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene. To address this problem, we herein synthesized 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene from 1&#8208;methoxypyrene in an overall yield (71% over four steps) considerably exceeding those of existing methods. 1,3&#8208;Dibromopyrene was converted into 13OPA, a long&#8208;axially symmetric pyrene dye with electron&#8208;donor (alkoxy) groups at positions 1 and 3 and electron&#8208;acceptor (formyl) groups at positions 6 and 8. 13OPA exhibited photophysical properties distinct from those of its point&#8208;symmetric and short&#8208;axially symmetric isomers, featuring a broad and strongly redshifted absorption, strong fluorescence with reduced sensitivity to protic solvents, and small dipole moment change upon photoexcitation. The derivatization of 13OPA into a Schiff base and its functionalization via Lewis acid&#8211;base pairing were also demonstrated. Thus, our work expands the design scope of pyrene&#8208;based molecules, particularly those used as emitters.</dc:description>

The derivatization of 13OPA into a Schiff base and its functionalization via Lewis acid&#8211;base pairing were also demonstrated. Thus, our work expands the design scope of pyrene-based molecules, particularly those used as emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advanced Insulin Synthesis by One&#8208;pot/Stepwise Disulfide Bond Formation Enabled by S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An advanced insulin synthesis is presented that utilizes one&#8208;pot/stepwise disulfide bond formation enabled by acid&#8208;activated S&#8208;protected cysteine sulfoxides in the presence of chloride anion. S&#8208;chlorocysteine generated from cysteine sulfoxides reacts with an S&#8208;protected cysteine to afford S&#8208;sulfenylsulfonium cation, which then furnishes the disulfide or reversely returns to the starting materials depending on the S&#8208;protection employed and the reaction conditions. Use of S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys(Acm)) and its sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) selectively give the disulfide under weak acid conditions in the presence of MgCl2 even if S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl cysteine (Cys(MBzl)) and its sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) are also present. In contrast, the S&#8208;MBzl pair yields the disulfide under more acidic conditions in the presence of a chloride anion source. These reaction conditions allowed a one&#8208;pot insulin synthesis. Additionally, lipidated insulin was prepared by a one&#8208;pot disulfide&#8208;bonding/lipidation sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>The Characterization of Multifaceted PREP1 Peptides Provides Insights into Correlations between Spectroscopic and Structural Properties of Amyloid&#8208;like Assemblies.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The widespread ability of proteins and peptides to self&#8208;assemble by forming cross&#8208;&#946; structure is one of the most significant discoveries in structural biology. Intriguingly, the cross&#8208;&#946; association of proteins/peptides may generate intricate supramolecular architectures with uncommon spectroscopic properties. We have recently characterized self&#8208;assembled peptides extracted from the PREP1 protein that are endowed with interesting structural/spectroscopic properties. We here demonstrate that the green fluorescence emission of the peptide PREP1[117&#8208;132] (&#955;em ~ 520 nm), can be induced by excitation with UV radiation. The associated unusually large Stokes shift (&#916;&#955; ~ 150 nm) represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of an internal resonance energy transfer in amyloid&#8208;like structures, where the blue emission of some assemblies becomes the excitation radiation for others. Moreover, the characterization of PREP1[117&#8208;132] variants provides insights into the sequence/structure and structure/spectroscopic properties relationships. Our data suggests that the green fluorescence is plausibly associated with antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet states of the peptide whereas parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies are only endowed with blue fluorescence. Notably, the different PREP1[117&#8208;132] variants also form assemblies characterized by distinct morphologies. Indeed, the parent peptide and single mutants form compact but structured aggregates whereas most of the double mutants exhibit elongated and highly extended fibers.</dc:description>

         <title>KpsS1 Mediates the Glycosylation of Pseudaminic Acid in Acinetobacter Baumannii</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pseudaminic acid (Pse) is found in the polysaccharide structures of the cell surface of various Gram&#8208;negative pathogenic bacteria including Acinetobacter baumannii and considered as an important component of cell surface glycans including oligosaccharides and glycoproteins. However, the glycosyltransferase that is responsible for the Pse glycosylation in A. baumannii remains unknown yet. In this study, through comparative genomics analysis of Pse&#8208;positive and negative A. baumannii clinical isolates, we identified a potential glycosyltransferase, KpsS1, located right downstream of the Pse biosynthesis genetic locus. Deletion of this gene in an Pse&#8208;positive A. baumannii strain, Ab8, impaired the glycosylation of Pse to the surface CPS and proteins, while the gene knockout strain, Ab8&#916;kpsS1, could still produce Pse with 2.86 folds higher amount than that of Ab8. Furthermore, impairment of Pse glycosylation affected the morphology and virulence potential of A. baumannii, suggesting the important role of this protein. This study will provide insights into the further understanding of Pse in bacterial physiology and pathogenesis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Heterogeneous interface and defect engineering offer effective pathways to accelerate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) charge transfer kinetics and motivate optimal intrinsic catalytic activity. Herein, we report the lattice&#8208;matched NiO/NiFe2O4 heterostructure with ample oxygen vacancies (Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4) induced by a feasible hydrothermal followed by calcination and plasma&#8208;engraving assistant technique, which shows the unique porous microflower arrangement of intertwined nanosheets. Benefitting from the synergetic effects between lattice&#8208;matched heterointerface and oxygen vacancies induce the strong electronic coupling, optimized OH&#8211;/O2 diffusion pathway and ample active sites, thus&#8208;prepared Vo&#8208;NiFe2O4 presents a favorable OER performance with a low overpotential (261 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8211;2) and small Tafel slope (39.4 mV dec&#8211;1), even surpassing commercial RuO2 catalyst. Additionally, the two&#8208;electrode configuration water electrolyzer and rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery assembled by Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4 catalyst show the potential practical application directions. This work provides an innovative avenue for strengthening OER performance toward water electrolysis and Zn&#8208;air batteries via the interface and vacancy engineering strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Role of Central Metals in Bulky Phthalocyanines for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two series of metallo&#8208;(Zn(II), Mg(II), and Ru(II)) and free&#8208;base phthalocyanines (Pcs) with a carboxyl anchoring group and well&#8208;established bulky peripheral substituents (either tert&#8208;butyl or bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy) were synthesized and tested as sensitizers in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The trend of photovoltaic efficiencies (PCEs) for free&#8208;base and metallo Pcs followed the order Zn(II)Pc &gt; Mg(II)Pc &gt;&gt; H2Pc &#8776; Ru(II)Pc regardless of the peripheral substitution. Higher efficiencies (4.95 versus. 3.63 for the Zn(II) derivatives) were achieved with Pcs bearing the bulkier 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy group, indicating a lower aggregation and more suitable HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels. Furthermore, these derivatives showed a more relevant influence of the metal on the PCE (from the highest value of 4.95 for the Zn(II)Pc to the lowest value of 0.23 for the Ru(II)Pc. In both series, the best PCEs observed with the Zn(II) derivatives were mainly due to their highest Jsc values. The lowest efficiencies found for the free&#8208;bases and Ru(II) derivatives were attributed to a mismatch between their LUMO levels and the conduction band of the TiO2 and lower light&#8208;harvesting capabilities, respectively. In conclusion, Zn(II) derivatives are still the best Pc candidates to use as sensitizers in molecular photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>Wavelength Dependent Activation of Photoacids and Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacids and bases allow remote control over pH in reaction solutions, which is of fundamental importance to an array of applications. Herein, we evaluate the wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength photoreactivity of triarylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate salts as a representative photoacid and p&#8208;(benzoyl)benzyl triethylammonium tetraphenylborate as a photobase, constructing a wavelength&#8208;resolved photochemical action plot for each of the compounds. We monitor the pH change of the solution on&#8208;line within the cavity of the laser vial and demonstrate a marked mismatch between the absorption spectrum of the photoacid and base with the photochemical action plot, unveiling reactivity at extremely low absorptivities. Our findings are of critical importance for the use of photoacids and bases, unambiguously demonstrating that absorption is no guide to chemical reactivity with critical consequences for the wavelength employed in applications of photoacids and bases.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Construction of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Emission for Tumor Visualization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with ordered &#960; structures are very promising in porous light&#8208;emitting materials. However, most of these COFs are either poor in luminescence or lack of water&#8208;stability. Herein, a series of isostructural D&#8208;A vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were constructed based a new D2h symmetric linker 1,4&#8208;bis(4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TMTA) with high crystallinity, comparative high surface area and excellent chemical/thermal stability. Impressively, their adsorption and luminescence wavelength vary with respect to the density of &#960;&#8208;systems in the electron&#8208;donating group, which constitute the foundation for molecular engineering the luminescent properties of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs. The DFT calculations further established the relationship between the luminescence properties and the donor electronic structure. Moreover, one of representative COF named FZU&#8208;203 showed inspiring applications in bioimaging, which may further provide strategic guidance for the use of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs as fluorescent nanoprobes in non&#8208;invasive medical diagnosis and visualization therapy of tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Cyclic Trimer of a Chiral Spirosilabifluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chiral shape&#8208;persistent macrocyclic compound (Si&#8208;[3]), designed by the C/Si substitution in the spiro&#8208;atom of spirobifluorene in the cyclic trimer (C&#8208;[3]), has been successfully synthesized in this study. The C/Si substitution made the spiro&#8208;conjugation and energy levels of HOMO and LUMO decrease. Due to the silicon substitution, the macrocyclic compound Si&#8208;[3] was able to be degraded by fluoride ions, but its reaction rate was slower than that of the unsubstituted spirosilabifluorene, showing the chemical stability of Si&#8208;[3]. Furthermore, the chiroptical properties of Si&#8208;[3] with D3&#8208;symmetric macrocyclic structure were investigated, and (M,M,M)&#8208;Si&#8208;[3] showed high emission quantum yield (&#934;f = 80%) and moderate dissymmetry factor of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) (glum,exp = &#8722;1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3). According to the the time&#8208;dependent density&#8208;functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT)&#160;calculations using polarizable continuum model (PCM), the bright CPL from Si&#8208;[3] was explained by a planarization of one bisilafluorenyl moiety at the excited state, which is responsible for the almost fully&#8208;allowed radiative transition with a short emission lifetime of tf = 1.89 ns.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Domino Reactions at an Imidazole Relay Control the Oxidation of a TyrZ&#8208;His190 Artificial Mimic of Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A close mimic of P680 and the TyrosineZ&#8208;Histidine190 pair in photosystem II (PS II) has been synthesized using a ruthenium chromophore and imidazole&#8208;phenol ligands. The intramolecular oxidation of the ligands by the photoproduced Ru(III) species is characterized by a small driving force, very similar to PS II where the complexity of kinetics was attributed to the reversibility of electron transfer steps. Laser flash photolysis revealed biphasic kinetics for ligand oxidation. The fast phase (&#964; &lt; 50 ns) corresponds to partial oxidation of the imidazole&#8208;phenol ligand, proton transfer within the hydrogen bond, and formation of a neutral phenoxyl radical. The slow phase (5 &#8208; 9 &#181;s) corresponds to full oxidation of the ligand which is kinetically controlled by deprotonation of the distant 1&#8208;nitrogen of the imidazolium. These results show that imidazole with its two protonatable sites plays a special role as a proton relay in a &#8216;proton domino&#8217; reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Basic Ligands and Alkenes on the Regioselectivity of C&#8722;H Additions of Tertiary Amines to Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of several types of tertiary amines with alkenes have been achieved by the use of imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato scandium(III) alkyl complexes. The basic ligand, a coordinating THF in the catalyst and the substitution of alkene substrates enabled to switch the regioselectivity of the C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines.







Abstract
Highly regioselective C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines and tertiary alkyl amines with simple alkenes have been achieved by the use of imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato scandium alkyl complexes. This protocol provided an efficient and atom&#8208;economical route to structurally diverse tertiary amine derivatives. The basic ligand, a coordinating THF in the catalyst and the substitution of alkene substrates were found to switch the regioselectivity of the C&#8722;H alkylation reactions of tertiary anilines presumably due to the generation of different types of catalytically active species or the formation of relatively stable intermediates. On the basis of the deuterium labeling experiments and KIE experiments, possible catalytical cycles were provided to understand the reaction mechanism as well as the regioselectivity.

         <title>Iridium Pyridylpyrrolides Hyperpolarised by Para&#8208;Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions with para&#8208;hydrogen (p&#8208;H2) dramatically enhance nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals. We explore the possibilities of a ligand new to this field, pyridylpyrrolides. These complexes display highly reversible hydrogen activation and repeatable hyperpolarisation in a variety of solvents, without the reduction of alkene ligands. Ligand functional group modifications reveal an untapped potential chemical scope for the development of hyperpolarisation catalysts.







Abstract
Chemical activation of the nuclear singlet state of dihydrogen, para&#8208;hydrogen, can dramatically increase the sensitivity of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. Here, we show that the highly reversible activation of para&#8208;hydrogen by an iridium pyridylpyrrolide complex is capable of producing this hyperpolarisation effect. Bound alkene ligands exhibit signal enhancement without reduction to alkanes, which is in contrast to the most widely used hyperpolarisation catalysts. The complex is recoverable due to the highly reversible binding and release of H2, and result in enhanced hydride signals in a wide range of coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating deuterated solvents. Synthetic modification of the ligand substituents and the addition of co&#8208;ligands show a strong dependence of chemical structure on reactivity, which reveals an untapped potential to exploit pyridylpyrrolides as ligands in the development of tunable para&#8208;hydrogen induced hyperpolarisation catalysts or molecular probes.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;catalyzed Intramolecular Hydrosilylation of Alkynes: Embracing Conventional and Electrochemical Routes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation can be efficiently achieved with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities through two distinct methodologies. The first approach utilizes a conventional method, involving the reduction of nickel salt (NiBr2&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) using manganese metal. The second method employs a one&#8208;step electrochemical reaction, utilizing the sacrificial anode process and NiBr2bipy catalysis. Both methods yield silylated heterocycles in good to high yields through a&#160;syn&#8208;exo&#8208;dig&#160;cyclization process. Control experiments and molecular electrochemistry (cyclic voltammetry) provided further insights into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Solution Behavior of Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Complexes with Tripodal&#160;N&#8208;Donor Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of multiple rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal complexes (Ln = Y, La, Ce, Sm, Lu) using tripodal&#160;N&#8208;donor ligands, which offer the key advantage of featuring only C, H, O and N elements, facilitating incineration to recover the metal. The structural properties of the Ln3+&#160;complexes were investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction, revealing that the ligands form complexes with a 1:1 ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratio, with two of the three triflate anions coordinated to the metal centers in all cases. The coordination of the third triflate anion was found to be variable, as supported by various NMR spectroscopic investigations. Additionally, transitioning from the previously reported tris(hydrazonyl)thiophosphanyl (SP)&#8208;based ligand system to the herein reported tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl) amine (tren)&#8208;anchored ligand system enhanced flexibility, resulting in improved encapsulation of the lanthanide ions. Competition studies between the two systems revealed selective coordination of the lutetium ion with the more flexible system. Thus, enhancing the flexibility of the ligand systems used for extraction has the potential to increase their efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Xanthene&#8208;Based Dyes for Photoacoustic Imaging and Their Use as Analyte&#8208;Responsive Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing imaging tools that can report on the presence of disease&#8208;relevant analytes in multicellular organisms can provide insight into fundamental disease mechanisms as well as provide diagnostic tools for the clinic. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a light&#8208;in, sound&#8208;out imaging technique that allows for high resolution, deep&#8208;tissue imaging with applications in pre&#8208;clinical and point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings. The continued development of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing small&#8208;molecule dyes promises to improve the capabilities of this emerging imaging modality. For example, new dye scaffolds bearing chemoselective functionalities are enabling the detection and quantification of disease&#8208;relevant analytes through activity&#8208;based sensing (ABS) approaches. Recently described strategies to engineer NIR absorbing xanthenes have enabled development of analyte&#8208;responsive PAI probes using this classic dye scaffold. Herein, we present current strategies for red&#8208;shifting the spectral properties of xanthenes via bridging heteroatom or auxochrome modifications. Additionally, we explore how these strategies, coupled with chemoselective spiroring&#8208;opening approaches, have been employed to create ABS probes for in vivo detection of hypochlorous acid, nitric oxide, copper (II), human NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase isozyme 1, and carbon monoxide. Given the versatility of the xanthene scaffold, we anticipate continued growth and development of analyte&#8208;responsive PAI imaging probes based on this dye class.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
A series of near&#8208;IR&#8208;absorbing 2,6&#8208;diarylated aza&#8208;BDP derivatives with various electron donors is designed, synthesized, and characterized. The impact of diverse electron donor substitutions on the photophysical properties is examined through steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, electrochemical analyses, time&#8208;resolved nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectroscopy, and theoretical computations.







Abstract
A series of near&#8208;IR absorbing 2,6&#8208;diarylated BF2&#8208;chelated aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BDPs) derivatives bearing different electron donors (benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, phenothiazine and carbazole) were designed and synthesized. The effect of different electron donor substitutions on the photophysical properties was studied by steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, electrochemical, time&#8208;resolved nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and theoretical computations. The UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra of AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ and AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#955;abs=710&#8197;nm in toluene) showed a bathochromic absorption profile compared with the reference AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#955;abs=685&#8197;nm in toluene), indicating the non&#8208;negligible electronic interaction at the ground state between donor and acceptor moieties. Moreover, the fluorescence is almost completely quenched for AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ/AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (fluorescence quantum yield, &#934;F=0.2&#8211;0.7&#8201;% in toluene) as compared with the AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#934;F=27&#8201;% in toluene). However, the apparent intersystem crossing ability of these compounds is poor, based on the singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;=0.3&#8211;1.5&#8201;%). The ns&#8208;TA spectral study showed typical Bodipy localized triplet state transient features, short&#8208;lived excited triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#964;T=53.2&#8197;&#956;s) versus significantly long&#8208;lived triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#964;T=114 &#956;s) was observed under deaerated experimental conditions. These triplet state lifetimes are much longer than that obtained with diiodoAzaBDP (intramolecular heavy atom effect, &#964;T=1.5~7.2&#8197;&#956;s). These information are useful for molecular structure design of triplet photosensitizers, for which longer triplet state lifetimes are usually desired. Theoretical computations displayed that the triplet state is mainly localized on the AzaBDP core, moreover, it was found that the HOMO/LUMO energy gap decreased after introducing donor moieties to the skeleton as compared with the reference.

         <title>CO2 Photoreduction Over Semiconducting 2D Materials with Supported Single Atoms: Recent Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting 2D materials with supported single atoms combine the advantages of 2D structures with single&#8208;atom catalysts, offering increased light absorption, enhanced charge separation and transfer, electron localization at active sites, improved reactant adsorption and activation, etc. This review highlights their significant potential and recent advancements in CO2 photoreduction, while also identifying key challenges and delineating future research directions.







Abstract
In the face of the growing energy crisis and environmental challenges, substantial efforts are now directed toward sustainable clean energy as a replacement for traditional fossil fuels. CO2 photoreduction into value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is widely recognized as a promising approach to mitigate current energy and environmental concerns. Photocatalysts comprising single atoms (SAs) supported on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials (SAs&#8208;2DSemi) have emerged as a novel frontier due to the combined merits of SA catalysts and 2D materials. In this study, we review advancements in metal SAs confined on 2DSemi substrates, categorized into four groups: (1) metal oxide&#8208;based, (2) g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based, (3) emerging, and (4) hybridized 2DSemi, for photocatalytic CO2 conversion over the past few years. With a particular focus on highlighting the distinct advantages of SAs&#8208;2DSemi, we delve into the synthesis of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts, their catalytic performances, and mechanistic elucidation facilitated by experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. Following this, we outline the challenges in this field and offer perspectives on harnessing the potential of SAs&#8208;2DSemi as promising photocatalysts. This comprehensive review aims to provide valuable insights for the future development of 2D photocatalytic materials involving SAs for CO2 reduction.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoinduced Generation of Aryl Radical and Applications: Generation of aryl radicals under photosensitized, photoinitiated, and direct or indirect photoredox&#8208;catalyzed conditions are reviewed. The utilization of aryl radicals in various reactions is demonstrated with examples.







Abstract
Photoinduced aryl radical generation is a powerful strategy in organic synthesis that facilitates the formation of diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds. The synthetic applications of photoinduced aryl radical formation in the synthesis of complex organic compounds, including natural products, physiologically significant molecules, and functional materials, have received immense attention. An overview of current developments in photoinduced aryl radical production methods and their uses in organic synthesis is given in this article. A generalized idea of how to choose the reagents and approach for the generation of aryl radicals is described, along with photoinduced techniques and associated mechanistic insights. Overall, this article offers a critical assessment of the mechanistic results as well as the selection of reaction parameters for specific reagents in the context of radical cascades, cross&#8208;coupling reactions, aryl radical functionalization, and selective C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl substrates.

         <title>Identification of the Cirratiomycin Biosynthesis Gene Cluster in Streptomyces Cirratus: Elucidation of the Biosynthetic Pathways for 2,3&#8208;Diaminobutyric Acid and Hydroxymethylserine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cirratiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in Streptomyces cirratus by genome sequencing and gene inactivation. The biosynthesis of two nonproteinogenic amino acids was elucidated: (2S,3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid (DABA) is synthesized from threonine by four enzymes, CirQ, CirR, CirS and CirB, and &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine (HMSer) is synthesized from d&#8208;serine by CirH.







Abstract
Cirratiomycin, a heptapeptide with antibacterial activity, was isolated and characterized in 1981; however, its biosynthetic pathway has not been elucidated. It contains several interesting nonproteinogenic amino acids, such as (2S,3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid ((2S,3S)&#8208;DABA) and &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine, as building blocks. Here, we report the identification of a cirratiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces cirratus. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that several Streptomyces viridifaciens and Kitasatospora aureofaciens strains also have this cluster. One S. viridifaciens strain was confirmed to produce cirratiomycin. The biosynthetic gene cluster was shown to be responsible for cirratiomycin biosynthesis in S. cirratus in a gene inactivation experiment using CRISPR&#8208;cBEST. Interestingly, this cluster encodes a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) composed of 12 proteins, including those with an unusual domain organization: a stand&#8208;alone adenylation domain, two stand&#8208;alone condensation domains, two type II thioesterases, and two NRPS modules that have no adenylation domain. Using heterologous expression and in&#8197;vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes, we revealed the biosynthetic pathway of (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA: (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA is synthesized from l&#8208;threonine by four enzymes, CirR, CirS, CirQ, and CirB. In addition, CirH, a glycine/serine hydroxymethyltransferase homolog, was shown to synthesize &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine from d&#8208;serine in&#8197;vitro. These findings broaden our knowledge of nonproteinogenic amino acid biosynthesis.

         <title>A General Concept for the Electronic and Steric Modification of 1&#8208;Metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes: A Case Study of Group 4 Metallocene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes were prepared from suitable organolithium precursors. The effect of introduction of phenyl groups was studied using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. For the first time cyclic voltammetry, EPR, and solid state NMR spectroscopy were used to support structural and DFT data.







Abstract
The synthesis of group 4 metal 1&#8208;metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes as organometallic analogues of elusive 1,2&#8208;cyclobutadiene has so far been limited to SiMe3 substituted examples. We present the synthesis of two Ph substituted dilithiated ligand precursors for the preparation of four new 1&#8208;metallacyclobuta&#8208;2,3&#8208;dienes [rac&#8208;(ebthi)M] (M=Ti, Zr; ebthi=1,2&#8208;ethylene&#8208;1,10&#8208;bis(&#951;5&#8208;tetrahydroindenyl)). The organolithium compounds [Li2(RC3Ph)] (1&#8201;b: R=Ph, 1&#8201;c: R=SiMe3) as well as the metallacycles of the general formula [rac&#8208;(ebthi)M(R1C3R2)] (2&#8201;b: M=Ti, R1=R2=Ph, 2&#8201;c: M=Ti, R1=Ph, R2=SiMe3; 3&#8201;b: M=Zr, R1=R2=Ph; 3&#8201;c: M=Zr, R1=Ph, R2=SiMe3) were fully characterised. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and quantum chemical bond analysis of the Ti and Zr complexes reveal ligand influence on the biradicaloid character of the titanocene complexes. X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy of structurally similar Ti complexes [rac&#8208;(ebthi)Ti(Me3SiC3SiMe3)] (2&#8201;a), 2&#8201;b, and 2&#8201;c was carried out to evaluate the accessibility of an EPR active triplet state. Cyclic voltammetry shows that introduction of Ph groups renders the complexes easier to reduce. 13C CPMAS NMR analysis provides insights into the cause of the low field shift of the resonances of metal&#8208;bonded carbon atoms and provides evidence of the absence of the &#946;&#8722;C&#8722;Ti interaction.

         <title>64Cu tumor labeling with hexadentate picolinic acid&#8208;based bispidine immunoconjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional chelators based on bispidine picolinates allow rapid and efficient labeling with the positron emitter Cu&#8208;64 under mild conditions. The resulting 64CuII&#8208;labeled bispidine complexes exhibit high in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo stability. Isothiocyanate functionalization of bispidine picolinates in C9 position enables efficient coupling to targeting vector molecules. After 64CuII&#8208;labeling of target modules, tumor visualization by PET with high target&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio is obtained.







Abstract
Discussed are two picolinate appended bispidine ligands (3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane derivatives) in comparison with an earlier described bis&#8208;pyridine derivative, which are all known to strongly bind CuII. The radiopharmacological characterization of the two isomeric bispidine complexes includes quantitative labeling with 64CuII at ambient conditions with high radiochemical purities and yields (molar activities &gt;200&#8197;MBq/nmol). Challenge experiments in presence of EDTA, cyclam, human serum and SOD demonstrate high stability and inertness of the 64Cu&#8208;bispidine complexes. Biodistribution studies performed in Wistar rats indicate a rapid renal elimination for both 64Cu&#8208;labeled chelates. The bispidine ligand with the picolinate group in N7 position was selected for further biological experiments, and its backbone was therefore substituted with a benzyl&#8208;NCS group at C9. Two tumor target modules (TMs), targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), overexpressed in prostate cancer, and the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in fibrosarcoma, were selected for thiourea coupling with the NCS&#8208;functionalized ligand and lysine residues of TMs. Small animal PET experiments on tumor&#8208;bearing mice showed specific accumulation of the 64Cu&#8208;labeled TMs in PSCA&#8208; and FAP&#8208;overexpressing tumors (standardized uptake value (SUV) for PC3: 2.7&#177;0.6 and HT1080: 7.2&#177;1.25) with almost no uptake in wild type tumors.

The bispidine ligand with the picolinate group in N7 position was selected for further biological experiments, and its backbone was therefore substituted with a benzyl-NCS group at C9. Two tumor target modules (TMs), targeting prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), overexpressed in prostate cancer, and the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in fibrosarcoma, were selected for thiourea coupling with the NCS-functionalized ligand and lysine residues of TMs. Small animal PET experiments on tumor-bearing mice showed specific accumulation of the &lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Cu-labeled TMs in PSCA- and FAP-overexpressing tumors (standardized uptake value (SUV) for PC3: 2.7&#177;0.6 and HT1080: 7.2&#177;1.25) with almost no uptake in wild type tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Increasing Dimensionality in Self&#8208;Assembly: Toward Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different approaches to attain 2D supramolecular polymers, following both a thermodynamic or a kinetic regime, are reviewed. The examples of 2D supramolecular polymers showed in this review demonstrate the utility of this strategy to achieve new 2D materials with biased morphologies and showing elegant applications.







Abstract
Different approaches to achieve 2D supramolecular polymers, as an alternative to the covalent bottom&#8208;up approaches reported for the preparation of 2D materials, are reviewed. The significance of the operation of weak non&#8208;covalent forces to induce a lateral growth of a number of self&#8208;assembling units is collected. The examples of both thermodynamically and kinetically controlled formation of 2D supramolecular polymers showed in this review demonstrate the utility of this strategy to achieve new 2D materials with biased morphologies (nanosheets, scrolls, porous surfaces) and showing elegant applications like chiral recognition, enantioselective uptake or asymmetric organic transformations. Furthermore, elaborated techniques like seeded or living supramolecular polymerizations have been demonstrated to give rise to complex 2D nanostructures.

         <title>Push&#8208;Pull Bis&#8208;Norbornadienes for Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ray of sunlight absorbed by a solution will be stored and later released as heat energy. The norbornadiene derivatives designed and studied in this work swirl around the flask like autumn leaves symbolizing the cyclic nature of molecular solar thermal energy storage; and as leaves turn red in autumn, so the absorption of these molecular switches is redshifted. The natural setting reflects the ultimate goal of providing a new, renewable way of storing energy, thereby protecting the environment and the climate.

         <title>Nucleic Acid&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Cationic Styryl Dyes in Vitro and in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a novel nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction between quaternized heteroaromatic and cationic aldehyde substrates, styryl dye libraries were successfully generated under mild conditions, and their optical properties information was simultaneously obtained. This powerful strategy, which is applicable both in&#8197;vitro and in living cells, enables the rapid discovery of styryl dyes with desirable characteristics that may find a broad range of biological applications.







Abstract
A novel method for synthesizing cationic styryl dyes through a nucleic acid&#8208;templated reaction has been developed. This approach overcomes issues associated with traditional synthesis methods, such as harsh conditions, low throughput, and wasteful chemicals. The presence of a nucleic acid template accelerated the styryl dye formation from quaternized heteroaromatic and cationic aldehyde substrates. These styryl dyes show remarkable optical properties change when bound to nucleic acids, hence the success of the synthesis could be readily monitored in&#8197;situ by UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and the optical properties data were also observable at the same time. This method provides the desired products from a broad range of coupling partners. By employing different substrates and templates, it is possible to identify new dyes that can bind to a specific type of nucleic acid such as a G&#8208;quadruplex. The templated dye synthesis is also successfully demonstrated in live HeLa cells. This approach is a powerful tool for the rapid synthesis and screening of dyes specific for diverse types of nucleic acids or cellular organelles, facilitating new biological discoveries.

         <title>A Family of Hexacopper Phenylsilsesquioxane/Acetate Complexes: Synthesis, Solvent&#8208;Controlled Cage Structures, and Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexacopper phenylsilsesquioxane/acetate complex exhibits high catalytic activity in (i) oxygenations of hydrocarbons, (ii) Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone, and (iii) tandem oxidation/Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation reaction, leading to lactone directly from cyclohexane







Abstract
Convenient self&#8208;assembly synthesis of copper(II) complexes via double (phenylsilsesquioxane and acetate) ligation allows to isolate a family of impressive sandwich&#8208;like cage compounds. An intriguing feature of these complexes is the difference in the structure of a pair of silsesquioxane ligands despite identical (Cu6) nuclearity and number (four) of acetate fragments. Formation of particular combination of silsesquioxane ligands (cyclic/cyclic vs condensed/condensed vs cyclic/condensed) was found to be dependent on the synthesis/crystallization media. A combination of Si4&#8208;cyclic and Si6&#8208;condensed silsesquioxane ligands is a brand new feature of cage metallasilsesquioxanes. A representative Cu6&#8208;complex (4) (with cyclic silsesquioxanes) exhibited high catalytic activity in the oxidation of alkanes and alcohols with peroxides. Maximum yield of the products of cyclohexane oxidation attained 30&#8201;%. The compound 4 was also tested as catalyst in the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone by m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid: maximum yields of 88&#8201;% and 100&#8201;% of &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone were achieved upon conventional heating at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 4&#8197;h and MW irradiation at 70 or 80&#8201;&#176;C during 30&#8197;min, respectively. It was also possible to obtain the lactone (up to 16&#8201;% yield) directly from the cyclohexane via a tandem oxidation/Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation reaction using the same oxidant.

         <title>Electronic Control of Polyproline II Helix Stability via the Identity of Acyl Capping Groups: the Pivaloyl Group Particularly Promotes PPII</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The type II polyproline helix (PPII) is a fundamental secondary structure of proteins. PPII is stabilized in part by n&#174;p* interactions between consecutive carbonyls, via electron delocalization between an electron&#8208;donor carbonyl lone pair (n) and an electron&#8208;acceptor carbonyl (p*) on the subsequent residue. We previously demonstrated that changes to the electronic properties of the acyl donor can predictably modulate the strength of n&#174;p* interactions, with data from model compounds, in solution in chloroform, in the solid state, and computationally. Herein, we examined whether the electronic properties of acyl capping groups could modulate the stability of PPII in peptides in water. In X&#8211;PPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides (X = 10 acyl capping groups), the effect of acyl group identity on PPII was quantified by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Electron&#8208;rich acyl groups promoted PPII relative to the standard acetyl (Ac&#8208;) group, with the pivaloyl and iso&#8208;butyryl groups most significantly increasing PPII. In contrast, acyl derivatives with electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents and the formyl group relatively disfavored PPII. Similar results, though lesser in magnitude, were also observed in X&#8211;APPGY&#8208;NH2 peptides, indicating that the capping group can impact PPII conformation at both proline and non&#8208;proline residues. The pivaloyl group was particularly favorable in promoting PPII.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrosilylation of olefins activated on highly Lewis&#8208;acidic calcium cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The report introduces simple yet highly reactive calcium salt, Ca[Al(ORF)4]2 (RF = C(CF3)3), 1, which effectively catalyses olefin hydrosilylation through an unusual mechanism involving the activation of the alkene molecule. Upon dissolution in o&#8208;difluorobenzene (oDFB), 1 forms a highly Lewis acidic [Ca(oDFB)6]2+ complex. Our DFT calculations reveal that fluoride ion affinity is comparable to SbF5. Reactivity tests show that it effectively catalyses the hydrosilylation of olefins with high regioselectivity, also in reactions involving sterically demanding substrates like (iPr)3SiH or tetrasubstituted olefins. Experimental and computational results point to the mechanism where the olefin molecule forms a complex with Ca2+, which significantly facilitates the attack of H&#8208;SiR3 on the C=C double bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Studying Cation Exchange in {Cr7Co} Pseudorotaxanes: Preparatory Studies for Hybrid Molecular Machines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the design of dynamic supramolecular systems used in molecular machines, it is important to understand the binding preferences between the macrocycle and stations along the thread. Here, we apply&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy to investigate the relative stabilities of a series of linear alkylammonium templated pseudorotaxanes with the general formula [H2NRR&#8217;][Cr7CoF8(O2CCH2tBu)16] by exchanging the cation in solution. Our results show that the pseudorotaxanes are able to exchange threads via a dissociative mechanism. The position of equilibrium is dependent upon the ammonium cation and solvent used. Short chain primary ammonium cations are shown to be far less favourable macrocycle stations than secondary ammonium cations. Collision&#8208;induced dissociation mass spectrometry (CID&#8208;MS) has been used to look at disassembly of the pseudorotaxanes in a solvent&#8208;free environment and stability trends compared to those in acetone&#8208;d6. The energy needed to induce 50% of the precursor ion loss (E50) is used shows a similar trend to the equilibria measured by NMR. The relative stabilities of these hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes are different to those of host&#8208;guest compounds involving crown ethers and this may be valuable for the design of molecular machines.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Behaviour and Redox Potentials of Dyes in Aqueous Buffers and Protic Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic dyes hold promise as inexpensive electrochemically&#8208;active building blocks for new renewable energy technologies such as redox&#8208;flow batteries and dye&#8208;sensitised solar cells, especially if they display high oxidation and/or low reduction potentials in cheap, non&#8208;flammable solvents such as water or protic ionic liquids. Systematic computational and experimental characterisation of a representative selection of acidic and basic dyes in buffered aqueous solutions and propylammonium formate confirm that quinoid&#8208;type mechanisms impart electrochemical reversibility for the majority of systems investigated, including quinones, fused tricyclic heteroaromatics, indigo carmine and some aromatic nitrogenous species. Conversely, systems that generate long&#8208;lived radical intermediates &#8208;&#8208; arylmethanes, hydroquinones at high pH, azocyclic systems &#8208;&#8208; tend to display irreversible electrochemistry, likely undergoing ring&#8208;opening, dimerisation and/or disproportionation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Peri&#8208;alkylated terrylenes and ternaphthalenes building&#8208;blocks towards multi&#8208;edge nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since its first synthesis by Clar in 1948, terrylene &#8208; a fully connected ternaphthalene oligomer via naphthalene&#8217;s peri&#8208;positions &#8208; has gained special focus within the rylene family, drawing interest for its unique chemical, structural, optoelectronic and single photon emission properties. In this study, we introduce a novel synthetic pathway that enhances the solubility of terrylene derivatives through complete peri&#8208;alkylation, while also facilitating extensions at the bay&#8208;positions. This approach not only broadens the scope of terrylene&#8217;s chemical versatility but also opens new avenues for developing solution processable novel multi&#8208;edge nanographenes and tailoring electronic energy levels through topological edge structures. Our findings include a comprehensive structural and spectroscopic characterization which include transient absorption spectroscopy and photophysics of both the synthesized peri&#8208;alkylated terrylene and its phenylene&#8208;fused derivative.</dc:description>

         <title>Ambiguous Faces of Water&#8208;Based Inclusion Compounds: L4(4)8(8) Intercalato&#8208;Clathrate Hydrate of Pt(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clathrate hydrates are among the most intensively studied H&#8208;bond inclusion compounds. Despite the broad definition for this class of compounds, their meaning commonly refers to closed polyhedral nanocages that encapsulate small guest molecules. On the other hand, larger solutes enforce another type of encapsulation because of the solute size effect. Herein, we report a series of structures containing various molecules encapsulated by intercalated water layers constructed of polycyclic moieties of L4(4)8(8) topology. We parametrized the corrugation of individual layers and characterized interactions governing their formation. We suggested which could be categorized as two&#8208;dimensional clathrates based on the character of intra&#8208;layer interactions and effects observed between entrapped molecules and water&#8208;based intercalators.</dc:description>

A dynamic halogen bonding multi&#8208;station [2]rotaxane displays a selective optical response to chloride over bromide and iodide anions. Chloride binding induces a translocation of the isophthalamide&#8208;functionalised macrocycle from the naphthalene diimide (NDI) stations to the halogen bonding station, leading to a reduction in the donor&#8208;acceptor charge&#8208;transfer absorption arising from macrocycle&#8208;NDI interactions, whereas the larger halides are excluded from the interlocked cavity.







Abstract
The first example of a [2]rotaxane shuttle capable of selective optical sensing of chloride anions over other halides is reported. The rotaxane was synthesised via a chloride ion template&#8208;directed cyclisation of an isophthalamide macrocycle around a multi&#8208;station axle containing peripheral naphthalene diimide (NDI) stations and a halogen bonding (XB) bis(iodotriazole) based station. Proton NMR studies indicate the macrocycle resides preferentially at the NDI stations in the free rotaxane, where it is stabilised by aromatic donor&#8208;acceptor charge transfer interactions between the axle NDI and macrocycle hydroquinone moieties. Addition of chloride ions in an aqueous&#8208;acetone solvent mixture induces macrocycle translocation to the XB anion binding station to facilitate the formation of convergent XB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl&#8722; and hydrogen bonding HB&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl&#8722; interactions, which is accompanied by a reduction of the charge&#8208;transfer absorption band. Importantly, little to no optical response was induced by addition of bromide or iodide to the rotaxane, indicative of the size discriminative steric inaccessibility of the interlocked cavity to the larger halides, demonstrating the potential of using the mechanical bond effect as a potent strategy and tool in chloride&#8208;selective chemo&#8208;sensing applications in aqueous containing solvent environments.

&lt;p&gt;A dynamic halogen bonding multi-station [2]rotaxane displays a selective optical response to chloride over bromide and iodide anions. Chloride binding induces a translocation of the isophthalamide-functionalised macrocycle from the naphthalene diimide (NDI) stations to the halogen bonding station, leading to a reduction in the donor-acceptor charge-transfer absorption arising from macrocycle-NDI interactions, whereas the larger halides are excluded from the interlocked cavity.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Pyrazoles via Manganese Pincer Complex Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This report detailed the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted pyrazoles through the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) reaction catalyzed by a well&#8208;defined manganese(I)&#8208;pincer complex. Symmetrically substituted pyrazoles were synthesized by reacting 1,3&#8208;diols with hydrazines. Unsymmetrically substituted pyrazoles were selectively made via the ADC of primary alcohols with methyl hydrazones. Water and hydrogen are liberated as the green byproducts. The endurance of these methodologies has been presented by producing 30 substrates with varied functionalities. Model reactions were scaled up to demonstrate practicability. The reaction rate and order were measured to transparent the involvement of the reagents during catalysis. Control experiments elucidated the plausible reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Afterglow Performance of Phenylenevinylene&#8208;Based Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles Doped with Photosensitizers Containing Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is usually believed that doping with photosensitizers capable of generating singlet oxygen (1O2) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the afterglow performance of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs). However, the effect of doping photosensitizer bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups&#160;has not been reported. Here we report the effect of doping with six photosensitizers possessing different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the afterglow performance of SPNs using poly[(9,9&#8208;di(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluo&#8208;rene&#8208;2,7&#8208;vinylene)&#8208;co&#8208;(1&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyloxy)&#8208;2,5&#8208;phenylenevinylene)] (PF&#8208;MEHPPV) as substrate. It was found that the afterglow performance of SPNs was significantly influenced by doping with photosensitizers bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. For the doped photosensitizers with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, the stronger the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the group, the worse of the afterglow performance of the SPN regardless of the 1O2&#160;generation ability of the photosensitizer. When the doped photosensitizer exhibited weak or none electron&#8208;withdrawing effect, the 1O2 generation ability of the photosensitizer played a dominant role on the afterglow performance of the SPNs. This work deepens the understanding of the design and synthesis of SPNs with different afterglow properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Flexdispersion: Structure&#8211;Function Relationship Studies of Organic Amphiphilic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since inorganic nanoparticles have unique properties that differ from bulk materials, their material applications have attracted attention in various fields. In order to utilize inorganic nanoparticles for functional materials, they must be dispersed without agglomeration. Therefore, the surfaces of inorganic nanoparticles are typically modified with organic ligands to improve their dispersibility. Nevertheless, the relationship between the tail group structure in organic ligands and the dispersibility of inorganic nanoparticles in organic solvents remains poorly understood. We previously developed amphiphilic ligands that consist of ethylene glycol chains and alkyl chains to disperse inorganic nanoparticles in a variety of organic solvents. However, the structural requirements for amphiphilic ligands to &#8220;flexibly&#8221; disperse nanoparticles in less polar to polar solvents are still unclear. Here, we designed and synthesized several phosphonic acid ligands for structure&#8210;function relationship studies of flexdispersion. Dynamic light scattering analysis and visible light transmittance measurements revealed that the ratio of alkyl/ethylene glycol chains in organic ligands alone does not determine the dispersibility of the nanoparticles in organic solvents, but the arrangement of the individual chains also has an effect. From a practical application standpoint, it is preferable to design ligands with ethylene glycol chains on the outside relative to the particle surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonothermal Synthesis and Solid&#8208;State NMR Study of the Imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The imidonitridosilicate Rb3Si6N5(NH)6, being only the second representative of this compound class, was synthesized ammonothermally at 870 K and 230 MPa. Its crystal structure was solved from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The imidonitridosilicate crystallizes isotypically with the respective potassium compound in space group P4132 with the lattice parameter a = 10.9422(4) &#197; forming a three&#8208;dimensional imidonitridosilicate tetrahedra network with voids for the rubidium ions. The structure model and the presence of the imide groups were verified by Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) and magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, using cross polarization 15N{1H} and 29Si{1H} MAS NMR experiments. Rb3Si6N5(NH)6 represents a possible intermediate during the ammonothermal synthesis of nitridosilicates. The characterization of these intermediates improves the understanding of the reaction pathway from ammonothermal solutions to nitrides. Thus, the ammonothermal synthesis is an alternative approach to the well&#8208;established high&#8208;temperature synthesis leading to the compound class of nitridosilicates.</dc:description>

         <title>Pronounced Self&#8208;Induced Diastereomeric Anisochronism in Anisidine Amino Acid Diamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergent properties resulting from selective supramolecular interactions are of significant importance for materials and chemical systems. For the directed use of such properties, a fundamental understanding of the interaction mechanism and the resulting mode of function is necessary for a tailored design. The self&#8208;induced diastereomeric anisochronism effect (SIDA), which occurs in the intermolecular interaction of chiral molecules, generates unique properties such as chiral self&#8208;recognition and nonlinear effects. Here we show that anisidine amino acid diamides lead to extraordinary signal splitting in NMR spectra through supramolecular interaction and homochiral self&#8208;recognition. By systematic experiments we have investigated the underlying SIDA effect, explored its limits and finally successfully utilized it in the determination of enantiomeric ratios by NMR spectroscopy of chiral &#8216;SIDA&#8208;inactive&#8217; compounds such as thalidomide.</dc:description>
