         <title>Germylenes Exhibiting Solid&#8208;State Emissions that Extend to NIR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;valent main group compounds that fluoresce in the solid&#8208;state were previously unknown. To address this, we investigated room&#8208;temperature photoluminescence from a series of crystals of germylenes 3&#8208;8 in this article; they exhibited emissions nearly reaching the NIR. Germylene carboxylates (3&#8208;8) were synthesized by reacting dipyrromethene&#8208;stabilized germylene pyrrolide (2) with carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, benzoic acid, p&#8208;cyanobenzoic acid, p&#8208;nitrobenzoic acid, and acetylsalicylic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of hierarchical CdS/NiS photocatalysts using Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 as template for efficient ethanol conversion and hydrogen production under visible light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conversion of ethanol into high&#8208;valuable chemicals and H2 by photocatalytic process provides a sustainable approach to produce carbon&#8208;chain&#8208;prolonged chemicals and hydrogen energy. In this article, Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 was added to fabricate the hierarchical CdS/NiS&#8208;N composites with an elevated specific surface area during the hydrothermal synthesis of CdS microsphere, and the Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 facilitate the self&#8208;assemble growth of CdS and provide a source of Ni for the formation of NiS. The as&#8208;prepared photocatalyst was subjected to photocatalytic ethanol conversion, and the hierarchical composite material CdS/NiS&#8208;N (100) formed by adding 100mg of Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity and stability in an ethanol aqueous solution with a water content of 10%. Under visible light irradiation, the conversion rate of ethanol reached 15.2% at the photocatalytic reaction of 5h. The selectivity of 2,3&#8208;butanediol(2,3&#8208;BDO) was 25%, and the selectivity of acetaldehyde(AA) was 63%. Through various characterizations, it has been proven that a large specific surface area and the coupling interface between CdS and NiS are key factors in improving photocatalytic performance. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing photocatalysts with coupled cocatalysts/semiconductors and large specific surface areas.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitchable Azoheteroarene&#8208;Based Chelating Ligands: Light Modulation of Properties, Aqueous Solubility and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the design and synthesis of eight photoswitchable phenylazopyridine&#8208; and phenylazopyrazole&#8208;based molecular systems as light&#8208;controllable chelation&#8208;type ligands. Besides the studies on fundamental photoisomerization behaviour, the ligands were also screened for light&#8208;tuneable properties such as photochromism, phase transition, and solubility especially in the aqueous medium. This investigation demonstrates how the modulation of aqueous solubility can be achieved through photoisomerization and can further be utilized toward controlling the amount of catalytically active Cu(I) species in the homogeneous aqueous conditions. Through this approach, light control over the catalytic activity was achieved for Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions, along with a partial recovery of the catalytically active species.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation Behavior of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane formed aggregation structures under the appropriate conditions, as was clearly observed for the first time. Detailed study of this phenomenon revealed that [3]rotaxane aggregated with hexagonal packing owing to hydrogen bond formation among CD units, in a manner similar to polyrotaxane species. This aggregation could be controlled by solvent type upon dispersion, through the axle end structures, and by modification of CD. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Akae and P. Theato (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301582).

         <title>Cyclotrimerization Approach to Symmetric [9]Helical Indenofluorenes: Diverting Cyclization Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic cyclotrimerization (Rh, Co, and Ni catalysts) of triyne 1 gives rise preferentially to [9]helical indenofluorene, whereas it thermal cyclization gives rise to polyaromatic hydrocarbon 3. The former reaction proceeds via classical alkyne cyclotrimerization, the latter via dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction accompanied by unusual C&#8722;C cleavage. DFT calculations shed light on the course of the reaction.







Abstract
Catalytic cyclotrimerization routes to symmetrical [9]helical indenofluorene were explored by using different transition&#8211;metal complexes and thermal conditions. Depending on the reaction conditions, the cyclotrimerizations were accompanied by dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction giving rise to another type of aromatic compounds. Structures of both symmetrical [9]helical cyclotrimerization product as well as the dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder product were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Limits of enantioselective cyclotrimerization were assessed as well. DFT calculations shed light on the reaction course and the origin of diminished enantioselectivity.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Helical Azaheptalene and Chiroptical Switching of an Isolable Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a ballet studio, azaheptalene with M helicity is dancing in front of a mirror. The molecule reflected in the mirror shows a novel azaheptalene with opposite P helicity, and the large torsion angle is described by the dynamic jumping molecule. Its attractive and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties are expressed rhythmically. This cover implies that the azaheptalene is now ready to come under the big spotlight. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Ishigaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301759).

         <title>A Versatile Route to Acyl (MIDA)Boronates.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular approach to highly functional acyl (MIDA)boronates is described. It involves the generation of the hitherto unknown radical derived from acetyl (MIDA)boronate and its capture by various alkenes, including electronically unbiased, unactivated alkenes. In contrast to the anion of acetyl (MIDA)boronate, which has not so far been employed in synthesis, the corresponding radical is well behaved and readily produced from the novel &#945;&#8208;xanthyl acetyl (MIDA)boronate. This shelf&#8208;stable, easily prepared solid is a convenient acyl (MIDA)boronate transfer agent that provides a direct entry to numerous otherwise inaccessible structures, including latent 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl derivatives that can be transformed into B(MIDA) substituted pyrroles and furans. A competition experiment indicated the acyl (MIDA)boronate substituted radical to be more stable than the all&#8208;carbon acetonyl radical but somewhat less reactive in additions to alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Soluble Cyclic Organoalanes Based on Anionic Dicarbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbocyclic aluminium hydrides [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 are readily accessible as crystalline solids on treatment of anionic dicarbenes Li(ADCAr) with LiAlH4. Hydroalumination of CO2 (and other organic substrates) with [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 has been shown to access [(ADCPh)Al(OCH(O))2]2 (and other products).







Abstract
Cyclic organoalane compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 (ADCAr = ArC{(DippN)C}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; Ar = Ph or 4&#8208;PhC6H4 (Bp)) based on anionic dicarbene (ADC) frameworks have been reported as crystalline solids. Treatments of Li(ADCAr) with LiAlH4 at room temperature afford [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 with the concomitant release of LiH. Compounds [(ADCAr)AlH2]2 are stable crystalline solids and are freely soluble in common organic solvents. They are annulated tricyclic compounds with an almost planar central C4Al2&#8208;core embedded between two peripheral 1,3&#8208;imidazole (C3N2) rings. At room temperature, [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 readily reacts with CO2 to form two&#8208; and four&#8208;fold hydroalumination products [(ADCPh)AlH(OCHO)]2 and [(ADCPh)Al(OCHO)2]2, respectively. Further hydroalumination reactivity of [(ADCPh)AlH2]2 has been shown with isocyanate (RNCO) and isothiocyanate (RNCS) species (R=alkyl or aryl group). All compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>The Unified Redox Scale for All Solvents: Consistency and Gibbs Transfer Energies of Electrolytes from their Constituent Single Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Consistent: The unified redox scale 
 is valid for all solvents. Still, the existence of their widely used constituents, the single ion properties &#8211; redox potential or pH value &#8211; are disputed. Yet, the sum of the single ion Gibbs transfer energy of electroactive cation and anion must equal the Gibbs transfer energy of the constituting salt, which is measurable without any assumption. With the recently proposed &#8216;ideal&#8217; ILSB&#8208;method to determine Gibbs transfer energies of single ions, we now show that this condition is fulfilled. Hence, our simple electrochemical method yields consistent single&#8208;ion magnitudes proving the validity of the assembled unified redox scale.







Abstract
We have devised the unified redox scale EabsH2O, which is valid for all solvents. The necessary single ion Gibbs transfer energy between two different solvents, which only can be determined with extra&#8208;thermodynamic assumptions so far, must clearly satisfy two essential conditions: First, the sum of the independent cation and anion values must give the Gibbs transfer energy of the salt they form. The latter is an observable and measurable without extra&#8208;thermodynamic assumptions. Second, the values must be consistent for different solvent combinations. With this work, potentiometric measurements on silver ions and on chloride ions show that both conditions are fulfilled using a salt bridge filled with the ionic liquid [N2225][NTf2]: if compared to the values resulting from known pKL values, the silver and chloride single ion magnitudes combine within a uncertainty of 1.5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 to the directly measurable transfer magnitudes of the salt AgCl from water to the solvents acetonitrile, propylene carbonate, dimethylformamide, ethanol, and methanol. The resulting values are used to further develop the consistent unified redox potential scale EabsH2O that now allows to assess and compare redox potentials in and over six different solvents. We elaborate on its implications.

         <title>Free Ethynylarsinidene and Ethynylstibinidene: Heavier Analogues of Nitrenes and Phosphinidenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet ethynylarsinidene (HCCAs) and ethynylstibinidene (HCCSb) were generated photochemically in argon matrices from their corresponding pnictines. Electronic structures of these species are compared with HCCN and HCCP in light of their vibrational and electronic spectra and with support from theory.







Abstract
Until now, there has been very little experimental evidence for the existence of free arsinidenes and stibinidenes, apart from the hydrides, AsH and SbH. Here, we report on photogeneration of triplet ethynylarsinidene, HCCAs, and triplet ethynylstibinidene, HCCSb, from ethynylarsine and ethynylstibine, respectively, in solid argon matrices. The products were identified using infrared spectroscopy and the associated UV absorption spectra are interpreted with the aid of theoretical predictions.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Characterization of Palladium&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework and Its Application as Heterogeneous Catalysis for C&#8722;H Arylation of Azoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework with high thermal and chemical stabilities has been prepared and used as heterogeneous ligand to immobilize PdII. The resulting Pd&#8208;bound COF was found to be an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the C&#8722;H arylation of azoles and aryl halides with high recyclability.







Abstract
A novel triazine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TFPT&#8208;Bz COF) has been constructed by the condensation of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinoxy)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TFPT) and benzidine (BZ) with deep eutectic solvent (DES) as the reaction medium. After the introduction of Pd ions through strong coordination to TFPT&#8208;Bz COF matrix, the constructed TFPT&#8208;Bz COF/Pd composite exhibited excellent catalytic activity for C&#8722;H arylation of azoles with aryl halides in 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran. The protocol allows the arylation of a variety of substituted azoles with diverse aryl halides in high to excellent yield. Moreover, the TFPT&#8208;Bz COF/Pd catalyst can be recycled several times without significantly reducing its activity.

         <title>Corrosion Engineering towards NiFe&#8208;Layered Double Hydroxide Macroporous Arrays with Enhanced Activity and Stability for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiFe&#8208;LDH macroporous arrays are prepared by a controllable corrosion strategy. The unique macroporous array not only increases the active area, but also creates a stable nanostructure. The catalysts only need 180&#8197;mV and 248&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER, respectively, and remain highly stable for 1000&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH) is the benchmark catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, however, it is still challenging to improve its activity and stability. Herein, NiFe&#8208;LDH macroporous array electrodes are demonstrated to significantly enhance the activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction. The electrodes are fabricated by the chemical and electrochemical corrosion process of Ni foam induced by ferric nitrate, hydrochloric acid and oxygen. By optimizing the amount of iron salt and acid and selecting the appropriate reaction temperature and time, the NiFe&#8208;LDH electrodes only need the overpotential of 180&#8197;mV and 248&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, and remain highly stable for 1000&#8197;h at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The unique macroporous array not only significantly increases the active area of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalyst, but also creates a stable nanostructure that avoids severe reconstruction.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Derived Cu&#8722;Ag Interface for Selective Carbon Monoxide Electroreduction to Acetate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8208;modified CuMOF&#8208;74 (Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74) has been synthesized for highly selective CO electroreduction with Faradaic efficiency for C2+ products up to 90.4&#8201;% and an acetate Faradaic efficiency of 61.1&#8201;%. The introduction of Ag to CuMOF&#8208;74 is beneficial to create abundant excellent Cu&#8722;Ag interface sites, in which the adsorption of key intermediates is optimized and the C&#8722;C coupling is promoted, thus favoring the formation of acetate.







Abstract
Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) is a potential way to obtain high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. However, achieving high selectivity to acetate is still a challenge. Herein, we develop a two&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8208;modified Cu metal&#8211;organic framework (Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74) that demonstrates Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2+ products up to 90.4&#8201;% at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an acetate FE of 61.1&#8201;% with a partial current density of 122.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Detailed investigations show that the introduction of Ag on CuMOF&#8208;74 favors the generation of abundant Cu&#8722;Ag interface sites. In situ attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy confirms that these Cu&#8722;Ag interface sites improve the coverage of *CO and *CHO and the coupling between each other and stabilize key intermediates *OCCHO and *OCCH2, thus significantly promoting to the acetate selectivity on Ag0.10@CuMOF&#8208;74. This work provides a high&#8208;efficiency pathway for CORR to C2+ products.

         <dc:description>
The cover illustrates that the monoselective deuteration of diiodomethane mediated by lithium carbenoid is enabled by a flow microreactor. The monodeuterated diiodomethane obtained was used for the protection of catechols and Matteson&#8208;type homologation to generate single deuterium&#8208;labelled molecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Nagaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301738).

         <dc:description>Irreversible two&#8208;photon photorearrangement of 1,2&#8208;diarylethenes is a unique process providing access to complex 2a1,5a&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dithiaacenaphthylene (DDA) heterocyclic core. This reaction was serendipitously discovered during studies on photoswitchable diarylethenes and was initially considered as a highly undesired process. However, in recent years, it has been recognized as an efficient photochemical reaction, interesting by itself and as a promising synthetic method for the synthesis of challenging molecules. Herein, we discuss the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in studies on this notable process.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering to Boost the Photo&#8208;oxidase Activity of Molecular Rotors in Colorimetric Sensing of Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Some organic dyes and photosensitizers with strong visible absorption can behave as photo&#8208;responsive oxidase mimics. However, the relationship between the photo&#8208;oxidase activity and molecular structure remains unclear to date. In this work, a new type of photosensitizer with the characteristics of molecular rotors, namely DPPy, served as the molecular scaffold for further investigation. To adjust the photocatalytic oxidation ability, DAPy and CBPy were designed and synthesized based on the enhancement and diminishment of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, respectively. Kinetic studies revealed that DAPy and CBPy both exhibited highly efficient photo&#8208;activated oxidase&#8208;like activity with 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as the substrate, which were in good accordance with their molecular engineering to promote either type I or type II reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Impressively a colorimetric method based on the visible light induced oxidase&#8208;like activity of molecular rotors was developed to determine the environmental temperature for the first time. Both DAPy and CBPy showed distinct sensitivities toward temperature as compared with several molecular rotors based on the typical fluorimetric detection. This work provides a new strategy for the application of molecular rotors to overcome the non&#8208;emissive challenge in temperature sensing.</dc:description>

London dispersion (LD) interactions, which stem from long&#8208;range electron correlations arising from instantaneously induced dipoles can occur between neighboring atoms or molecules, for example, between H atoms within ligand C&#8722;H groups. These interactions are currently of interest as a new method of stabilizing long bonds and species with unusual oxidation states. They can also limit reactivity by installing LD enhanced groups into organic frameworks or ligand substituents. Here, we address the most recent advances in the design of LD enhanced ligands, the sterically counterintuitive structures that can be generated and the consequences that these interactions can have on the structures and reactivity of sterically crowded heavy group&#8197;14 species.

         <title>Tuning Mechanically Interlocked Molecules to Recognize Anions and Cations: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anions and cations develop several roles in nature. Thus, compounds capable to interact with ions show large relevancy. Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) appear as potential candidates to perform efficient ionic recognition. Here, DFT calculations have been realized to elucidate and tune the MIM&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;(anion and/or cation) chemical bonds and compare them with the acyclic/cyclic molecular structures&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;(anion and/or cation) interactions.







Abstract
Ions appear as active components in diverse materials. Here, the bonding energy between mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) or their acyclic/cyclic molecular derivatives and i) Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; ions and/or ii) Na+ and K+ ions, have been investigated. The chemical environment provided by MIMs is less preferably to recognize ionic species compared to unconstrained interactions that are furnished by acyclic molecules. However, MIMs can be more adequate structures for ionic recognition than cyclic compounds if a chemical arrangement of the bond sites that relevantly support more favorable interactions with ions compared to Pauli repulsive ambient is provided. The hydrogen replacement by electron donor (&#8722;NH2) or acceptor (&#8722;NO2) groups in MIMs favors the anion/cation recognition due to decreased Pauli repulsion energy and/or more attractive non&#8208;covalent bonds. This study clarifies the chemical environment provided by MIMs to interact with ions and highlights these molecules as relevant structures to realize ionic sensing.

         <title>Insight into the Structural and Emissive Behavior of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Americium(III) Formate Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported is the synthesis and characterization of a novel three&#8208;dimentional americium(III) formate coordination polymer, which features unique C3v site symmetry and atypical emission behavior. Rationalization of inner sphere bonding and unusual optical properties is supported by theoretical QTAIM and NLMO calculations.







Abstract
We report the structural, vibrational, and optical properties of americium formate (Am(CHO2)3) crystals synthesized via the in&#8197;situ hydrolysis of dimethylformamide (DMF). The coordination polymer features Am3+ ions linked by formate ligands into a three&#8208;dimensional network that is isomorphous to several lanthanide analogs, (e.&#8201;g., Eu3+, Nd3+, Tb3+). Structure determination revealed a nine&#8208;coordinate Am3+ metal center that features a unique local C3v symmetry. The metal&#8211;ligand bonding interactions were investigated by vibrational spectroscopy, natural localized molecular orbital calculations, and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The results paint a predominantly ionic bond picture and suggest the metal&#8208;oxygen bonds increase in strength from Nd&#8722;O&lt;Eu&#8722;O&lt;Am&#8722;O. The optical properties were probed using diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence spectroscopies. Notably, the rarely reported 5D1&#8242;&#8594;7F0&#8242; emission band is observed and dominates the emission spectrum. This behavior is unusual and is attributed to the C3v coordination environment of the metal center.

         <title>Sulfonyl Diazaborine &#8216;Click&#8217; Chemistry Enables Rapid and Efficient Bioorthogonal Labeling
</title>

Here we have systematically developed and deliberated an efficient bioorthogonal reaction via the rapid formation of sulfonyl&#8208;diazaborine. The conjugation is robust to demonstrate suitable application in cancer cell imaging and treatment.







Abstract
Finding an ideal bioorthogonal reaction that responds to a wide range of biological queries and applications is of great interest in biomedical applications. Rapid diazaborine (DAB) formation in water by the reactions of ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid with &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles is an attractive conjugation module. Nevertheless, these conjugation reactions demand to satisfy stringent criteria for bioorthogonal applications. Here we show that widely used sulfonyl hydrazide (SHz) offers a stable DAB conjugate by combining with ortho&#8208;carbonyl phenylboronic acid at physiological pH, competent for an optimal biorthogonal reaction. Remarkably, the reaction conversion is quantitative and rapid (k2&gt;103&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) at low micromolar concentrations, and it preserves comparable efficacy in a complex biological milieu. DFT calculations support that SHz facilitates DAB formation via the most stable hydrazone intermediate and the lowest energy transition state compared to other biocompatible &#945;&#8208;nucleophiles. This conjugation is extremely efficient on living cell surfaces, enabling compelling pretargeted imaging and peptide delivery. We anticipate this work will permit addressing a wide range of cell biology queries and drug discovery platforms exploiting commercially available sulfonyl hydrazide fluorophores and derivatives.

         <title>[2+4] Cycloaddition Product of an Amidinate Substituted Dialumene with Toluene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transient dialumene based on an amidinate scaffold was synthesized. The complex was isolated as a cycloaddition product with toluene. The mechanism of the reaction investigated using the DFT method indicates a free energy barrier of 0.9&#8197;kcal/mol with respect to the monomeric AlI intermediate.

         <title>Unimolecular Reactivity of [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; Complexes (R=Organyl): Stepwise versus Concerted Mechanism in Copper&#8208;Mediated Trifluoromethylation</title>

         <dc:description>
A combination of gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments and quantum chemical calculations affords detailed insight into the reactivity of high&#8208;valent trifluoromethylated cuprate complexes. Depending on the nature of the organyl group R, these key intermediates of synthetically valuable trifluoromethylation reactions lose two radicals or undergo concerted reductive eliminations.







Abstract
The cuprate complexes [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; (R=organyl) offer an efficient synthetic access to valuable trifluoromethylation products RCF3. Here, electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry is used to analyze the formation of these intermediates in solution and probe their fragmentation pathways in the gas phase. Furthermore, the potential energy surfaces of these systems are explored by quantum chemical calculations. Upon collisional activation, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R=Me, Et, Bu, sBu, allyl) afford the product ions [Cu(CF3)3]&#8901;&#8722; and [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722;. The former obviously results from an R&#8901; loss, whereas the latter originates either from the stepwise release of R&#8901; and CF3&#8901; radicals or a concerted reductive elimination of RCF3. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments as well as the quantum chemical calculations indicate that the preference for the stepwise reaction toward [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; increases with the stability of the formed organyl radical R&#8901;. This finding suggests that the recombination of R&#8901; and CF3&#8901; radicals may possibly contribute to the formation of RCF3 from [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; in synthetic applications. In contrast, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R=aryl) only yield [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; when subjected to collision&#8208;induced dissociation. These species exclusively undergo a concerted reductive elimination because the competing stepwise pathway is disfavored by the low stability of aryl radicals.

         <title>Stereochemically Active Tin(II)&#8208;Induced Enhancement of Birefringence in SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new tin(II) phosphates SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2 exhibit enhanced birefringence by introducing the tin(II) ions with stereochemically active lone pairs. And in particular for SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2, the hydrogen groups facilitate more aligned Sn2+&#8208;centered oxygen polyhedra. Moreover, the UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR diffuse reflectance measurement further indicates that their cut off edges are 262 and 263&#8197;nm, which can be used as a new UV birefringent crystal.







Abstract
Two new tin(II) phosphates, SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2, were synthesized by the high&#8208;temperature solution method and hydrothermal method, respectively. Theoretical study indicates that by introducing tin(II) with stereochemical activity lone pairs (SCALP) in metal phosphates, the birefringence was enhanced, 0.048@1064&#8197;nm for SnIISnIV(PO4)2 and 0.080@1064&#8197;nm for SrSn(PO4)PO2(OH)2.

         <title>Extended Light Absorption and Improved Charge Separation by Protonation of the Organic Ligand in a Bismuth&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of the nitrogen in the thiazole ring, which acts as the organic ligand of Bi&#8208;based MOF (Bi&#8208;MMTAA), results in a pronounced redshift in light absorption. This protonation also accelerates charge separation and transfer and ultimately improves photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
In this work, a new method to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic activity of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with nitrogen&#8208;containing ligand is reported, namely, the protonation of nitrogen. Specifically, a protonated Bi&#8208;based MOF synthesized by a hydrothermal method (Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;H, MMTAA=2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;thiazoleacetic acid) displays a wider visible light absorption than Bi&#8208;MMTAA&#8208;R with the same single&#8208;crystal structure, but synthesized by a reflux method. The redshifted light absorption was confirmed to be caused by the protonation of nitrogen in the thiazolyl ring in MMTAA. Moreover, this protonation also facilitates the charge separation and transfer and improves the photocatalytic activity of selective oxidation of &#945;&#8208;terpinene to p&#8208;cymene. Our results provide a new idea for nitrogen&#8208;containing Bi&#8208;based MOFs to extend the light absorption and improve the photocatalytic performance.

Stapled peptides: The development of an i, i+7 diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy that produces &#945;&#8208;helical, protease stable, cell permeable and Raman active stapled peptides.







Abstract
Stapled peptides are a unique class of cyclic &#945;&#8208;helical peptides that are conformationally constrained via their amino acid side&#8208;chains. They have been transformative to the field of chemical biology and peptide drug discovery through addressing many of the physicochemical limitations of linear peptides. However, there are several issues with current chemical strategies to produce stapled peptides. For example, two distinct unnatural amino acids are required to synthesize i, i+7 alkene stapled peptides, leading to high production costs. Furthermore, low purified yields are obtained due to cis/trans isomers produced during ring&#8208;closing metathesis macrocyclisation. Here we report the development of a new i, i+7 diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy that addresses these issues. The asymmetric synthesis of nine unnatural Fmoc&#8208;protected alkyne&#8208;amino acids facilitated a systematic study to determine the optimal (S,S)&#8208;stereochemistry and 14&#8208;carbon diyne&#8208;girder bridge length. Diyne&#8208;girder stapled T&#8208;STAR peptide 29 was demonstrated to have excellent helicity, cell permeability and stability to protease degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that the diyne&#8208;girder constraint is a Raman chromophore with potential use in Raman cell microscopy. Development of this highly effective, bifunctional diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy leads us to believe that it can be used to produce other stapled peptide probes and therapeutics.

         <title>Steric Control over the Threading of Pyrophosphonates with One or Two Cyanostar Macrocycles during Pseudorotaxane Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over the binding stoichiometry and the threading kinetics is achieved in pseudorotaxanes comprising the anion&#8208;binding cyanostar macrocycle and organic pyrophosphonates with fine&#8208;tuned steric bulk. The approach allowed the selective assembly of [3]pseudorotaxanes and [2]pseudorotaxanes, and it provided insights that are valuable for future work on anion recognition and the design of molecular machines.







Abstract
The supramolecular recognition of anions is increasingly harnessed to achieve the self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular architectures, ranging from cages and polymers to (pseudo)rotaxanes. The cyanostar (CS) macrocycle has previously been shown to form 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes with organophosphate anions that can be turned into [3]rotaxanes by stoppering. Here we achieved steric control over the assembly of pseudorotaxanes comprising the cyanostar macrocycle and a thread that is based, for the first time, on organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates. Subtle differences in steric bulk on the threads allowed formation of either [3]pseudorotaxanes or [2]pseudorotaxanes. We demonstrate that the threading kinetics are governed by the steric demand of the organo&#8208;pyrophosphonates and in one case, slows down to the timescale of minutes. Calculations show that the dianions are sterically offset inside the macrocycles. Our findings broaden the scope of cyanostar&#8208;anion assemblies and may have relevance for the design of molecular machines whose directionality is a result of relatively slow slipping.

         <title>Electronic and Charge Transport Properties in Bridged versus Unbridged Nanohoops: Role of the Nanohoop Size</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental/theoretical investigations link the size of a nanohoop to its charge transport properties, which are key in organic electronics. the first cyclocarbazole possessing five constituting building units was synthesized and studied. Comparison of the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological and charge transport properties with those of a shorter analogue highlights the key role played by the hoop size. Corresponding cycloparaphenylenes with eight and ten phenyl units were also compared. Notably the saturated field effect mobility of the five&#8208;unit cyclocarbazole is four times higher than that of its smaller analogue.







Abstract
In the field of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanohoops, the size of the macrocycle has a strong impact on its structural characteristics, which in turn affect its electronic properties. In this work, we report the first experimental investigations linking the size of a nanohoop to its charge transport properties, a key property in organic electronics. We describe the synthesis and study of the first example of a cyclocarbazole possessing five constituting building units, namely [5]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole, [5]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz. By comparison with a shorter analogue, [4]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole, [4]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz, we detail the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological and charge transport properties, highlighting the key role played by the hoop size. In particular, we show that the saturated field effect mobility of [5]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz is four times higher than that of its smaller analogue [4]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz (4.22&#215;10&#8722;5 vs 1.04&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). However, the study of the other organic field&#8208;effect transistor characteristics (threshold voltage VTH and subthreshold slope SS) suggest that a small nanohoop is beneficial for good organization of the molecules in thin films, whereas a large one increases the density of structural defects, and hence of traps for the charge carriers. The present findings are of interest for the further development of nanohoops in electronics.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Stabilized Liquid Crystal Films Containing Dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;Based Chiral Photoswitch: Multi&#8208;Modulation for Environment&#8208;Adaptative Smart Windows</title>

         <dc:description>
An environment&#8208;adaptative smart window with multi&#8208;modulations is constructed by a dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;based chiral photoswitch. The smart window can be automatically transformed from initial transparent state to light scattering state with the changes of external ambient conditions, and can be manually switched between the opaque state and transparent state through a low electric field, which greatly satisfies the diverse requirements for daily life.







Abstract
A polymer&#8208;stabilized liquid crystal (PSLC)&#8208;based environment&#8208;adaptative smart window with multi&#8208;modulations is demonstrated. This PSLC system contains a right&#8208;handed dithienyldicyanoethene&#8208;based chiral photoswitch and a chiral dopant, S811, with opposite handedness, of which the reversible cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of the switch can drive self&#8208;shading of the smart window under UV light stimulus because of the transition from nematic phase to cholesteric one. With the assistance of solar heat, the opacity of the smart window can be deepened because the heat promotes the isomerization conversion rate of the switch. This switch has no thermal relaxation at room temperature, therefore, the smart window exhibits dual stabilization: transparent state (cis&#8208;isomer) and opaque state (trans&#8208;isomer). Moreover, the incident intensity of sunlight can be regulated by an electric field, which allows the smart window to adapt to some specific situations. Such an energy&#8208;saving device can be used in buildings and vehicles to control indoor temperature and adapt to the required ambiance.

         <title>Structural Interconversion Based on Intramolecular Boroxine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation and hydrolysis has been developed. Owing to entropic factors, a macrocyclic triboronic acid and tricyclic boroxine can be dynamically interconverted by simple heating/cooling. The entropically stabilized tricyclic boroxine also shows high stability against hydrolysis.







Abstract
A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation has been developed. A macrocyclic triboronic acid consisting of three phenylboronic acid units linked by covalent linkers preferentially underwent intramolecular rather than intermolecular boroxine formation, resulting in a quantitative formation of tricyclic boroxine. This structural transformation was accompanied by changes in the polarity, flexibility, and size of the molecule. Dynamic interconversion between the macrocyclic triboronic acid and the tricyclic boroxine was achieved by simple heating/cooling, whereas no boroxine formation occurred upon heating when three boronic acid units were not connected by linkers. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the entropic advantage of the intramolecular boroxine formation process resulted in these unique features. The entropically stabilized tricyclic boroxine also shows high stability with respect to hydrolysis.

         <title>Ionic Liquids and Electrolytes with Flexible Aromatic Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural analogous ionic liquids (ILs) and electrolytes comprising oligoether&#8208;based flexible aromatic anions offer different physicochemical properties. The designed ILs and the electrolytes are fluorine&#8208;free and have better physicochemical properties than conventional electrolytes and have a great potential to be used as electrolytes in next generation batteries, in particular those operating at elevated temperatures and with limited electrochemical stability window.







Abstract
Five new n&#8208;tetrabutylphosphonium (P4444)+ cation&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) with oligoether substituted aromatic carboxylate anions have been synthesized. The nature and position of the oligoether chain affect thermal stability (up to 330&#8201;&#176;C), phase behaviour (Tg&lt;&#8722;55&#8201;&#176;C) and ion transport. Furthermore, with the aim of application in lithium batteries, electrolytes were created for two of the ILs by 10&#8197;mol% doping using the corresponding Li&#8208;salts. This affects the ion diffusion negatively, from being higher and equal for cations and anions to lower for all ions and unequal. This is due to the stronger ionic interactions and formation of aggregates, primarily between the Li+ ions and the carboxylate group of the anions. Electrochemically, the electrolytes have electrochemical stability windows up to 3.5&#8197;V, giving some promise for battery application.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Structural analogous ionic liquids&lt;/b&gt; (ILs) and electrolytes comprising oligoether-based flexible aromatic anions offer different physicochemical properties. The designed ILs and the electrolytes are fluorine-free and have better physicochemical properties than conventional electrolytes and have a great potential to be used as electrolytes in next generation batteries, in particular those operating at elevated temperatures and with limited electrochemical stability window.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five new &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-tetrabutylphosphonium (P&lt;sub&gt;4444&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation-based ionic liquids (ILs) with oligoether substituted aromatic carboxylate anions have been synthesized. The nature and position of the oligoether chain affect thermal stability (up to 330&#8201;&#176;C), phase behaviour (T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;&#8722;55&#8201;&#176;C) and ion transport. Furthermore, with the aim of application in lithium batteries, electrolytes were created for two of the ILs by 10&#8197;mol% doping using the corresponding Li-salts. This affects the ion diffusion negatively, from being higher and equal for cations and anions to lower for all ions and unequal. This is due to the stronger ionic interactions and formation of aggregates, primarily between the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and the carboxylate group of the anions. Electrochemically, the electrolytes have electrochemical stability windows up to 3.5&#8197;V, giving some promise for battery application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The neutral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene stabilized, &#8722;N=C=S substituted bora&#8208;alkene was used as a &#960; ligand in transition metal complexes. Due to the C&#8208;nucleophilic nature of the boraalkene, it underwent regioselective hydroboration reactions with the boranes (C6F5)2BH or C6F5BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2. The latter reaction showed a subsequent hydride vs. isothiocyanate substituent exchange.







Abstract
The neutral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene stabilized bora&#8208;alkene 1, conveniently prepared by a BH borenium/hydroboration route, forms stable copper, gold or palladium &#960;&#8208;complexes. The polar bora&#8208;alkene B=C system undergoes regioselective hydroboration reactions with the (C6F5)2BH or C6F5BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 boranes. The latter reaction involves a subsequent rearrangement that leads to internal hydride vs. isothiocyanate substituent exchange at the borane pair.

         <title>Isoform&#8208;Selective Fluorescent Labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; by Acrylamide&#8208;Containing Fusicoccins</title>

14&#8208;3&#8208;3 isoforms and the elucidation of their biological roles: In vitro isoform&#8208;selective fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; was achieved by a fusicoccin derivative containing a fluorophore and a Cys&#8208;directed acrylamide group. The reaction proceeds upon ternary complex formation with mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide, which possesses i+1 aliphatic residues.







Abstract
The 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 family of proteins is central to the regulation of signaling pathways driven by serine/threonine kinases. In humans, 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 consists of seven highly conserved isoforms, yet the function of each isoform remains to be fully elucidated. Synthetic agents capable of isoform&#8208;specific fluorescent labeling of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 would provide a useful tool for studying in depth the biological roles of isoforms. In this study, the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; isoform was evaluated, which possesses a unique Cys38, and a natural product&#8208;based fluorescent labeling agent was designed by introducing an acrylamide group and a fluorescent dye to fusicoccin (FC). In vitro evaluation demonstrated that 12&#8208;hydroxy 1 and 2 exhibit 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; selective labeling activity over 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#950; in the presence of a mode&#8208;3 phospholigand. Furthermore, 2 was shown to label 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; in cell lysate in the presence of a C&#8208;terminal mode&#8208;3 phosphopeptide derived from ER&#945;, with no apparent nonspecific labeling. These results indicate that 2 is capable of selective fluorescent detection of 14&#8208;3&#8208;3&#963; upon binding to mode&#8208;3 phospholigand under biologically relevant conditions.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Stachyurin and Casuarinin Focusing on C&#8208;Glycosidic Bond Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a method for the divergent synthesis of stachyurin and casuarinin, focusing on the C&#8208;glycosidic bond reactivity. The proposed method applies to the syntheses of stachyurin and casuarinin analogues, thereby facilitating the utilization of their beneficial bioactivities.







Abstract
Stachyurin and casuarinin are ellagitannins, a class of polyphenols that exhibit various biological activities that have an impact on human health. Casuarinin is a stachyurin stereoisomer. These compounds contain the characteristic C&#8208;glycosidic bond between the open&#8208;chain d&#8208;glucose and the phenol aromatic ring. Therefore, chemical elucidation of the C&#8208;glycosidic bond reactivity is required to exploit their multiple bioactivities. This study developed a method for the divergent synthesis of stachyurin and casuarinin via the &#945;&#8208;selective C&#8208;glycosylation as well as the &#946;&#8208;selective introduction of the oxygen functional group, focusing on structural specificity. The proposed method applies to the syntheses of stachyurin and casuarinin analogues, thereby facilitating the utilisation of their beneficial bioactivities.

FeP@CoP nanorods derived from pyramidal metal organic frameworks were developed as aluminum&#8208;ion battery cathode, which displays excellent electrochemical performance and fast electron transfer kinetics.







Abstract
Anhui Provincial Engineering Laboratory for Engineering appropriate cathode materials is significant for the development of high&#8208;performance aluminum&#8208;ion (Al&#8208;ion) batteries. Here, a pyramidal metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;derived FeP@CoP composite was developed as cathode, which exhibits good stability and high capacity. FeP@CoP cathode maintains a high capacity of 168&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles, and displays a stable rate&#8208;performance at both room and low temperatures of &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C. After three rounds of rate&#8208;performance cycling, the FeP@CoP composite recovers 178.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.3&#8197;A g&#8722;1. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify improved electron&#8208;transfer kinetics with narrowed band gap and enhanced density of states. These findings inspire a broad set of studies on MOFs&#8208;derived composites for high&#8208;performance secondary batteries.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines is reported. &#955;5&#8208;Biphosphinines directly connected through a C&#8722;C bond in 4,4&#8208;position display two reversible oxidations highlighting their multi&#8208;stage redox character. In situ formed radicals are studied. Electrofluorochromism experiments revealed the potential of these intrinsically switchable electroactive fluorophores for applications as switchable materials.







Abstract
The synthesis and full characterization of a family of stable &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines connected in 4,4&#8208;position through a variety of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bridges is reported. The impact of the &#960;&#8208;bridge on the optical (absorption/emission) and redox properties was investigated using a joint experimental/theoretical approach. In contrast to the &#960;&#8208;extended ones, the &#955;5&#8208;biphosphinines directly connected through a C&#8722;C bond in 4,4&#8208;position display two easily accessible and reversible oxidations highlighting their multi&#8208;stage redox character. The in&#8197;situ formed radical cations are studied by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry and electron paramagnetic resonance. Finally, electrochemical modulation of fluorescence (electrofluorochromism) was performed and revealed the potential of these intrinsically switchable electroactive fluorophores for further applications as switchable materials.

         <title>A Feasible Strategy for a Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Over 900&#8201;nm Based on Phenalenone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel NIR TADF organic emitters, namely OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA, were first designed and compared in parallel. Neat films of OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA present real NIR emission with peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm, respectively. Encouragingly, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC&#8208;DBBPA exhibits a maximum of 0.103&#8201;% with an emission at a peak wavelength of 906&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) suffer from the low external electroluminescence (EL) quantum efficiency (EQE), which is a critical obstacle for potential applications. Herein, 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1&#8208;phenalene&#8208;2,3&#8208;dicarbonitrile (OPDC) is employed as an electron&#8208;withdrawing aromatic ring, and by incorporating with triphenylamine (TPA) and biphenylphenylamine (BBPA) donors, two novel NIR emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristics, namely OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA, are first developed and compared in parallel. Intense NIR emission peaks at 962 and 1003&#8197;nm are observed in their pure films, respectively. Contributed by the local excited (LE) characteristics in the triplet (T1) state in synergy with the charge transfer (CT) characteristics for the singlet (S1) state to activate TADF emission, the solution processable doped NIR OLEDs based on OPDC&#8208;DTPA and OPDC&#8208;DBBPA yield EL peaks at 834 and 906&#8197;nm, accompanied with maximum EQEs of 0.457 and 0.103&#8201;%, respectively, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art EL performances in the TADF emitter&#8208;based NIR&#8208;OLEDs in the similar EL emission regions so far. This work manifests a simple and effective strategy for the development of NIR TADF emitters with long wavelength and efficiency synchronously.

         <title>From Framework to Layers Driven by Pressure &#8211; The Monophyllo&#8208;Oxonitridophosphate &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 and Comparison to its &#945;&#8208;Polymorph</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the discovery of &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2:Eu2+, an oxonitridophosphate with outstanding luminescence properties is presented. Structural comparison of the &#945;&#8208;phase already known from the literature with other classes of compounds allowed a possible basic structure to be predicted, which was confirmed experimentally. This approach could be applied to other (oxo)nitridophosphates known in the literature, leading to the discovery of additional host lattices for possible luminescent properties.







Abstract
Oxonitridophosphates exhibit the potential for broad structural diversity, making them promising host&#8208;compounds in phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode applications. The novel monophyllo&#8208;oxonitridophosphate &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 was obtained by using the high&#8208;pressure multianvil technique. The crystal structure was solved and refined based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data and confirmed by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Cmme (no. 67, a=8.8109(6), b=12.8096(6), c=4.9065(3) &#197;, Z=4) and has a structure related to that of Ba2CuSi2O7. DFT calculations were performed to investigate the phase transition from &#945;&#8208; to &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2 and to confirm the latter as the corresponding high&#8208;pressure polymorph. Furthermore, the luminescence properties of Eu2+ doped samples of both polymorphs were investigated and discussed, showing blue and cyan emission, respectively (&#945;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2; &#955;max=438&#8197;nm, fwhm=46&#8197;nm/2396&#8197;cm&#8722;1; &#946;&#8208;MgSrP3N5O2; &#955;max=502&#8197;nm, fwhm=42&#8197;nm/1670&#8197;cm&#8722;1).

         <title>A Novel Nitridoborate Hydride Sr13[BN2]6H8 Elucidated from X&#8208;ray and Neutron Diffraction Data</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strontium nitridoborate hydride was prepared in a solid&#8208;state synthesis at 950&#8201;&#176;C and extends the little&#8208;known family of nitridoborate hydrides. The crystal structure was elucidated from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction data. MAS&#8197;NMR, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy support the structure model and the presence of anionic hydrogen. Quantum chemical calculations provide insight into the electronic structure.







Abstract
Metal hydrides are an uprising compound class bringing up various functional materials. Due to the low X&#8208;ray scattering power of hydrogen, neutron diffraction is often crucial to fully disclose the structural characteristics thereof. We herein present the second strontium nitridoborate hydride known so far, Sr13[BN2]6H8, formed in a solid&#8208;state reaction of the binary nitrides and strontium hydride at 950&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure was elucidated based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction in the hexagonal space group P63/m (no.&#8197;176), exhibiting a novel three&#8208;dimensional network of [BN2]3&#8722; units and hydride anions connected by strontium cations. Further analyses with magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and vibrational spectroscopy corroborate the presence of anionic hydrogen within the structure. Quantum chemical calculations reveal the electronic properties and support the experimental outcome. Sr13[BN2]6H8 expands the emerging family of nitridoborate hydrides, broadening the access to an open field of new, intriguing materials.

We herein present the second strontium nitridoborate hydride known so far, Sr&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;[BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, formed in a solid-state reaction of the binary nitrides and strontium hydride at 950&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structure was elucidated based on single-crystal X-ray and neutron powder diffraction in the hexagonal space group &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; (no.&#8197;176), exhibiting a novel three-dimensional network of [BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; units and hydride anions connected by strontium cations. Further analyses with magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and vibrational spectroscopy corroborate the presence of anionic hydrogen within the structure. Quantum chemical calculations reveal the electronic properties and support the experimental outcome. Sr&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;[BN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; expands the emerging family of nitridoborate hydrides, broadening the access to an open field of new, intriguing materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Template&#8208;assisted Fabrication of O&#8208;doped CoP Microflowers with Optimal Electronic Modulation for Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the O&#8208;doped CoP microflowers are synthesized via a self&#8208;sacrificial reactive template&#8208;engaged strategy. Benefiting from the structural and compositional advantages, the obtained sample with optimal electronic structure exhibits the excellent hydrogen evolution performance.







Abstract
Exploring efficient, affordable and stable electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of great scientific significance for the practical implementation of the water splitting. The heteroatom doping represents a serviceable strategy to further elevate the catalytic performance for a transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalyst because of the electronic regulation effect. Herein, a reliable self&#8208;sacrificial template&#8208;engaged approach is proposed to synthesize O&#8208;doped CoP (denoted as O&#8208;CoP) microflowers, which simultaneously considers the regualtion of electronic configuration via anion doping and sufficient exposure of active sites via nanostructure engineering. The suitable O incorporation content in CoP matrix could tremendously modify the electronic configuration, accelerate the charge transfer, promote the exposure of active sites, strengthen the electrical conductivity, and adjust the adsorption state of H*. Consequently, the optimized O&#8208;CoP microflowers with optimal O concentration display a remarkable HER property with a small overpotential of 125&#8197;mV to afford a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a low Tafel slope of 68&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term durability for 32&#8197;h under alkaline electrolyte, manifesting a considerable potential application for hydrogen production at large scale. The integration of anion incorporation and architecture engineering in this work will bring in a depth insight for the design of low&#8208;cost and effective electrocatalysts in energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>Tf2O&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Cyclization/Trifluoromethylselenolation of Alkynes for Synthesis of CF3Se&#8208;Containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and practical Tf2O&#8208;catalyzed tandem cyclization/trifluoromethylselenolation of alkynes with EtOH as the green solvent was developed. Various CF3Se&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds, including indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes have been synthesized with trifluoromethyl selenoxides as CF3Se source.







Abstract
Herein, the tandem synthesis of various CF3Se&#8208;containing heterocyclic compounds has been developed, using Tf2O as the catalyst and trifluoromethyl selenoxides as the electrophilic trifluoromethylselenolation reagents. This process is characterized by its mild conditions, ease of operation, and good functional group compatibility. A variety of alkynes could be transferred into CF3Se&#8208;containing indoles, benzofurans, benzothiophenes, isoquinolines and chromenes in good yields. A key step involving the formation of the electrophilic CF3Se species was proposed.

         <title>Nms&#8208;Amides: An Amine Protecting Group with Unique Stability and Selectivity</title>

         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Toluenesulfonyl (Tosyl) and nitrobenzenesulfonyl (Nosyl) are two of the most common sulfonyl protecting groups for amines in contemporary organic synthesis. While p&#8208;toluenesulfonamides are known for their high stability and robustness, their use in multistep synthesis is plagued by difficult removal. Nitrobenzenesulfonamides, on the other hand, are easily cleaved but display limited stability to various reaction conditions. In an effort to resolve this conundrum, we herein present Nms&#8208;amides, initially developed through in silico studies, which overcome these previous limitations and leave no room for compromise, enabling a range of transformations that are not possible with traditional sulfonamide protecting groups.

We have investigated the incorporation, robustness and cleavability of this group and found it to be superior to traditional sulfonamide protecting groups in a broad range of case studies.

         <title>Enantioenriched Boron C,N&#8208;Chelates via Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chirality transfer strategy was established to access enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates stereogenic only at the B&#8208;atom. First, a library of chiral boron O,N&#8208;complexes was synthesized in diastereoselective fashion. The generated stereoinformation at boron was then transferred via the ate&#8208;complex into the boron C,N&#8208;chelates.Twitter affiliations: @LaschatGroup, @YStoeckl







Abstract
Molecules stereogenic only at tetrahedral boron atoms show great promise for applications, for example as chiroptical materials, but are scarcely investigated due to their synthetic challenge. Hence, this study reports a two&#8208;step synthesis of enantioenriched boron C,N&#8208;chelates. First, the diastereoselective complexation of alkyl/aryl borinates with chiral aminoalcohols furnished boron stereogenic heterocycles in up to 86&#8201;% yield and d.r. &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2. Treatment of these O,N&#8208;complexes with chelate nucleophiles was surmised to transfer the stereoinformation via the ate&#8208;complex into the C,N&#8208;products. This chirality transfer succeeded by substitution of the O,N&#8208;chelates with lithiated phenyl pyridine to give boron stereogenic C,N&#8208;chelates in up to 84&#8201;% yield and e.r. up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3. The chiral aminoalcohol ligands could be recovered after isolation of the C,N&#8208;chelates. The chirality transfer tolerated alkyl, alkynyl and (hetero&#8208;)aryl moieties at boron and could be further extended by post&#8208;modification: transformations such as catalytic hydrogenations or sequential deprotonation/electrophilic trapping were feasible while maintaining the stereochemical integrity of the C,N&#8208;chelates. Structural aspects of the boron chelates were studied by variable temperature NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Symmetrically Functionalized Copper and Silver Corrole&#8208;Bis&#8208;Tetracyanobutadiene Push&#8208;Pull Conjugates: Efficient Population of Triplet States via Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper and silver corroles, symmetrically functionalized with two TCBDs, have been newly synthesized as wideband capturing push&#8208;pull systems. An efficient population of triplet states via the intermediate charge transfer state formed as a function of excitation wavelength is demonstrated using ultrafast pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy.







Abstract
Copper and silver tritolylcorroles (TTC) are symmetrically functionalized to carry two tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD) entities via [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroeletrocyclization reaction involving ethynyl functionalized corroles with an electron acceptor, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) in excellent yields, as the first examples of corrole&#8208;TCBD push&#8208;pull systems. The strong push&#8208;pull effect resulted in charge polarization in the ground state resulting in a considerable hypsochromic shift of the spectrum extending it into the near&#8208;IR region. Electrochemical studies coupled with computational studies revealed considerable interactions between the two TCBD entities via the corrole &#960;&#8208;system and the degree of such interactions was found to depend on the metal ion present in the corrole cavity. Energy considerations suggested charge transfer (CT) from the S2 or vibrationally hot S1 state but not the relaxed S1 state in the case of CuTTC(TCBD)2 while CT to occur from all these states in the case of AgTTC(TCBD)2. Additionally, the high&#8208;energy CT states populate the low&#8208;lying triplet states. Systematic femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies provided the ultimate proof for the occurrence of excited CT as a function of excitation wavelength followed by the efficient population of the triplet states. The present study brings out the significance of charge transfer in efficiently populating the triplet states in rather unusual copper and silver corroles carrying two TCBD entities.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Aryl and Alkenyl Halides from Fluorosulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 41, July 20, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relevance of aryl fluorosulfonates in coupling reactions has increased over the past decade. Surprisingly, the use and synthesis of alkenyl fluorosulfonates is still poorly described. In this paper, the advantageous use of aryl and alkenyl fluorosulfonates instead of the corresponding triflates is reported to synthesize aryl and alkenyl halides using halide salts and commercially available ruthenium catalysts.







Abstract
Aryl and alkenyl halides are widely used as key intermediates in organic synthesis, particularly for the formation of organometallic reagents or as radical precursors. They are also found in pharmaceutical and agrochemical ingredients. In this work, the synthesis of aryl and alkenyl halides from the corresponding fluorosulfonates using commercially available ruthenium catalysts is reported. Notably, this is the first conversion of phenols to aryl halides that is efficient with chloride, bromide, and iodide. Fluorosulfonates are readily prepared using sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2) and less expensive substitutes for triflates. Although aryl fluorosulfonates and their reactions are well known, this is the first report of an efficient coupling of alkenyl fluorosulfonates. To finish, it was demonstrated, by means of representative examples, that the reaction is possible in a one&#8208;pot process, starting directly from phenol or aldehyde.

         <title>Direct C(3)5&#8722;H Polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;Amino/alkoxy Pyridines Enabled by a Transient and Electron&#8208;deficient Palladium Intermediate</title>

         <dc:description>
A transiently formed electrophilic polyfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species overrides the unproductive N&#8208;coordination enabling a remote selective polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines. The strategy allowed rapid construction of polyfluorinated heterobiaryls containing bioactive molecules and drug derivatives in good yields.







Abstract
Herein, we present an unprecedented azine&#8208;limited C5&#8722;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;aminopyridines enabled by a transient and electron&#8208;deficient perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species via C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H coupling. The protocol further allows C3(5)&#8722;H polyfluoroarylation of 2&#8208;alkoxypyridines guided by sterics and electronics for the first time. The late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization of drugs, drug derivatives, and natural product derivatives and synthesis of C5&#8208;aryl drug derivatives further demonstrated the method's utility. The preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic combination of the bulky yet electrophilic perfluoroaryl&#8208;Pd species and the partial nucleophilicity of the C5&#8208;position of 2&#8208;amino/alkoxy&#8208;pyridines is the origin of reactivity and selectivity. Importantly, the first experimental evidence for the role of diisopropyl sulfide is provided.

         <dc:description>
A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation has been developed. The interconversion of a macrocyclic triboronic acid (blue Japanese umbrella) and a tricyclic boroxine (green pinwheel) can be triggered by water or temperature. These unique interconversions are attributed to the entropic advantage of intramolecular boroxine formation. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Ono and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300995).

The impact of the hoop size on the electronic and charge transport properties of [5]&#8208; and [4]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazoles is reported. In these examples, a small nanohoop is beneficial for good organization of the molecules into thin films, whereas a large one increases the density of structural defects.

Fabrication strategies of polycrystalline MOF membranes and the corresponding performance in separation of light hydrocarbons were classified and summarized. In addition, the perspective of this topic has also been proposed.







Abstract
Due to facile designability and versatile nanospace, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as promising membrane materials. Compared to the mixed matrix membranes that incorporated with MOF particles, the polycrystalline MOF membranes demonstrates significant advantages in maximum utilizing the crystalline nanospace, and thus yielding a fruitful of achievements in the last twenty years. Although some reviews have summarized the development of MOF&#8208;based membranes, the theoretical framework for oriented design and preparation of polycrystalline MOF membranes for highly efficient separation of light hydrocarbons remains in infancy. Herein, in this review, the fabrication strategies of polycrystalline MOF membranes and the corresponding performance in the separation of light hydrocarbons were classified and summarized. Particularly, the MOF membranes with global and local dynamics have been proposed as an interesting topic promoted performance.

         <title>Peptide Macrocyclization Guided by Reversible Covalent Templating</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The creation of complementary products via templating is a hallmark feature of nucleic acid replication. Outside of nucleic acid&#8208;like molecules, the templated synthesis of a hetero&#8208;complementary copy is still rare. Herein we describe one cycle of templated synthesis that creates homomeric macrocyclic peptides guided by linear instructing strands. This strategy utilizes hydrazone formation to pre&#8208;organize peptide oligomeric monomers along the template on a solid support resin, and microwave&#8208;assisted peptide synthesis to couple monomers and cyclize the strands. &#160;With a flexible templating strand, we can alter the size of the complementary macrocycle products by increasing the length and number of the binding peptide oligomers, showing the potential to precisely tune the size of macrocyclic products. For the smaller macrocyclic peptides, the products can be released via hydrolysis and characterized by ESI&#8208;MS.</dc:description>

         <title>The Factor beyond Schmidt's Criteria Impacting the Photo&#8208;Induced [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactivity and Photoactuation of Molecular Crystals Based on Cyclic Chalcone Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond Schmidt's criteria, the restricted mobility of the C=C bond affects the solid&#8208;state photo&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloaddition reactivity, facilitating the development of photomechanical molecular crystalline materials.







Abstract
Generally, the potential reactive &#8220;olefin pairs&#8221; in the molecular crystals satisfying Schmidt's criteria could undergo topological [2+2] cycloaddition. In this study, another factor that affects the photodimerization reactivity of chalcone analogues was found. The cyclic chalcone analogues of (E)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one (BIO), (E)&#8208;2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;inden&#8208;1&#8208;one (NIO), (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)benzofuran&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one (BFO), and (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)benzo[b]thiophen&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one (BTO) have been synthesized. While the geometrical parameters for the molecular packing of the above four compounds did not exceed Schmidt's criteria, [2+2] cycloaddition did not occur in the crystals of BIO and BTO. The single crystal structures and Hirshfeld surface analyses revealed that interactions of C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H (CH2) existed between adjacent molecules in the crystal of BIO. Therefore, the carbonyl and methylene groups linked with one carbon atom in carbon&#8208;carbon double bond were tightly confined in the lattice, acting as a tweezer to inhibit free movement of the double bond and suppressing [2+2] cycloaddition. In the crystal of BTO, similar interactions of Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S and C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H (C6H4) prevented free movement of the double bond. In contrast, the intermolecular interaction of C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H only exists around the carbonyl group in the crystals of BFO and NIO, leaving the C=C double bonds to move freely and allowing the occurrence of [2+2] cycloaddition. Driven by photodimerization, the needle&#8208;like crystals of BFO and NIO displayed evident photo&#8208;induced bending behavior. This work demonstrates that the intermolecular interactions around carbon&#8208;carbon double bond affect the [2+2] cycloaddition reactivity except for Schmidt's criteria.

     alt="The Factor beyond Schmidt's Criteria Impacting the Photo-Induced [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactivity and Photoactuation of Molecular Crystals Based on Cyclic Chalcone Analogues"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond Schmidt's criteria&lt;/b&gt;, the restricted mobility of the C=C bond affects the solid-state photo-induced [2+2] cycloaddition reactivity, facilitating the development of photomechanical molecular crystalline materials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the potential reactive &#8220;olefin pairs&#8221; in the molecular crystals satisfying Schmidt's criteria could undergo topological [2+2] cycloaddition. In this study, another factor that affects the photodimerization reactivity of chalcone analogues was found. The cyclic chalcone analogues of (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-2-(2,4-dichlorobenzylidene)-2,3-dihydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-inden-1-one (&lt;b&gt;BIO&lt;/b&gt;), (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-2-(naphthalen-2-ylmethylene)-2,3-dihydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-inden-1-one (&lt;b&gt;NIO&lt;/b&gt;), (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-2-(2,4-dichlorobenzylidene)benzofuran-3(2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-one (&lt;b&gt;BFO&lt;/b&gt;), and (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-2-(2,4-dichlorobenzylidene)benzo[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]thiophen-3(2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-one (&lt;b&gt;BTO&lt;/b&gt;) have been synthesized. While the geometrical parameters for the molecular packing of the above four compounds did not exceed Schmidt's criteria, [2+2] cycloaddition did not occur in the crystals of &lt;b&gt;BIO&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;BTO&lt;/b&gt;. The single crystal structures and Hirshfeld surface analyses revealed that interactions of C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) existed between adjacent molecules in the crystal of &lt;b&gt;BIO&lt;/b&gt;. Therefore, the carbonyl and methylene groups linked with one carbon atom in carbon-carbon double bond were tightly confined in the lattice, acting as a tweezer to inhibit free movement of the double bond and suppressing [2+2] cycloaddition. In the crystal of &lt;b&gt;BTO&lt;/b&gt;, similar interactions of Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S and C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) prevented free movement of the double bond. In contrast, the intermolecular interaction of C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H only exists around the carbonyl group in the crystals of &lt;b&gt;BFO&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;NIO&lt;/b&gt;, leaving the C=C double bonds to move freely and allowing the occurrence of [2+2] cycloaddition. Driven by photodimerization, the needle-like crystals of &lt;b&gt;BFO&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;NIO&lt;/b&gt; displayed evident photo-induced bending behavior. This work demonstrates that the intermolecular interactions around carbon-carbon double bond affect the [2+2] cycloaddition reactivity except for Schmidt's criteria. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of photomechanical molecular crystalline materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
In a solid catalyst with ionic liquid layer (SCILL), ionic liquid (IL) coatings are used to improve the selectivity of noble metal catalysts. To understand the origins of this selectivity control, we performed model studies by surface science methods in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). We investigated the growth and thermal stability of ultrathin IL films by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). We combined these experiments with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to obtain information on the orientation of the ions, the interactions with the surface, the intermolecular interactions, and the structure formation. Additionally, we performed DFT calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to interpret the experimental data. We studied the IL 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate [C2C1Im][OTf] on Au(111) surfaces. We observe a weakly bound multilayer of [C2C1Im][OTf], which is stable up to 390&#8197;K, while the monolayer desorbs at &#8764;450&#8197;K. [C2C1Im][OTf] preferentially adsorbs at the step edges and elbows of the herringbone reconstruction of Au(111). The anion adsorbs via the SO3 group with the molecular axis perpendicular to the surface. At low coverage, the [C2C1Im][OTf] crystallizes in a glass&#8208;like 2D phase with short&#8208;range order. At higher coverage, we observe a phase transition to a 6&#8208;membered ring structure with long&#8208;range order.

A novel method for preparing mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones from alkene&#8208;substituted quinazolinones via chemodivergent tandem radical cyclization under metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free conditions has been established.







Abstract
Chemodivergent tandem radical cyclization offers exciting possibilities for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic compounds. Herein, we revealed a chemodivergent tandem cyclization of alkene&#8208;substituted quinazolinones under metal&#8208; and base&#8208;free conditions, this transformation is initiated by alkyl radicals produced from oxidant&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of alkyl nitriles or esters. The reaction resulted in the selective synthesis of a series of mono&#8208; and di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones by modulating the loading of oxidant, reaction temperature, and reaction time. Mechanistic investigations show that the mono&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is constructed by the key process of 1,2&#8208;hydrogen shift, whereas the di&#8208;alkylated ring&#8208;fused quinazolinones is mainly achieved through crucial steps of resonance and proton transfer. This protocol is the first example of remote second alkylation on the aromatic ring via &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization and difunctionalization achieved by association of two unsaturated bonds in radical cyclization.

Abstract
The first case of successful suppression of the coordination of a lithium atom with a dialkylamino group by the effective conjugation of the latter with the aromatic core has been discovered. This effect controls regioselectivity of the bromine&#8722;lithium exchange in 4,6,7,9&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;perimidine, which leads to products with the most effective conjugation. As a result, the product of this quadruple exchange demonstrates no tendency of the coordination of the NMe groups to neighboring lithium atoms despite the absence of steric restrictions. Experimental results are explained by means of quantum chemical calculations: geometry optimization, natural bond analysis and scans using the modredundant scheme.

         <title>Piezochromism and Conductivity Modulations under High Pressure by Manipulating the Viologen Radical Concentration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulating the radical concentration to modulate the properties is an attractive topic. In this work, the cross&#8208;conjugated 2&#8208;X all exhibit much higher radical concentrations with more sensitive piezochromism after compression. Unexpectedly, the electrical resistance of linear&#8208;conjugated 1&#8208;NO3 decreased remarkably with the increasing pressure, while that in 2&#8208;NO3 remained almost unchanged. Such unusual invariant conductivity breaks the conventional wisdom that radical generation is beneficial to improve conductivity.







Abstract
Manipulating the radical concentration to modulate the properties in solid multifunctional materials is an attractive topic in various frontier fields. Viologens have the unique redox capability to generate radical states through reversible electron transfer (ET) under external stimuli. Herein, taking the viologens as the model, two kinds of crystalline compounds with different molecule&#8208;conjugated systems were designed and synthesized. By subjecting the specific model viologens to pressure, the cross&#8208;conjugated 2&#8208;X all exhibit much higher radical concentrations, along with more sensitive piezochromic behaviors, compared to the linear&#8208;conjugated 1&#8208;X. Unexpectedly, we find that the electrical resistance (R) of 1&#8208;NO3 decreased by three orders of magnitude with the increasing pressure, while that in high&#8208;radical&#8208;concentration 2&#8208;NO3 remained almost unchanged. To date, such unusual invariant conductivity has not been documented in molecular&#8208;based materials under high pressure, breaking the conventional wisdom that the generations of radicals are beneficial to improve conductivity. We highlight that adjusting the molecular conjugation modes can be used as an effective way to regulate the radical concentrations and thus modulate properties rationally.

By subjecting the specific model viologens to pressure, the cross-conjugated &lt;b&gt;2-X&lt;/b&gt; all exhibit much higher radical concentrations, along with more sensitive piezochromic behaviors, compared to the linear-conjugated &lt;b&gt;1-X&lt;/b&gt;. Unexpectedly, we find that the electrical resistance (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) of &lt;b&gt;1-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; decreased by three orders of magnitude with the increasing pressure, while that in high-radical-concentration &lt;b&gt;2-NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; remained almost unchanged. To date, such unusual invariant conductivity has not been documented in molecular-based materials under high pressure, breaking the conventional wisdom that the generations of radicals are beneficial to improve conductivity. We highlight that adjusting the molecular conjugation modes can be used as an effective way to regulate the radical concentrations and thus modulate properties rationally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Five Novel Silver&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers as Photoluminescent Sensing Platforms for the Detection of Nitrobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Ag10hpbt, Ag12bpva and Ag12bpb exemplify the first luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers used in the sensing of nitrobenzene through fluorescence quenching.







Abstract
Nitrobenzene (NB) is a highly toxic chemical and a cause for concern to human health and the environment. Hence, it is worth designing new efficient and robust sensing platforms for NB. In this study, we present three newly synthesized luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers, {[Ag10(StBu)6(CF3COO)4(hpbt)] (DMAc)2(CH3CN)2}n (hpbt=N,N,N&#8217;,N'N&#8221;,N&#8221;&#8208;hexa(pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamine), [Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpva)3]n (bpva=9,10&#8208;Bis(2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)anthracene), and {[Ag12(StBu)6(CF3COO)6(bpb)(DMAc)2(H2O)2] (DMAc)2}n (bpb=1,4&#8208;Bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)benzene) composed of Ag10, Ag12 and Ag12 cluster cores, respectively, connected by multidentate pyridine linkers. In addition, two new luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers, [Ag(CF3COO)(dpa)]n (dpa=9,10&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)anthracene) referred to as Agdpa (H) and Agdpa (R), where H and R denote hexagon&#8208; and rod&#8208;like crystal shapes, respectively, have been prepared. The coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effects to NB, attributed to the &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and NB as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of NB.

         <title>Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles as Clients of Biomolecular Condensates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles concentrate and distribute into biomolecular condensates. The nanoparticles establish dynamic noncovalent interactions with the scaffold protein and act as clients. They may also favor or disfavor condensate formation. The nanoparticles could be used to explore biomolecular condensates in&#8197;vitro and in cellular models of pathology.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of biopolymers to form condensates is a widespread phenomenon in living cells. Agents that target or alter condensation can help uncover elusive physiological and pathological mechanisms. Owing to their unique material properties and modes of interaction with biomolecules, nanoparticles represent attractive condensate&#8208;targeting agents.
Our work focused on elucidating the interaction between ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (usGNPs) and diverse types of condensates of tau, a representative phase&#8208;separating protein associated with neurodegenerative disorders. usGNPs attract considerable interest in the biomedical community due to unique features, including emergent optical properties and good cell penetration. We explored the interaction of usGNPs with reconstituted self&#8208;condensates of tau, two&#8208;component tau/polyanion and three&#8208;component tau/RNA/alpha&#8208;synuclein coacervates. The usGNPs were found to concentrate into condensed liquid droplets, consistent with the formation of dynamic client (nanoparticle) &#8208; scaffold (tau) interactions, and were observable thanks to their intrinsic luminescence. Furthermore, usGNPs were capable to promote LLPS of a protein domain which is unable to phase separate on its own.
Our study demonstrates the ability of usGNPs to interact with and illuminate protein condensates. We anticipate that nanoparticles will have broad applicability as nanotracers to interrogate phase separation, and as nanoactuators controlling the formation and dissolution of condensates.

Two stable MOFs, Zr/Hf&#8722;CAU&#8208;61, were discovered in acetic acid as solvent by using pyromellitic acid (H4PMA). Structure refinement and full characterization were carried out and permanent porosity was confirmed. Acid&#8208;base properties were determined by titration with aqueous LiOH and compared with the acidic Zr&#8208;MOFs UiO&#8208;66&#8208;BDC, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;TMA and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;PMA. In addition, results of metal ion and dye permeation studies on Zr&#8722;CAU&#8208;61 membranes are presented.







Abstract
Herein, we report two new COOH&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) of composition [M6O4(OH)6(PMA)2(H2PMA)]&#215;H2O, M=Zr, Hf), denoted CAU&#8208;61, synthesized by using pyromellitic acid (H4PMA), a tetracarboxylic acid, as the linker and acetic acid as the solvent. The structure was determined from powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data and one&#8208;dimensional inorganic building units are connected through tetracarboxylate as well as dicarboxylate linker molecules, resulting in highly stable microporous framework structures with limiting and maximum pore diameter of &#8764;3.6 and &#8764;5.0&#8197;&#197;, respectively, lined with &#8722;COOH groups. Thermal stabilities of up to 400&#8201;&#176;C in air, chemical stability in water at pH&#8197;1 to 12 and water uptake of 17&#8197;mol/mol prompted us to study the proton exchange of the &#956;2&#8208;OH, &#956;3&#8208;OH of the IBU and &#8722;COOH groups of the linker by titration with LiOH. Comparison of the pKa values with three UiO&#8208;66 derivatives confirms distinct pKa value ranges and trends for the different acidic protons. Furthermore, the preparation of Zr&#8722;CAU&#8208;61 membranes and first results on permeation of dyes and ions in aqueous solutions are presented.

Fluorescent probes: In two triangulenium fluorophores we have tested the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching by appended aryl amine moieties. Depending on the dihedral angle within the conjugated quencher moiety we observed a 20&#8208;fold change in the PET&#8208;quenching rate.Investigating Design Rules for Photoinduced Electron Transfer Quenching in Triangulenium Probes (Laursen et&#8197;al.) @ChemKUniversity @jesperdj10 @BoWLaursen







Abstract
Fluorescent probes based on photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching of long lifetime triangulenium fluorophores have found multiple applications. For such probes a successful design relies on the right balance between the rate of PET quenching and fluorescence. In a series of ADOTA (A) and DAOTA (D) triangulenium fluorophores appended with aniline&#8208;like quencher moieties, we have investigated the rate of quenching and its relation to thermodynamic driving force, distance, and conjugation within the quencher moiety. Three different quenchers, a short (1), a long (2), and a long twisted (3), 4&#8208;aminophenyl, 4&#8217;&#8208;aminobiphenyl, and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;aminobiphenyl, respectively were investigated. Steady&#8208;state spectroscopy and electrochemistry confirms that the quencher moieties are electronically decoupled from the dyes and have similar oxidation potentials and thus driving force for PET quenching, irrespectively of their different length and conjugation. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurement was used to measure the fast PET quenching, with rate constant kPET ranging from &gt;4&#215;1011 to 2&#215;109&#8197;s&#8722;1. Interestingly, PET quenching is equally efficient/fast from 1 and 2, even with increase in distance between the donor and the acceptor. However, when twisting the biphenyl in 3, a 20&#8208;fold decrease in quenching is found. Even with this decrease in kPET, the quenching in 3&#8201;A/D is still highly efficient, with nearly 99&#8201;% quenching. The study show that long lifetime fluorophores can be efficiently switched even by relatively slow PET processes and that PET quencher moieties can be removed far from the fluorophore if conjugated linkers are applied.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorescent probes based on photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching of long lifetime triangulenium fluorophores have found multiple applications. For such probes a successful design relies on the right balance between the rate of PET quenching and fluorescence. In a series of ADOTA (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;) and DAOTA (&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;) triangulenium fluorophores appended with aniline-like quencher moieties, we have investigated the rate of quenching and its relation to thermodynamic driving force, distance, and conjugation within the quencher moiety. Three different quenchers, a short (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), a long (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), and a long twisted (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), 4-aminophenyl, 4&#8217;-aminobiphenyl, and 2,2&#8217;-dimethyl-4&#8217;-aminobiphenyl, respectively were investigated. Steady-state spectroscopy and electrochemistry confirms that the quencher moieties are electronically decoupled from the dyes and have similar oxidation potentials and thus driving force for PET quenching, irrespectively of their different length and conjugation. Time-resolved fluorescence measurement was used to measure the fast PET quenching, with rate constant &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PET&lt;/sub&gt; ranging from &amp;gt;4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Interestingly, PET quenching is equally efficient/fast from &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, even with increase in distance between the donor and the acceptor. However, when twisting the biphenyl in &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, a 20-fold decrease in quenching is found. Even with this decrease in &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PET,&lt;/sub&gt; the quenching in &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;A/D&lt;/b&gt; is still highly efficient, with nearly 99&#8201;% quenching. The study show that long lifetime fluorophores can be efficiently switched even by relatively slow PET processes and that PET quencher moieties can be removed far from the fluorophore if conjugated linkers are applied.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CH3CN@open&#8208;C60: An Effective Inner&#8208;Space Modification and Isotope Effect Inside a Nano&#8208;Sized Flask</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polar CH3CN molecule has been encapsulated inside an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative under high pressure. The inserted CH3CN molecule has an impressive effect on the outer carbon cage, as shown by the enhanced polarity and decreased LUMO level. Crystallographic and computational analyses revealed that these changes were governed by the existence of the CH3CN and cage deformation caused by the insertion. Moreover, the favored binding affinity of CD3CN compared with CH3CN was affirmed. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Murata and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301161).

         <title>Structural Variations in Carboxylated Bispidine Ligands: Influence of Positional Isomerism and Rigidity on the Conformation, Stability, Inertness and Relaxivity of their Mn2+ Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mn2+ complexes of 2,4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;disubstituted bispidine ligands have emerged as more biocompatible alternatives to Gd3+&#8208;based MRI probes. They display relaxivities comparable to that of commercial contrast agents and high kinetic inertness, unprecedented for Mn2+ complexes. The chemical structure, in particular the substituents on the two macrocyclic nitrogens N3 and N7, are decisive for the conformation of the Mn2+ complexes, and this will in turn determine their thermodynamic, kinetic and relaxation properties. We describe the synthesis of four ligands with acetate substituents in positions N3, N7 or both. We evidence that the bispidine conformation is dependent on N3 substitution, with direct impact on the thermodynamic stability, kinetic inertness, hydration state and relaxivity of the Mn2+ complexes. These results unambiguously show that (i) solely a chair&#8208;chair conformation allows for favorable inertness and relaxivity, and (ii) in this family such chair&#8208;chair conformation is accessible only for ligands without N3&#8208;appended carboxylates.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Luminescence from a Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with Flexible Conformation of Ancillary Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Robust scaffolds were typically applied in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules to suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay, trigger the fast spin&#8208;flipping, and enhance the light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Herein, we disclosed for the first time the positive effect of flexible conformation of ancillary groups on the photophysical properties of TADF emitter. The red TADF emitter Ph&#8208;TPA with flexible conformation demonstrated small excited&#8208;state structural distortion and low reorganization energy compared to the counterpart Mc&#8208;TPA with a rigid macrocycle. Consequently, Ph&#8208;TPA showed an excellent photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of 92% and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.6% at 630 nm. This work could deepen our understanding of structure&#8208;property relationships of organic luminophores and help us to rationalize the design of efficient TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of Amyloid &#946; Aggregation and Cytotoxicity by Berbamine Hydrochloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to be a major global health challenge, and the recent approval of Aduhelm and Leqembi has opened new avenues for its treatment. Small&#8208;molecule inhibitors targeting A&#946; aggregation hold promise as an alternative to monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we evaluated the ability of berbamine hydrochloride (BBMH), a member of the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, to reduce A&#946; aggregation and cytotoxicity. Thioflavin T kinetics, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy results indicated that BBMH effectively inhibited A&#946; aggregation. Surface plasmon resonance and molecular docking results further revealed that BBMH could bind to A&#946; fibrils, thereby hindering the aggregation process. This physical picture has been confirmed in a quantitative way by chemical kinetics analysis, which showed BBMH tends to bind with the fibril ends and thus prevents the transition from protofibrils to mature fibrils as well as the elongation process. Additionally, our MTT results showed that BBMH was able to reduce the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 on N2a cells. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the potential of BBMH to inhibit A&#946; aggregation and cytotoxicity, offering a promising direction for further research and drug development efforts in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthodithiophene&#8208;Fused Porphyrins: Synthesis, Characterization, and Impact of Extended Conjugation on Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fusion of tetrapyrroles with aromatic heterocycles constitutes a useful tool for manipulation of their opto&#8208;electronic properties. In this work, the synthesis of naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins was achieved through a Heck reaction&#8208;based cascade reaction followed by a Scholl reaction. These naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins display a unique set of optical and electronic properties. Fusion of the naphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b']dithiophene to porphyrin (F2VTP) leads to an increase in the fluorescence lifetime by ~20%, which is accompanied, unexpectedly, by a more than 2&#8208;fold drop in the emission quantum yield (&#934;=0.018). In contrast, fusion of the isomeric naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b']dithiophene to porphyrin (F3VPT) results in a ~1.5&#8208;fold increase in the fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;=0.13) with the concomitant ~30% increase in the fluorescence lifetime.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fusion of tetrapyrroles with aromatic heterocycles constitutes a useful tool for manipulation of their opto-electronic properties. In this work, the synthesis of naphthodithiophene-fused porphyrins was achieved through a Heck reaction-based cascade reaction followed by a Scholl reaction. These naphthodithiophene-fused porphyrins display a unique set of optical and electronic properties. Fusion of the naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b']dithiophene to porphyrin (F2VTP) leads to an increase in the fluorescence lifetime by ~20%, which is accompanied, unexpectedly, by a more than 2-fold drop in the emission quantum yield (&#934;=0.018). In contrast, fusion of the isomeric naphtho[1,2-b:4,3-b']dithiophene to porphyrin (F3VPT) results in a ~1.5-fold increase in the fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;=0.13) with the concomitant ~30% increase in the fluorescence lifetime. This behaviour suggests that fusion of the porphyrin with the naphthodithiopheno-system affects mainly the radiative rate constant in the Q-state deactivation pathway, while the effects of the isomeric naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b']dithiophene- vs naphtho[1,2-b:4,3-b']dithiophene-fusion are essentially the opposite. Interestingly, NICS analysis revealed considerable difference between the aromaticity of these two isomericsystems. Our results demonstrate that subtle structural differences in the fused components of the porphyrin can be reflected in rather significant differences between the photophysical properties of the resulting systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>In recent years, there has been a concerted drive to develop methods that are greener and more sustainable. Being an earth&#8208;abundant transition metal, cobalt offers an attractive substitute for commonly employed precious metal catalysts, though reactions engaging cobalt are still less developed.

The reaction allows for the formation of various substituted allylated products in moderate&#8208;excellent yields with a broad scope. Additionally, the synthetic potential of the methodology is demonstrated by the transformation of products into versatile heterocyclic motifs.

         <title>Photoinduced NiH Catalysis with Trialkylamines for the Stereodivergent Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a selectivity&#8208;switchable nickel hydride&#8208;catalyzed methodology that enables the stereocontrolled semi&#8208;reduction of internal alkynes to E&#8208; or Z&#8208;alkenes under very mild conditions. The proposed transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation process involves the use of a dual nickel/photoredox catalytic system and triethylamine, not only as a sacrificial reductant, but also as a source of hydrogen atoms. Mechanistic studies revealed a pathway involving photo&#8208;induced generation of nickel hydride, syn&#8208;hydronickelation of alkyne, and alkenylnickel isomerization as key steps. Remarkably, mechanistic experiments indicate that the control of the stereoselectivity is not ensuing from a post&#8208;reduction alkene photoisomerization under our conditions. Instead, we demonstrate that the stereoselectivity of the reaction is dependent on the rate of a final protonolysis step which can be tuned by adjusting the pKa of an alcohol additive.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereomerically Pure Titanocenes by Dynamic Conformational Locking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational locking of unbridged substituted titanocenes is achieved by the introduction of chiral anionic ligands. A novel method for the synthesis of monosubstituted, enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically pure titanocenes with C2&#8208;symmetry in the (RC5H4)2Ti fragment by reacting the methylated complexes with camphorsulfonic acid is presented. This study encompasses data from NMR and X&#8208;ray analysis as well as a mechanistic investigation with the aid of state of the art DFT calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of enantiomerically pure titanocenes is limited to cases with enantiomerically pure substituents at the cyclopentadienyl ligands and to ansa&#8208;titanocenes. For the latter complexes, the use of achiral ligands requires a resolution of enantiomers and frequently also a separation of the diastereoisomers obtained after metalation. Here, we introduce a new synthetic method that relies on the use of enantiomerically pure camphorsulfonate (CSA) ligands as control elements for the absolute and relative configuration of titanocene complexes. Starting from the conformationally flexible (RC5H4)2TiCl2, the desired conformationally locked and hence enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically pure complexes (RC5H4)2Ti(CSA)2 are obtained in just two steps. According to X&#8208;ray crystallography the (RC5H4)2Ti fragment is essentially C2&#8208;symmetric and nuclear magnetic resonance displays overall C2&#8208;symmetry. We applied density functional theory methods to unravel the dynamics of the complexes and the mechanisms and selectivities of their formation.

         <title>Kinetic Analysis of the Photochemical Paths in Asymmetric Diarylethene Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric diarylethene dimer composed of two different diarylethenes exhibited multicolor photochromism and generated four isomers. Photochemical paths such as quantum yields, lifetimes, and rate constants were evaluated from the points of the dimer&#8208; and unit&#8208;based models. The m&#8208;phenylene spacer regulates the rate of energy transfer to be similar value of photoisomerization.







Abstract
An asymmetric diarylethene dimer composed of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;thienylethene units linked by m&#8208;phenylene developed various colors upon UV irradiation via an independent photochromic reaction on each unit. The change in contents and the other photoresponses of the photogenerated four isomers were analyzed using quantum yield for all the possible photochemical paths, i.&#8201;e., photoisomerization, fluorescence, energy transfer, and the other non&#8208;radiative paths. Almost all the rate constants of photochemical paths were calculated using measurable quantum yields and lifetimes. It was found that a significant contribution on photoresponse was the competition between photoisomerization and intramolecular energy transfer. The clear difference was observed in the photoresponses of the dimer and the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture solution of the model compounds. The m&#8208;phenylene spacer appropriately regulated the rate of energy transfer in the asymmetric dimer, and the spacer enabled isolation of the excited state of the dimer, making the above quantitative analysis possible.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An asymmetric diarylethene dimer composed of 2- and 3-thienylethene units linked by &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene developed various colors upon UV irradiation via an independent photochromic reaction on each unit. The change in contents and the other photoresponses of the photogenerated four isomers were analyzed using quantum yield for all the possible photochemical paths, i.&#8201;e., photoisomerization, fluorescence, energy transfer, and the other non-radiative paths. Almost all the rate constants of photochemical paths were calculated using measurable quantum yields and lifetimes. It was found that a significant contribution on photoresponse was the competition between photoisomerization and intramolecular energy transfer. The clear difference was observed in the photoresponses of the dimer and the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture solution of the model compounds. The &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene spacer appropriately regulated the rate of energy transfer in the asymmetric dimer, and the spacer enabled isolation of the excited state of the dimer, making the above quantitative analysis possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acidic CO2 Electrolysis Addressing the &#8220;Alkalinity Issue&#8221; and Achieving High CO2 Utilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) mainly adopt alkaline or neutral electrolytes to suppress the hydrogen evolution (HER), but with significant drawback of (bi)carbonate crossover, leading to low carbon utilization efficiency. CO2RR in acidic electrolytes can alleviate the &#8220;alkalinity problem&#8221;, but the competing HER is more kinetically favourable. Thus, it is a priority to effectively suppress HER and accelerate acidic CO2 electrolysis.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a promising approach for sustainable chemical fuel production of carbon neutrality. Neutral and alkaline electrolytes are predominantly employed in the current electrolysis system, but with striking drawbacks of (bi)carbonate (CO32&#8722;/HCO3&#8722;) formation and crossover due to the rapid and thermodynamically favourable reaction between hydroxide (OH&#8722;) with CO2, resulting in low carbon utilization efficiency and short&#8208;lived catalysis. Very recently, CO2RR in acidic media can effectively address the (bi)carbonate issue; however, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is more kinetically favourable in acidic electrolytes, which dramatically reduces CO2 conversion efficiency. Thus, it is a big challenge to effectively suppress HER and accelerate acidic CO2RR. In this review, we begin by summarizing the recent progress of acidic CO2 electrolysis, discussing the key factors limiting the application of acidic electrolytes. We then systematically discuss addressing strategies for acidic CO2 electrolysis, including electrolyte microenvironment modulation, alkali cations adjusting, surface/interface functionalization, nanoconfinement structural design, and novel electrolyzer exploitation. Finally, the new challenges and perspectives of acidic CO2 electrolysis are suggested. We believe this timely review can arouse researchers&#8242; attention to CO2 crossover, inspire new insights to solve the &#8220;alkalinity problem&#8221; and enable CO2RR as a more sustainable technology.

         <title>Regioselective Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C8&#8208;H Borylation of 4&#8208;Quinolones via Transient O&#8208;Borylated Quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quinolone&#8211;quinoline tautomerization allows the regioselective C8&#8208;borylation of biologically important 4&#8208;quinolones by using [Ir(OMe)(cod)]2 as catalyst precursor, Si&#8208;SMAP as the ligand, and B2pin2 as boron source. Following O&#8208;borylation of the quinoline tautomer, N&#8208;directed selective Ir&#8208;catalyzed borylation takes place at C8. Hydrolysis of the OBpin moiety on workup returns the system to the quinolone tautomer.







Abstract
The quinolone&#8211;quinoline tautomerization is harnessed to effect the regioselective C8&#8208;borylation of biologically important 4&#8208;quinolones by using [Ir(OMe)(cod)]2 as the catalyst precursor, the silica&#8208;supported monodentate phosphine Si&#8208;SMAP as the ligand, and B2pin2 as the boron source. Initially, O&#8208;borylation of the quinoline tautomer takes place. Critically, the newly formed 4&#8208;(pinBO)&#8208;quinolines then undergo N&#8208;directed selective Ir&#8208;catalyzed borylation at C8. Hydrolysis of the OBpin moiety on workup returns the system to the quinolone tautomer. The C8&#8208;borylated quinolines were converted to their corresponding potassium trifluoroborate (BF3K) salts and to their C8&#8208;chlorinated quinolone derivatives. The two&#8208;step C&#8208;H borylation&#8208;chlorination reaction sequence resulted in various C8&#8208;Cl quinolones in good yields. Conversion to C8&#8208;OH&#8208;, C8&#8208;NH2&#8208;, and C8&#8208;Ar&#8208;substituted quinolones was also feasible by using this methodology.

         <title>Electrochemical Preparation of Sm(II) Reagent Facilitated by Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical analysis of the potential and reversibility of the Sm(11)/Sm(111) redox couple will inform the development of electrocatalytic Sm&#8208;driven reactions in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Samarium diiodide (SmI2) is widely used as a strong one&#8208;electron reducing agent and is often employed to form C&#8722;C bonds in complex systems. Despite their utility, SmI2 and related salts suffer from several drawbacks that render the use of Sm reducing agents in large&#8208;scale synthesis impractical. Here, we report factors influencing the electrochemical reduction of Sm(III) to Sm(II), towards the goal of electrocatalytic Sm(III) reduction. We probe the effect of supporting electrolyte, electrode material, and Sm precursor on Sm(II)/(III) redox and on the reducing power of the Sm species. We find that the coordination strength of the counteranion of the Sm salt affects the reversibility and redox potential of the Sm(II)/(III) couple and establish that the counteranion primarily determines the reducibility of Sm(III). Electrochemically generated SmI2 performs similarly to commercial SmI2 solutions in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept reaction. The results will provide fundamental insight to facilitate the development of Sm&#8208;electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of l&#8208;Methionine Analogues and Application in a Methyltransferase Catalysed Alkylation Cascade
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine sulfhydrolase is used for the production of l&#8208;methionine analogues from l&#8208;homocysteine and off&#8208;the shelf organic thiols. Combined with methyltransferase&#8208;catalysed alkylation cascades, this enables the transfer of a wide range of moieties onto various substrates.







Abstract
Chemical modification of small molecules is a key step for the development of pharmaceuticals. S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) analogues are used by methyltransferases (MTs) to transfer alkyl, allyl and benzyl moieties chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and regioselectively onto nucleophilic substrates, enabling an enzymatic way for specific derivatisation of a wide range of molecules. l&#8208;Methionine analogues are required for the synthesis of SAM analogues. Most of these are not commercially available. In nature, O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine sulfhydrolases (OAHS) catalyse the synthesis of l&#8208;methionine from O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine or l&#8208;homocysteine, and methyl mercaptan. Here, we investigated the substrate scope of ScOAHS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the production of l&#8208;methionine analogues from l&#8208;homocysteine and organic thiols. The promiscuous enzyme was used to synthesise nine different l&#8208;methionine analogues with modifications on the thioether residue up to a conversion of 75&#8201;%. ScOAHS was combined with an established MT dependent three&#8208;enzyme alkylation cascade, allowing transfer of in total seven moieties onto two MT substrates. For ethylation, conversion was nearly doubled with the new four&#8208;enzyme cascade, indicating a beneficial effect of the in&#8197;situ production of l&#8208;methionine analogues with ScOAHS.

         <title>Helical Self&#8208;Assembly and Fe3+ Detection of V&#8208;Shaped AIE&#8208;Active Chiral Tetraphenylbutadiene&#8208;Based Polyamides

A series of V&#8208;shaped tetraphenylbutadiene&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active chiral polyamides bearing n&#8208;propyl/hexyl/dodecyl side&#8208;chains are reported. They possess AIE features, display helical conformation polymer chains and self&#8208;assemble into helical nano&#8208;fibers, and present enhanced CD signal with positive Cotton effect. And P1&#8208;C6 is a fluorescence probe for Fe3+.







Abstract
Chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules have drawn attention for their helical self&#8208;assembly and special optical properties. The helical self&#8208;assembly of AIE&#8208;active chiral non&#8208;linear main&#8208;chain polymers can produce some desired optical features. In this work, a series of V&#8208;shaped chiral AIE&#8208;active polyamides P1&#8208;C3, P1&#8208;C6, P1&#8208;C12 and linear P2&#8208;C3, P2&#8208;C6, bearing n&#8208;propyl/hexyl/dodecyl side&#8208;chains, based on tetraphenylbutadiene (TPB), were prepared. All target main&#8208;chain polymers exhibit distinct AIE characteristics. The polymer P1&#8208;C6 with moderate length alkyl chains shows better AIE properties. The V&#8208;shaped main&#8208;chains and the chiral induction of (1R,2R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine in each repeating unit promote the polymer chains display helical conformation, and multiple helical polymer chains induce nano&#8208;fibers helicity when the polymer chains aggregate and self&#8208;assemble in THF/H2O mixtures. Simultaneously, the helical conformation polymer chains and helical nano&#8208;fibers cause P1&#8208;C6 produce strong circular dichroism (CD) signals with positive Cotton effect. Moreover, P1&#8208;C6 could also occur fluorescence quenching response to Fe3+ selectively with a low detection limit of 3.48&#8197;&#956;mol/L.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral aggregation-induced emission (AIE) molecules have drawn attention for their helical self-assembly and special optical properties. The helical self-assembly of AIE-active chiral non-linear main-chain polymers can produce some desired optical features. In this work, a series of V-shaped chiral AIE-active polyamides &lt;b&gt;P1-C3&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;P1-C6&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;P1-C12&lt;/b&gt; and linear &lt;b&gt;P2-C3&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;P2-C6&lt;/b&gt;, bearing &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-propyl/hexyl/dodecyl side-chains, based on tetraphenylbutadiene (TPB), were prepared. All target main-chain polymers exhibit distinct AIE characteristics. The polymer &lt;b&gt;P1-C6&lt;/b&gt; with moderate length alkyl chains shows better AIE properties. The V-shaped main-chains and the chiral induction of (1R,2R)-(+)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine in each repeating unit promote the polymer chains display helical conformation, and multiple helical polymer chains induce nano-fibers helicity when the polymer chains aggregate and self-assemble in THF/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O mixtures. Simultaneously, the helical conformation polymer chains and helical nano-fibers cause &lt;b&gt;P1-C6&lt;/b&gt; produce strong circular dichroism (CD) signals with positive Cotton effect.

         <title>Direct Alkylative Amination Using 1&#8208;Allylsilatrane
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DRA is so pass&#233;. Three&#8208;component reactions involving the condensation of unprotected aniline and benzaldehyde substrates being intercepted by 1&#8208;allylsilatrane in a direct alkylative amination afford a variety of homoallylic amines under robust, air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant conditions. A single precursor is then used to highlight the versatility of the scaffold by generating azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and quinoline analogues.







Abstract
Homoallylic amines prepared via addition of allylsilanes often require preformed imine substrates, metal catalysts, fluoride activators, or use of protected amines. In this metal&#8208;free, air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant procedure, aromatic aldehyde and aniline substrates undergo direct alkylative amination using easily accessible 1&#8208;allylsilatrane.

         <title>Substrate Selectivity Imparted by Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Containers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent trends in catalysis are devoted to mimicking some peculiar features of enzymes like site selectivity, through functional group recognition, and substrate selectivity, through recognition of the entire surface of the substrate. The latter is a specific feature of enzymes that is seldomly present in homogeneous catalysis. Supramolecular catalysis, thanks to the self&#8208;assembly of simple subunits, enables the creation of cavities and surfaces whose confinement effects drive the preferential binding of a substrate among others with consequent substrate selectivity. The topic is an emerging field that exploits recognition phenomena to discriminate the reagents based on their size and shape. This review deals this cutting&#8208;edge field of research covering examples of supramolecular self&#8208;assembled molecular containers and catalysts operating in organic as well as aqueous media, with special emphasis for catalytic systems dealing with direct competitive experiments involving two or more substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization&#8208;Hydroboration of Alkenes Affords Terminal Functionalization at Remote C&#8208;H Position</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the synthesis and characterization of nickel complexes supported by tridentate and bidentate phosphino(silyl) ancillary ligands, along with the successful application of these complexes as precatalysts for the hydroboration of terminal and internal alkenes using pinacolborane (HBPin). These reactions proceeded with low nickel loadings of 2.5&#8208;5 mol % in the absence of co&#8208;solvent, and in some cases at room temperature. Isomerization to afford exclusively the terminal hydroboration product was obtained across a range of internal alkenes, including tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted examples. This reactivity is unprecedented for nickel and offers a powerful means of achieving functionalization at a C&#8208;H position remote from the C=C double bond. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed deuteroboration experiments using DBPin support a mechanism involving 1,2&#8208;insertion of the alkene and subsequent chain&#8208;walking, which results in isotopic scrambling.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A highly enantioselective cyanation of imines (up to &gt;99% ee) has been developed using well&#8208;designed C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogen bonding catalysts. The catalytic strategy was characterized with low catalyst loading (0.1&#8208;1 mol%), easily accessible catalysts with diverse functional groups, and catalytic base additives. A wide range of imines, including the challenging N&#8208;Boc and N&#8208;Cbz protected ketimines and aldimines, as well as fluoroalkylated ketimines, were investigated under mild conditions to afford the products with good to excellent yields (up to 99% yield) and high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee). Control experiments revealed that the multiple hydrogen bonding catalysts enhanced the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the Strecker reaction initiated by the base.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The prominent role of gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes in numerous research areas such as homogeneous (photo)catalysis, medicinal chemistry and materials science has prompted organometallic chemists to design gold&#8208;based synthons that permit access to target complexes through simple synthetic steps under mild conditions. In this review, the main gold&#8208;NHC synthons employed in organometallic synthesis are discussed.

         <title>Heterocyclic Merging of Stereochemically Diverse Chiral Piperazines and Morpholines with Indazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a heterocyclic merging approach to construct novel indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines. Starting from chiral diamines and amino alcohols, novel regiochemically (1,3 and 1,4) and stereochemically diverse (relative and absolute) cohorts of indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines were obtained within 6&#8208;7 steps. The key transformations involved are a Smiles rearrangement to generate the indazole core structure and a late stage Michael addition to build the piperazine and morpholine heterocycles. We further explored additional vector diversity by incorporating substitutions on the indazole aromatic ring, generating a total of 20 unique enantiomerically pure heterocyclic scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Polarity of Antibiotic&#8208;Cy5 Conjugates Enables Highly Selective Labeling of Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study on 13 new antibiotic&#8208;Cy5 dye conjugates derived from ampicillin, erythromycin, trimethoprim, and vancomycin revealed that in particular the incorporation of Cy5 dyes of low polarity leads to significantly improved properties regarding photostability, optical brightness, and distinctiveness. In turn, the related conjugates could be identified as outstanding tools for a variety of studies including fluorescence and super&#8208;resolution spectroscopy, differentiation of Gram+/&#8208; bacteria and competition binding.







Abstract
Multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria pose a major threat to global health, even as newly introduced antibiotics continue to lose their therapeutic value. Against this background, deeper insights into bacterial interaction with antibiotic drugs are urgently required, whereas fluorescently labeled drug conjugates can serve as highly valuable tools. Herein, the preparation and biological evaluation of 13&#8197;new fluorescent antibiotic&#8208;Cy5 dye conjugates is described, in which the tuning of the polarity of the Cy5 dye proved to be a key element to achieve highly favorable properties for various fields of application.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Computational Study of the Organocatalytic Umpolung of Bromocations: An Accelerated Stereoselective Dibromination Protocol
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly developed method towards the in&#8197;situ umpolung of cationic bromine from N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) using an amine organocatalyst is reported. The intermediate reagents and their reactivity have well been characterised by spectroscopic and computational methods. Strategic structural change in the NBS molecule can cause sufficient polarity reversal to accelerate the dibromination reaction needing both &#8220;Br&#8221; synthons. This has further been utilised in an accelerated dibromination reaction of olefins with a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Herein, organocatalytically achieved polarity reversal of cationic bromine is presented. The proven bromocation source N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) was converted to a superior bromoanion reagent by H/Br exchange with a secondary amine, substantiated with spectroscopic and computational evidence. The concept has further been used in a successfully accelerated organocatalyzed dibromination of olefins in a non&#8208;hazardous, commercially viable process with a wide range of substrate scope. The reactivity of key entities observed through NMR kinetics and reaction acceleration using only 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% of catalyst account for its major success. The nucleophilicity of the bromoanion was found to be superior in comparison to other nucleophiles such as MeOH and H2O also the protocol dominates over the competing allylic bromination reaction.

         <title>The Role of the Amino Acid Molecular Characteristics on the Formation of Fluorescent Gold&#8208; and Silver&#8208;Based Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent gold and silver nanoclusters: Formation of few&#8208;atomic (5&#8211;7 atoms) metallic nanoclusters having molecular&#8208;like behaviour and intense fluorescence features is confirmed for Phe, Arg and Gln amino acids. Relatively high QY% (&#8764;18&#8201;%) was obtained for Arg&#8208;AuNCs which is outstanding value among the small molecule&#8208;stabilized Au NCs published in the literature so far.







Abstract
Role of amino acids like L&#8208;phenylalanine (Phe), L&#8208;glutamine (Gln) and L&#8208;arginine (Arg) is described and interpreted in terms of their potential for preparation of fluorescent molecular&#8208;like gold and silver nanostructures. We are among the first to demonstrate the effect of syntheses conditions as well as the molecular characteristics of Phe, Gln and Arg amino acids on the structure of the formed products. Comprehensive optical characterizations (lifetime, quantum yield (QY%)) of the blue&#8208;emitting products were also carried out. It was confirmed that for all Au&#8208;containing samples and for Gln&#8208;Ag system the characteristic fluorescence originates from few&#8208;atomic metallic nanoclusters (NCs) where the reduction of metal ions was promoted by citrate in some cases. Relatively high QY% (&#8764;18&#8201;%) was obtained for Arg&#8208;stabilized Au NCs due to the existence of an electrostatic interaction between the electron rich, positively charged guanidium side chain of Arg and the negatively charged carboxylate group of citrate on the metallic surface. Size and structural analysis of the products were evaluated by infrared measurements and dynamic light scattering techniques.

         <title>Anthradithiophene (ADT)&#8208;Based Polymerized Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable monomer called ADT, easily synthesized from cheap starting materials in high yield via simple filtration through basic alumina, was used as the electron&#8208;rich building block in polymerized non&#8208;fullerene molecular acceptors. ADT may serve as an electron&#8208;rich monomer for more green and scalable organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Realizing efficient all&#8208;polymer solar cell (APSC) acceptors typically involves increased building block synthetic complexity, hence potentially unscalable syntheses and/or prohibitive costs. Here we report the synthesis, characterization, and implementation in APSCs of three new polymer acceptors P1&#8211;P3 using a scalable donor fragment, bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)anthra[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;5,6&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;4,10&#8208;dicarboxylate (ADT) co&#8208;polymerized with the high&#8208;efficiency acceptor units, NDI, Y6, and IDIC. All three copolymers have comparable photophysics to known polymers; however, APSCs fabricated by blending P1, P2 and P3 with donor polymers PM5 and PM6 exhibit modest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), with the champion P2&#8208;based APSC achieving PCE=5.64&#8201;%. Detailed morphological and microstructural analysis by AFM and GIWAXS reveal a non&#8208;optimal APSC active layer morphology, which suppresses charge transport. Despite the modest efficiencies, these APSCs demonstrate the feasibility of using ADT as a scalable and inexpensive electron rich/donor building block for APSCs.

         <title>FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S: A Sulfur&#8208;Pnictogen Four&#8208;Membered Ring with 6&#960; Electrons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elusive 6&#960;&#8208;electron four&#8208;membered ring compound FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S is prepared, and it can undergo ring&#8208;opening to the thiazyl isomer FPNSN upon irradiation at 550&#8197;nm.

Abstract
The new 6&#960;&#8208;electron four&#8208;membered ring compound 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#955;2,2,4,3&#955;3&#8208;thiadiazaphosphetidine, FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S, has been generated in the gas phase through high&#8208;vacuum flash pyrolysis (HVFP) of thiophosphoryl diazide, FP(S)(N3)2, at 1000&#8197;K. Subsequent isolation of FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S in cryogenic matrices (Ar, Ne, and N2) allows its characterization with matrix&#8208;isolation IR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy by combination with 15N&#8208;isotope labeling and computations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/VTZ&#8208;F12 level of theory. Upon visible&#8208;light irradiation at 550&#8197;nm, this cyclic compound undergoes ring&#8208;opening to the thiazyl isomer FPNSN, followed by dissociation to FP and SN2 under subsequent UV&#8208;irradiation at 365&#8197;nm. In sharp contrast to the square planar structure for the isolobal four&#8208;membered ring S2N2, a puckered structure with significant biradical character has been found for FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S.

         <title>Smart Wearable Patches Using Light&#8208;Controlled Activation and Delivery of Photoswitchable Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This unique proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy is the first to combine photoisomerization and photocaging to regulate antibacterial activity and reduce toxicity. Concomitant light&#8208;controlled activation and delivery of an active antimicrobial peptide from a wearable patch via photolysis of a photocleavable linker allows topical delivery to the site of infection. The active agent can be deactivated immediately, potentially minimizing antimicrobial resistance.







Abstract
A novel strategy to treat Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) skin infections is presented, where UV light is used to facilitate concomitant light&#8208;controlled activation and delivery of an antimicrobial therapeutic agent. Specifically, a new photoswitchable gramicidin S analogue was immobilized onto a polymeric wearable patch via a photocleavable linker that undergoes photolysis at the same wavelength of light required for activation of the peptide. Unlike toxic gramicidin S, the liberated active photoswitchable peptide exhibits antimicrobial activity against S. aureus while being ostensibly non&#8208;haemolytic to red blood cells. Moreover, irradiation with visible light switches off the antimicrobial properties of the peptide within seconds, presenting an ideal strategy to regulate antibiotic activity for localized bacterial infections with the potential to mitigate resistance.

         <title>External Flash Generation of Carbenoids Enables Monodeuteration of Dihalomethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High monodeuteration efficiency has been achieved by flash generation of active intermediate and the subsequent external quenching by deuteration reagent with suppressing decomposition of the intermediate (external generation method), which has been achieved under microflow conditions with rapid mixing.







Abstract
In this study, incorporation of one deuterium atom was achieved by H&#8722;D exchange of one of the two identical methylene protons in various dihalomethanes (halogen=Cl, Br, and I) through a rapid&#8208;mixing microflow reaction of lithium diisopropylamide as a strong base and deuterated methanol as a deuteration reagent. Generation of highly unstable carbenoid intermediate and suppression of its decomposition were successfully controlled under high flow&#8208;rate conditions. Monofunctionalization of diiodomethane afforded various building blocks composed of boryl, stannyl, and silyl groups. The monodeuterated diiodomethane, which served as a deuterated C1 source, was subsequently subjected to diverted functionalization methods to afford various products including biologically important molecules bearing isotope labelling at specific positions and homologation products with monodeuteration.

         <title>Non&#8208;Conjugated Bis&#8208;(Dithienylethene)&#8208;Naphthalenediimide as a Dynamic Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Agent: Driving the Wheel of Photoswitching Enactment</title>

         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;conjugated bis&#8208;(dithienylethene)&#8208;naphthalenediimide based photo&#8208;responsive molecule is reported, having photoinduced electron transfer regulated enhancement of fluorescence property upon photocyclization, which can be utilized in secret code encryption&#8208;decryption and erasable ink applications.







Abstract
Photochromic fluorescent molecules dramatically extend their fields of applications ranging from optical memories, bioimaging, photoswitches, photonic devices, anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology and many more. Here, we have logically designed and synthesized a triazole appended bis&#8208;(dithienylethene)&#8208;naphthalenediimide based photo&#8208;responsive material, 5, which demonstrated fluorescence enhancement property upon photocyclization (&#934;F=0.42), with high photocyclization (44&#8197;s, ksolution=0.0355&#8197;s&#8722;1, ksolid=0.0135&#8197;s&#8722;1) and photocycloreversion (160&#8197;s, ksolution=0.0181&#8197;s&#8722;1, ksolid=0.0085&#8197;s&#8722;1) rate and decent photoreaction quantum yield (&#934;o&#8594;c=0.93 and &#934;c&#8594;o=0.11). The open isomer almost converted to the closed isomer at photo&#8208;stationary state (PSS) with distinct color change from colorless to blue with 92.85&#8201;% conversion yield. A reversible noninvasive modulation of fluorescence through efficient photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process was observed both in solution as well as in solid state. The fluorescence modulation through PET process was further corroborated with thermodynamic calculations using the Rehm&#8211;Weller equation and quantum chemical studies (DFT). The thermally stable compound 5 exhibits high fatigue resistance property (up to 50&#8197;cycles) both in solution and solid state. Furthermore, the compound 5 was successfully applied as erasable ink and in deciphering secret codes (Quick Response/bar code) portending potential promising application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

Abstract
A series of donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) compounds based on naphthalendiimide (NDI) and perylenediimide (PDI) central cores combined with triphenylamine and phenylcarbazole donor groups have been synthesized, characterized and tested in top&#8208;contact/bottom gate organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). The results showed high electron mobilities, up to 0.3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, in the case of NDI derivatives and moderate values of around 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for PDI&#8208;based semiconductors. Quantum chemical calculations were performed in order to support the experimental data. The results suggest that adequate molecular characteristics and larger crystalline domains in NDI vs. PDI semiconducting films may be the reasons behind the enhanced electrical properties of NDI derivatives. Furthermore, when the lateral donor substituents are triphenylamine groups, the mobilities were slightly higher in comparison to phenylcarbazole donor groups due to an improved electron&#8208;donating character. Other characterization techniques, such as AFM, X&#8208;ray diffraction or spectroelectrochemistry, among others, have been performed to analyze supramolecular order, charge carriers&#8217; nature and stability, parameters closely related to charge transport characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;A series of donor-&#960;-acceptor-&#960;-donor (D-&#960;-A-&#960;-D) compounds based on naphthalendiimide (&lt;b&gt;NDI&lt;/b&gt;) and perylenediimide (&lt;b&gt;PDI&lt;/b&gt;) central cores combined with triphenylamine and phenylcarbazole donor groups have been synthesized, characterized and tested in top-contact/bottom gate organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). The results showed high electron mobilities, up to 0.3&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, in the case of &lt;b&gt;NDI&lt;/b&gt; derivatives and moderate values of around 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;b&gt;PDI&lt;/b&gt;-based semiconductors. Quantum chemical calculations were performed in order to support the experimental data. The results suggest that adequate molecular characteristics and larger crystalline domains in &lt;b&gt;NDI&lt;/b&gt; vs. &lt;b&gt;PDI&lt;/b&gt; semiconducting films may be the reasons behind the enhanced electrical properties of &lt;b&gt;NDI&lt;/b&gt; derivatives. Furthermore, when the lateral donor substituents are triphenylamine groups, the mobilities were slightly higher in comparison to phenylcarbazole donor groups due to an improved electron-donating character. Other characterization techniques, such as AFM, X-ray diffraction or spectroelectrochemistry, among others, have been performed to analyze supramolecular order, charge carriers&#8217; nature and stability, parameters closely related to charge transport characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Helical Azaheptalene and Chiroptical Switching of an Isolable Radical Cation
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N&#8208;centered helical heptalene, azaheptalene, was synthesized by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction. Since the azaheptalene skeleton shows configurationally stable helicity, enantiomers could be successfully separated. Moreover, thanks to the electron&#8208;donating N atom, such helical azaheptalene with two bromine atoms undergoes one&#8208;electron oxidation to produce radical cation species with a drastic chiroptical response.







Abstract
A nitrogen&#8208;centered heptalene, azaheptalene, was designed as a representative of a new class of redox&#8208;responsive molecules with a large steric strain that originates from the adjacent seven&#8208;membered rings. The pentabenzo derivative of azaheptalene was efficiently synthesized by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of commercially available reagents. Bromination led to mono&#8208; and dibrominated derivatives, the latter of which is interconvertible with isolable radical cation species exhibiting near&#8208;infrared absorption. Since the azaheptalene skeleton shows configurationally stable helicity with a large torsion angle, enantiomers could be successfully separated. Thus, optically pure azaheptalenes with P&#8208; or M&#8208;helicity showed strong chiroptical properties (|gabs|&#8805;0.01), which could be changed by an electric potential.

         <title>Light&#8208;Cleavable Auxiliary for Diselenide&#8211;Selenoester Ligations of Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward access to seleno&#8208;based light&#8208;cleavable auxiliaries, including diverse amino acids, facilitates access to challenging protein targets via diselenide&#8211;selenoester ligations (DSL) and expressed protein selenoester ligations (EPSL).







Abstract
Diselenide&#8211;selenoester ligations are increasingly used for the synthesis of proteins. Excellent ligation rates, even at low concentrations, in combination with mild and selective deselenization conditions can overcome some of the most severe challenges in chemical protein synthesis. Herein, the versatile multicomponent synthesis and application of a new ligation auxiliary that combines a photocleavable scaffold with the advantages of selenium&#8208;based ligation strategies are presented. Its use was investigated with respect to different ligation junctions and describe a novel para&#8208;methoxybenzyl deprotection reaction for the selenol moiety. The glycine&#8208;based auxiliary enabled successful synthesis of the challenging target protein G&#8208;CSF.

         <title>Stability and Reversible Oxidation of Sub&#8208;Nanometric Cu5 Metal Clusters: Integrated Experimental Study and Theoretical Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bare clusters of five Cu atoms, synthesized electrochemically, display remarkable oxidation stability on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. They exhibit reversible O2 adsorption, transitioning between various Cu oxidation states with changes in temperature and O2 pressure. In&#8208;situ XPS and XANES spectroscopy experiments, along with theoretical characterizations of Cu5&#8211;(O2)n complexes, provide direct evidence of the Cu5 clusters&#8217; O2 stability.

         <title>Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation as a Key Step in the Synthesis of the Phosphonic Acid Analogues to Aminocarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Aminophosphonic acids have a remarkably broad bioactivity spectrum. They can function as highly efficient transition state mimics for a variety of hydrolytic and angiotensin&#8208;converting enzymes, which makes them interesting target structures for synthetic chemists. Especially the phosphonic acid analogues to &#945;&#8208;aminocarboxylic acids (PaAAs) are potent enzyme inhibitors, but many of them are only available by chiral or enzymatic resolutions, sometimes only one enantiomer is accessible, and several have never been prepared in enantiopure form at all. Today, a variety of methods to access enantiopure &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic acids are known but none of the reported approaches can be generally applied for the synthesis of PaAAs. Here we show that the phosphonic acid analogues to many (proteinogenic) &#945;&#8208;amino acids become accessible by the catalytic, stereoselective asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates. The obtained highly enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates (enantiomeric excess [ee] &#8805; 98%) are important pharmaceutical building blocks themselves and could be easily converted to &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic acids in most studied cases. Even stereoselectively deuterated analogues became easily accessible from the same &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates using formic acid (DCO2H).</dc:description>

         <title>The Rise of Structurally Anisotropic Plasmonic Janus Gold Nanostars</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructures intrinsically possessing two different structural or functional features, often called Janus nanoparticles, are emerging as a potential material for sensing, catalysis, and biomedical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of plasmonic gold Janus nanostars (NSs) possessing a smooth concave pentagonal morphology with sharp tips and edges on one side and, contrastingly, a crumbled morphology on the other. The methodology reported herein for its synthesis using a single&#8208;step growth reaction is unique to any other Janus nanoparticle preparation involving either template&#8208;assisted growth or a masking technique.&#160;&#160;Interestingly, a coexistence of lower and higher index facets has been found in these Janus NSs.&#160;&#160;The general paradigm for synthesizing Au Janus NSs was investigated by understanding the mechanism of its kinetic control with the combinatorial effect of all the reagents responsible for its structure. Optical property of the Janus NSs has been realized by corelating their extinction spectrum with the simulated data. The size&#8208;dependent surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity of these Janus NSs has been studied with 1,4&#8208;BDT as the model analyte. Finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain (FDTD) simulations for different sized particles revealed the distribution of electromagnetic hot&#8208;spots over the particles resulting in the enhancement of the&#160;SERS&#160;signal in a size dependent manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Subsequent Molecular Conversion to Control Photoluminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) has attracted interest because it alters the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) wavelength and emission efficiency. These modifications depend on the binding configuration and degree of functionalization. Excessive functionalization reduces the emission efficiency as the integrity of the conjugated&#160;p&#8208;system decreases, making controlling the degree of functionalization essential. Because the binding configurations and degree of functionalization are affected by the reagent structure, a stepwise approach combining functionalization reactions of SWNTs and subsequent reactions to introduce functional groups into the addenda could effectively control their PL properties and functionalities. We studied this approach by implementing the reductive alkylation of SWNTs using bromoalkanes with&#160;t&#8208;butyl carbamate (Boc)&#8208;protected amino groups and subsequent deprotection and amidation reactions. The reaction products were analyzed based on absorption, PL, and Raman spectroscopy and the Kaiser test. Depending on the structure of the reagent, deprotection and amidation reactions competed with the elimination reaction of addenda, changing the PL properties of the SWNTs. Furthermore, the elimination reaction was inhibited in the adducts functionalized with dibromoalkane with Boc&#8208;protected amino groups, demonstrating that the use of appropriate reagents enables molecular conversion of the functional groups of SWNT adducts without affecting their PL properties.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Silylated Dihydroquinazolinone as a Photocatalytic Energy Transfer Enabled Radical Hydrosilylation Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful development of a photoinduced silyl radical addition reaction by using 2&#8208;silylated dihydroquinazolinone as a silyl radical precursor is presented. Hydrosilylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkene and styrene substrates resulted in addition products in good to high yield. The herein discussed energy transfer type silyl radical precursors will be suitable for hydrosilylation reactions as well as further radical addition reactions.







Abstract
The hydrosilylation of alkenes is one of the most important methods for the synthesis of organosilicon compounds. In addition to the platinum&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation, silyl radical addition reactions are notable as economic reactions. An efficient and widely applicable silyl radical addition reaction was developed by using 2&#8208;silylated dihydroquinazolinone derivatives under photocatalytic conditions. Electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and styrene derivatives underwent hydrosilylation to give addition products in good to high yields. Mechanistic studies indicated that the photocatalyst functioned not as a photoredox catalyst but as an energy transfer catalyst. DFT calculations clarified that the triplet excited state of 2&#8208;silylated dihydroquinazolinone derivatives released a silyl radical through the homolytic cleavage of a carbon&#8208;silicon bond, and this was followed by the hydrogen atom transfer pathway, not the redox pathway.

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;1&#8208;Piperidonyl amides were firstly oxidized by mCPBA from N&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyl amides. The new developed method was also extended to Rimonabant analogue, N&#8208;(piperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamide, and N&#8208;(azepan&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzamide, especially for Rimonabant analogue. This work presented a significant advancement in the synthesis of oxidized N&#8208;1&#8208;piperidonyl amides that had important implications for the further development of potential drugs and the study of the oxidized metabolite.







Abstract
A simple and efficient one&#8208;pot oxidation synthesis of N&#8208;1&#8208;piperidonyl amides was successfully developed through the double oxidation of hydrazides (involving hydrazonium formation, azodioxy&#8208;carbonyl compounds generation, and &#945;&#8208;carbon oxidation) by using meta&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA). The convenient oxidation method was also extended to Rimonabant analogue. The lactam oxidized Rimonabant analogue was first successfully synthesized for demonstrating the construction and characterized by NMR spectroscopic methods and the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study (ORTEP).

The hand in the cover depicts how spin&#8208;crossover&#8208;active CoII complexes are held together by noncovalent fluorine&#8208;specific interactions between the perfluorinated alkyl chains on the ligand backbone. Once the hand releases the molecules into certain solvents, the fluorine&#8208;specific interactions are broken up through preferential interactions with the solvent molecules, which are present in large excess.

         <title>A Dormant Reagent Reaction&#8208;Diffusion Method for the Generation of Co&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogue Periodic Precipitate Particle Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction&#8211;diffusion system forms a library of different&#8208;size catalytically active Prussian Blue analogue (PBA) particles at each generation of the precipitation pattern. The trick to creating a library of such a highly insoluble product is to add the reactants together (uncommon in an RD system), keeping one as a &#8220;dormant&#8221; citrate complex and activating on demand with strong acid diffusion (center). More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Baytekin and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301261).

         <title>Capture and Stabilization of the Hydroxyl Radical in a Uranyl Peroxide Cluster
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A uranyl peroxide cluster has been synthesized that is capable of stabilizing the hydroxyl radical for more than a week in both solution and the solid state. The cluster has been structurally and spectroscopically characterized including with deuterated materials, which indicate the origin of the free radicals is from the breakdown of H2O2, and this demonstrates that radiolysis products in spent nuclear fuel may interact with actinide species.







Abstract
Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of a new uranyl peroxide cluster (UPC), U60Ox30*, which captures and stabilizes oxygen&#8208;based free radicals for more than one week. These radical species were first detected with a nitroblue tetrazolium colorimetric assay and U60Ox30* was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as infrared (IR), Raman, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Identification of the free radicals present in U60Ox30* was done via room temperature solid and solution state X&#8208;band EPR studies using spin trapping methods. The spin trapping agent 5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;pyrroline N&#8208;oxide (DMPO) was definitive for identifying the free radicals in U60Ox30*, which are hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) that are stable for up to ten days that also persist upon addition of the metalloenzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase. Addition of the spin trapping agent &#945;&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl N&#8208;oxide)&#8208;N&#8208;tert&#8208;butylnitrone (POBN) further confirmed the radicals were oxygen based, and deuteration experiments showed that the origin of the free radicals was from the decomposition of H2O2 in water. These results demonstrate that highly oxidizing species such as the &#8901;OH radical can be stabilized in UPCs, which alters our understanding of the role of free radicals present in spent nuclear fuel.

     alt="Capture and Stabilization of the Hydroxyl Radical in a Uranyl Peroxide Cluster**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A uranyl peroxide cluster&lt;/b&gt; has been synthesized that is capable of stabilizing the hydroxyl radical for more than a week in both solution and the solid state. The cluster has been structurally and spectroscopically characterized including with deuterated materials, which indicate the origin of the free radicals is from the breakdown of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and this demonstrates that radiolysis products in spent nuclear fuel may interact with actinide species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of a new uranyl peroxide cluster (UPC), &lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;Ox&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;, which captures and stabilizes oxygen-based free radicals for more than one week. These radical species were first detected with a nitroblue tetrazolium colorimetric assay and &lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;Ox&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;*&lt;/b&gt; was characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction as well as infrared (IR), Raman, UV-Vis-NIR, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Identification of the free radicals present in &lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;Ox&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;*&lt;/b&gt; was done via room temperature solid and solution state X-band EPR studies using spin trapping methods. The spin trapping agent 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) was definitive for identifying the free radicals in &lt;b&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;Ox&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;, which are hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) that are stable for up to ten days that also persist upon addition of the metalloenzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase. Addition of the spin trapping agent &#945;-(4-pyridyl N-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN) further confirmed the radicals were oxygen based, and deuteration experiments showed that the origin of the free radicals was from the decomposition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in water. These results demonstrate that highly oxidizing species such as the &#8901;OH radical can be stabilized in UPCs, which alters our understanding of the role of free radicals present in spent nuclear fuel.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Comprehensive Study and Development of a Metal&#8208;Free and Mild Nucleophilic Trifluoromethoxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free trifluoromethoxylation by nucleophilic substitution under mild conditions was developed based on the inexpensive DNTFB/DMAP system. An efficient rationalization was developed to propose optimal conditions depending on the characteristics of the starting substrates. A mechanistic study proved the crucial role of potassium salts in the transient formation of the CF3OK species, which has promising properties.







Abstract
Among the general interest in fluorinated compounds, trifluoromethoxylated molecules play a specific role. However, despite this interest, the development of efficient reagents to perform trifluoromethoxylation reactions remains a challenge. Here, 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB) is used as a trifluoromethoxylating reagent to perform nucleophilic substitution under mild metal&#8208;free conditions with different leaving groups, including direct dehydroxytrifluoromethoxylation. A mechanistic study rationalized the reaction and subsequently proposed only three reaction conditions, depending on the reactivity of the starting substrates.

         <title>The Best of Both Worlds: Combining the Power of MICs and WCAs to generate Stable and Crystalline CrI&#8208;tetracarbonyl Complexes with 
Accepting Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of two isomeric pyridyl&#8208;MIC chromium(I) tetracarbonyl complexes, which were fully characterized by IR&#8208; and EPR&#8208;spectroscopy and compared with their electrochemical&#8208;generated analogues is presented. Furthermore, theoretical calculations were conducted to get detailed information about the electronic structure of these rare complexes. This is the first time Cr(I) complexes with &#960;&#8208;acceptor ligands have been isolated and crystallographically characterized.







Abstract
Here we present stable and crystalline chromium(I) tetracarbonyl complexes with pyridyl&#8208;MIC (MIC=mesoionic carbene) ligands and weakly coordinating anions (WCA=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;, RF=C(CF3)3 and BArF=[B(ArF)4]&#8722;, ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3). The complexes were fully characterized via crystallographic, spectroscopic and theoretical methods. The influence of counter anions on the IR and EPR spectroscopic properties of the CrI complexes was investigated, and the electronic innocence versus non&#8208;innocence of WCAs was probed. These are the first examples of stable and crystalline [Cr(CO)4]+ complexes with a chelating 
accepting ligand, and the data presented here are of relevance for both the photochemical and the electrochemical properties of these classes of compounds.

         <title>Hantzsch Ester as Efficient and Economical NAD(P)H Mimic for In Vitro Bioredox Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically stable Hantzsch ester is discovered to be an efficient and economical NAD(P)H mimic as sacrificial electron source in in&#8197;vitro bioconversions.







Abstract
Biocatalysis has emerged as a valuable and reliable tool for industrial and academic societies, particularly in fields related to bioredox reactions. The cost of cofactors, especially those needed to be replenished at stoichiometric amounts or more, is the chief economic concern for bioredox reactions. In this study, a readily accessible, inexpensive, and bench&#8208;stable Hantzsch ester is verified as the viable and efficient NAD(P)H mimic by four enzymatic redox transformations, including two non&#8208;heme diiron N&#8208;oxygenases and two flavin&#8208;dependent reductases. This finding provides the potential to significantly reduce the costs of NAD(P)H&#8208;relying bioredox reactions.

         <title>Degradation of Penicillinic Antibiotics and &#946;&#8208;Lactamase Enzymatic Catalysis in a Biomimetic Zn&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), capable to catalyze the selective hydrolysis of the &#946;&#8208;Lactam antibiotics amoxicillin and ceftriaxone is reported. Remarkably, the MOF degrades, very efficiently, the four&#8208;membered &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of amoxicillin, acting as a &#946;&#8208;lactamase mimic and expands the very limited number of MOFs capable to mimic catalytic enzymatic processes. The whole process is unveiled by SCXRD and DFT calculations.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Lactam antibiotics are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs to treat bacterial infections. However, their use has been somehow limited given the emergence of bacteria with resistance mechanisms, such as &#946;&#8208;lactamases, which inactivate them by degrading their four&#8208;membered &#946;&#8208;lactam rings. So, a total knowledge of the mechanisms governing the catalytic activity of &#946;&#8208;lactamases is required. Here, we report a novel Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, 1), possessing functional channels capable to accommodate and interact with antibiotics, which catalyze the selective hydrolysis of the penicillinic antibiotics amoxicillin and ceftriaxone. In particular, MOF 1 degrades, very efficiently, the four&#8208;membered &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of amoxicillin, acting as a &#946;&#8208;lactamase mimic, and expands the very limited number of MOFs capable to mimic catalytic enzymatic processes. Combined single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies and density functional (DFT) calculations offer unique snapshots on the host&#8208;guest interactions established between amoxicillin and the functional channels of 1. This allows to propose a degradation mechanism based on the activation of a water molecule, promoted by a Zn&#8208;bridging hydroxyl group, concertedly to the nucleophilic attack to the carbonyl moiety and the cleaving of C&#8722;N bond of the lactam ring.

The first crystal structure of the metastable hexalacunary Wells&#8208;Dawson [&#945;&#8208;H2P2W12O48]12&#8722; ({P2W12}). By using a proper combination of counter cations, the anion selectively transforms into a {WO(OH2)}4+&#8208;bridged Pacman&#8208;shaped [{WO(OH2)}(&#945;&#8208;HP2W12O48)2]22&#8722; ({P4W25}) dimer or a cyclic [{WO(OH2)}3(P2W12O48)3]30&#8722; ({P6W39}) trimer without coordination to transition metal cations.







Abstract
We report the first single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural evidence of the potassium salt of the hexalacunary [&#945;&#8208;H2P2W12O48]12&#8722; (abbreviated as {P2W12}) anion after its discovery by Contant and Ciabrini in 1977. In addition, we observed oligomerization of {P2W12} into a {WO(OH2)}4+&#8208;bridged Pacman&#8208;shaped [{WO(OH2)}(&#945;&#8208;HP2W12O48)2]22&#8722; ({P4W25}) dimer and a cyclic [{WO(OH2)}3(P2W12O48)3]30&#8722; ({P6W39}) trimer. The three phosphotungstate anions were synthesized through recrystallization of (NH4)12[&#945;&#8208;H2P2W12O48] from slightly alkaline (HOCH2)3CNH2/KCl, CH3NH3Cl/KCl, and CH3NH3Cl/NH4Cl solutions. The structure of {P2W12} is derived from [&#945;&#8208;P2W18O62]6&#8722; that has six tungsten atoms one from each polar group and four from the belt&#8211;removed, and the center of the lacunary site is capped by a potassium cation. Structures of {P4W25} and {P6W39} are constructed by connecting two and three {P2W12} units with {WO(OH2)}4+, respectively. The isolation of a pure {P6W39} phosphotungstate framework without coordination with transition metal cations is unprecedented. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed the bulk purity of these compounds, indicating that selective crystallization was achieved through the selection of countercations and pH.

         <title>A Quadruple Catalysis Enabling Intermolecular Branch&#8208;Selective Hydroacylation of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadruple N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene/cobalt/photoredox/Br&#248;nsted base catalysis is demonstrated, realizing branch&#8208;selective hydroacylation of styrenes with aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes. This protocol allows to access branched ketones from readily available materials in an atom&#8208;economical manner. The quadruple catalysis can transfer a formyl hydrogen of aldehydes as hydrogen radical equivalent onto terminal carbon of alkene by controlled electron and proton transfers.

         <title>Dissymmetric Triaryltriazines: Small Mass Columnar Glasses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cotrimerization of complementary benzonitriles leads to dissymmetric triaryltriazines that form anisotropic mesomorphic luminescent glasses at very small molecular weight.







Abstract
Columnar liquid crystals with very small molecular masses that form anisotropic glasses well above room temperature are obtained by mixed dissymmetric substitution of sym&#8208;triazine with ester&#8208;bearing phenyl and phenanthryl or tetrahelicenyl moieties. The combination of low molecular symmetry with configurational flexibility and short polar ester moieties stabilizes the mesophase over large temperature ranges and induces pronounced calorimetric glass transitions within the anisotropic fluid despite the smallness of the molecules. In contrast to more symmetrical homologs, no ester tails longer than ethyl are necessary to induce the liquid crystalline state, allowing for the near&#8208;absence of any insulating and weight&#8208;increasing alkyl periphery. Films drop&#8208;cast from solution show in all cases emission spectra that do not show significant change of fluorescence emission upon annealing, indicating that the columnar hexagonal mesoscopic order is obtained directly upon deposition from solution and is resistant to crystallization upon annealing.

         <title>Inept N2 Activation of Tri&#8208;Nuclear Nickel Complex with Labile Sulfur Ligands Facilitates Selective N2H4 Formation in Electrocatalytic Conversion of N2
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction: This work delineates the mechanism for electrochemical nitrogen reduction and competing Hydrogen evolution over a tri&#8208;nuclear Ni molecular catalyst [Ni3S8]2&#8722; by conducting a DFT study. Its interesting selectivity towards N2H4 over NH3 was reflected by our calculated pathways. We suggest weak N2 activation by Ni is responsible for such unusual selectivity.







Abstract
Conversion of N2 to the energy vector N2H4 under benign conditions is highly desirable. However, such N2 fixation processes are extremely rare. It has been recently reported that N2 to N2H4 conversion can be achieved electrochemically by using a trinuclear [Ni3(S2C3H6)4]2&#8722; complex (named as [Ni3S8]2&#8722;). There are hardly any precedents of Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) by molecular catalysts having Ni and the highly unusual selectivity for N2H4 over NH3 makes this electrochemical reduction unique. A systematic theoretical study employing calibrated Density Functional Theory to unearth the mechanisms of NRR (4e&#8722;/4H+) and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (2e&#8722;/2H+) was conducted for the aforementioned trinuclear Ni complex. Our findings unravel a curious case of ligand lability working in tandem with metal centers in facilitating this unprecedented electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, it is shown that the poor N&#8722;N bond activation property of Ni is responsible for this unusual selectivity. Additionally, the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) mechanistic pathways have also been delineated in this report.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Electrochemical nitrogen reduction&lt;/b&gt;: This work delineates the mechanism for electrochemical nitrogen reduction and competing Hydrogen evolution over a tri-nuclear Ni molecular catalyst [Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; by conducting a DFT study. Its interesting selectivity towards N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; over NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was reflected by our calculated pathways. We suggest weak N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation by Ni is responsible for such unusual selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversion of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the energy vector N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; under benign conditions is highly desirable. However, such N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation processes are extremely rare. It has been recently reported that N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion can be achieved electrochemically by using a trinuclear [Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; complex (named as [Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). There are hardly any precedents of Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) by molecular catalysts having Ni and the highly unusual selectivity for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; over NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; makes this electrochemical reduction unique. A systematic theoretical study employing calibrated Density Functional Theory to unearth the mechanisms of NRR (4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) was conducted for the aforementioned trinuclear Ni complex. Our findings unravel a curious case of ligand lability working in tandem with metal centers in facilitating this unprecedented electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, it is shown that the poor N&#8722;N bond activation property of Ni is responsible for this unusual selectivity. Additionally, the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) mechanistic pathways have also been delineated in this report. The mechanistic intricacies thus unearthed in this study may assist in developing more efficient electrocatalysts for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; production through NRR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aggregation Behavior of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation of a cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane was first observed and analyzed in this work. It was clarified that [3]rotaxane forms a hexagonal packing type aggregation derived from hydrogen bond formation among CD units in a similar manner to polyrotaxane species. This aggregation could be controlled by solvent type on dispersion treatment, axle end structures, and modification of CD.







Abstract
The aggregation of a cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane has been observed and analyzed in detail for the first time in this work. Although the hexagonal packing aggregation of CD&#8208;based polyrotaxane is a well known phenomenon, corresponding studies in terms of rotaxanes without any polymer structure have not been conducted so far, probably owing to the difficulty of the molecular design. We synthesized a series of [3]rotaxane species by using a urea&#8208;end&#8208;capping method and evaluated their aggregation behavior by XRD and SEM measurements. [3]Rotaxane species containing native CD rings showed clear signals assigned to the hexagonal packing by XRD measurement as did polyrotaxane; this proved their aggregation capability. Because the corresponding per&#8208;acetylated derivatives did not show this aggregation behavior, the driving force of this aggregation was suggested to be hydrogen bond formation among CD units. The effect of axle end structures and partial acetylation of CDs were also studied.

         <title>Amide Skeletal Elongation via Amino Acid Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new amide bond activation paradigm through amino acid insertion enabled by two tandem intramolecular rearrangements is reported. This strategy only requires stable and readily available amide and amino acid as the starting materials, which does not need any pre&#8208;functionalization as well as the isolation of reaction intermediates.







Abstract
Amide derivatization is useful to access valuable organic compounds considering the ready availability of molecules containing amide functionality. Current methods to derivatize amide mainly focus on the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds and amines. Incorporating both parts of the initial amide into the new derivatives is rare. Herein, we describe a simple and practical amide derivatization through amino acid insertion to prepare more complex amides. This insertion is applicable to a wide range of amino acids and more importantly, the chiral information is completely conserved during the insertion. Comparison of this insertion strategy with conventional amide synthesis demonstrates the synthetic advantages of this new protocol.

         <title>Staightforward Synthesis of Halopyridine Aldehydes via Diaminomethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel two&#8208;step method for formylation of fluoropyridines with silylformamidine 1 under catalyst&#8208;free conditions was developed. A series of possible 18 fluoropyridines featuring one to four fluorine atoms were subjected to the reaction with 1 existing in equilibrium with its carbenic form 1&#8242;.12 Fluoropyridines were shown to react via C&#8208;H insertion. The reaction proceeded either at &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;positions affording the corresponding aminals. The more fluorine atoms in pyridines, the easier the reaction proceeded. We also hypothesized that the pyridines in which the fluorine was substituted by other halogens would react in a similar manner. To test the hypothesis, a set of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with various combination of halogen atoms was prepared. 3,5&#8208;Difluoropyridine was taken as a compound for comparison. All the pyridines in the series also reacted likewise. In most cases, hydrolysis of the aminals afforded the corresponding aldehydes. As DFT calculations indicate, the reaction mechanism includes deprotonation of pyridine by 1&#8242; as a strong base and the following rearrangement of the formed tight ionic pair to the final product. An alternative reaction pathway involving addition of 1&#8242; to the pyridine carbon with the following hydrogen transfer via a three&#8208;membered transition state structure required much higher activation energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrofluorination of Alkynes: From (E) to (Z)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrofluorination of alkynes is an efficient synthetic route to monofluoroalkenes or difluoroalkanes. Both fluorinated motifs have found applications in medicinal chemistry and beyond. This review explores the recent advances in the hydrofluorination of diverse alkynes through various activation methods, from classical coinage metal catalysis to metal&#8208;free conditions. The range of alkynes goes from the simplest unactivated alkynes to activated ones (ynones and derivatives, ynamides, alkynyl sulfides and sulfones as much as haloalkynes). Regio&#8208; and stereoselective methods exists, but there is still room for improvement depending on the type of alkyne.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterocyclic [9]helicenes exhibiting bright circular polarized luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a concise synthetic strategy for the preparation of heterocyclic [9]helicenes and a simple preparative&#8208;scale protocol for the optical resolution of the resulting M&#8208; and P&#8208;enantiomers. The helicenes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction along with a range of spectroscopic and computational techniques. A fluorescence quantum yield of up to 65% was observed, and the chiroptical properties of both M&#8208; and P&#8208;helicenes revealed large dissymmetry factors. The CPL brightness reaches up to 17 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1, as measured experimentally and verified computationally, which makes this the highest CPL brightness among heterocyclic helicenes. We describe how chiroptical properties (both CD and CPL) can be described and predicted using DFT calculations. The synthetic approach also reveals by&#8208;products that originate from internal oxidation reactions, presumably mediated by the close proximity of the &#960;&#8208;surfaces in the helicene structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Aromatics in Spherical Nanocages.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In general, due to the lack of efficient specific molecular interactions, achieving host&#8208;guest molecular recognition inside large and neutral metal organic cages (MOCs) is challenging. Preferential molecular recognition of aromatics using the internal binding sites of interlocked icosahedral (i.e., spherical) M12L8MOCs within poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenane (1) is reported.

         <title>Mechanical Interlocking to Unlock the Reinforcing Potential of Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) present extraordinary mechanical properties, with Youngs&#8217; modulus &gt; 1 TPa and tensile strength &gt; 50 GPa which makes them ideal candidates as fillers for the reinforcement of polymers. However, the performance of SWNTs in this field has fallen behind expectations. This is due to a combination of imperfect individualization of the SWNTs and poor load transfer from the polymer to the SWNTs. Here, we study the reinforcement of polymers of different chemical nature using mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs). We compare the mechanical properties of fibers made of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polysulfone (PSU) and their composites made with pristine SWNTs, MINTs, and the corresponding supramolecular models. With very low loading of MINTs (0.01% w/w), improvements of more than 100% on Youngs Modulus and the tensile strength are observed for both the nonpolar aliphatic PMMA and the very polar aromatic PSU polymers, while pristine carbon nanotubes and the supramolecular nanofillers showed smaller reinforcement. These data, together with our previous report on the reinforcement of polystyrene (nonpolar and aromatic), indicate that derivatization of SWNTs as MINTs is a valid general strategy to optimize the interaction between SWNT fillers and the polymer matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>Induction and Stabilization of Columnar Mesophases in Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Arene&#8208;Perfluoroarene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The straightforward synthesis of several Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by the efficient, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, arene fluorine nucleophilic substitution reaction is reported, and the full investigation of their liquid crystalline and optical properties reported. The key precursors for this study, i.e. 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dilithio&#8208;4,4',5,5'&#8208;tetraalkoxy&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl alkylated derivatives, were obtained in two steps from the highly selective Scholl oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of 3,4&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;1&#8208;bromobenzene, followed by quantitative double&#8208;lithiation. In situ room temperature nucleophilic annulation with either perfluorobenzene or perfluoronaphthalene leads to 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;6,7,10,11&#8208;tetraalkxoytriphenylenes and 9,10,11,12,13,14&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7&#8208;tetraalkoxybenzo[f]tetraphenes, respectively, in good yields. Exploiting the same strategy, subsequent double annulations resulted in the formation of 9,18&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7,11,12,15,16&#8208;octa(alkoxy)tribenzo[f,k,m]tetraphenes and 9,10,19,20&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7,12,13,16,17&#8208;octakis(hexyloxy)tetrabenzo[a,c,j,l]tetracenes, respectively. Despite the presence of only four alkoxy chains, the polar &#8220;Janus&#8221; mesogens display a columnar hexagonal mesophase over broad temperature ranges, with higher mesophase stability than the archetypical 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexa(alkoxy)triphenylenes and their hydrogenated counterparts. The improvement or induction of mesomorphism is attributed to efficient antiparallel face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacking driven by the establishment of non&#8208;covalent perfluoroarene&#8208;arene intermolecular interactions. The larger lipophilic discotic &#960;&#8208;extended compounds also exhibit columnar mesomorphism, over similar temperature ranges and stability than their hydrogenated homologs. Finally, these fluorinated molecules form stringy gels in various solvents, and show interesting solvatochromic emission properties in solution as well as strong emission in thin films and gels.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;Deoxyenterocin and Attempted Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin has been accomplished starting from pentane&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triol (16 steps in the longest linear sequence, 0.2% overall yield). (&#8722;)&#8208;Menthone served as the source of chirality to distinguish the enantiotopic hydroxymethyl groups of the substrate. Key steps of the synthesis include two aldol reactions to either end of the C5&#8208;skeleton, a diastereoselective hydroxylation reaction and a biomimetic two&#8208;fold intramolecular aldol reaction as the final step. Although this step suffered from geometrical constraints and was low&#8208;yielding (10%), enough synthetic material could be secured to substantiate the relative and absolute configuration of the natural product. Additional experiments were directed toward a C&#8722;H functionalization at carbon atom C5. Despite the fact that several protocols could be successfully applied to (3aR)&#8208;(+)&#8208;scerolide as model substrate, (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin withstood any selective functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>The Rapid Synthesis of Colibactin Warhead Model Compounds Using New Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Cyclopropanation Reactions Facilitates the Investigation of Biological Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of colibactin warhead model compounds using two newly developed metal&#8208;free photocatalytic cyclopropanation reactions. These mild cyclopropanations expand the known applications of eosin within synthesis. A halogen atom transfer reaction mode has been harnessed so that dihalides can be used as the cyclopropanating agents. The colibactin warhead models were then used to provide new insight into two key mechanisms in colibactin chemistry. An explanation is provided for why the colibactin warhead sometimes undergoes a ring expansion&#8208;addition reaction to give fused cyclobutyl products while at other times nucleophiles add directly to the cyclopropyl unit (as when DNA adds to colibactin). Finally, we provide some evidence that Cu(II) chelated to colibactin may catalyze an important oxidation of the colibactin&#8208;DNA adduct. The Cu(I) generated as a result could then also play a role in inducing double strand breaks in DNA.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>To ESPT, or not to ESPT. The effective utilization of luminescent dyes often relies on a comprehensive understanding of their excitation and relaxation pathways. One such pathway, Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT), involves the tautomerization of the dye in its excited state, resulting in a new structure that exhibits distinct emission properties, such as a very large Stokes' shift or dual&#8208;emission. Although the ESPT phenomenon is well&#8208;explained theoretically, its experimental demonstration can be challenging due to the presence of numerous other phenomena that can yield similar experimental observations. In this review, we propose that an all&#8208;encompassing methodology, integrating experimental findings, computational analyses, and a thorough evaluation of diverse mechanisms, is essential for verifying the occurrence of ESPT in luminescent dyes. Investigations have offered significant understanding of the elements impacting the ESPT process and the array of approaches that can be used to validate the existence of ESPT. These discoveries hold crucial ramifications for the advancement of molecular probes, sensors, and other applications that depend on ESPT as a detection mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#8208;mediated photocatalytic chlorine production over bismuth oxychloride in chloride solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the most commonly bulky chemicals, chlorine is conventionally manufactured by electrolysis of NaCl solution in the chlor&#8208;alkali process, which requires a huge supply of electrical energy. The photocatalytic route to produce chlorine using solar energy and&#160;NaCl solution&#160;offers a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption and bring economic benefits. Herein, we found that the introduction of CO2 would enhance the productivity of Cl2 from 8.24 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8722;1 to 39.6 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8722;1 in NaCl solution over BiOCl. Experimental studies reveal that the CO2 species (CO32&#8722;) entered into the crystal texture of BiOCl and the interlayer space between [Bi2O2]2+ slabs were increased and distorted, accelerating the cycle of Cl species. Besides, the cycle of carbonate species also existed and accelerated the reaction efficiency of Cl&#8722; oxidation to Cl2. This work provides a new feasible method of using abundant CO2 resources to accelerate the process of chlorine production via photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Concise Synthetic Approach to Highly Reactive Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Linkers
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular iodolactonization was employed for the efficient and stereoselective conversion of an sTCO click&#8208;conjugation precursor to a highly reactive and stable click&#8208;cleavable sTCO antibody conjugate linker.







Abstract
An increase in the click&#8208;to&#8208;release reaction rate between cleavable trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) and tetrazines would be beneficial for drug delivery applications. In this work, we have developed a short and stereoselective synthesis route towards highly reactive sTCOs that serve as cleavable linkers, affording quantitative tetrazine&#8208;triggered payload release. In addition, the fivefold more reactive sTCO exhibited the same in&#8197;vivo stability as current TCO linkers when used as antibody linkers in circulation in mice.

         <title>Comparative Study on Proton Conductivity and Mechanism Analysis of Two Imidazole Modified Imine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work elucidates the potential impact of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore walls of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on proton conductivity. Employing DaTta and TaTta as representative hosts, it was observed that their innate proton conductivities (&#963;) are both unsatisfactory and &#963;(DaTta) &lt; &#963;(TaTta). Intriguingly, the performance of both imidazole&#8208;loaded products, Im@DaTta and Im@TaTta is greatly improved, and the &#963; of Im@DaTta (0.91 &#215; 10&#8208;2 S&#183;cm&#8208;1) even surpasses that of Im@TaTta (3.73 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S&#183;cm&#8208;1) under 100 &#176;C and 98% relative humidity. The structural analysis, gas adsorption tests, and activation energy calculations forecast the influence of imidazole on the H&#8208;bonded system within the framework, leading to observed changes in proton conductivity. It is hypothesized that intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the COF framework impede efficient proton transmission. Nevertheless, the inclusion of an imidazole group disrupts these intramolecular bonds, leading to the formation of an abundance of intermolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore channels, thus contributing to a dramatic increase in proton conductivity. The related calculation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) provides further evidence for this inference.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes: Dual Reagents for the Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;boranes are demonstrated to be efficient dual reagents, as both reducing agent and source of surface ligands, for the synthesis of NHC&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles. This strategy allows the synthesis of spherical and monodisperse AuNPs of variable sizes by adjusting the gold to NHC&#8208;borane ratio. The NHC&#8208;boranes can also be exploited in a seeded growth process, a strategy never before reported with NHC stabilized gold nanoparticles. The protocol is simple, operates under mild conditions and avoids the use of extensive purification methods.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have drawn considerable interest in the field of nanomaterials chemistry as highly stabilizing ligands enabling the formation of strong and covalent carbon&#8211;metal bonds. Applied to gold nanoparticles synthesis, the most common strategy consists of the reduction of a preformed NHC&#8208;AuI complex with a large excess of a reducing agent that makes the particle size difficult to control. In this paper, we report the straightforward synthesis of NHC&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles (NHC&#8208;AuNPs) by treating a commercially available gold(I) precursor with an easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize NHC&#8208;BH3 reagent. The latter acts as both the reducing agent and the source of surface ligands operating under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies including NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry demonstrate that the reduction of gold(I) generates NHC&#8208;BH2Cl as a by&#8208;product. This strategy gives efficient control over the nucleation and growth of gold particles by varying the NHC&#8208;borane/gold(I) ratio, allowing unparalleled particle size variation over the range of 4.9&#177;0.9 to 10.0&#177;2.7&#8197;nm. Our strategy also allows an unprecedented precise and controlled seeded growth of gold nanoparticles. In addition, the as&#8208;prepared NHC&#8208;AuNPs exhibit narrow size distributions without the need for extensive purification or size&#8208;selectivity techniques, and are stable over months.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrochemiluminescence from Imidazole&#8208;Based Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of novel Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been synthetized by a straightforward and metal&#8208;free synthesis, and structurally characterized. In this work we keep fixed the acceptor moiety, 4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzonitrile, and systemically tested different donors to correlate their photophysical and electrochemical properties with their performance in electrochemiluminescence using both benzoyl peroxide as coreactant and coreactant free (annihilation) conditions. Some compounds exceed the efficiency of the standard [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 up to 28 times with benzoyl peroxide and 38 times in annihilation. Interestingly, we found that the efficiency is mainly dictated by the electrochemical reversibility of redox processes rather than by the photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yield or excited state lifetime.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A family of novel Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been synthetized by a straightforward and metal-free synthesis, and structurally characterized. In this work we keep fixed the acceptor moiety, 4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)benzonitrile, and systemically tested different donors to correlate their photophysical and electrochemical properties with their performance in electrochemiluminescence using both benzoyl peroxide as coreactant and coreactant free (annihilation) conditions. Some compounds exceed the efficiency of the standard [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 up to 28 times with benzoyl peroxide and 38 times in annihilation. Interestingly, we found that the efficiency is mainly dictated by the electrochemical reversibility of redox processes rather than by the photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yield or excited state lifetime. In addition, the annihilation electrochemiluminescence efficiency strongly depend on the pulse sequence. The imidazole moiety can be conveniently alkylated allowing the insertion of functional groups, such a carboxylic acid, enabling practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The structure of Maneb: An important manganese&#8208;containing bis(dithiocarbamate) fungicide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maneb is a manganese(II) containing fungicide with a multi&#8208;site effect and no resistance, therefore it is widely applied in many parts of the world. There is however mounting evidence for neurotoxic effects with Parkinson&#8208;like symptoms (manganism) related to usage of Maneb. Due to its insolubility in most solvents and its paramagnetism, structural elucidation is not trivial and thus its exact molecular structure remains unknown. We report herein a synthesis procedure to prepare Maneb reproducibly in pure form and the use of various analytical techniques including X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and electron diffraction to determine the molecular structure of Maneb in the solid state and also in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Centrohexaindane, a Unique Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon Bearing the Rare C q (C q )4 Core: Inelastic Neutron Scattering, Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have investigated the structure and vibrational spectroscopy of centrohexaindane, 1. This unusual molecule has a quaternary carbon atom that is coordinated to four further such quaternary carbon atoms as its core, each pair of which is bonded to an ortho&#8208;phenylene unit. Previous NMR studies have shown that the molecule has tetrahedral (Td) symmetry in solution. The infrared and Raman spectra of chloroform and deuterochloroform solutions of 1 are completely in agreement with this conclusion, as the only modes that are visible are those allowed for Td symmetry. This is not the case in the solid state: X&#8208;ray powder diffraction indicates that the unit cell is triclinic or monoclinic with a volume in excess of 4000 &#197;3. The vibrational spectroscopy is consistent with C1 site symmetry and the presence of at least two molecules in the primitive cell. It is likely that the space group is centrosymmetric.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Activation of Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bonds in Hydroxymethylfurfural Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed activation of C&#8211;C bonds in organic molecules is a powerful tool for the synthesis of value&#8208;added compounds. 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) derivatives are a promising class of biomass&#8208;derived chemicals that have received considerable attention due to their potential applications in the synthesis of biologically active molecules and materials. However, the selective activation of unstrained C&#8211;C bonds is a challenging task, mainly due to their relatively high bond dissociation energies. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed method for the efficient C&#8211;C bond activation of HMF derivatives, enabling their arylation with iodobenzenes. Mechanistic studies, including reaction&#8208;profile analysis, competition experiments and head&#8208;space IR&#8208;spectroscopy suggest a decarboxylative mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Unambiguous Structure Elucidation of Streptnatamide A, a New Cyclic Peptide Isolated from A Marine&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides have been excellent source of drug leads. With the advances in discovery platforms, the pharmaceutical industry has a growing interest in cyclic peptides and has pushed several into clinical trials. However, structural complexity of cyclic peptides brings extreme challenges for structure elucidation efforts. Isotopic fine structure analysis, Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and detailed tandem mass spectrometry rapidly provided peptide sequence for streptnatamide A, a cyclic peptide isolated from a marine&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp. Marfey&#8217;s analysis determined the stereochemistry of all amino acids, enabling the unambiguous structure determination of this compound. A non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster (stp) was tentatively identified and annotated for streptnatamide A based on the in&#8208;silico analysis of whole genome sequencing data. These analytical tools will be powerful tools to overcome the challenges for cyclic peptide structure elucidation and accelerate the development of bioactive cyclic peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Method for the Synthesis of Merocyanines: New Photophysical Possibilities for a Known Class of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction followed by nucleophilic aromatic substitution enables the assembly of rhodols and novel strongly emitting merocyanines from simple substrates.







Abstract
A new, transformative method for the preparation of rhodols and other merocyanines from readily available tetrafluorohydroxybenzaldehyde and aminophenols has been developed. It is now possible to prepare merocyanines bearing three fluorine atoms and additional conjugated rings, and the whole one&#8208;pot process occurs under neutral, mild conditions. Three heretofore unknown merocyanine&#8208;based architectures were prepared using this strategy from aminonaphthols and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins. The ability to change the structure of original rhodol chromophore into &#960;&#8208;expanded merocyanines translates to a comprehensive method for the modulation of photophysical properties, such as shifting the absorption and emission bands across almost the entire visible spectrum, reaching a huge Stokes shift i.&#8201;e. 4800&#8197;cm&#8722;1, brightness approximately 80.000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1, two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section above 150&#8197;GM and switching&#8208;on/off solvatofluorochromism. A detailed investigation allowed to rationalize the different spectroscopic behavior of rhodols and new merocyanines, addressing solvatochromism and two&#8208;photon absorption.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of New Type of Macrocyclic Architectures Used for Optoelectronic Materials and Supramolecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry has received much attention for decades. Macrocyclic architectures as representative receptors play a vital role in supramolecular chemistry and are applied in many fields such as supramolecular assembly and host&#8208;guest recognition. However, the classical macrocycles generally lack functional groups in the scaffolds, which limit their further applications, especially in optoelectronic materials. Therefore, developing new design principle is not only essential to better understand macrocyclic chemistry and the supramolecular behaviors, but also further expand their applications in many research fields. In recent years, the doping compounds with main&#8208;group heteroatoms (B, N, S, O, P) into the carbon&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles offered a new strategy to build macrocyclic architectures with unique optoelectronic properties. In particular, the energy gaps and redox behavior can be effectively tuned by incorporating heteroatoms into the macrocyclic scaffolds. In this Minireview, we briefly summarize the design and synthesis of new macrocycles, and further discuss the related applications in optoelectronic materials and supramolecular chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and pH&#8208;Independent Detection of Ba2+ in Water by a Benzo&#8208;21&#8208;Crown&#8208;7&#8208;Functionalized BODIPY</title>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report on a highly Ba2+ selective fluorescence sensing in water by a fluorescent probe&#160;consisting of&#160;a benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 as a Ba2+ binding unit (ionophore)&#160;and a tetramethylated BODIPY fluorophore as a fluorescence reporter.&#160;This fluorescent probe showed a Ba2+ induced fluorescence enhancement (FE) by a factor of 12 &#177; 1 independently of the pH value and a high Ba2+ sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of (17.2 &#177; 0.3) &#181;M. Moreover, a second fluorescent probe consisting of the same BODIPY fluorophore, but a benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as a cation&#8208;responsive binding moiety, showed an even higher FE upon Ba2+ complexation by a factor of 85 &#177; 3 and a lower LOD of (13 &#177; 3) &#181;M albeit a lower Ba2+ selectivity. The fluorescence sensing mechanism of Ba2+ was further investigated by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence as well as transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and it turned out that within these probes a blocking of a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) by Ba2+ is very likely responsible for the FE.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reactions of the Ir(V) hydride [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 {BDI = (Dipp)NC(Me)CH(Me)CN(Dipp); Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3} with E[N(SiMe3)2]2 (E = Sn, Pb) afforded the unusual dimeric dimetallotetrylenes ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 in good yields. Moreover, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Ge)2 was formed in situ from thermal decomposition of [MeBDIDipp]Ir(H)2Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2. These reactions are accompanied by liberation of HN(SiMe3)2 and H2 by the apparent cleavage of an E&#8212;N(SiMe3)2 bond by Ir&#8212;H. In a reversal of this process, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 reacted with excess H2 to regenerate [MeBDIDipp]IrH4. Variations of the concentrations of reactants led to formation of the trimeric ([MeBDIDipp]IrH2)3(&#956;2&#8208;E)3. The further scope of this synthetic route was investigated with group 15 amides, and ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Bi)2 was prepared via the reaction of [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 with Bi(NMe2)3 or Bi(O t Bu)3, to afford the first example of a &#8216;naked&#8217; two&#8208;coordinate Bi atom bound exclusively to transition metals. A viable mechanism that accounts for formation of the products is proposed. Computational investigations of the Ir2E2 (E = Ge, Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open&#8208;shell singlets with confined nonbonding lone&#8208;pairs at the E centers. In contrast, Ir2Bi2 is characterized as having a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as Photocatalyst for the Direct Formylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the use of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) for the photocatalytic radical formylation of anilines, which represents a more sustainable and attractive alternative to the currently used approaches. Our operationally simple method occurs under mild conditions, employing air as oxidant. In particular, the chemistry is driven by the ability of g&#8208;CN to reach an electronically excited state upon visible&#8208;light absorption which has a suitable potential energy to trigger the formation of reactive &#945;&#8208;amino radical species from anilines. Mechanistic investigations also proved the key role of the g&#8208;CN to form reactive superoxide radicals from O2via single electron transfer. Importantly, this photocatalytic transformation provides a variety of functionalized formamides (15 examples, up to 89% yield).</dc:description>

         <title>Fe(III)&#8208;based Eutectic Mixtures as Multi&#8208;Task and Reusable Reaction Media for Efficient and Selective Conversion of Alkynes into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient, simple and general protocol for the selective hydration of terminal alkynes into the corresponding methyl ketones was developed by using a cheap, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise and sustainable Fe(III)&#8208;based eutectic mixture [FeCl3&#183;6H2O/Gly (3:1)] as both promoter and solvent for the hydration reaction, working: i) under mild (45 &#186;C) and bench type reaction conditions (air); and ii) in the absence of ligands, co&#8208;catalysts, co&#8208;solvents or toxic, non&#8208;abundant and expensive noble transition metals (Au, Ru, Pd). When the final methyl ketones are solid/insoluble in the eutectic mixture, the hydration reaction takes place in 30 minutes and the obtained methyl ketones can be isolated just by simple decantation of the liquid Fe(III)&#8208;DES, allowing the direct isolation of the desired ketones without VOC solvents. By using this straightforward and simple isolation protocol, we have been able to recycle our Fe(III)&#8208;based eutectic mixture system up to 8 consecutive times. Furthermore, our Fe(III)&#8208;eutectic mixture is able to promote the selective and efficient formal oxidation of internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, being the system recycled up to 3 consecutive times. Preliminary investigations on a possible mechanism for the oxidation of the internal alkynes seems to indicate that it proceeds through the formation of the corresponding methyl ketones and &#945;&#8208;chloroketones</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis and Reactivity of Three&#8208;membered Strained Carbo&#8208; and Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;membered carbocyclic&#8208; and heterocyclic ring structures are versatile synthetic building blocks in organic synthesis owing to their biological importance. Also, the inherent strain of these three&#8208;membered rings led to their ring&#8208;opening functionalization via C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, and C&#8208;O bond cleavage. Traditional synthesis and ring&#8208;opening methods of these molecules require the usage of acid catalysts or transition&#8208;metals. Recently, electroorganic synthesis has emerged as a powerful tool for initiating new chemical transformations. In this review, the synthetic and mechanistic aspects of electro&#8208;mediated synthesis and ring&#8208;opening functionalization of three&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic promotion of large&#8208;current water splitting through interfacial engineering of hierarchically structured CoP&#8208;FeP nanosheets with rich P vacancies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts with high performance under large current density is still a challenge. Introducing P vacancies in heterostructure is an appealing strategy to enhance HER kinetics. In this study, we investigated a CoP&#8208;FeP heterostructure catalyst with abundant P vacancies (Vp&#8208;CoP&#8208;FeP/NF) on nickel foam (NF), which was prepared using dipping and phosphating treatment. The optimized Vp&#8208;CoP&#8208;FeP catalyst exerted prominent HER catalytic capability, requiring an ultra&#8208;low overpotential (58 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8208;2) and displaying robust durability (50 h @ 200 mA cm&#8208;2) in 1.0 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated superior overall water splitting activity as cathode, demanding only cell voltage of 1.76 V at 200 mA cm&#8208;2, outperforming Pt/C/NF(&#8722;) || RuO2/NF(+). The catalyst's outstanding performance can be attributed to the hierarchical structure of porous nanosheets, abundant P vacancies, and synergistic effect between CoP and FeP components, which promote water dissociation and H* adsorption and desorption, thereby synergically accelerating HER kinetics and enhancing HER activity. Our study demonstrates the potential of HER catalysts with phosphorus&#8208;rich vacancies that can work under industrial&#8208;scale current density, highlighting the importance of developing durable and efficient catalysts for hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#183;&#183;&#183;Amide Supramolecular Synthon for Tuning Amino Acid&#8208;Based Hydrogels&#8217; Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular hydrogels formed by the self&#8208;assembly of N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine derivatives are gaining relevance for several applications in the materials and biomedical fields. In the challenging attempt to predict or tune their properties, we selected Fmoc&#8208;pentafluorophenylalanine (1) as a model efficient gelator, and studied its self&#8208;assembly in the presence of benzamide (2), a non&#8208;gelator able to form strong hydrogen bonding with the amino acid carboxylic group. Equimolar mixtures of 1 and 2 in organic solvents afforded a 1:1 co&#8208;crystal thanks to the formation of an acid&#183;&#183;&#183;amide heterodimeric supramolecular synthon. The same synthon occurred in the transparent gels formed by mixing the two components in 1:1 ratio in aqueous media, as revealed by structural, spectroscopic, and thermal characterizations performed on both the co&#8208;crystal powder and the lyophilized hydrogel. These findings revealed the possibility to modulate the properties of amino acid&#8208;based hydrogels, by involving the gelator in the formation of a co&#8208;crystal. Such crystal engineering&#8208;based approach is demonstrated to be also useful for the time&#8208;delayed release of suitable bioactive molecules, when involved as hydrogel coformers.</dc:description>

         <title>EPR Sensing of Cation Species by Aza&#8208;Crown Ethers Incorporating a Persistent Nitroxidic Radical Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New nitroxides based on aza&#8208;crown ethers were prepared and employed as selective sensors for the detection of inorganic and organic cations by EPR analysis of the corresponding host&#8208;guest complexes. The nitroxide unit behaves as a sensitive probe for a number of alkali and alkaline earth metal cations affording EPR spectra differing in the value of nitrogen hyperfine constants and in the appearance of splitted signals due to non&#8208;zero nuclear spin of some metal cation upon complexation. Owing to the remarkable EPR spectral differences between the host and the corresponding cation complex the new macrocycles are likely to act as multitasking tools to recognize several cationic species. EPR behaviour of the larger nitroxide azacrown 1&#8226; when acting as a wheel in a radical synthetic bistable [2]rotaxane containing both secondary dialkylammonium and 1,2&#8208;bis(pyridinium) molecular stations, was also investigated. Reversible movements of the macrocycle between the two recognition sites in the rotaxane were promptly revealed by EPR, which shows significant changes either in nitrogen coupling constant values (aN) or in the spectral shape in the two rotaxane co&#8208;conformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photolysis of an Archetypal Model Complex. Photooxidation Versus Photoreduction of Azido(porphinato)iron(III).</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azidoporphinatoiron(III) ([1]) is an archetypal model complex for the photochemical generation of nitridoiron(V) complexes via cleavage of dinitrogen. So far, this process has only been studied with continuous irradiation in thin films under cryogenic conditions or in frozen solutions. In addition, the photooxidation from iron(III) to iron(V) competes with photoreduction to iron(II) via cleavage of an azidyl radical. The quantum yields of both pathways remained hitherto undisclosed. Here, we investigated the photolysis of this model complex in room temperature liquid solution using stationary and time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy. The two reaction pathways are unambiguously identified in quenching studies and their quantum yields are accurately determined. Nitridoporphinatoiron(V) ([2]) exhibits N&#8208;atom&#8208;2&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactivity toward tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile and forms a carbodiimido species. In the presence of tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile, the two products of the photoreduction pathway react to cationic diisonitriloporphinatoiron(III) and azide anions, which in turn combine to reform [1] and the quencher.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Black Phosphorene Quantum Dots from Red Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorene quantum dots (PQDs) are most commonly derived from high&#8208;cost black phosphorus, while previous syntheses from the low&#8208;cost red phosphorus (Pred) allotrope are highly oxidised. Herein, we present an intrinsically scalable method to producing high quality PQDs, by first ball&#8208;milling Pred to create nanocrystalline Pblack and subsequent reductive etching using lithium electride solvated in liquid ammonia. The resultant ~25 nm PQDs are crystalline with low oxygen content, and spontaneously soluble as individualized monolayers in tertiary amide solvents, as directly imaged by liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy. This new method presents a scalable route to producing quantities of high quality PQDs for academic and industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Finding Order in Disorder &#8211; The Highly Disordered Lithium Oxonitridophosphate Double Salt Li8+ x P3O10&#8722; x N1+ x  (x = 1.4(5))</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x was synthesized in an ampoule synthesis from P3N5 and Li2O. The compound crystallizes in the triclinic space group P[[EQUATION]] with a = 5.125(2), b = 9.888(5), c = 10.217(5) &#197;, &#945; = 70.30(2), &#946; = 76.65(2), &#947; = 77.89(2)&#176;. Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a double salt, the structure of which contains distinctive complex anion species, namely non&#8208;condensed P(O,N)4 tetrahedra, and P(O,N)7 double tetrahedra connected by one N atom. Additionally, there is mixed occupation of O/N positions, which enables further anionic species by variation of O/N occupancies. To characterize these motifs in detail, complementary analytical methods were applied. The double tetrahedron exhibits significant disorder in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, the title compound is a Li+ ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;7 S cm&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C, and a corresponding total activation energy of 0.47(2) eV.</dc:description>

The compound crystallizes in the triclinic space group P[[EQUATION]] with a = 5.125(2), b = 9.888(5), c = 10.217(5) &#197;, &#945; = 70.30(2), &#946; = 76.65(2), &#947; = 77.89(2)&#176;. Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a double salt, the structure of which contains distinctive complex anion species, namely non-condensed P(O,N)4 tetrahedra, and P(O,N)7 double tetrahedra connected by one N atom. Additionally, there is mixed occupation of O/N positions, which enables further anionic species by variation of O/N occupancies. To characterize these motifs in detail, complementary analytical methods were applied. The double tetrahedron exhibits significant disorder in single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Furthermore, the title compound is a Li+ ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;7 S cm-1 at 25 &#176;C, and a corresponding total activation energy of 0.47(2) eV.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;mediated Isomerization of Spring&#8208;loaded 1,7&#8208;Enynes seen through the Lens of Density Functional Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We propose a mechanism for the previously reported formation of benzobicyclo[3.2.0]heptane derivatives from 1,7&#8208;enyne derivatives bearing a terminal cyclopropane. Our calculations support the formation of the product through two sequential cyclopropane openings followed by the formation of an oxonium intermediate. The subsequent breakage of carbon&#8208;oxygen bond acts as driving force for the formation of an allene group. The DFT calculations also shed light on the reaction divergence depending on the substituents. These mechanistic insights will help guide the future development in the synthesis of challenging scaffolds through gold(I) catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Symmetric and Unsymmetric Imines via Photoelectrochemical Catalysis: Application to N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Phenylalanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy that combines electrochemical synthesis and photoredox catalysis was reported for the efficient synthesis of imines. This approach was demonstrated to be highly versatile in producing various types of imines, including symmetric and unsymmetric imines, by exploring the impact of different substituents on the benzene ring of the arylamine. Additionally, the method was specifically applied to modify N&#8208;terminal phenylalanine residues and was found to be successful in photoelectrochemical bioconjugation between NH2&#8208;Phe&#8208;OMe and aryl methylamines, leading to the synthesis of phenylalanine&#8208;containing imines. Therefore, this technique would present a convenient and efficient platform for synthesizing imines, with promising applications in chemical biology, drug development, and organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Free Decoupled Water Electrolyzer Operating at Simulated Fluctuating Renewables with Tri&#8208;functional NiCo&#8208;P Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water electrolysis has been considered a promising technology for the conversion of renewables to hydrogen. However, preventing mixing of products (H2 and O2) and exploring cost&#8208;efficient electrolysis components remains challenging for conventional water electrolyzers. Herein, we design a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis system using graphite felt supported nickel&#8208;cobalt phosphate (GF@NixCoy&#8208;P) material as a tri&#8208;functional (redox mediator, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) electrode. The versatile GF@Ni1Co1&#8208;P electrode obtained by one&#8208;step electrodeposition not only exhibits high specific capacity (176 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1) and long cycle life (80% capacity retention after 3000 cycles) as a redox mediator, but also has relatively outstanding catalytic activities for HER and OER. The excellent properties of the GF@NixCoy&#8208;P electrode endow this decoupled system with more flexibility for H2 production by fluctuating renewable energies. This work provides guidance for multifunctional applications of transition metal compounds between energy storage and electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Regioselective Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolyl Glycoconjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel organocatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of nitroolefins with glycosyl azides as well as organic azides has been developed for successful construction of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl glycoconjugates. This metal&#8208;free and acid&#8208;free, regioselective synthetic protocol proceeds in the presence of only Schreiner thiourea organocatalysts, which enable the required activation of nitroolefins through double hydrogen bonding. The straightforward, operationally simple, and regioselectivity of this methodology, complementing to the classical RuAAC catalyzed synthesis of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. In the presence of catalytic amount of Schreiner thiourea, organic azides react with a broad array of nitroolefins producing a series of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208; triazoles in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Biosensor Based on Carbon Nanotubes/Protein Hybrid Electrolyte Gated Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semiconducting single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising materials for biosensing applications with electrolyte&#8208;gated transistors (EGT). However, to be employed in EGT devices, SWCNTs often require lengthy solution&#8208;processing fabrication techniques. Here, we introduce a simple solution&#8208;based method that allows fabricating EGT devices from stable dispersions of SWCNTs/bovine serum albumin (BSA) hybrids in water. The dispersion is then deposited on a substrate allowing the formation of a SWCNTs random network as the semiconducting channel. We demonstrate that this methodology allows the fabrication of EGT devices with electric performances that allow their use in biosensing applications. We demonstrate their application for the detection of cortisol in solution, upon gate electrode functionalization with anti&#8208;cortisol antibodies. This is a robust and cost&#8208;effective methodology that sets the ground for a SWCNT/BSA&#8208;based biosensing platform that allows overcoming many limitations of standard SWCNTs biosensor fabrications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rising Star: Luminescent Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coinage metal (gold, silver, and copper) complexes are attractive candidates to substitute the widely studied noble metal complexes such as iridium(III) and platinum(II) as luminescent materials in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the development of coinage metal complexes exhibiting high emission quantum yields and short exciton lifetimes is still a formidable challenge. In the past few years, coinage metal complexes featuring a carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) motif have emerged as a new class of luminescent materials in OLEDs. Thanks to the coinage metal&#8208;bridged linear geometry, coplanar conformation, and the formation of excited states with dominant ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer character and reduced metal d&#8208;orbital participation, most CMA complexes have high radiative rates via thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Currently, the family of CMA complexes have rapidly evolved and remarkable progresses in CMA&#8208;based OLEDs have been made. Here, a concept review of CMA complexes is presented, with a focus on molecular design principles, the correlation between molecular structure/conformation and optoelectronic properties, as well as OLED performance. The future prospects of CMA complexes are also discussed.</dc:description>
