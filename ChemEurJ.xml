         <title>Helical Supramolecular Polymers Formed via Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Host&#8208;Guest Complexation of Chiral Bisporphyrin Monomers with Trinitrofluorenone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intermolecular host&#8208;guest complexation of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers consisting of cleft&#8208;shaped bisporphyrin and trinitrofluorenone units connected by a chiral binaphthyl linker was employed to construct helically twisted supramolecular polymers. Results from 1H NMR, diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy, and viscometry experiments revealed that the supramolecular polymerization of these monomers follows a ring&#8208;chain competition mechanism. The introduction of bulky substituents at the linker significantly suppressed the formation of macrocyclic oligomers, whereas smaller alkyl chains facilitated the formation of the cyclic form. The chirally twisted structures of the supramolecular polymers were confirmed using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;configurations of the binaphthyl linkers induced right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical structures, respectively, in the supramolecular polymer chains. The absence of cooperativity in the supramolecular copolymerization of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;1a resulted in the formation of stereo&#8208;random supramolecular copolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>C(sp2)&#8208;H Acylation of benzo[h]quinolines at Room Temperature via Aldehyde Autoxidation and Palladium Catalysis Cooperation</title>

         <dc:description>Herein, we report Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8208;H acylation using aldehyde as acyl source and O2 as the green oxidant at room temperature. A selective association of acyl radical formed in&#8208;situ during aldehyde autoxidation with Pd&#8208;catalysis is the key to the process. The reaction afforded products in good yields (up to 82%) and it is scalable. The proposed PdII/PdIII&#8208;catalytic cycle is supported by a series of control studies and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Characteristics of a Partially Planarized Triarylmethyl Cation with Unsymmetrical Push&#8211;Pull Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the physical properties of a new class of triarylmethyl&#8208;based carbocations containing both an electron&#8208;donating diphenyl ether moiety and an electron&#8208;accepting carbonyl group with a helical plane framework. Their unique packing patterns were clarified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which depend on the counter anions to influence their photophysical properties in the solid states. Notably, the interactions between &#960;&#8208;cation species and planar anion species lead to a unique panchromatic property, accompanying a near&#8208;infrared absorption with a &#955;onset value of 1030 nm, which can be assigned to intermolecular charge transfer transition. We found that the &#960;&#8208;cation species with planar anion formed cation dimers, being stacked in opposite directions. The two cation molecules are flanked by two anions on both the top and bottom side. Pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) calculations imply that the origins of the unique packing patterns of the &#960;&#8208;cations originate from the electrostatic forces of four neighbouring &#960;&#8208;anion species.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Guided Development of Bifunctional Cyclooctenes as Active, Practical, and Light&#8208;Gated Bromination Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most molecular catalysts have been developed employing polar functional groups as catalytic sites. However, the use of non&#8208;polar functional groups for catalysis has received less attention due to their modest molecular interactions while the bioorthogonal reactivity of non&#8208;polar alkenes as substrates is frequently used in click chemistry. In this study, we conducted mechanistic studies on the catalysis of trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) derivatives with the strained olefin as the catalytic site using kinetic and computational analyses to aid the design of more active olefin catalysts. The analysis reveals the significant role of the benzyl substituents in accelerating the generation of bromonium species through dispersion interaction in the rate&#8208;determining step. Guided by the mechanistic insights, we developed bifunctional TCO catalysts bearing a functionalized benzyl group, taking advantage of the remarkable substituent effects. Experimental studies confirmed the theoretical model and revealed that TCO with a para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl group provided excellent catalytic activity. Furthermore, inclusion of the functionalized benzyl groups allowed more readily available and robust cis&#8208;cyclooctenes to be used as active catalysts, expanding the practical utility of the olefin catalysts. By using a photochemically labile masking group on the para&#8208;hydroxybenzyl substituent, the first light&#8208;gated bromination catalyst was developed, enabling spatiotemporal control of the transformation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new miniaturized framework for graphitic material featuring three neighboring pyridinic nitrogen atoms is disclosed. The quinoline/quinazoline hybridized pseudo trimeric macrocycle, DiQuinoline(Q)&#8208;MonoQuinazolines(Qz), Q2Qz1, was readily synthesized from the key macrocyclic amide precursor in a modular fashion. Its central cavity strongly captures a proton, and the thus&#8208;formed positively charged, highly planar architecture exhibits supramolecular complexation through &#120587;&#8208;interactions. Q2Qz1, with its unique properties, was applied as a scavenger for toxic polyaromatic hydrocarbons and as a G&#8208;quartet ligand for potential therapeutic agent for cancer chemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Transition&#8208;Dipole Stacking of Conjugated Organic Molecules: Structure, Exciton Behavior and Optoelectronic Property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;transition&#8208;dipole stacking enables weak exciton coupling, leads to exciton localization, and induces chirality in organic solids, which emerged as a unique molecular stacking mode for enhanced optoelectronic properties. This mini&#8208;review offers an in&#8208;depth insight and perspective in this packing mode.







Abstract
Organic conjugated molecules have gained widespread application as organic semiconductors due to their unique optoelectronic properties. The rigidity of these large conjugated structures facilitates strong intermolecular interactions, which significantly influence their properties in the solid state through various molecular arrangements. The study of the relationship among molecular arrangement, exciton behavior, and optoelectronic properties is an eternal research topic. Cross&#8208;dipole stacking is a specific molecular arrangement that demonstrates unique characteristics and has received continuous attention over the past decades. This mini&#8208;review will first discuss the unique exciton behaviors in cross&#8208;dipole stacking based on exciton models, including weak exciton coupling and suppression of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. These exciton behaviors, determined by molecular stacking arrangements, are fundamental to the optoelectronic properties of cross&#8208;dipole stacking systems. Next, we will introduce well&#8208;defined cross&#8208;dipole systems and summarize their design principles from a molecular structure perspective. Finally, we will present the specific optoelectronic properties of cross&#8208;dipole stacking systems and their outstanding performance, such as high solid&#8208;state luminescence, good charge carrier mobility, and significant CD/CPL. Through this mini&#8208;review, we hope to enhance the understanding of cross&#8208;dipole stacking, contributing to the construction of such systems, the exploration of excited&#8208;state behaviors, and the discovery of high&#8208;performance materials.

         <title>Utilizing Alkyne&#8208;Nitrone Cycloaddition for the Convenient Multi&#8208;Component Assembly of Protein Degraders and Biological Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a fast, modular, and convenient multi&#8208;component assembly strategy of multi&#8208;functional molecules via strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8211;nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC), facilitating the synthesis of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and biological probes. The 2&#8208;component PROTACs were assembled via SPANC in&#8197;vivo. The 3&#8208;component PROTACs were assembled by sequential nitrone formation and SPANC, and photocages can be used to provide extra control of protein degradation.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have become a popular therapeutic strategy, and the development of multi&#8208;functional PROTACs has added complexity to their synthetic process. Although click reactions have been widely applied to prepare highly functionalized biomolecules, most of them are limited to two&#8208;component reactions, restricting the creation of more complex structures. Here, we developed a convenient multi&#8208;component assembly strategy via strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8211;nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC), which can be extended to a 3&#8208;component reaction when combined with nitrone formation. Using the 2&#8208;component assembly, we demonstrated the targeted protein degradation with both preassembled and in&#8208;cell assembled PROTACs. This strategy was also applied to facilitate the screening of E3 ligases in PROTACs and the preparation of various biological probes. Moreover, the 3&#8208;component assembly, via sequential nitrone formation and SPANC, enabled the synthesis of trifunctional 3&#8208;component PROTACs. The N&#8208;substituent, serving as an additional functional moiety, was designed as a photocage for sterically controlling PROTAC activity. The 3&#8208;component assembly can be further modified to provide additional control or enhance the cell&#8208;targeting ability of PROTACs. In short, our multi&#8208;component SPANC assembly strategy offers a modular and versatile synthetic platform for creating multi&#8208;functional PROTACs and biological probes.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Dehydration of 1&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;Ethanediols to Methyl Ketones Driven by Eosin Y Fragmentation Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;How would you remove water from your molecule with light?&#8221; Herein, we report a mild photocatalytic dehydration protocol for aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediols. Our mechanistic studies suggest a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and a 1,2&#8208;spin center shift (SCS) as key steps. Eosin Y photodissociation products serve as a highly efficient catalytic mixture.







Abstract
Herein, we report a mild photocatalytic redox&#8208;neutral dehydration of aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethanediols forming the respective methyl ketones. In the proposed mechanistic cycle an initial hydrogen atom abstraction (HAT) is followed by a 1,2&#8208;spin center shift (SCS) as key steps. Interestingly, Eosin Y was found to act as a pre&#8208;catalyst dissociating into a catalytically active mixture under irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, this exemplifies the first synthetic utilization of Eosin Y degradation products. As a result, our reaction can be realized with a single organic photocatalyst and releases water as a sole by&#8208;product.

         <title>Basic&#8208;Functionalized Ionic Porous Organic Polymers: Triple Roles in One for Highly Efficient and Recyclable Carboxylative Cyclization of CO2 under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Basic&#8208;functionalized ionic porous organic polymers (IPOPs) DCX&#8208;4&#8208;Tetz/Ag2O exhibited highly efficient and recyclable performance for the cycloaddition of CO2 under mild condition due to its triple roles as adsorbent, activator and stabilizer, eliminating the use of extra organic bases.







Abstract
The transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into high&#8208;value chemicals is a significant step towards achieving the goal of &#8220;carbon neutrality&#8221;. &#945;&#8208;methylene cyclic carbonate, as an intermediate for the synthesis of many important organic compounds, is widely employed in industrial productions. In this work, a series of ionic porous organic polymers (IPOPs) with different basic&#8208;functionalized anions were successfully synthesized and adjusted to have certain BET surface areas and high contents of ion sites by post&#8208;modification. These basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs could exhibit excellent catalytic performance for carboxylative cyclization of CO2 at 30&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar in presence of silver salts, eliminating the use of the extra organic bases. In the whole catalytic reaction, the basic&#8208;functionalized anions could play triple roles: enriching CO2 for further transformation, activating the hydroxyl groups of substrates to improve the catalytic performance, while coordinating with Ag atom to stabilize and regenerate catalyst. Notably, the catalytic system of DCX&#8208;4&#8208;Tet/Ag2O exhibited excellent recyclability, and the yield of &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonate was well maintained at 99&#8201;% after 5&#8197;cycles. To the best of our knowledge, the catalytic system was the first example of basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs that played multiple roles for highly efficient CO2 cyclization under mild conditions without any extra organic bases.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Ligand Functionalization Reverses Hypsochromic Luminescence Shifts in Platinum(II) Complexes of Benzannulated NCN&#8208;Coordinating Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversing the Trend: Phenanthridine (benzo[c]quinoline) donors defy conventional logic that increasing ligand benzannulation leads to bathochromic (red) shifts in the absorption and emission of their coordination complexes. Here, we provide a counterfactual that reverses this trend: substitution at the phenanthridine 6&#8208;position (i.&#8201;e., at the C=N sub&#8208;unit) breaks the phenanthridine's tendency to cause hypsochromic luminescence shifts.







Abstract
Ligands containing phenanthridine (benzo[c]quinoline) have presented notable exceptions to the conventional logic that increasing ligand benzannulation leads to bathochromic (red) shifts in the absorption and emission of their coordination complexes. The counterintuitive blue shifts have been attributed to the peculiar structure of phenanthridines, whose ground states are dominated by imine&#8208;bridged biphenyl resonance contributors. These serve to isolate the C=N unit electronically from the rest of the ligand framework and allow the C=N moiety to act as a &#8216;shock&#8208;absorber&#8217;, buffering against larger molecular distortions in a molecule's excited state, and reducing the observed pseudo&#8208;Stokes&#8217; shift. Here, we provide experimental evidence for this assertion in the form of a counterfactual that reverses this trend: substitution at the phenanthridine 6&#8208;position (i.&#8201;e., at the C=N sub&#8208;unit) breaks the phenanthridine's tendency to cause hypsochromic luminescence shifts. The synthesis, full characterization, and comparison of 2&#8208;quinolinyl and 6&#8208;phenanthridinyl exemplars is provided, supported by a detailed theoretical treatment.

         <title>Peptide Designs for Cell&#8208;Interfacing Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept review underscores the pivotal role of designing cell&#8208;interfacing peptide assemblies, including the precise control of displayed molecules, the regulation of molecular dynamics to modulate cell behaviors, and responsiveness to biological stimuli. Finally, the development of advanced cell&#8208;interfacing biomaterials is summarized and prospected.







Abstract
Constructing synthetic materials to interact with cells offers significant promise for understanding natural cellular processes and manipulating cell behaviors beyond nature's capabilities. Peptide assemblies are particular promising in this regard, as they have demonstrated efficacy in promoting cell differentiation, repair, and regeneration as supportive scaffolds. However, distinct gaps persist between natural and synthetic assembly systems in various aspects. This Concept review explores representative studies focusing on developing chemical strategies to design peptide assemblies with precise control over displayed molecules, adjustable molecular dynamics to modulate cell behaviors, and responsiveness to biological stimuli. This paper would inspire more fundamental studies on molecular assemblies and foster inter&#8208;disciplinary interests in material applications, advancing the interplay between natural cells and synthetic materials.

This paper would inspire more fundamental studies on molecular assemblies and foster inter-disciplinary interests in material applications, advancing the interplay between natural cells and synthetic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Fabrication of Novel S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/Zeolite Photocatalyst for Boosting Photocatalytic Tetracycline Degradation and Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite ternary photocatalyst performed dramatically enhanced photocatalytic TC degradation and hydrogen evolution performance. The improved photocatalytic activity was mainly due to the synergistic effect of S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction and zeolite support. This study provides a promising strategy to develop a low&#8208;cost, efficient, and stable photocatalyst for photocatalytic antibiotic wastewater treatment and hydrogen production.







Abstract
This study presents a novel ternary Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite composite for photocatalytic H2 production and TC degradation through S&#8208;scheme electron transport. The S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction was successfully constructed on zeolite surface through calcination and precipitation processes. The results indicated that Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite&#8208;50&#8201;% presented dramatically enhanced photocatalytic TC degradation performance, and the TC degradation efficiency was up to 92.86&#8201;% in 180&#8197;min under visible light. The corresponding reaction rate constant was 0.01205&#8197;min&#8722;1 which was 2.18 and 7.48 times greater than those of pure Ag3PO4 (0.00554&#8197;min&#8722;1) and g&#8208;C3N4 (0.00161&#8197;min&#8722;1), respectively. Meanwhile, the highest H2 production rate (2748.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) was achieved over Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4/zeolite&#8208;50&#8201;% under simulated solar light which was around 26.5 and 5.6 times higher than that of g&#8208;C3N4 and Ag3PO4, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity of the ternary composite was mainly due to the synergistic effect of S&#8208;scheme Ag3PO4/g&#8208;C3N4 heterojunction and zeolite support which endowed the composite with excellent adsorption activity, enhanced light response ability, and efficient separation of photoinduced carriers. TC degradation mechanism and pathways were proposed based on quenching experiment and HPLC&#8208;MS results. Overall, this study proposes a promising strategy for significantly improving photocatalytic activity and applying in photocatalytic pollutant degradation and hydrogen production.

         <title>Click Coupling of Flavylium Dyes with Plasmodione Analogues: Towards New Redox&#8208;Sensitive Pro&#8208;Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;sensitive pro&#8208;fluorophores based on azido&#8208;flavyliums clicked to alkynyl analogues of plasmodione oxide have been developed. In their quinone form, the fluorescence is quenched by photoinduced electron process (PeT) and restored after reducing to hydroquinone. PEG chain length modulates the amplitude of fluorogenic response. Due to their properties, these hybrid compounds have the potential to evaluate redox alterations in parasitized erythrocytes.







Abstract
The development of redox&#8208;sensitive molecular fluorescent probes for the detection of redox changes in Plasmodium falciparum&#8208;parasitized red blood cells remains of interest due to the limitations of current genetically encoded biosensors. This study describes the design, screening and synthesis of new pro&#8208;fluorophores based on flavylium azido dyes coupled by CuAAC click chemistry to alkynyl analogues of plasmodione oxide, the key metabolite of the potent redox&#8208;active antimalarial plasmodione. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these probes were evaluated, focusing on their fluorogenic responses. The influence of both the redox status of the quinone and the length of the PEG chain separating the fluorophore from the electrophore on the photophysical properties was investigated. The fluorescence quenching by photoinduced electron transfer is reversible and of high amplitude for probes in oxidized quinone forms and fluorescence is reinstated for reduced hydroquinone forms. Our results demonstrate that shortening the PEG chain has the effect of enhancing the fluorogenic response, likely due to non&#8208;covalent interactions between the two chromophores. All these systems were evaluated for their antiparasitic activities and fluorescence imaging suggests the efficacy of the fluorescent flavylium dyes in P. falciparum&#8208;parasitized red blood cells, paving the way for future parasite imaging studies to monitor cellular redox processes.

         <title>Mild&#8208;Temperature Catalyzed Hydrosilylation for Simplified Carbohydrate Functionalization of Porous Silicon Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot hydrosilylation strategy is developed for the functionalization of porous silicon nanoparticles (PSiNPs) with allyl&#8208;tetra&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranoside (ATAG), using mild temperatures and ethylaluminium dichloride solution (EtAlCl2) as a catalyst. This efficient method reduces reaction times for passivating and bioengineering PSiNPs, enhancing their stability and potential for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Porous silicon is one of the most explored nanostructured materials in various biomedical applications owing to its remarkable properties. However, its inherent chemical instability mandates a robust surface modification procedure, and proper surface bioengineering is essential to ensure its effectiveness in the biomedical field. In this study, we introduce a one&#8208;pot functionalization strategy that simultaneously stabilizes porous silicon nanoparticles and decorates their surface with carbohydrates through hydrosilylation chemistry, combining mild temperatures and a Lewis acid catalyst. This approach yielded a surface functionalization degree of 300&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 in just 4&#8197;hours at 60&#8201;&#176;C, significantly reducing both the prolonged reaction times and high temperatures typically associated with conventional hydrosilylation. Furthermore, this advancement opens the way for utilizing thermolabile molecules useful for surface bioengineering.

         <dc:description>Porous organic polymers (POPs) are novel emergent materials for heterogeneous organocatalysis owing to their remarkable physicochemical stabilities. Through a bottom&#8208;up approach entailing diligent design of twisted biaryl building blocks with in&#8208;built o&#8208;iodobenzoic acid (IA) moieties, a series of POP precatalysts, p&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP, DiMeIA&#8208;POP, and m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP, were synthesized by employing Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. These IA&#8208;POP precatalysts can undergo in situ oxidation in the presence of Oxone&#174; to generate hypervalent iodine(V) species (&#955;5&#8208;iodanes), in particular, modified o&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid, popularly termed IBX, which mediates diverse oxidative transformations. The applications of m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP as a heterogeneous precatalyst in the presence of Oxone&#174; are demonstrated for facile oxidation of i) primary and secondary alcohols to carbonyl compounds, ii) cleavage of olefins, vicinal diols, and acyloins into carboxylic acids and iii) oxidation of diols to lactones; the in situ formation of the &#955;5&#8208;iodane species in catalytic amounts precludes potential explosive attributes of IBX. It is shown that the IA&#8208;precatalyst (m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP) can be easily recycled without any loss of catalytic activity. The results constitute the first demonstration of the development of IA&#8208;bearing POP precatalysts for in situ generation of hypervalent iodine(V) species and various heterogeneous oxidations mediated therefrom.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur and Oxygen Transfer&#160;Reactions with Simultaneous NHC&#8208;Coordination from Cyclic Thioureas and Ureas to a Stable Silylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of cyclic thioureas (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;thione and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;thione) and ureas (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;one and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;one) with an isolable dialkylsilylene were examined. In these reactions, cyclic thioureas served as sulfur and NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) sources, and the corresponding silanethione and NHC&#8208;derived products formed via silanethione&#8208;NHC complexes. Reactions of cyclic ureas with the silylene afforded a new NHC and an isolable azomethine ylide. These reactions involved oxygen atom transfer and 1,3&#8208;silyl migrations, which were supported by computational studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent Mechanochromism of a Platinum Complex with Four Monodentate Ligands Governed by Intramolecular Interactions Between Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A platinum complex equipped with 3&#8208;methylbenzofuryl groups was prepared and its crystal structure and emission properties were investigated. This platinum complex has two distinctly emissive polymorphs: a blue&#8208;emissive polymorph with low intensity and a brightly green&#8208;emissive polymorph. Upon mechanical stimulation, the blue&#8208;emitting phase is converted to green&#8208;emitting powder through a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition. Structure analyses indicated that intramolecular interactions between ligands control the phase&#8208;transition behavior and the emission properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry Unveils Nsp10 Inhibitors with Antiviral Potential Against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of antiviral drugs against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) responsible for the recent Covid&#8208;19 pandemic is crucial, as treatment options remain limited and vaccination does not prevent (re)infection. Two relatively underexplored targets of this virus are the 3&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; exoribonuclease (ExoN) and the 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methyltransferase (2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Mtase), both essential for the viral viability. The non&#8208;structural protein Nsp14 and Nsp16 exhibit enzymatic activities for ExoN and 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Mtase, respectively, especially when in complex with their co&#8208;factor protein Nsp10. The study focuses on the use of target&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (tdDCC) to identify binders of Nsp10, aiming to disturb the protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI) involving Nsp10&#8211;Nsp14, as well as Nsp10&#8211;Nsp16. We synthesised the hits and evaluated them to assess Nsp10 affinity, ExoN and 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Mtase activities inhibition, and anti&#8208;viral activity in hCoV&#8208;229E and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infected whole&#8208;cell setting. This study reports a novel class of ExoN and/or 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;Mtase inhibitors exhibiting anti&#8208;viral activity against coronaviruses.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence and Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species in Solution by Ta6Br12 Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intrinsic metal cluster NIR&#8208;II emission of the {Ta6Br12}2+ aqua/hydroxocomplexes was determined in aqueous solutions under inert atmosphere. The photoluminescence (PL) is enhanced in D2O, and the lifetime scale expands from nanoseconds to microseconds. Possible cluster emission transitions have been assigned and analyzed from a computational perspective. In the presence of O2, the cluster compound kept its robustness but showed partial quenching of the PL. Stern&#8208;Volmer and laser&#8208;flash photolysis studies confirmed that quenching is mainly associated with O2 diffusion. Laser&#8208;flash photolysis experiments showed that singlet oxygen (1O2) was not detected under measurement conditions. Generation of peroxide and superoxide radical species after irradiation in D2O was confirmed by using luminol as a probe, whereas no hydroxide radical species were detected as evidenced by the emission of the 3&#8208;coumarin carboxylic acid (3&#8208;CCA) molecular sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in Chiral Macrocycles: Molecular Design and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral macrocycles have recently emerged as promising materials for enantioselective recognition, asymmetric catalysis, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) due to their terminal&#8208;free structure, preorganized chiral cavities, and unique host&#8208;guest and self&#8208;assembly properties. This review summarizes recent advances in the design and synthesis of chiral macrocycles with central, axial, helical, and planar chirality, each imparting distinct structural and chiroptical characteristics. We highlight key strategies for constructing these macrocycles and their applications in optoelectronic and catalytic systems. Emphasis is placed on the balance between rigidity and flexibility in macrocycle design, essential for effective molecular recognition, adaptable catalysis, and CPL. We conclude with perspectives on future opportunities, anticipating ongoing developments in chiral macrocycle research.</dc:description>

         <title>Screening of an Antibacterial and Coagulation Multifunctional Peptide and Its Application in Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a new type of drug developed in the era of antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have great potential in antibacterial, antiviral and antitumor aspects. Different from the principle of action of antibiotics, AMPs have a better effect on resisting drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. We synthesized a peptide library using solid&#8208;phase synthesis and successfully screened the antimicrobial peptide RKGAK. AMPs provide effective defense against both bacteria and fungi. Research has found that the lowest inhibitory concentrations of RKGAK against S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans are 75 &#956;g/mL, 100 &#956;g/mL, and 300 &#956;g/mL. Not only that, this antibacterial peptide also has certain antiviral and coagulation effects. It is a multifunctional peptide that has great potential in many biomedical fields. It also has the advantages of being less likely to develop drug resistance, low hemolytic activity and low cytotoxicity. Loading the peptide into hydrogels has achieved good results in applications that promote wound healing.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrocoupling of Phosphine&#8208;Borane Adducts Under Ambient Conditions using Aminoboranes as Hydrogen Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the reactivity of aminoboranes (R2N=BH2; R =&#160;iPr, Et, Me) with phosphine&#8208;borane adducts (PhR&#697;PH&#8226;BH3; R&#697; = H, Ph): sufficiently sterically unencumbered aminoboranes can accept hydrogen from phosphine&#8208;borane adducts. The hydrogen transfer results in the formation of amine&#8208;borane adducts (R2NH&#8226;BH3) and transient phosphinoboranes (PhR&#697;P&#8211;BH2)&#160;in situ. These phosphinoboranes undergo subsequent reactivity to yield either polyphosphinoborane, [PhPH&#8211;BH2]n, or the linear dimer, Ph2PH&#8226;BH2&#8211;Ph2P&#8226;BH3. Unlike metal catalyzed phosphine&#8208;borane dehydrocoupling, which occurs at elevated temperatures (2 M, toluene, &#8805; 100 &#176;C, &#8805; 24 h), these dehydrocoupling reactions occur under ambient conditions (2 M, Et2O or C6D6, 20 &#176;C, &#8804; 24 h). We performed a computational mechanistic study in which we identified that this transformation potentially occurs&#160;via&#160;a P&#8208;to&#8208;N and B&#8208;to&#8208;B hydrogen transfer&#160;via&#160;a&#160;6&#8208;membered transition state.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing bio&#8208;carbon matrices for the encapsulation of silicon nanoparticles for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion battery anode materials</title>

Natural coconut silk is employed to synthesize a CSC with hierarchical pore structure and rich oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, which is used to compound with Si to obtain CSC/Si composite, and delivers decent electrochemical performances.







Abstract
Silicon (Si) is considered to be one of the most promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries because of its abundant reserves, low discharge potential, and most importantly, its high theoretical specific capacity. However, the practical application of Si&#8208;based anodes is mainly hindered by the low intrinsic conductivity of Si and the large volume change upon lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of Si&#8208;based anodes, we prepared a composite material consisting of Si nanoparticles (NPs) and coconut silk bio&#8208;carbon (CSC) skeleton. The porous carbon skeleton derived from coconut silk with natural through&#8208;holes and ample micropores on the wall, which was used as the carrier of Si NPs. The continuous through&#8208;holes and well&#8208;distributed oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups of the CSC provided sufficient space and abundant adsorption active sites for Si NPs, what&#8216;s more, the good dispersion of Si NPs in the through&#8208;holes increased their contact with the surrounding carbon materials, which was conducive to electron transport. Meanwhile, the pore structure also provided buffer space for the volume expansion of Si. The rich oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups can form a certain chemical force with silicon particles, and further stabilize the nano silicon particles. Hence, the CSC/Si electrode revealed an excellent capacity retention of 82.8&#8201;% at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. This study provides a simple universal high&#8208;throughput method to obtain anode materials with outstanding electrochemical properties and promotes the further development of Si/C composites.

Melanin in Nature is responsible for photoprotection and coloration hence performs its function by interacting with light. Recent studies demonstrate that light activate both in natural and biomimetic melanin different processes that can be in approximatively distinguished in photochemical and photothermal. Several questions remain to be answered to understand the unique interaction of melanin and light.







Abstract
Melanin is responsible, in Nature, for photoprotection, for this reason it is expected to be poorly photoreactive. However, the photo&#8208;reactivity of melanin and related materials is well documented. Here we discuss some relevant recent examples to demonstrate that, indeed, the actual mechanism of interaction of melanin with light is complex and still not completely understood. Photochemical and photothermal processes are involved, giving a contribution that strongly depends on light wavelength and intensity. Moreover, some interesting experiments demonstrated that photochemical reactivity of melanin related compounds is likely to be indirect, in the sense that the effect of light is to increase the number of radical species rather than creating photoreactive excited state. These suggestions open&#8208;up new perspectives in the interpretation of the role of melanin in photoprotection and in the design of new melanin based photoactive materials for energy conversion, environmental remediation, and nanomedicine. Further complication is given by the role of atmospheric oxygen and humidity in the photoinduced processes. Beside this complexity of behavior makes it difficult a systematic understanding of the interaction of melanin with light, it surely strongly contributes to make the properties of melanin and related materials unique.

         <title>Distinguishing Organomagnesium Species in the Grignard Addition to Ketones with X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have calculated the X&#8208;ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy of organomagnesium species in solution in the reaction of CH3MgCl with acetone. The spectra provide insight into the oxidation state of magnesium and the changes in the first solvation sphere.







Abstract
The addition of Grignard reagents to ketones is a well&#8208;established textbook reaction. However, a comprehensive understanding of its mechanism has only recently begun to emerge. X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, because of its high selectivity and sensitivity, is the ideal tool for distinguishing between an ensemble of competing pathways. With this aim in mind, we investigated the concerted mechanism of the addition of methylmagnesium chloride (CH3MgCl) to acetone in tetrahydrofuran by simulating the X&#8208;ray spectra of different molecules in solution. We used electronic structure methods to calculate the X&#8208;ray absorption spectra at the Mg K&#8208; and L1&#8208;edges and the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra at the Mg K&#8208;edge for different organomagnesium species, which coexist in solution due to the Schlenk equilibrium. The simulated spectra show that individual species can be distinguished throughout the different stages of the reaction. Each species has a distinct spectral feature which can be used as a fingerprint in solution. The absorption and photoelectron spectra consistently show a blue shift as the reaction progressed from reagents to products.

         <title>Recovery of Berry Natural Products Using Pyrene&#8208;Based MOF Solid Phase Extraction</title>

Recovery of berry natural products (BNPs) by solid&#8208;phase extraction (SPE) using pyrene&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) Al&#8208;PyrMOF and Zn&#8208;NU&#8208;1000. The success of MOF&#8208;SPE was evaluated by their ability to capture and desorb BNPs at elevated concentration.







Abstract
This work introduces a novel method of recovering bioactive berry natural products (BNPs) using solid phase extraction with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;SPE). Two pyrene&#8208;based MOFs with different structural topologies, Al&#8208;PyrMOF and Zr&#8208;NU&#8208;1000, were evaluated for their ability to capture and desorb BNPs, including ellagic acid, quercetin, gallic acid, and p&#8208;coumaric acid. Time&#8208;dependent BNP uptake via dispersive SPE revealed that NU&#8208;1000 outperformed Al&#8208;PyrMOF in capturing all BNPs. Our findings show NU&#8208;1000 demonstrated a higher and more consistent BNP capture profile, achieving over 90&#8201;% capture of all BNPs within 36&#8197;h, with only a 9&#8201;% variation between the most and least effectively captured BNPs. In contrast, Al&#8208;PyrMOF, displayed a staggered uptake profile, with a significant 53&#8201;% difference in capture efficiency between the most and least effectively captured BNP. However, when a BNP mixture was used at a loading concentration of 50&#8197;&#956;g/mL, Al&#8208;PyrMOF outperformed NU&#8208;1000, capturing over 70&#8201;% of all BNPs. Al&#8208;PyrMOF also exhibited improved BNP recovery, with a minimum of two&#8208;fold greater amount recovered for all BNPs. Further testing with a BNP mixture at a concentration of 15&#8197;&#956;g/mL demonstrated that Al&#8208;PyrMOF efficiently concentrated all BNPs, achieving a maximum extraction factor of 2.71 observed for quercetin. These findings highlight the use of Al&#8208;PyrMOF as a MOF&#8208;SPE sorbent for recovering bioactive BNPs.

Two pyrene-based MOFs with different structural topologies, Al-PyrMOF and Zr-NU-1000, were evaluated for their ability to capture and desorb BNPs, including ellagic acid, quercetin, gallic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Time-dependent BNP uptake via dispersive SPE revealed that NU-1000 outperformed Al-PyrMOF in capturing all BNPs. Our findings show NU-1000 demonstrated a higher and more consistent BNP capture profile, achieving over 90&#8201;% capture of all BNPs within 36&#8197;h, with only a 9&#8201;% variation between the most and least effectively captured BNPs. In contrast, Al-PyrMOF, displayed a staggered uptake profile, with a significant 53&#8201;% difference in capture efficiency between the most and least effectively captured BNP. However, when a BNP mixture was used at a loading concentration of 50&#8197;&#956;g/mL, Al-PyrMOF outperformed NU-1000, capturing over 70&#8201;% of all BNPs. Al-PyrMOF also exhibited improved BNP recovery, with a minimum of two-fold greater amount recovered for all BNPs. Further testing with a BNP mixture at a concentration of 15&#8197;&#956;g/mL demonstrated that Al-PyrMOF efficiently concentrated all BNPs, achieving a maximum extraction factor of 2.71 observed for quercetin. These findings highlight the use of Al-PyrMOF as a MOF-SPE sorbent for recovering bioactive BNPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancement of Effective Energy Barrier and Magnetic Blocking Temperature in Tetraoxolene Radical Coupled Dinuclear Dysprosium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>

The chloranilate radical bridged Dy2&#8208;SMM molecule shows the highest thermal energy barrier amongst the radical bridged Dy(III) SMMs. The ferromagnetic coupling between the lanthanide ions enhances the blocking temperature to &#8764;7&#8197;K.







Abstract
A well&#8208;judged combination of a high axial ligand field and a bridging radical ligand in a dinuclear lanthanide complex provides a single&#8208;molecule magnet with a higher effective energy barrier for magnetic relaxation and blocking temperature compared to its non&#8208;radical analog due to significant magnetic exchange coupling between radical and Ln(III) ions. In this work, we report two chloranilate (CA) bridged dinuclear dysprosium complexes, [{(bbpen)Dy(&#956;2&#8208;CA)Dy(bbpen)}] (1Dy) and [{(bbpen)Dy(&#956;2&#8208;CA&#8901;)Dy(bbpen)}&#8722;{CoCp2}+] (2Dy), where 2Dy is the radical bridged Dy&#8208;complex obtained via the chemical reduction of bridging CA moiety (H2bbpen=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxybenzyl)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methylpyridyl)ethylenediamine). The presence of high electronegative phenoxide moiety enhances the axial anisotropy of pseudo&#8208;square antiprismatic Dy(III) ions. The diffused spin of radical is efficiently coupled with anisotropic Dy(III) centres and decreases the quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) in the magnetic relaxation process. The magnetic relaxation of 1Dy follows Orbach, Raman, and QTM processes whereas for 2Dy it follows Orbach and Raman Processes. Due to less involvement of the QTM relaxation process, 2Dy shows a higher thermal energy barrier (Ueff=700&#8197;K) and a high blocking temperature (6.7&#8197;K), compared to its non&#8208;radical analog. Remarkably, the radical coupled 2Dy complex shows the highest energy barrier among the radical bridged Dy(III)&#8208;based SMMs to date.

A high&#8208;yielding, selective and scalable synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;cannabidiol (CBD) has been developed via a straightforward Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of olivetol mediated by FeCl3. The synthetic CBD was employed for its encapsulation in solid and hollow pH&#8208; and temperature&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles, being evaluated their release, solubility, bioavailability and antitumoral properties of the resulting CBD&#8208;encapsulated nanosystems. Notably, the synthesized nanosystems displayed improved properties compared with free CBD, opening the doors towards therapeutically useful cannabinoid&#8208;based formulations.







Abstract
Cannabidiol (CBD) is garnering increasing interest due to its significant biological activity. This natural compound is one of the major cannabinoids in Cannabis sativa L. In this work, we describe the encapsulation of CBD in solid and hollow pH&#8208;sensitive poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (solid@p4VP and hollow@p4VP) nanoparticles, and temperature&#8208;sensitive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (solid@pNIPAM and hollow@pNIPAM) nanoparticles for transport and release CBD in a controlled manner. The CBD loading into these smart polymeric systems was effective and their release profiles, solubility and resistance to stomach and intestinal conditions were evaluated, showing satisfactory properties and improved bioavailability with respect to free CBD. Finally, the A549 human lung cancer cell line was used as lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cellular model to carry out preliminary assays of the in&#8197;vitro activity of the vehiculized CBD. For all these studies, synthetic CBD was employed, for which a new efficient and scalable synthesis of cannabinoids has been developed.

         <title>Conformational Switching of a Nano&#8208;Size Urea&#8208;Bridged Zn(II)Porphyrin Dimer by External Stimuli</title>

Explicit stabilization of the (cis,cis), (cis,trans) and (trans,trans)&#8208;conformers of a &#8216;nano&#8208;sized&#8217; highly&#8208;flexible urea&#8208;bridged Zn(II)porphyrin dimer have been achieved via careful manipulations of external stimuli viz. solvent dielectrics, temperature, anionic interactions, axial ligation and surface&#8208;mediated stabilization. The conformers differ widely in their structures, chemical and photophysical properties and thus have wide applicability.







Abstract
For the first time, explicit stabilization of all the three conformers, viz. (cis,cis), (cis,trans) and (trans,trans), of a &#8216;nano&#8208;sized&#8217; highly&#8208;flexible urea&#8208;bridged Zn(II)porphyrin dimer have been achieved via careful manipulations of external stimuli such as solvent dielectrics, temperature, anionic interactions, axial ligation and surface&#8208;induced stabilization. The conformers differ widely in their structures, chemical and photophysical properties and thus have vast potential applicability. X&#8208;ray structural characterizations have been reported for the (cis,cis) and (cis,trans)&#8208;conformers. While (cis,cis) conformer stabilized exclusively in dichloromethane, more polar solvents resulted in the stabilization of (cis,trans) and (trans,trans)&#8208;conformers. Low temperature promotes the stabilization of (cis,trans)&#8208;conformer while rise in temperature facilitates flipping to the (cis,cis) one. Significantly, exclusive stabilization of the (trans,trans)&#8208;isomer has been illustrated using acetate anion which facilitates H&#8208;bonding with the two amide linkages of the urea spacer. Remarkably, HOPG surface facilitates stabilization of the energetically challenging (trans,trans)&#8208;conformer via CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions with the solid surface to the porphyrinic cores. DFT calculations demonstrate that the relative stability of the conformers can be modulated upon slight external perturbations as also observed in the experiment. Several factors contributing towards the conformational landscape for the highly flexible urea&#8208;bridged porphyrin dimers have been mapped.

         <title>Superactivity of Bimetallic CuFeO2 Submicron Particles towards Selective Proteolysis, Depending on their Surface Hydroxyls</title>

CuFeO2 SMPs display a high protease activity towards selective cleavage of peptide bond involving hydrophobic residue at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The synergistic effect of Lewis acid sites and Lewis base sites on the surface of the particles significantly accelerates the cleavage of peptide bonds via high&#8208;efficient bimetallic catalysis. The protease activity of CuFeO2 SMPs depends on metal ion&#8208;bound hydroxyls on their surface.







Abstract
Nano bimetallic oxides as nanoproteases have the great advantages in the heterogeneous hydrolysis of proteins. Here, we report that bimetallic delafossite CuFeO2 submicron particles (CuFeO2 SMPs) display a high protease activity towards selective cleavage of peptide bond involving hydrophobic residue at 25&#8201;&#176;C. CuFeO2 SMPs have excellent regeneration performance with high structural stability. The strong Lewis acidity of Fe3+ and the strong nucleophilicity of Cu+ bound hydroxyl groups are both necessary for the high protease activity of CuFeO2 SMPs. Low&#8208;valent metal ion has a great advantage in that low&#8208;valent Cu+ bound hydroxyl has strong nucleophilicity, resulting in promotion of protein hydrolysis via high&#8208;efficient bimetallic catalysis. This study provides evidence that the protease activity of CuFeO2 SMPs depends on metal ion&#8208;bound hydroxyls on their surface. Our findings highlight that the valence of metal ions in artificial protease and their surface hydroxyls are two important factors that determine their catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Intramolecular Pericyclic Re&#8208;hydroboration via Six&#8208;Membered Transition State: Synthesis of Fused Borolo[3,2&#8208;b]siloles</title>

         <dc:description>
The reaction of 1,4&#8208;pentadiynes with 9&#8208;BBN&#8722;H initially leads to 2,3&#8208;dihydrosiloles with BBN and propargyl groups at the endocyclic double bond, followed by closure of the borole ring forming borolo[3,2&#8208;b]siloles with high to moderate yields. The last step proceeds by a pericyclic mechanism via a six&#8208;membered transition state and is accompanied by an unprecedented dehydroboration of the 9&#8208;BBN unit.







Abstract
We experimentally demonstrate a new type of the intramolecular reaction between non&#8208;activated alkyne units and the dialkylboryl group (9&#8208;BBN), which was previously only hypothesized and studied on a calculational level. The reaction described here can formally be classified as a 1,2&#8208;hydroboration reaction, but, in contrast to the classical mechanism via a cyclic four&#8208;membered transition state, the reaction proceeds by a pericyclic mechanism involving a six&#8208;membered transition state. In practice, the reaction allows the synthesis of a new class of the borolenes fused with silole or dihydrosilole units. Thus, the heating (125&#8201;&#176;C) of 2,3&#8208;dihydrosiloles or 2,3&#8208;dihydrosilolo[2,3&#8208;b]silole bearing 9&#8208;BBN and propargyl or dimethylpropargyl groups in positions 4 and 5, respectively, affords, in high to moderate yields, di&#8208; and tricyclic compounds containing a borolo[3,2&#8208;b]silole unit. In all cases, the reactions are accompanied by an unprecedented dehydroboration of the 9&#8208;BBN fragment, leading, in the final products, to a cyclooct&#8208;4&#8208;enyl group on the boron atom. The effects of the substituents on the rate and the selectivity of the reaction are discussed. The structures of all the new compounds have been determined from HRMS together with multinuclear 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, the results of which are in excellent agreement with DFT calculated chemical shifts.

         <title>Two&#8208;Positron&#8208;bonded Dihalides: Ps2XY (X, Y=F, Cl, Br)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energetic stability of Ps2XY complexes is confirmed through potential energy curves, and positron/electron densities reveal the presence of two&#8208;positron bonds. Ps2XY systems typically show shorter bond distances, higher force constants, and lower dissociation energies than the PsXY&#8722; ones. The analogy between Ps2XY systems and two&#8208;electron&#8208;bonded dialkali molecules AB, (A, B=Na, K, Rb) is also explored.







Abstract
This study explores the energetic stability and physical properties of

 complexes formed by two halide anions (X&#8722;, Y&#8722;=F&#8722;, X&#8722;, Br&#8722;), and two positrons (Ps: positron&#8208;electron pair). We combine electronic coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) calculations with positronic multicomponent renormalized partial third&#8208;order propagator (MC&#8208;REN&#8208;PP3) calculations to effectively recover correlation energies. Analysis of potential energy curves confirms the energetic stability of these positronic molecules, with optimized structures identified as global minima. Further investigation of electron and positron densities reveals stabilization owing to the formation of two&#8208;positron bonds. The global stability of the

 complexes contrasts with the metastable two&#8208;positron&#8208;bonded (PsH)2, which energetically favors the emission of Ps2. Comparative analysis of one&#8208; and two&#8208;positron dihalides indicates that the addition of a positron to PsXY&#8722; generally results in shorter bond distances, higher force constants, and lower dissociation energies, with exceptions due to differences in positron affinities of PsXY&#8722; and Y&#8722;.

The bonding properties in two&#8208;positron dihalides and their electronic dialkali analogs are comparable, displaying identical periodic trends.

         <dc:description>
Upon photoirradiation of a water dispersion of MoSe2/C60&#8208;dendron nanohybrids, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) proceeded in the presence of a sacrificial donor (1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide) and co&#8208;catalyst (Pt&#8208;PVP). The apparent quantum yields of the HER were estimated to be 0.06&#8201;% and 0.27&#8201;% upon photoexcitation at the A&#8208; and B&#8208;exciton absorption peaks (&#955;max=800 and 700&#8197;nm), respectively.







Abstract
To facilitate water splitting using MoSe2 as a light absorber, we fabricated water&#8208;dispersible MoSe2/C60&#8208;dendron nanohybrids via physical modification of the basal plane of MoSe2. Upon photoirradiation, the mixed&#8208;dimension MoSe2/C60 (2D/0D) heterojunction generates a charge&#8208;separated state (MoSe2&#8901;+/C60&#8901;&#8722;) through electron extraction from the exciton in MoSe2 to C60. This process is followed by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water in the presence of a sacrificial donor (1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide) and co&#8208;catalyst (Pt&#8208;PVP). The apparent quantum yields of the HER were estimated to be 0.06&#8201;% and 0.27&#8201;% upon photoexcitation at the A&#8208; and B&#8208;exciton absorption peaks (&#955;max=800 and 700&#8197;nm), respectively.

         <title>Tuning the Steric and Electronic Properties of Hemilabile NHC ligands for Gold(I/III) Catalyzed Oxyarylation of Ethylene: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations on 1,2&#8208;oxyarylation of ethylene in the presence of NHC^X hemilabile gold complexes are reported. The tuning of electronic and steric NHC^X properties, as well as of the NHC architecture, reveals that the NHC^P combination, with a low/moderate steric hindrance, is very promising for the synthesis of new gold catalyst ligands.







Abstract
Mechanistic studies on 1,2&#8208;oxyarylation of ethylene promoted by gold catalysts bearing hemilabile N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC^X) ligands were conducted by DFT calculations, exploring the whole catalytic cycle. After highest energy transition state (TS) barriers were located for NHC^N gold catalyst, and experimental results with different iodoarenes and alcohols rationalized, the study was extended to modified NHC^X catalysts, to observe how electronic and steric effects could affect the rate determining step TS. Electronic effects were investigated on NHC^X (X=H, N, O, P, and S), whereas steric effects emerged when comparing catalysts with different N&#8722;R groups (R=Dipp, Mes, tBu and Me). Finally, we suggest a different catalyst design based on N&#8208;aryl N&#8208;o&#8208;donor&#8208;aryl NHC, with different donors and NHC backbones to search for better performing systems.

         <title>Insights into the Synergistic Catalytic Effect of TiO2 Supported V&#8208;W Oxides for Selective C&#8722;H Bond Oxidation of Cyclohexane to KA Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>

The TiO2 supported V&#8722;W bimetallic oxides catalyst was prepared and used for the catalytic oxidation of cyclohexane to KA oil with H2O2 as an oxidant, and the prepared catalyst exhibited satisfactory catalytic activity owing to the synergistic effect between V and W.







Abstract
It is urgent to develop an efficient and stable non&#8208;noble metal catalyst for selective C&#8722;H bond oxidation of cyclohexane. Herein, a series of V&#8722;W oxides supported on TiO2 catalysts (V&#8722;W/TiO2) were fabricated. The V&#8722;W/TiO2 catalysts exhibited much higher catalytic activity for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane to KA oil, compared to that of V/TiO2 and W/TiO2 catalysts. The good distribution of active metals and the synergistic effect were responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity. H2&#8208;TPR results disclosed that the presence of V in V&#8722;W/TiO2 affected the reducibility of W6+ species, and XPS verified that an electronic interaction was formed between them. Such results led to good catalytic reusability of V&#8722;W/TiO2 catalyst during the reactions, and no obvious activity loss was found after six runs. The reaction mechanism was investigated, and the results verified that hydroxyl radicals generated from H2O2 homolysis were the main active oxidative species. Theoretical study revealed that V dopant could regulate electronic structure of adjacent O atom, facilitating the adsorption of cyclohexane, and lower energy was needed for the rate&#8208;limiting step over V&#8722;W/TiO2 during the whole oxidation reaction. This work developed an efficient V&#8722;W/TiO2 catalyst for the selective oxidation of cyclohexane via a synergistic effect.

         <title>Selective Interaction of Chiral Carbon Dots with Nucleic Acids: A Promising Nanosensing Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the selective interaction of chiral carbon dots (CCDs) with nucleic acids (ODNs). A systematic study probing CCDs with various ODNs revealed that the chirality of the active surface can be leveraged to selectively obtain either fluorescence quenching or destabilization of DNA double helix. The ability to induce specific DNA interactions through chiral recognition opens up promising avenues for the bioapplications of CCDs.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) represent an emerging class of nanomaterials that combine outstanding photoluminescent properties with low toxicity and excellent biocompatibility. These unique features have garnered significant interest for potential applications in sensing as well as nanovectors for bioactive compounds. Within this context, the possibility of synthesizing chiral carbon dots (CCDs) has paved the way for a plethora of bioapplications in their interaction with chiral biomolecules. In this study we report the synthesis and characterization of CCDs with opposite chiralities and their selective interaction with nucleic acids. A systematic study on their interaction with different oligonucleotides (ODNs) using UV&#8208;vis, photoluminescence, and circular dichroism analyses highlighted how the chiral surface of the CCDs induces distinct spectroscopic responses in CCDs&#8208;ODN conjugates. These findings establish the foundation for innovative applications of CCDs as nanosensors and nanocarriers for nucleic acids. Additionally, the antioxidant properties of CCDs were investigated, highlighting their dual potential as both sensing and preservative nanomaterials for genetic material. Our results suggest significant implications for the development of chiral&#8208;specific diagnostic tools, drug delivery systems, and therapeutic agents. Furthermore, these properties open new avenues for the use of CCDs in antibiotic residue detection, fluorescence imaging, and photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Copper Complexes with Protein&#8208;Based N&#8208;Donor Ligands as cis&#8208;Selective Nascent Cyclopropanases</title>

         <dc:description>
Stepwise repurposing of the first and second coordination spheres in cupin proteins yielded novel copper cupin complexes that could catalyze diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective cyclopropanation reactions via copper carbene species using ethyl diazoacetate. Even when employing t&#8208;butyl diazoacetate which is too bulky to produce the cis&#8208;cyclopropane, these nascent cyclopropanases exhibited thermodynamically unfavorable cis&#8208;preference.







Abstract
In this study, we aimed to develop protein&#8208;based metal ligands to catalyze cis&#8208;selective cyclopropanation using the TM1459 cupin protein superfamily. Copper complexes with TM1459 mutants containing the 3&#8208;His metal&#8208;binding site exhibited excellent diastereoselectivity in cyclopropanation reactions with styrene and ethyl diazoacetate. Further mutations in the secondary coordination sphere increased the cis&#8208;preference with t&#8208;butyl diazoacetate as the substrate with up to 80&#8201;:&#8201;20 (cis:trans ratio) and high enantioselectivity (90&#8201;% ee).

         <title>A Reusable Polystyrene Support for Sustainable yet Cost&#8208;effective Octreotide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid phase synthesis of cyclic peptide drugs derived from disulfide tethers is challenging. A soluble polystyrene support with spacer units between sites of peptide synthesis enables on&#8208;support disulfide cyclization to afford the drug octreotide in good yield and high purity. The protocol is scalable, minimizes reagent waste and reduces raw&#8208;material cost. The support can also be recycled offering a sustainable yet cost&#8208;effective approach for octreotide synthesis.







Abstract
The synthesis of peptide drugs has become facile with the use of supports that enable easy separation of the growing peptide. Peptide synthesis on insoluble supports typically employs excess reagents to enhance reaction efficiency and faces challenges during intramolecular cyclization. A non&#8208;crosslinked soluble polystyrene support is reported herein that improves cyclization efficiency on the support by using spacers. The support efficiency is illustrated by synthesizing octreotide drug in a scalable manner by on&#8208;support cyclization. The methodology drastically reduces the reagent waste, raw&#8208;material cost, and solvent requirement. The support can also be recovered and re&#8208;used up to 3 times making this a very sustainable method.

     alt="A Reusable Polystyrene Support for Sustainable yet Cost-effective Octreotide Synthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid phase synthesis of cyclic peptide drugs derived from disulfide tethers is challenging. A soluble polystyrene support with spacer units between sites of peptide synthesis enables on-support disulfide cyclization to afford the drug octreotide in good yield and high purity. The protocol is scalable, minimizes reagent waste and reduces raw-material cost. The support can also be recycled offering a sustainable yet cost-effective approach for octreotide synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of peptide drugs has become facile with the use of supports that enable easy separation of the growing peptide. Peptide synthesis on insoluble supports typically employs excess reagents to enhance reaction efficiency and faces challenges during intramolecular cyclization. A non-crosslinked soluble polystyrene support is reported herein that improves cyclization efficiency on the support by using spacers. The support efficiency is illustrated by synthesizing octreotide drug in a scalable manner by on-support cyclization. The methodology drastically reduces the reagent waste, raw-material cost, and solvent requirement. The support can also be recovered and re-used up to 3 times making this a very sustainable method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Where do they go? A macrocycle consisting of four square planar platinum corners and twenty&#8208;four sp carbon atoms, the cavity of which has a markedly negative surface potential and engages in supramolecular chemistry, is treated with iodine. The platinum corners are converted to diiodide complexes. The fate of the carbon atoms is explored, and other preparative approaches to cyclo[24]carbon are reviewed.







Abstract
The overarching goal of this study is to effect the elimination of platinum from adducts with cis &#8211;C&#8801;C&#8722;Pt&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8208; linkages, thereby generating novel conjugated polyynes. Thus, the bis(hexatriynyl) complex trans&#8208;(p&#8208;tol3P)2Pt((C&#8801;C)3H)2 is treated with 1,3&#8208;diphosphines R2C(CH2PPh2)2 to generate (R2C(CH2PPh2)2)2Pt((C&#8801;C)3H)2 (14; R=c, n&#8208;Bu; e, p&#8208;tolCH2). These condense with the diiodide complexes R2C(CH2PPh2)2PtI2 (9&#8201;a,c) in the presence of CuI (cat.) and excess HNEt2 to give the title macrocycles [(R2C(CH2PPh2)2)Pt(C&#8801;C)3]4 (16&#8201;c,e) as adducts of the byproduct [H2NEt2]+ I&#8722; (30&#8211;66&#8201;%). DOSY NMR experiments establish that this association is maintained in solution, but NaOAc removes the ammonium salt. The bis(triethylsilylpolyynyl) complexes (n&#8208;Bu2C(CH2PPh2)2)Pt((C&#8801;C)nSiEt3)2 (n=2, 3) are synthesized analogously to 14&#8201;c. They react with I2 at rt to give mainly the diiodide complex 9&#8201;c and the coupling product Et3Si(C&#8801;CC&#8801;C)nSiEt3. The possibility of competing reactions giving IC&#8801;C species is investigated. Analogous reactions of the Pt4C24 macrocycle 16&#8201;c also give 9&#8201;c, but no sp 13C&#8197;NMR signals or mass spectrometric Cxz+ ions (x=24&#8211;100) could be detected. It is proposed that some cyclo[24]carbon is generated, but then rapidly converts to other forms of elemental carbon. No cyclotetracosane (C24H48) is detected when this sequence is carried out in the presence of PtO2 and H2.

         <title>Two&#8208;Fold Oxidative Coupling of Furan with Indole Provides Modular Access to a New Class of Tetra&#8208;(Hetero)Arylated Furans with Up to Four Different Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first methodology for two&#8208;fold oxidative coupling on furan core is presented. The reaction is mediated by an earth&#8208;abundant Fe(III)&#8208;catalyst without the need for any ligand. The product bis(indolyl)furans represent a new class of &#8216;extremely congested&#8217; tetra&#8208;(hetero)arylated furans with propeller shape and displays unique aggregation&#8208;caused quenching properties of highly arylated furans.







Abstract
Highly arylated propeller&#8208;shaped heteroarenes constitute an intriguing class of molecular scaffolds for material science applications. Among these, tetraarylated furans demonstrate differentiated properties as compared to other similar heterocyclic cores. The synthetic complexity to access tetraarylated furans increases significantly with increasing number of different peripheral aryl groups. There are only a very limited number of methodologies available to access furans with four different (hetero)aryl substituents. Notably, none of these involve direct oxidative coupling on the furan core as the method of choice. Herein, we report the first methodology based on a sequential two&#8208;fold oxidative C&#8722;C coupling of furans with indoles to access bis(indolyl)furans (BIFs) &#8208; a new class of &#8216;extremely congested&#8217; tetra&#8208;(hetero)arylated furans with up to four different substituents. The reaction is mediated by inexpensive, earth&#8208;abundant FeCl3&#8901;6H2O and displays high efficiency, wide substrate scope, modularity and aqueous compatibility. Moreover, we also present the first validation of the distinct aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) property of the tetraarylated furans beyond only phenyls as peripheral groups and disclose new mechanistic underpinnings for the same.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Surface&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Photocathodes for Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>

The COFTh&#8208;Cu, synthesized via a simple copper surface&#8208;mediated in&#8208;situ growth method, exhibits remarkable catalytic activity alongside exceptional stability. This distinctive material adeptly bridges the interface between photoactive materials and conductive substrates, fostering a seamless integration that drastically accelerates the migration of charge carriers and consequently boosts the efficiency of photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
Sp2&#8208;carbon (sp2&#8208;c) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring distinctive &#960;&#8208;conjugated network structures, facilitate the migration of photo&#8208;generated carriers, rendering them exceptionally appealing for applications in photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, owing to the powdery nature of COFs, leaving anchor the sp2&#8208;c COFs powder tightly onto a conductive substrate challenging. Here, we propose a method for preparing photoactive substance&#8208;conductive substrate integrated photocathodes through copper surface&#8208;mediated knoevenagel polycondensation (Cu&#8208;SMKP), this approach results in a uniform and stable sp2&#8208;c COF film, directly grown on commercial copper foam (COFTh&#8208;Cu). The COFTh&#8208;Cu demonstrates a high H2&#8208;evolution photocurrent density of 56&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, sustaining stability for 12&#8197;h. The as&#8208;prepared COFTh&#8208;Cu represents a 4.5&#8208;fold increase in current density compared to traditional spin&#8208;coating methods and outperforms most COF photocathodes without cocatalysts. This innovative copper surface&#8208;mediated approach for preparing photocathodes opens up a crucial pathway towards the realization of highly active COF photocathodes.

         <title>Nanocomposite Hydrogels from Nanodiamonds and a Self&#8208;Assembling Tripeptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocomposite hydrogels can be obtained by embedding nanodiamonds (NDs) within the fibrillary network that arises from self&#8208;assembly of a simple tripeptide biomolecule at physiological pH. Spectroscopy and microscopy data point to non&#8208;covalent interactions between peptide fibers and NDs, which enable modulation of the viscoelastic properties of the nanocomposites.







Abstract
We report the successful assembly of a tripeptide in the presence of nanodiamonds (NDs) into nanocomposite hydrogels. While the presence of NDs does not hinder peptide self&#8208;assembly and gelation kinetics are not affected, NDs improve the viscoelastic properties and significantly increase the elastic moduli of the peptide hydrogels. Increased resistance of the gels against applied stress can also be attained depending on the amount of NDs loaded in the nanocomposite. Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy and TEM confirmed the presence of NDs on the surface, and not in the interior, of peptide nanofibers. Peptide&#8208;ND non&#8208;covalent interactions are also probed by Raman and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared spectroscopies. Overall, this work enables the embedding of NDs into nanocomposite hydrogels formed through the self&#8208;assembly of a simple tripeptide at physiological pH, and it provides key insights to open the way for their future applications in biomaterials, for instance exploiting their luminescence and near&#8208;infrared responsiveness.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed [3+1+1] Cascade Cyclization of O&#8208;Acyl Oximes with Sulfur and Silyl Enol Ethers: Rapid Access to Naphthothiazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component cyclization reaction of O&#8208;acyl oximes, silyl enol ethers and elemental sulfur has been developed, in which silyl enol ether acts as a C1 synthon to participate in cyclization reaction and build serious 2&#8208;aroylnaphthothiazoles and 2&#8208;aroylbenzothienothiazoles. Moreover, the products obtained exhibit favorable fluorescence properties, which indicates their potential application as functional materials.







Abstract
A three&#8208;component cyclization reaction of O&#8208;acyl oximes, silyl enol ethers and elemental sulfur has been developed, in which silyl enol ether acts as a C1 synthon to participate in cyclization reaction and build a series of 2&#8208;aroylnaphthothiazoles and 2&#8208;aroylbenzothienothiazoles. The preliminary exploration of the reaction mechanism indicated that this transformation probably proceeded through a radical process, involving S3&#8901;&#8722; as a key intermediate, enabling subsequent nucleophilic substitution with O&#8208;acyl oximes to afford iminosulfur radical, which undergoes 1,3&#8208;H shift to yield sulfur&#8208;centered radical intermediate. And then this intermediate undergoes radical addition with silyl enol ether, leading to the formation of the titled products through intramolecular cyclization and oxidation. Moreover, the products obtained exhibit favorable fluorescence properties, which indicates their potential application as functional materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Deoxycyclophellitols as Human Retaining &#946;&#8208;Glucosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of deoxygenated cyclophellitol derivatives was synthesized and screened against the three human retaining exo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosidases, GBA1, GBA2, and GBA3. From this screen an activity&#8208;based probe (ABP) was identified that, in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner, selectively captures GBA3 over GBA1 and GBA2 in extracts of HEK293T cells overexpressing both GBA2 and GBA3.







Abstract
Cyclophellitol is a potent and selective mechanism&#8208;based retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidase inhibitor that has served as a versatile starting point for the development of activity&#8208;based glycosidase probes (ABPs). We developed routes of synthesis of eight mono&#8208; and dideoxycyclophellitols and cyclophellitol aziridines, the latter as ABPs carrying either a biotin or fluorophore linked to the aziridine nitrogen. We reveal the potency of these 24 compounds as inhibitors of the three human retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidases, GBA1, GBA2 and GBA3. We show that 3,6&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;galacto&#8208;cyclophellitol aziridine selectively captures GBA3 over GBA1 and GBA2 in extracts of cells overexpressing both GBA2 and GBA3. We also identify a probe that selectively labels GBA1 and GBA2 over GBA3 at lower concentrations. In sum, the here&#8208;presented studies reveal new chemistries to prepare chiral, substituted cyclitol epoxides and aziridines, add to the growing suite of cyclophellitols varying in configuration and substitution pattern, and yielded a reagent that may find use to investigate the physiological role and therapeutic relevance of the most elusive of the three retaining &#946;&#8208;glucosidases: GBA3.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Three&#8208;Component Reaction for the Construction Of &#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amino Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective photochemical three&#8208;component synthesis is presented for the construction of valuable &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acid structures, leveraging alkyl radicals generated through a light&#8208;induced halogen atom transfer (XAT) process to create a mild reaction environment. The excellent functional group tolerance and the potential for late&#8208;stage modification of the products further underscore the practical utility and versatility of this approach.







Abstract
The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;tertiary amino acids (ATAAs), which are pivotal components in natural metabolism and pharmaceutical innovation, continues to attract significant research interest. Despite substantial advancements, the pursuit of a facile, versatile, and resource&#8208;efficient methodology remains an area of active development. In this work, we introduce a visible light&#8208;triggered three&#8208;component reaction involving readily available nitrosoarenes, N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles, and allyl or (bromomethyl)benzenes under mild conditions. This approach enables the straightforward assembly of a wide array of ATAA derivatives (42 examples) in commendably high yields (up to 89&#8201;%). Mechanistic investigations elucidate that the reaction proceeds through a dehydration condensation between nitrosoarenes and N&#8208;acyl pyrazoles to generate ketimine intermediates. This is followed by a light&#8208;driven halogen atom transfer (XAT) process and a radical addition, culminating in the formation of the desired products. The approach showcases excellent functional group compatibility and late&#8208;stage derivatization potential, offering new insights and avenues for the synthesis of ATAA analogs.

         <title>Spectroscopic Properties and Reactivity of a MnIII&#8208;Hydroperoxo Complex that is Stable at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amide&#8208;containing N5 ligand is used to generate a manganese(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo complex that is stable at room temperature and generated using a stoichiometric amount of H2O2. The stability of this complex permits detailed investigation of its spectroscopic properties and analysis of decay kinetics. Despite its high thermal stability, the new manganese(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo is more reactive than manganese(III)&#8208;alkylperoxo analogues in substrate oxidation reactions.







Abstract
Manganese catalysts that activate hydrogen peroxide have seen increased use in organic transformations, such as olefin epoxidation and alkane C&#8722;H bond oxidation. Proposed mechanisms for these catalysts involve the formation and activation of MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo intermediates. Examples of well&#8208;defined MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo complexes are rare, and the properties of these species are often inferred from MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo analogues. In this study, we show that the reaction of the MnIII&#8208;hydroxo complex [MnIII(OH)(6Medpaq)]+ (1) with hydrogen peroxide and acid results in the formation of a dark&#8208;green MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo species [MnIII(OOH)(6Medpaq)]+ (2). The formulation of 2 is based on electronic absorption, 1H&#8197;NMR, IR, and ESI&#8208;MS data. The thermal decay of 2 follows a first order process, and variable&#8208;temperature kinetic studies of the decay of 2 yielded activation parameters that could be compared with those of a MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo analogue. Complex 2 reacts with the hydrogen&#8208;atom donor TEMPOH two&#8208;fold faster than the MnIII&#8208;hydroxo complex 1. Complex 2 also oxidizes PPh3, and this MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo species is 600&#8208;fold more reactive with this substrate than its MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo analogue [MnIII(OOtBu)(6Medpaq)]+. DFT and time&#8208;dependent (TD) DFT computations are used to compare the electronic structure of 2 with similar MnIII&#8208;hydroperoxo and MnIII&#8208;alkylperoxo complexes.

     alt="Spectroscopic Properties and Reactivity of a MnIII-Hydroperoxo Complex that is Stable at Room Temperature"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An amide-containing N5 ligand is used to generate a manganese(III)-hydroperoxo complex that is stable at room temperature and generated using a stoichiometric amount of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The stability of this complex permits detailed investigation of its spectroscopic properties and analysis of decay kinetics. Despite its high thermal stability, the new manganese(III)-hydroperoxo is more reactive than manganese(III)-alkylperoxo analogues in substrate oxidation reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manganese catalysts that activate hydrogen peroxide have seen increased use in organic transformations, such as olefin epoxidation and alkane C&#8722;H bond oxidation. Proposed mechanisms for these catalysts involve the formation and activation of Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-hydroperoxo intermediates. Examples of well-defined Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-hydroperoxo complexes are rare, and the properties of these species are often inferred from Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-alkylperoxo analogues. In this study, we show that the reaction of the Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-hydroxo complex [Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(OH)(&lt;sup&gt;6Me&lt;/sup&gt;dpaq)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with hydrogen peroxide and acid results in the formation of a dark-green Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-hydroperoxo species [Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(OOH)(&lt;sup&gt;6Me&lt;/sup&gt;dpaq)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). The formulation of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is based on electronic absorption, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H&#8197;NMR, IR, and ESI-MS data. The thermal decay of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; follows a first order process, and variable-temperature kinetic studies of the decay of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; yielded activation parameters that could be compared with those of a Mn&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-alkylperoxo analogue.

         <title>Computational Screening Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Microporous Polymer Applied in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A 2D conjugated microporous polymer has been synthesized and used to modify the hole transport layer in inverted perovskite solar cells. The aligned Fermi level, enhanced hole mobility and reduced recombination improve the efficiency to 24.64&#8201;%.







Abstract
A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conjugated microporous polymer with a structure of 2D nanosheets has been synthesized. Theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that the Fermi level of this 2D polymer aligns well with perovskite absorber, and its conduction band is high enough to block electron transport into the anode. This 2D polymer is used to modify the hole transport layer, significantly improving its photoelectric properties, including enhanced hole mobility, matched energy level, and reduced recombination. Furthermore, the 2D polymer exhibits a mesoporous structure, allowing perovskite to fill into its loose framework, increasing the hole export area and providing a large hole transport flux. As a result, the efficiency of inverted perovskite solar cells enhances to 24.64&#8201;% from 21.17&#8201;% of control device without 2D conjugated microporous polymer. Given that this material can be synthesized on a large scale, this work has significant implications for the future development of 2D polymers in perovskite solar cells, potentially accelerating industrialization.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Acid Catalyzed Continuous&#8208;Flow Aminolysis of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminolysis of epoxides is a promising way to construct C&#8722;N bonds without producing any byproduct. In this article, it was revealed that titania&#8208;zirconia supported molybdenum oxide as a solid acid catalyst could accelerate the reaction, and be applied for continuous&#8208;flow systems with high efficiency. Furthermore, sequential&#8208;flow synthesis of an important API, Rivaroxaban intermediate was achieved utilizing hydrogenation and aminolysis to afford the desired product in 73&#8201;%.







Abstract
We report a solid&#8208;acid catalyzed aminolysis of epoxides under continuous&#8208;flow conditions. A titania&#8208;zirconia supported molybdenum oxide catalyst demonstrated exceptional substrate compatibility, enabling the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols in excellent yields with high catalyst durability. Characterization of the catalyst revealed the crucial role of the titania&#8208;zirconia ratio in optimizing its performance. Furthermore, this method was applied to the efficient, sequential&#8208;flow synthesis of a rivaroxaban intermediate (an oral anticoagulant and the first direct factor Xa inhibitor), combining a hydrogenation step with the aminolysis reaction without the need for intermediate isolation.

         <title>The Effect of Hyperconjugation and Hydrogen Bonding on the Conformers of Methylated Monosaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rotational spectra of four methylated monosaccharides were recorded using a Fourier transform microwave spectrometer, employing a custom&#8208;designed nozzle cap, thus eliminating the need for an expensive laser ablation system. Ten low&#8208;energy conformers were identified experimentally, and their geometries reveal an interesting interplay between neutral hyperconjugation and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Methylation appears to exert a strong influence on structural preference.







Abstract
The conformational landscapes of four 1&#8208;O&#8208;methylated monosaccharides&#8212;methyl &#945;&#8208;glucose, methyl &#946;&#8208;glucose, methyl &#945;&#8208;galactose, and methyl &#946;&#8208;galactose&#8212;were characterized using jet&#8208;cooled broadband rotational spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory calculations. A newly designed, simple pulsed nozzle assembly was used to introduce the sugar samples into a jet expansion without thermal degradation, eliminating the need for a complex and expensive laser ablation system. Ten conformers were experimentally identified by assigning their rotational spectra, and the intricate methyl internal rotation splittings were analysed. Notably, methylation alters the directionality of intramolecular hydrogen bonding of &#945;&#8208;galactose highlighting its impact on structural preference. Natural bond orbital, intrinsic bond strength, and non&#8208;covalent interaction analyses were conducted to explore the interplay between hydrogen bonding and hyperconjugation. A set of &#963; to &#963;* neutral hyperconjugative interactions was found to override a strong hydrogen bond, driving a preference for the gauche conformers.

         <title>Peptide Catalyzed Conjugate Additions to &#946;&#8208;Nitroacrylates &#8211; Steric Bulk Increases the Reaction Rate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective peptide&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition reaction to &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates featuring unusually short reaction times (15&#8211;60&#8197;min) at low catalyst loading (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) was developed. Key to high reactivity is the reluctance of the peptide catalyst to undergo deactivation by alkylation and, at first glance counterintuitive, a high steric demand of the ester group of the &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylate.







Abstract
The organocatalytic conjugate addition of aldehydes to &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylates provides direct access to &#946;&#8208;ester&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes and, thereby, common structural motifs of many bioactive compounds. However, the deactivation of amine&#8208;based catalysts by alkylation with the highly electrophilic nitroacrylates hampers this reaction. Here, we show that the peptide H&#8208;Mep&#8208;dPro&#8208;dGlu&#8208;NH2, which is reluctant to undergo alkylation, catalyzes this reaction at low catalyst loading (0.5&#8211;1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) within short reaction times (15&#8211;60&#8197;min) to yield a broad range of &#946;&#8208;ester&#8208;&#947;&#8208;nitroaldehydes with high stereoselectivity. Kinetic studies revealed that increased steric bulk on the &#946;&#8208;nitroacrylate enhances the reaction rate by hindering catalyst alkylation.

         <title>Detection of Guanine Quadruplexes by Raman Optical Activity and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Interpretation of the Spectra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>

A dramatic increase of Raman optical activity of guanosine monophosphate reveals a quadruplex formation. The shapes of the spectra could be reproduced by computations and related to the geometry, in particular to the mutual twist of quadruplex units in the polymer.







Abstract
Quadruplexes formed by guanine derivatives or guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acids are involved in metabolism and genetic storage of many living organisms, they are used in DNA nanotechnologies or as biosensors. Since many quadruplex geometries are possible the determination of their structures in aqueous solutions is difficult. Raman optical activity (ROA) can make it easier: For guanosine monophosphate (GMP), we observed a distinct change of the spectra upon its condensation and quadruplex formation. The vibrational bands become more numerous, stronger, and narrower. In particular, a huge ROA signal appears below 200&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The aggregation can be induced by high concentration, low temperature, or by a metal ion. We focused on well&#8208;defined quadruplexes stabilized by potassium, where using molecular dynamics and density functional theory the spectra and particular features related to GMP geometric parameters could be understood. The simulations explain the main experimental trends and confirm that the ROA spectroscopy is sensitive to fine structural details, including guanine base twist in the quadruplex helix.

         <title>Pathway&#8208;dependent Metallosupramolecular Polymerization Regulated by Ligand Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we exploit ligand geometry (linear vs. V&#8208;shaped) to tune the self&#8208;assembly pathways (one vs. two&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly), morphology (nanoparticles vs. fibers) and photophysical properties (MMLCT vs. MLCT excited state) of metallosupramolecular polymers.







Abstract
Understanding structure/property correlations in self&#8208;assembly is a key but challenging requirement for developing functional materials. Herein, we explore the importance of ligand geometry to fine&#8208;tune photophysical properties (MMLCT vs. MLCT excited states) and self&#8208;assembly pathways in metallosupramolecular polymerization. To this end, we have designed two hydrophobic Pt(II) complexes, 1 and 2, containing a &#960;&#8208;extended bidentate bipyridine ligand with different substitution pattern, resulting in different molecular geometries (linear vs. V&#8208;shaped). Detailed comparative studies revealed significant differences for both complexes in terms of their photophysical properties and self&#8208;assembly pathways in non&#8208;polar media. The V&#8208;shaped topology of 1 enables facile face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular stacking with a certain curvature leading to luminescent spherical assemblies exhibiting MMLCT states and short Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt contacts via a single&#8208;step cooperative pathway. On the other hand, the higher preorganized linear topology of complex 2 induces a two&#8208;step competitive self&#8208;assembly process leading to the formation of one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers with slipped packing and MLCT&#8208;originated emission. Our findings broaden the monomer scope for supramolecular polymerization and provide design guidelines for the realization of luminescent supramolecular assemblies.

Abstract
The reduction of CO2 has become a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in efforts to search for long&#8208;term responses to climate change. We report a couple of CO2&#8208;reducing molecular catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant copper complexes. These are [Cu(DPA)(PyNAP)] (1) and [Cu(DPA)(PyQl)] (2) (where, DPA=pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate, PyNAP=2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, and PyQl=2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline). The copper metal&#8208;catalysed 2&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO in the presence of 2&#8208;protons is challenging. These catalysts exhibit the production of CO gas in DMF/water mixtures, achieving an impressive Faradaic efficiency of 84&#8201;% and 72&#8201;% for complex 1 and 2 at &#8722;1.7&#8197;V vs. SCE, respectively, for selective CO2 reduction. The production of H2 due to 2H++2e&#8722; was also observed as a byproduct through the competitive proton reduction reaction. This was cross&#8208;verified by online gas and mass analysis. A comprehensive series of electrochemical experiments have substantiated the homogeneous behaviour exhibited by these molecular electrocatalysts. Our investigations confirmed the stability of the electrocatalysts under the electrocatalytic conditions. The mechanistic pathways were proposed to work with the EECC and ECEC (E: electrochemical and C: chemical) mechanisms. A CO2 insertion into an in&#8208;situ generated hydride from the Cu&#8208;center generates CO through the favourable path. This critical path kinetically favors excess Faradaic efficiency in 1 than 2, which agrees with the computational investigation.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal Free Amination and Hydrodefluorination of Aryl Fluorides Promoted by Solvated Electrons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a transition metal&#8208;free method for C&#8722;N coupling of aryl fluorides using solvated electrons, red light, and sonication. The method exhibits moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high yields (35&#8211;99&#8201;%), broad substrate compatibility, and eliminates toxic catalysts.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;coupling reactions for constructing C&#8722;N bonds represent a pivotal advancement in chemical science. Traditional methodologies, including nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings, have limitations concerning aryl scope, reliance on toxic and costly transition&#8208;metal catalysts, and issues related to atom economy and waste generation from ligands and additives. In this work, we introduce a novel method for aminating neutral, electron&#8208;rich, and electron&#8208;deficient aryl halides, eliminating the need for transition metals. Our approach involves the activation of aryl halides using solvated electrons generated from granulated lithium and sonication. This serves as a sustainable source of reducing power, facilitating the efficient formation of C&#8722;N bonds under near ambient conditions. Competitive selectivity studies between halide and ester functionalities were explored. Reaction scope and conducted mechanistic studies which supported the proposed radical&#8208;nucleophilic substitution (SRN1) mechanism for the reaction. Notably, the developed reaction has a highly competitive reductive dehalogenation pathway during the C&#8722;N coupling reaction, and this mechanistic divergency was thoroughly explored. This work not only broadens the scope of C&#8722;N coupling reactions which typically employs aryl bromides and iodides and rarely aryl fluorides which is also equally abundant, but also introduces a new way to do C&#8722;N coupling reactions using solvated electrons.

         <title>Regioselective Electrochemical Construction of Csp2&#8722;Csp2 Linkage at C5&#8722;C5&#8217; Position of 2&#8208;Oxindoles via an Intermolecular Anodic Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly regioselective electrochemical homo&#8208;coupling strategy was developed for the synthesis of C5&#8722;C5&#8217; dimer of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole. Control experiments and cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies confirmed that C&#8722;C bond formation occurs via a radical&#8208;radical dimerization process. Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies validated the reaction mechanism and the observed high regioselectivity. The reaction conditions are mild and compatible with a wide range of functional groups.







Abstract
Applying electricity as a reagent in synthetic organic chemistry has attracted particular attention from synthetic chemists worldwide as an environmentally benign and cost&#8208;effective technique. Herein, we report the construction of the Csp2&#8722;Csp2 linkage at the C5&#8722;C5&#8217; position of 2&#8208;oxindole utilizing electricity as the traceless oxidant in an anodic dehydrogenative homo&#8208;coupling process. A variety of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles were subjected to dimerization, achieving yields of up to 70&#8201;% through controlled potential electrolysis at an applied potential of 1.5&#8197;V versus Ag/Ag+ nonaqueous reference electrode. This electro&#8208;synthetic approach facilitates the specific assembly of C5&#8722;C5&#8217; (para&#8208;para coupled) dimer of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole without the necessity of any external oxidants or additives and DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations provided confirmation of this pronounced regioselectivity. Furthermore, validation through control experiments and voltammetric analyses substantiated the manifestation of radical&#8208;radical coupling (or biradical pathway) for the dimerization process.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Centered Oligoynes Capped by Boron Difluoride Formazanate Dyes and Their Thin&#8208;Film Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly stable Pt(II)&#8208;centered oligoynes capped by boron difluoride formazanate dyes exhibit solution processability, redox activity, panchromatic absorption, and thin film conductivity. Compared to their metal&#8208;free analogs, Pt(II)&#8208;centered oligoynes have poorer conductivity on the microscale and improved conductivity on the nanoscale.







Abstract
Since the Nobel prize winning discovery that polyacetylene could act as a semiconductor, there has been tremendous efforts dedicated to understanding and harnessing the unusual properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. Much of this research has focused on the preparation of oligoynes and polyynes with well&#8208;defined numbers of repeating alkyne units as models for carbyne. These studies are usually hampered by a structure&#8208;property relationship where the stability of the resulting materials decrease with the incorporation of additional alkyne units. Here, we describe a series of oligoynes, with up to 12 alkyne units, where electron&#8208;rich [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units are incorporated at the center of the oligoyne backbones which are capped by electron&#8208;poor BF2 formazanate dyes. These compounds exhibit excellent stability and solubility, panchromatic absorption, and redox activity characteristic of their structural components. These traits facilitated thin&#8208;film studies of extended oligoyne materials, where it is shown that incorporating [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units leads to smoother films, decreased conductivity on the microscale, and increased conductivity on the nanoscale when compared to metal&#8208;free analogs. Remarkably, our oligoynes have superior conductivity compared to the ubiquitous poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) semiconductor.

         <title>Simultaneous Hydrogenation of an Insulated Diarylacetylene Dimer Incorporated as Axle Molecules in a Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [c2]Daisy Chain Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane was synthesized for the first time through the simultaneous hydrogenation of both diarylacetylene moieties within a pre&#8208;prepared [c2]daisy chain rotaxane. This study demonstrates that [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes can undergo chemical modification owing to their unique structural features, thereby advancing the development of functional interlocked molecules.







Abstract
The [c2]daisy chain rotaxane is an attractive interlocked molecule for the development of functional materials because of its unique mechanical properties that respond to various external stimuli, resulting in extension and contraction motions along the molecular axis. The synthesis of several &#8216;impossible&#8217; [2]rotaxanes that do not exhibit obvious binding motifs between their axle and wheel moieties has been achieved through further chemical modification of their axle moieties within pre&#8208;prepared [2]rotaxanes. However, no &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane has been synthesized using similar strategies until now. In this study, we investigated the hydrogenation of diarylacetylene moieties within a permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (PM &#945;&#8208;CD)&#8208;based [c2]daisy chain rotaxane using Pd/C or Pd/CaCO3 under hydrogen. A new [c2]daisy chain rotaxane featuring two diarylethane moieties was successfully synthesized through the simultaneous full hydrogenation of the insulated diarylacetylene moieties under optimized conditions. The new rotaxane is classified as an &#8216;impossible&#8217; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane due to the lack of obvious binding motifs between diarylethane and the PM &#945;&#8208;CD. This work demonstrates for the first time that the insulated axle moieties of [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes can undergo novel chemical modifications using a synthetic strategy employing transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation, which can potentially advance the development of nanoarchitectures with functional interlocked molecules.

         <title>Facile Access to Terminal Nitroalkanes via Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydronitration and Hydronitroalkylation of Alkenes Using Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitroalkanes: This work introduces methods to convert alkenes to terminal nitroalkanes using redox&#8208;active organic nitrating reagent N&#8208;nitrosuccinimide and aromatic thiol as HAT mediator under visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. Mild conditions tolerate number of functionalities, and the products can be obtained with exceptional anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. In addition to hydronitration, we introduce an anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydronitroalkylation strategy that facilitates chain expansion while maintaining the nitro group at the terminal position.







Abstract
The evolution of catalysis and functional group transfer reagents play a significant role in the development of anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrofunctionalization reactions, facilitating the access to value&#8208;added molecules. We herein report the first rational design of a modular intermolecular anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydronitration of alkenes, enabling the direct synthesis of terminal nitroalkanes under visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis. By employing the redox&#8208;active organic nitrating reagent N&#8208;nitrosuccinimide, the produced nitryl radicals, in the presence of an olefin and a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mediator, lead to an anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition with complete regioselectivity. Furthermore, we present results demonstrating the use of this catalytic system for chain expansion via anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition, utilizing substituted bromonitroalkanes as commercially available reagents. These transformations effectively address a gap in synthetic chemistry, enabling the direct synthesis of nitroalkanes from a variety of unactivated olefins in both complex molecules and unfunctionalized commodity chemicals.

         <title>Ag108(PEt3)24Cl6: A Hexagonal Prismatic Metalloid Cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and shape of metalloid clusters are heavily influenced by the ligands used for their protection. By carrying out a previously developed synthetic route for Ag64(PnBu3)16Cl6 with a different phosphine, the metalloid cluster Ag108(PEt3)24Cl6 can be obtained. Its unusual hexagonal prismatic shape as well as similarities with its smaller congener give further insight into the formation process of faceted silver nanoparticles.







Abstract
The ligands used for the protection of metalloid clusters heavily influence the resulting structure and shape. For silver, thiolate and alkynyl ligands are commonly used, while phosphines usually play a minor role as co&#8208;ligands. Herein, we report the synthesis and structural characterization of Ag108(PEt3)24Cl6 (1), the largest structurally characterized metalloid silver cluster with phosphines and halides as sole ligands. Instead of the frequently observed spherical shape of metalloid clusters, 1&#8217;s structure resembles a hexagonal prism. The highly light and temperature sensitive compound features many similarities to its smaller congener Ag64(PnBu3)16Cl6, though there are distinct structural and electronic differences present. Within 1, a Ag64 subunit can be found, which identifies these clusters as molecular seeds for the formation of faceted nanoparticles.

Cobalt&#8208;mediated oxidation of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dilithio&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl by ferrocenium salts afforded [6]cyclo&#8208;1,2&#8208;naphthylene, which exhibits blue circularly polarized luminescence at 383&#8197;nm, with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 97&#8201;% and a |glum| factor of 7.2&#215;10&#8722;4.







Abstract
A one&#8208;pot procedure with cobalt&#8208;mediated oxidation of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dilithio&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl by ferrocenium salts afforded the chiral cyclic hexamer of naphthylene, [6]cyclo&#8208;1,2&#8208;naphthylene (1). The molecular structure of 1 was determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR analyses, revealing its cyclic structure with an approximate D3 symmetry. Compound 1 exhibits blue emission at 383&#8197;nm with high photoluminescence quantum yield of 97&#8201;%, which can be attributed to its rigid twelve&#8208;membered ring structure. Optical resolution of 1 by chiral HPLC allowed for the evaluation of its chiroptical properties. Each enantiomer exhibits circular dichroism with complex Cotton effects, which are grouped into three positive or three negative couplets. Circularly polarized luminescence is observed at 383&#8197;nm with an anisotropy factor |glum| on the order of 10&#8722;4. The high photoluminescence quantum yield and the CPL properties of 1 indicate its potential application as a CPL emitter.

         <title>100&#8197;&#956;s Luminescence Lifetime Boosts the Excited State Reactivity of a Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Anthracene Complex in Photon Upconversion and Photocatalytic Polymerizations with Red Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ruthenium(II)&#8208;anthracene triad complex shows a metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) excited&#8208;state lifetime longer than 100&#8197;&#956;s. This complex enables the first ruthenium(II)&#8208;sensitizing red&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion with an efficiency of 0.8&#8201;% in aerobic solution and a pseudo anti&#8208;stokes shift of 0.94&#8197;eV. The long luminescence lifetime boosts the oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoredox catalytic polymerizations of acrylates and acrylamide with red light.







Abstract
The triplet excited state lifetime of a photosensitizer is an essential parameter for diffusion&#8208;controlled energy&#8208; and electron&#8208;transfer, which occurs usually in a competitive manner to the intrinsic decay of a triplet excited state. Here we show the decisive role of luminescence lifetime in the triplet excited state reactivity toward energy&#8208; and electron transfer. Anchoring two phenyl anthracene chromophores to a ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex (RuII ref) leads to a RuII triad with a luminescence lifetime above 100&#8197;&#956;s, which is more than 40 times longer than that of the prototypical complex. The obtained RuII triad sensitizes energy transfer to anthracene&#8208;based annihilators more efficiently than RuII ref and enables red&#8208;to&#8208;blue photon upconversion with a pseudo anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 0.94&#8197;eV and a moderate upconversion efficiency near 1&#8201;% in aerated solution. Particularly, RuII triad allows rapid photoredox catalytic polymerizations of acrylate and acrylamide monomers under aerobic condition with red light, which are kinetically hindered for RuII ref. Our work shows that excited state lifetime of a photosensitizer governs the dynamics of the excited state reactions, which seems an overlooked but important aspect for photochemistry.

         <title>Substituent Effects in Scholl&#8208;Type Reactions of 1,2&#8208;Terphenyls to Triphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The widely used Scholl&#8208;type cyclodehydrogenation is often still a mechanistic mystery. Here, bis&#8208;(disubstituted) 1,2&#8208;terphenyls were studied to get a deeper insight into position and electron nature of substituents to triphenylene formation. Furthermore, theoretical calculations suggest whether it is preferably a radical cation or arenium&#8208;ion mechanism that led to product formation.







Abstract
A series of 3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208; and 4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;dimethoxy terphenyls with different second substituents on their ortho&#8208;positions have been synthesized and investigated upon the possibility to be oxidatively cyclodehydrogenated to the corresponding triphenylenes under Scholl&#8208;type conditions. The experimentally obtained selectivities were supported and explained by quantum chemical calculations and conclusions on the involved mechanisms (acid catalyzed arenium&#8208;ion mechanism (AIM) vs radical cation mechanism) were drawn.

Herein, we devised a direct arylation reactions of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with azonaphthalenes, utilizing chiral phosphoric acid as the catalyst. This method delivers structurally novel atroposelective N, N&#8208;1,2&#8208;azole heteroaryl diamines with high yields (up to &gt;98&#8201;%) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios while exhibiting a wide range of substrate compatibility.







Abstract
The utilization of axially chiral biaryl diamines has been widely acknowledged as highly advantageous structures for the advancement of chiral catalysts and ligands. This highlights their extensive range of applications in asymmetric catalysis and synthesis. Herein, we devised a direct arylation reactions of 5&#8208;aminopyrazoles with azonaphthalenes, utilizing chiral phosphoric acid as the catalyst. This method delivers structurally novel atroposelective N, N&#8208;1,2&#8208;azole heteroaryl diamines with high yields (up to &gt;98&#8201;%) and good to excellent enantiomeric ratios while exhibiting a wide range of substrate compatibility.

         <dc:description>
The anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydronitration and hydronitroalkylation of alkenes by using cooperative photoredox catalysis and hydrogen atom abstraction has been developed to access an important class of molecules&#8212;nitroalkanes. The image shows a vibrant beam of visible light directed into a flask containing bench&#8208;stable, redox&#8208;active organic nitrating reagents, either N&#8208;nitrosuccinimide or gem&#8208;bromonitroalkanes, generating a controlled number of bubbles that transport reactive nitryl or nitroalkyl radicals. The unique molecules surrounding the flask and carried by bubbles symbolize the novelty of the reported method, drawing attention and inviting scientists to explore the world of radical nitration chemistry in greater depth. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Patra and D. Katayev (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403654).

The Cover Feature illustrates the possible synthetic routes for an &#8220;impossible&#8221; [c2]daisy chain rotaxane. The synthesis was achieved through simultaneous hydrogenation of both diarylacetylene moieties within a pre&#8208;prepared [c2]daisy chain rotaxane. This study demonstrates that the axle moieties of [c2]daisy chain rotaxanes can undergo chemical modification due to their expandable and contractible structural features, thereby advancing the development of functional interlocked molecules.

The Cover Feature depicts recent work on the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO with higher selectivity by employing CuII&#8208;based molecular catalysts. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403321), S.&#8197;K. Padhi and co&#8208;workers explain how they also observed the generation of H2 as a by&#8208;product due to 2&#8201;H++2&#8201;e&#8722; in the competitive proton reduction reaction. The kinetic phenomena reveal that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs prior to the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).

         <title>Surface Modification of Gold Nanorods: Multifunctional Strategies and Application Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a comprehensive review of the synthesis methods and surface ligand modifications of gold nanorods. It explores the roles and advantages of various ligands in self&#8208;assembly, highlighting that the careful selection of appropriate ligands not only optimizes the properties of nanoparticles but also enhances their functionality for specific applications.







Abstract
Gold nanorods (AuNRs), as an important type of gold nanomaterials, have attracted much attention in the nano field. Compared with gold nanoparticls, AuNRs have broader application potential due to their tunable localized surface plasmon resonance properties and anisotropic shapes. Yet, conventional synthesis methods using surfactants have limited the use of AuNRs in a variety of fields such as biomedical applications, plasma&#8208;enhanced fluorescence, optics and optoelectronic devices. To solve this problem and improve the stability and biocompatibility of AuNRs, researchers in recent years have used surface modification and functionalization to modify AuNRs, among which the introduction of organic ligands to prepare organic/gold hybrid nanorods has become an effective strategy. Organic materials have better toughness and easy processing, and by introducing organic ligands into the surface of AuNRs, the molecular&#8208;level composite of organic and inorganic materials can be realized, thus obtaining hybrid nanorods with excellent properties. This paper reviews the research progress of hybrid nanocomposites, and introducing the synthesis methods of AuNRs and the development of surface ligand modification, then summarises the applications of a wide variety of ligands. Also, the advantages and disadvantages of different ligands and their roles in further self&#8208;assembly processes are discussed.

Organic materials have better toughness and easy processing, and by introducing organic ligands into the surface of AuNRs, the molecular-level composite of organic and inorganic materials can be realized, thus obtaining hybrid nanorods with excellent properties. This paper reviews the research progress of hybrid nanocomposites, and introducing the synthesis methods of AuNRs and the development of surface ligand modification, then summarises the applications of a wide variety of ligands. Also, the advantages and disadvantages of different ligands and their roles in further self-assembly processes are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The binder materials is responsible for the mass transport of the catalyst layer for HT&#8208;PEMFCs. A detailed discussion of various binders with different molecular structures is described. In addition, we provide the development directions for different binders aiming at reducing the Pt loading and mitigating the PA poisoning.







Abstract
High&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) based on phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole membrane (PBI/PA) operating at 120&#8211;200&#8201;&#176;C can provide insensitivity to carbon monoxide (CO) and simplified managements of water and heat and thus attract significant global attention. However, one significant drawback is its low utilization of precious metal catalysts resulted from the PA poisoning and inefficient three&#8208;phase boundary. Studies of binder materials in catalyst layers for HT&#8208;PEMFC are gradually emerging and there are few literature reviews on this important topic. The purpose of this review is to describe the various types of binders based on their molecular structure and electrochemical properties, with particular emphasis on catalyst layer for fuel cells. Importantly, this review provides a better understanding of relationship between fuel cell performance and the gas permeability and conductivity of different binders. Then, future directions of research and development in binder materials of HT&#8208;PEMFC are pointed out.

         <title>Dimensionally Extending from 1D MX&#8211;Chain to Ladder and Nanotube Systems: Structural and Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in dimensionally extending MX&#8208;chains from 1D chains to various ladders and nanotubes are reviewed, from the viewpoints of structural and electronic properties. The dimensional extension of MX&#8208;chains can not only modulate interchain coupling and electronic properties, but also provide nanoscale confinement space for studying transport dynamics, thus providing insights into the next&#8208;generation of nanoelectronics.







Abstract
Molecular one&#8208;dimensional (1D) electron systems have attracted much attention due to their unique electronic state, physical and chemical properties derived from high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio structures. Among 1D materials, mixed&#8208;valence halogen&#8208;bridged transition&#8208;metal chain complexes (MX&#8208;chains) based on coordination assemblies are currently of particular interest because their electronic properties, such as mixed&#8208;valence state and band gap, can be controlled by substituting components and varying configurations. In particular, chemistry has recently noted that dimensionally extending MX&#8208;chains through organic rung ligands can introduce and modulate electronic coupling of metal atoms between chains, i.&#8201;e., interchain interactions. In this review, for the first time, we highlight the recent progress on MX systems from the viewpoint of dimensionally extending from 1D chain to ladder and nanotube, mainly involving structural design and electronic properties. Overall, dimensional extension can not only tune the electronic properties of MX&#8208;chain, but also build the unique platform for studying transport dynamics in confined space, such as proton conduction. Based on these features, we envision that the MX&#8208;chain systems provide valuable insights into deep understanding of 1D electron systems, as well as the potential applications such as nanoelectronics.

In this contribution, we provide an overview of the use of RuII alkynyl derivatives toward the understanding and the development of various research domains, ranging from non&#8208;linear and linear optics to nano&#8208;and molecular electronics through molecular switches.







Abstract
In this contribution, we describe the various research domains in which RuII alkynyl derivatives are involved. Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the &#960; system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light&#8208;harvesting applications or non&#8208;linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/&#960; mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.

Modulating d&#8208;band center of transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts is an effective approach to regulate the adsorption energy of intermediates, alter reaction pathways, reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, ultimately improve electrocatalytic water splitting performance. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in modulating the d&#8208;band center for enhanced electrocatalytic water splitting is provided.







Abstract
To tackle the global energy scarcity and environmental degradation, developing efficient electrocatalysts is essential for achieving sustainable hydrogen production via water splitting. Modulating the d&#8208;band center of transition metal electrocatalysts is an effective approach to regulate the adsorption energy of intermediates, alter reaction pathways, lower the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step, and ultimately improve electrocatalytic water splitting performance. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in modulating the d&#8208;band center for enhanced electrocatalytic water splitting is offered. Initially, the basics of the d&#8208;band theory are discussed. Subsequently, recent modulation strategies that aim to boost electrocatalytic activity, with particular emphasis on the d&#8208;band center as a key indicator in water splitting are summarized. Lastly, the importance of regulating electrocatalytic activity through d&#8208;band center, along with the challenges and prospects for improving electrocatalytic water splitting performance by fine&#8208;tuning the transition metal d&#8208;band center, are provided.

         <title>Recent Applications of Sulfonium Salts in Synthesis and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent developments on the synthetic applications of sulfonium salts with an emphasis on the description of the operating mechanistic pathways.







Abstract
The use of sulfonium salts in organic synthesis has experienced a dramatic increase during the last years that can arguably be attributed to three main factors; the development of more direct and efficient synthetic methods that make easily available sulfonium reagents of a wide structural variety, their intrinsic thermal stability, which facilitates their structural modification, handling and purification even on large scale, and the recognition that their reactivity resembles that of hypervalent iodine compounds and therefore, they can be used as replacement of such reagents for most of their uses. This renewed interest has led to the improvement of already existing reactions, as well as to the discovery of unprecedented transformations; in particular, by the implementation of photocatalytic protocols. This review aims to summarize the most recent advancements on the area focusing on the work published during and after 2020. The scope of the methods developed will be highlighted and their limitations critically evaluated.

         <title>50 Years of Organoselenium Chemistry, Biochemistry and Reactivity: Mechanistic Understanding, Successful and Controversial Stories</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 70, December 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
From the stink to the stars! The reputation of organoselenium species changed drastically in the past fifty years. While at the beginning of their history they were notoriously famous for their toxicity and infernal smell, organoselenides are nowadays recognized for their fundamental role in redox biology and as green organocatalysts. While applications in pharmaceutical sciences are still lacking, safe&#8208;to&#8208;be&#8208;administered compounds exist and new venues for bioactive low molecular weight organoselenides are being explored. In this review, the pervasive chemistry of the element of the moon is discussed focusing on the pivotal role of organoselenium species in biology, catalysis and pharmacology, providing an historical perspective on different but intertwined fields.







Abstract
In 1973, two major discoveries changed the face of selenium chemistry: the identification of the first mammal selenoenzyme, glutathione peroxidase 1, and the discovery of the synthetic utility of the so&#8208;called selenoxide elimination. While the chemical mechanism behind the catalytic activity of glutathione peroxidases appears to be mostly unveiled, little is known about the mechanisms of other selenoproteins and, for some of them, even the function lies in the dark. In chemistry, the capacity of organoselenides of catalyzing hydrogen peroxide activation for the practical manipulation of organic functional groups has been largely explored, and some mechanistic details have been clearly elucidated. As a paradox, despite the long&#8208;standing experience in the field, the nature of the active oxidant in various reactions still remains matter of debate. While many successes characterize these fields, the pharmacological use of organoselenides still lacks any true application, and while some organoselenides were found to be non&#8208;toxic and safe to use, to date no therapeutically approved use was granted. In this review, some fundamental and chronologically aligned topics spanning organoselenium biochemistry, chemistry and pharmacology are discussed, focusing on the current mechanistic picture describing their activity as either bioactive compounds or catalysts.

         <title>Nucleophilic Triphenylgermanides of Magnesium and Calcium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of the dimeric alkaline earth hydrides, [(BDI)AeH]2 (BDI=HC{(Me)CNDipp}2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3; Ae=Mg, Ca), with Ph3GeH in the presence of THF provide H2 and [(BDI)AeGePh3(THF)]. Although the synthesis of the magnesium derivative is complicated by THF ring opening, the calcium reagent is a viable source of the triphenylgermanide nucleophile.







Abstract
The dimeric calcium and magnesium hydrides, [(BDI)AeH]2 [BDI=HC{(Me)CNDipp}2, Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3; Ae=Mg or Ca] do not react with Ph3GeH in non&#8208;coordinating solvent. Addition of THF, however, induces deprotonation and access to monomeric Ae&#8208;germanide complexes, [(BDI)Ae{GePh3}(THF)], both of which have been structurally characterized. Although this process is facile when Ae=Ca, the analogous magnesium&#8208;based reaction requires heating to temperatures &gt;100&#8201;&#176;C, under which conditions germanide formation is complicated by THF ring opening and the generation of an alkaline earth germyl&#8208;C&#8208;terminated n&#8208;butoxide, [(BDI)Mg{&#956;2&#8208;O(CH2)4GePh3}]. Reactions of [(BDI)Ca{GePh3}(THF)] with N,N&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylcarbodiimide and benzophenone provide the respective germylamidinate and germylalkoxide derivatives, [(BDI)Ca{(i&#8208;PrN)2CGePh3}(THF)] and [(BDI)Ca{OC(GePh3)Ph2}(THF)], demonstrating its potential as a well&#8208;defined and soluble source of the [Ph3Ge]&#8722; anion in nucleophilic addition reactions.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Thioglycosylated Monolignol Dual Probes for Bioimaging of Lignin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the design, synthesis, and application of thioglycosylated monolignol probes, functionalized for bioorthogonal labeling, to study lignin biosynthesis in plant cell walls. By incorporating stable sulfur&#8208;linked glycosides with clickable tags, we enable precise in&#8197;situ visualization of lignin through confocal fluorescence microscopy. Our results highlight unique insights into the spatial dynamics and roles of monolignol glucosides in lignification.







Abstract
Lignin biosynthesis is a critical process that underpins plant structural integrity and defenses. Central to this pathway are monolignol glucosides (MLGs), whose role as intermediates remains debated. To elucidate MLGs&#8217; involvement, we developed thioglycosylated monolignol probes compatible with click chemistry for in&#8197;situ visualization of lignin biosynthesis. Using a highly selective Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig&#8211;Migita cross&#8208;coupling approach, these probes incorporate glycosyl thiols into MLGs, creating stable thioacetal bonds to enhance both metabolic stability and tracking precision. The unique chemistry of these probes allows for incorporation within the lignification pathway, enabling specific visualization of MLG involvement in lignin formation. The probes are compatible with bioorthogonal chemistry labeling and confocal microscopy, allowing detailed tracking of MLG transport, storage, and incorporation into cell walls. Our findings provide new insights into lignification dynamics, underscoring the metabolic roles of MLGs and demonstrating their potential as metabolic intermediates in lignin polymerization. This approach offers a novel chemical biology toolset to dissect plant cell wall biosynthesis and will help elucidatethe molecular roles of MLGs in the context of plant biochemistry and resilience.

Determination of partial orders of reactions in kinetics is a general entry step for any mechanistic investigation; recently, considerable attention has been given to the benefits of using visual methods to help in this task, such as easy utilization and data&#8208;efficiency. In this respect, we here revisit and improve the classic method by Powell and Margerison for kinetic analysis. For the first time, analytical equations for a bimolecular reaction have been worked out for all values of partial orders of reactions, and the solutions have been implemented in a free, open&#8208;access and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use Web&#8208;application, named IPLOT&#8208;VKA, which also allows estimation of the errors on the kinetic constant, and residual standard error on concentrations. Several examples, taken from reference teaching experiences and from recent literature in catalysis show the efficacy and accuracy of our approach, which also has the advantage of requiring less experimental runs than other visual methods currently available.

&lt;p&gt;Methods for the determination of partial orders of reaction have been surveyed and expanded. A free online application named IPLOT-VKA, after Integral-method Powell-pLOT-enhanced-Visual Kinetic Analysis, has been developed to speed up the determination of partial orders of reaction in chemical kinetics.

         <title>Near&#8208;Quantitative Removal of Oxalate and Terephthalate from Water by Precipitation with a Rigid Bis&#8208;Amidinium Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple precipitant removes oxalate and terephthalate from water and shows remarkable selectivity over other anions including halides, other polycarboxylates and sulfate. Once oxalate/terephthalate has been removed from water, the precipitant can be regenerated easily and effectively for subsequent re&#8208;use.







Abstract
A simple, readily&#8208;prepared precipitant (1&#8901;Cl2) precipitates oxalate or terephthalate from water with very high efficacy, removing these anions at sub&#8208;millimolar concentrations using only one equivalent of precipitant. A simple aqueous base/acid cycle can be used to regenerate 1&#8901;Cl2 after use. The resulting precipitates, 1&#8901;oxalate and 1&#8901;terephthalate, are anhydrous and closely&#8208;packed, with each anion receiving eight charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds from amidinium N&#8722;H donors. Precipitation of oxalate and terephthalate occurs at much lower concentrations than other dicarboxylates, and direct competition experiments with the biologically/environmentally relevant divalent anions CO32&#8722;, HPO42&#8722; and SO42&#8722; reveal very high selectivity for oxalate or terephthalate over these competitors.

         <title>Hydridostannylene Derivatives of Magnesium and Calcium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of [(2,6&#8208;Dipp2C6H3)Sn(&#956;&#8208;H)]2 (Dipp=2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3) with [(BDI)AeH]2 (BDI=HC{(Me)CNDipp}2; Ae=Mg, Ca) provide heterobimetallic bis&#8208;&#956;2&#8208;hydrido species, [[(BDI)Ae&#8208;&#956;&#8208;(H)2&#8208;Sn(C6H3&#8208;2,6&#8208;Dipp2)]. Although both compounds react with hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene to provide alkaline earth derivatives of tetravalent organostannides, the magnesium reagent promotes twofold addition of the alkene whereas the calcium&#8208;based reaction is arrested after a single hydrostannylation event.







Abstract
Reactions of a m&#8208;terphenylhydridostannylene with &#946;&#8208;diketiminato magnesium and calcium hydrides provide bis&#8208;&#956;2&#8208;hydrido species, the heterobimetallic constitutions of which are maintained after the addition of THF donor solvent. In both cases, reactions with hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene result in the formation of tetravalent organostannyl alkaline earth derivatives. Whereas the magnesium reagent undergoes facile twofold addition, the calcium&#8208;centered process is arrested after a single alkene reduction event. This contrasting behavior is assessed to result from the heavier alkaline earth element's ability to form a persistent polyhapto interaction with an arene substituent of the m&#8208;terphenyl ligand.

         <title>A Photolockable Polyaromatic Capsule Designed via Regiochemical Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bent amphiphile featuring two 2&#8208;substituted anthracene panels, designed via the regiochemical substitution of a previous bent amphiphile with 9&#8208;substituted panels, quantitatively assembles into a well&#8208;defined polyaromatic capsule in water with improved host ability. Upon short light irradiation, the capsule and its host&#8208;guest composites undergo efficient intermolecular [4+4] photo&#8208;oligomerization in water, without release of the bound guests.







Abstract
Photocontrol over host frameworks is an elegant way to manipulate host&#8208;guest composites, yet the majority of previous systems suffer from long irradiation time and narrow guest scope, and are restricted to intramolecular photoreactions in organic solvents. Herein we present a photolockable polyaromatic capsule with high guest binding abilities in water. The capsule assembles from bent amphiphiles featuring two 2&#8208;subsutituted anthracene panels, which shows high stability against dilution and undergoes intermolecular [4+4] photo&#8208;oligomerization upon short light irradiation (&lt;10&#8197;min). The photolocked capsule provides a roughly spherical framework, with an average, core diameter of ~3&#8197;nm, composed of amphiphilic oligomers (e.&#8201;g., trimer). The new capsule shows improved host ability (up to 10&#8208;fold) in water toward various hydrophobic compounds (e.&#8201;g., organic and metal&#8208;complex dyes), as compared with an analogous, non&#8208;photolockable capsule with 9&#8208;subsutituted anthracene panels. In addition, the resultant dye&#8208;loaded capsules are also successfully photolocked via short irradiation with high retention of the bound dyes.

Supercapacitor electrodes: Glucose induced NiCo&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (NiCoLDH) to produce excellent electrode structure, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor.







Abstract
In order to improve the electrochemical performance of NiCo&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (NiCoLDH), the synthesis of low&#8208;crystallinity NiCoLDH was induced by the adsorption of glucose and NiCoLDH. The results showed that glucose could not only effectively regulate the pore structure and morphology of NiCoLDH, but also had a regular effect on crystallinity. Pure phase NiCoLDH had higher crystallinity. When the mass of glucose is 0.05&#8197;g, the prepared NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 is a short&#8208;range ordered structure embedded in the amorphous matrix. The crystallinity of the product decreases further with the further increase of glucose mass. Since the ordered structures have higher electrical conductivity, and amorphous structures have more defects and active sites, the structure of NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 is conducive to achieving the best electrochemical performance. Electrochemical test results show that NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 has a high specific capacitance, about 12 times that of the pure phase NiCoLDH, the mass of glucose is higher than or below 0.05&#8197;g, the specific capacitance will be further reduced. NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 and activated carbon assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor have a power density of 400&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 32.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This study provides a new idea for obtaining excellent electrochemical properties by adjusting LDH crystallinity.

         <title>An Ion Pair Receptor for Selective Solid&#8208;Liquid Extraction of LiCl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion pair receptor composed of a functionalized calix[4]arene and a calix[4]pyrrole unit extracts lithium chloride with high selectivity from a solid mixture of alkali metal chloride salts and releases it upon contact with water.







Abstract
We have synthesized a new ion pair receptor (2) consisting of a cone&#8208;calix[4]arene bearing a combination of ethyl esters and ethers as a cation binding site and a calix[4]pyrrole subunit acting as an anion binding site. Ion pair receptor 2 complexes LiCl, NaCl, and CsCl among alkali metal chloride salts with distinct complexation modes and affinities in 10&#8201;% methanol&#8208;d4 in chloroform&#8208;d. For instance, relatively small Li+ and Na+ cations are bound to the oxygen atoms of the functionalized calix[4]arene lower rim with Cl&#8722; being hydrogen bonded to the calix[4]pyrrole NHs while the larger Cs+ cation is bound to the cone&#8208;shaped calix[4]pyrrole cavity via a &#960;&#8208;cation interaction. By contrast, in the co&#8208;presence of all MCl salts (M=Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs), receptor 2 binds LiCl with complete selectivity. Besides, receptor 2 is capable of extracting LiCl selectively into a chloroform or a dichloromethane organic phase from its solid source containing all other MCl salts.

         <title>Enabling High&#8208;Performance Multi&#8208;Resonant TADF Emitters via Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green OLED based on BN&#8208;2Pm demonstrates EQEmax of 36.5% with CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.71), while device employing BN&#8208;5Pm as emitting layer exhibits EQEmax of 14.6% with CIE coordinates of (0.12, 0.57). The magic difference in luminescence between the two isomers lies in the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bond.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonds (HBs), prevalent strong interactions in organic compounds, can effectively constrain single bond rotation, leading to rigid planar configurations. This rigidity enhances emission efficiency and narrows the emission spectrum of luminescent materials. Recent advances have leveraged HBs to advance high&#8208;performance donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. However, their application in multi&#8208;resonance (MR) TADF emitters remains limited. We herein developed MR&#8208;TADF emitters incorporating intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IHBs) with pyrimidine as the HB acceptor. The rigid planar conformation induced by IHBs significantly improved photoluminescence quantum yield, extended emission wavelength, reduced full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, and decreased non&#8208;radiative decay rates for BN&#8208;2Pm compared to BN&#8208;5Pm. Devices based on BN&#8208;2Pm achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.5&#8201;%, a current efficiency of 102.3&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, a power efficiency of 84.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.18, 0.71). In contrast, BN&#8208;5Pm exhibited lower values: 14.6&#8201;%, 36.8&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, 27.6&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, and (0.12, 0.57), respectively.

         <title>Isolation of a Staudinger&#8208;type Intermediate Utilizing a Five&#8208;Membered Phosphorus&#8208;Centered Biradicaloid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trapping transient Staudinger&#8208;type intermediates. The reaction of five&#8208;membered biradicaloids with azides (e.&#8201;g.&#160;Dipp&#8208;N3) leads to a variety of reaction pathways. Staudinger&#8208;type intermediates can be isolated directly from the reaction mixture (without loss of N2) if specific time or temperature control is applied. SCXRD, low&#8208;temperature NMR studies and calculations help to understand under which conditions addition or Staudinger type reaction takes place.







Abstract
The Staudinger reaction provides chemists with a valuable tool for the reduction of azides, which are notoriously unstable and can decompose explosively. By providing a controlled method for the conversion of azides to amines, the reaction opened up new avenues for the synthesis of various amine&#8208;containing compounds that are widely used in natural products, pharmaceuticals and polymers. The Staudinger reaction begins with the nucleophilic attack of a trivalent phosphine (usually triphenylphosphine), leading to the formation of a triazenide intermediate, a highly reactive species. Here we report how a divalent phosphorus&#8208;centered biradicaloid reacts with covalent azides and show that it is possible to capture and fully characterize the transient intermediate. The experimental data is supported by quantum chemical calculations of the reaction paths and in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Encapsulated NHCs: Increased Selectivity and Reactivity of CO2 in Amine Formylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement of a N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) in cyclodextrins (CDs) allows the organocatalytic formylation of amines. The presence of a cavity enables substrate&#8208;selectivity, based on the steric bulk around the amine, without any loss of reactivity.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the confinement of a N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) organocatalyst in the cavity of cyclodextrins (CDs). These confined organocatalysts allow the formylation of amines through CO2 hydrosilylation. The presence of the cavity of the CDs leads to substrate&#8208;selectivity between amines in competition reactions. The use of the smallest &#945;&#8208;CD induces the best selectivities but also increased reactivity compared to the bigger &#946;&#8208;CD. A careful study conducted by NMR and DFT revealed that in &#945;&#8208;CD, the complexed CO2 interacts with the cavity through hydrogen bonds. These H&#8208;bonds destabilize the NHC&#8211;CO2 adduct and are accountable for the higher reactivity observed using &#945;&#8208;CD.

This study demonstrates how the coordination conformation of a tris&#8208;amine molecule built on a central benzene frame changes when multimetallated by a different set of alkali metals







Abstract
Literature on Group One organoelement chemistry is dominated by lithium, though sodium and potassium also feature prominently, whereas rubidium and caesium are rarely mentioned. With recent breakthroughs hinting that organoelement compounds of these two heavier metals can perform better than their lighter congeners in particular applications, important advantages could be missed unless complete sets of alkali metals are included in studies. Here, we report the synthesis and characterisation of a complete set of multi&#8208;alkali&#8208;metallated molecular compounds of the 1,3,5&#8208;tris[(4,6&#8208;dimethylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)aminomethyl]&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triethylbenzene framework. Made by deprotonating the framework N&#8722;H bonds by a suitable base, the set comprises six THF&#8208;solvated compounds, four of which are homometallic, either containing Li in a trinuclear structure or Na, K, and Rb in hexanuclear structures. Since deprotonation was incomplete with Cs, its homometallic compound is tetranuclear containing two un&#8208;metallated N&#8722;H bonds. A heterobimetallic trilithium&#8208;tricaesium hexanuclear compound was also obtained by using a bimetallic Li&#8722;Cs base for deprotonation. Such alkali&#8208;metallated frameworks are often precursors to other multimetallic frameworks with unique properties across different fields of science.

Such alkali-metallated frameworks are often precursors to other multimetallic frameworks with unique properties across different fields of science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reusable Iron&#8208;Copper Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Primary Amides with Aryl and Alkyl Halides: Access to N&#8208;Arylamides as Potential Antibacterial and Anticancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed, for the first time, reusable, efficient ligand&#8208;free iron&#8208;copper catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction involving a variety of aryl, heteroaryl halides (including chlorides, bromides, and iodides), and alkyl bromides with diverse aryl and aliphatic primary amides, conducted under solvent&#8208;minimized conditions. This economically competitive protocol offered the corresponding cross&#8208;coupling products, N&#8208;arylamides and N&#8208;alkylamides, in good to excellent yields with broad substrate scope (65 examples) and tolerance to several sensitive functionalities. A series of experiments, XPS, UV, CV, EPR, XRD, and radical clock experiments were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the in&#8208;vitro. study of synthesized products 3&#8201;ii, 3&#8201;xii, and 3&#8201;xxxx exhibited promising antibacterial and anticancer activities (MTT and Molecular Docking).







Abstract

This economically competitive protocol successfully yielded the corresponding cross&#8208;coupling products, N&#8208;arylamides and N&#8208;alkylamides, in good to excellent yields with broad substrate scope (65 examples) and tolerance to several sensitive functionalities (including heterocycles). No conventional work&#8208;up is required for this protocol, and the developed method is applicable for gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Notably, the catalyst is inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and can be reused at least four times with minimal loss of catalytic activity. A series of experiments, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) were conducted to identify the oxidation state of active catalytic species and radical clock experiment was performed using a radical probe to investigate the reaction mechanism. Furthermore, we evaluated the antibacterial and anticancer properties of selected synthesized products (3&#8201;ii, 3&#8201;xii, and 3&#8201;xxxx) in&#8208;vitro. The results indicated that the prepared compounds exhibited promising antibacterial and anticancer activities (MTT and Molecular Docking).

         <title>Morphological Evolution of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks into Hedrite, Sheaf and Spherulite Superstructures with Localized Different Coloration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hyperbranched metal&#8208;organic superstructures reported here exhibit diverse morphologies, including hedrites, sheafs, and spherulites. These structures are formed via non&#8208;crystallographic branching, which represents a distinct growth mechanism typically observed in many materials and is being reported for the first time in metal&#8208;organic frameworks.







Abstract
The branched metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are the first superstructures of this kind, and the growth mechanism may explain crystal shapes of other materials. The mechanism of the formation of fascinating structures having a hedrite, sheaf or spherulite appearance are detailed. The branching can be controlled, resulting in crystals that either exhibit multiple generations of branching or a single generation. These structures might result from an increasing number of defects on fast&#8208;grown rods. As the basal facets become less reactive, material is added to the prism facets, leading to secondary nucleation and triangular branches. These triangular structures are connected to the rod surface, growing longer than the central rod. Electron diffraction analyses show that the sheafs are polycrystalline structures with their fantails consisting of single&#8208;crystalline nanorods deviating gradually from each other in their orientation. The crystallographic structure consists of channels with opposite handedness. The accessibility of the nanochannels and the porosity of the superstructures are demonstrated by chromophore diffusion into the channels. The confinement and alignment of the chromophores inside the channels resulted in polarized&#8208;light dependent coloration of the crystals; the polycrystallinity generated areas having different optical properties.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene&#160;S&#8208;oxides has been efficiently synthesized via one&#8208; or two&#8208;step selective oxidation of benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b]benzothiophene (BTBT). These BTBT&#160;S&#8208;oxides form highly ordered structures that display optical anisotropy, are thermally stable up to temperatures above 210 oC, and do not show phase transitions. They exhibit long excited state lifetimes (0.181&#8211;0.869 ms) and are more resistant to oxidative degradation than their parent unoxidized BTBT. Some of these compounds demonstrate high quantum yields, exceeding 98% in solution and 71% in the solid state. As evidenced by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, BTBT&#8208;based sulfoxides have sufficiently high pyramidal inversion energy barriers that prevent their stereomutation at room temperature. Additionally, fully S&#8208;oxidized BTBT meets the energy&#8208;splitting criterion required for the singlet fission process, with the T1 energy level that makes it suitable for device application.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrinoids in the 20&#960;&#8208;electron state have been extensively studied from the fundamental viewpoint of investigating their structure&#8211;antiaromaticity relationships. However, most of the 20&#960; porphyrinoids are highly distorted and unstable in air, which hinder the comprehensive analysis of paratropic ring&#8208;current effects derived from planar &#960;&#8208;electron systems. Herein, we present the first examples of antiaromatic Sn(IV) complexes of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5,15&#8208;diazaporphyrinoids (SnX2TADAPs), prepared by the complexation of the corresponding freebases with Sn(II) chloride under aerobic conditions and subsequent metathesis of the axial ligands, that show paratropic ring&#8208;current effects. Notably, both neutral 20&#960;&#8208;electron derivatives and 19&#960;&#8208;electron radical cations of SnX2TADAP are extremely stable in air owing to the intrinsic electronic effects of the central Sn(IV) unit and meso nitrogen atoms. NMR spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and density functional theory calculations were performed to assess the ring&#8208;current effects and orbital energies of a series of the 20&#960;&#8208;electron SnX2TADAPs, and the results reveal that the paratropic ring&#8208;current effects arising from the planar 20&#960;&#8208;electron DAP ring increases with a decrease in the HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution Processable Se&#8208;annulated Swallow Tail Perylene Bisimide Exhibiting

Room Temperature Columnar Phase and Efficient

Ambipolar Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a selenium&#8208;annulated perylene bisimide (PBI&#8208;SeST) stabilizing room temperature columnar hexagonal phase with exceptionally low clearing temperature. The synthesis of this Se&#8208;annulated PBI (PBI&#8208;SeST) was accomplished using the reductive Cadogan cyclization method, with the introduction of swallow tails to reduce the clearing temperature and improve solubility. In addition, the charge carrier mobility of the Se&#8208;bay annulated PBI is assessed by space charge limited current (SCLC) technique and juxtaposed with PBI as well as nitrogen and sulphur&#8208;bay&#8208;annulated PBIs. It is noteworthy that all these PBIs exhibited ambipolar charge carrier mobility, a characteristic that diverges from the prevailing literature where predominantly electron transport behavior was observed for PBIs. This distinguishes them as an exclusive category of solution&#8208;processable, self&#8208;assembling organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic Investigations of the Solid Solution Zr(V1&#8208;xAlx)2 Adopting the Laves Phase Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Laves phases are an interesting field of research when it comes to structural chemistry and physical properties. Investigations of the ternary system Zr&#8211;V&#8211;Al showed, in contrast to the system Hf&#8211;V&#8211;Al, that no superstructures can be observed within the solid solution Zr(V1&#8211;xAlx)2. High values of x form aluminum rich phases that adopt the hexagonal MgZn2 type structure while low values of x lead to vanadium rich phases that adopt the cubic MgCu2 type. All samples were investigated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. Single crystal studies indicated that no superstructure formation is present in the investigated samples. 27Al MAS NMR investigations confirmed these findings. For ZrAl2, quantum&#8208;chemical calculations helped with the analysis of the 27Al NMR spectrum of the binary endmember of the solid solution. Some of the prepared samples were investigated with respect to their magnetic properties. The investigated compounds show Pauli&#8208;paramagnetism, in Zr(V0.875Al0.125)2 in addition superconductivity with a critical temperature of TC = 4.17(1) K was observed. Investigations of compositions that do not belong to the Laves phase regime clearly indicate that the MgZn2 type structure is still the dominant phase. Regardless of the starting composition chosen, the hexagonal Laves phase was mostly present.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfonatocalix[4]arene&#8208;Based Scavengers for V&#8208;Type Nerve Agents with Enhanced Detoxification Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic small molecule scavengers that rapidly detoxify nerve agents&#160;in vivo&#160;allow (pre)treatment of nerve agent poisoning. However, scavengers that detoxify persistent V&#8208;type nerve agents at pH 7.4 and 37 &#176;C with sufficient efficiency are still unknown. The most promising compound to date is a monosubstituted sulfonatocalix[4]arene containing a hydroxamic acid group. This compound was used to investigate the effect of structural modifications on detoxification activity. While none of the monosubstituted calixarene derivatives considered in this context possessed higher activity than the parent compound, the disubstituted derivatives were very active, exhibiting half&#8208;lives of detoxification under the conditions of an established&#160;in vitro&#160;assay of &lt;1.5 min. The rate of detoxification decreased with decreasing scavenger concentration, but even at a fourfold molar excess of the scavenger, complete detoxification of 2.5 &#956;M&#160;solutions of some nerve agents could be achieved within one hour. These disubstituted calixarene derivatives thus bring synthetic scavengers for V&#8208;type nerve agents closer to application.</dc:description>

         <title>Guest diffusion versus recrystallization in a single crystal: two growing mechanisms for griseofulvin clathrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Griseofulvin represents a rare case of a close&#8208;packed organic apohost that can clathrate selected volatile guests in a solid&#8208;gas fashion. Inclusion mechanisms and solvent exchange were investigated by a combination of single crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, coupled to optical microscopy and thermal analyses. In particular, gas diffusion and dissolution/recrystallization are alternatively observed, depending on the host polymorph, as well as the chemical nature of the guest and its physical state.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Aromatization of 5,7,12,14 Pentacenetetrone: Approach Towards Substituted Pentacenes?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report a convenient access to asymmetrically substituted, well soluble pentacene derivatives synthesized from commercially available 5,7,12,14 pentacenetetrone via reductive one step functionalization. Zinc or potassium are used as reducing agents and the reduced intermediates are trapped with electrophiles such as acetyl, triisopropylsilyl or cationic methyl synthons. The reduction allows for an unsymmetric functionalization whilst one dione moiety is maintained due to partial reduction. The resulting dyes are characterized by UV/ Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Their redox potentials are studied by cyclic voltammetry. The experimentally determined molecular frontier orbital energies are rationalized by density functional theory. The spatial molecular packing motive in the solid state is studied as a function of the substituent size by X ray crystallography. Attempts of reducing the second quinone moiety towards a functionalized pentacene led to an over reduced 6,13&#8208;dihydropentacene derivative, which by means of an XRD structural analysis surprisingly displays a planar molecular conformation and unique optoelectronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic CeCl3&#8208;Promoted C&#8722;H Alkenylation and Alkynylation of Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indirect HAT&#8208;mediated photocatalytic protocol is developed, using a cerium salt (CeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O) and a chlorine source (TBACl) as the catalytic system. A variety of cyclic and linear hydrocarbons are utilized, delivering the corresponding alkenylation or alkynylation products in good to high yields, displaying high regioselectivity under 390 nm irradiation.







Abstract
The reemerging field of photoredox catalysis offers numerous advantages towards the development of novel, sustainable and easy&#8208;to&#8208;execute organic transformations. Herein, we report a light&#8208;triggered application of cerium complexes towards the C&#8722;H alkenylation and alkynylation of alkanes. An indirect HAT&#8208;mediated photocatalytic protocol was developed, using a cerium salt (CeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;7H2O) and a chlorine source (TBACl) as the catalytic system. A variety of cyclic and linear hydrocarbons were utilized, delivering the corresponding alkenylation or alkynylation products in good to high yields, displaying high regioselectivity. A series of mechanistic experiments were conducted.

         <title>Economically Scalable Cu&#8208;based MOFs: Vital Role of Structural Integrity towards Selectivity on Azeotropic Ethanol Dehydration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable production of Cu&#8208;triazole MOF through a facile and economical route is demonstrated. Providing hydrophilic pores with open&#8208;metal Cu&#8208;sites, the framework is highly selective to water adsorption from an azeotropic mixture of water&#8208;ethanol. Furthermore, the enhanced framework's crystallinity is a key to success in the improved performance of liquid&#8208;phase ethanol dehydration.







Abstract
A facile, green, and economical method for the scalable synthesis of hydrophilic copper&#8208;triazole metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Cu&#8208;trz) is demonstrated. Numerous open metal sites within the highly crystalline porous structure of Cu&#8208;trz are generated through mild thermal activation, enabling its application in liquid&#8208;phase ethanol dehydration under ambient conditions. The frameworks with distinct crystallinity and particle sizes were achieved by modifying the synthesis process. The high crystallinity of the framework plays an exclusive role in enhancing water adsorption capacity. With selective water adsorption comparable to commercial zeolite 3&#8197;A, Cu&#8208;trz MOF emerges as a promising candidate for cost&#8208;effective water&#8208;ethanol separation.

         <title>Pd/Cu Catalyzed Asymmetric Allylation for Stereodivergent Synthesis of Glutamic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synergistic Pd/Cu catalyst system has been developed for stereodivergent transformation of Morita&#8208;Baylis&#8208;Hillman (MBH) carbonates and Schiff bases derived from simple amino acids to afford a series of optically active &#946;&#8208;branched &#947;&#8208;methyleneglutamic acid derivatives with adjacent tertiary/tertiary and quaternary/tertiary stereocenters in high yields (up to 96%) with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (&gt;20/1 dr and &gt;99% ee in most cases) under mild conditions. The use of SKP ligand is disclosed to be crucial for the success of the transformation, and in particular allowing the reaction to proceed at low catalyst loading (0.02 mol% for Pd and 0.08 mol% for Cu). The high efficiency of the catalysis was attributed to the formation of intimate ion pair complex A1, composed of Pd&#8208;phosphonium cation and a t&#8208;butoxide anion, which would facilitate the subsequent deprotonation and C&#8208;C coupling events. All four stereoisomers of the &#946;&#8208;branched glutamic acid derivatives were readily prepared by permutation of the catalyst enantiomers. Synthetic utility of the methodology was exemplified by efficient synthesis of a fused pyrrolooxazolidinone with three contiguous chiral centers, highlighting the power of synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis for asymmetric allylic alkylation with MBH carbonates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries have abundant sources of raw materials, uniform geographical distribution, and low cost, and it is considered an important substitute for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Thereinto, solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries have the advantages of low raw material cost, high safety, and high energy density, and it has shown great potential for application in the fields of mobile power, electric vehicles, and large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, the commercial development and large&#8208;scale application of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries urgently need to address issues such as the low room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of solid electrolytes, high interfacial charge transfer impedance, and poor compatibility and contact between the solid electrolytes and the electrodes. Herein, this paper systematically discusses the basic theories of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries, including working principles and characteristics, electrode materials and components, and solid electrolytes. Then, focusing on solid electrolytes, the key scientific challenges faced by solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries were systematically discussed, and the application of interface modification in enhancing solid&#8208;state electrolytes was reviewed. Finally, the future industrial development of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries was prospected. This review helps to deepen the understanding of the interface scientific issues of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries and provides theoretical guidance for its development and application.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective formal (3+3) and (3+2) cycloaddition reaction of isatin&#8208;derived tertiary propargylic esters with N,N&#8208;dimethylbarbituric acid and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins, respectively. In this process, the tertiary propargylic ester serves as both C3&#8208; and C2&#8208;synthons, facilitating the synthesis of optically&#160;active spirooxindole&#8208;pyran and furan scaffolds featuring an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. The reaction delivers these spirocyclic frameworks in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Additionally, the scalability of both the reactions and the transformation of chiral intermediates into valuable structures emphasize the synthetic and practical importance of this strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;Hunterine A: Deciphering the Key Step in the Biogenetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise, bioinspired, and enantioselective synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;hunterine A, an odd 6/7/6/6/5 pentacyclic natural product, is described. The key step in the synthesis of this complex structure is an interim&#8208;template directed 6&#8208;exo selective epoxide ring&#8208;opening reaction, which is interwoven with a hydrolysis step of the indolenine hemiaminal template to create the unusual 7&#8208;membered azepine bridge motif. Our work not only refines the previously proposed biogenetic pathway, but also reveals the possible stereochemical prerequisite of the unique skeletal rearrangement, which provides a vantage point for understanding how (&#8211;)&#8208;hunterine A is likely to be generated in nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Site Engineering of a Glycerol Dehydrogenase Improves its Oxidative Activity and Scope Toward Glycerol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselective oxidation of glyceryl alkyl ethers is of utmost importance for the fabrication of substituted hydroxy ketones and enantiopure 1,2&#8208;diols as green solvents and pharmaceutical building blocks, respectively. An engineered glycerol dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus was described to perform the regioselective oxidation of alkyl glycerol ethers, identifying position 252 as key for accepting larger substrates than glycerol. In this work, we further engineer that position through partial saturation mutagenesis to broaden the substrate scope toward other glycerol derivatives, improving enzyme kinetics and minimizing product inhibition. In particular, the BsGlyDH&#8208;L252S variant becomes the most efficient biocatalyst for the deracemization of alkyl glyceryl ethers in a two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot system. The discovery and use of these alternative mutants of GlyDH opens the road to more applications and increases the enzymatic toolbox for the modifications of glyceryl ethers.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water Channel&#8208;like Structure Self&#8208;Assembled by Nucleosides</title>

1D water channels are valued for their selectivity and transport efficiency, but developing such channels from small molecules is challenging due to dipolar water tuning difficulty. This study explored C8 modifications of 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2FA), leading to a derivative that forms an S&#8208;shaped tetramer channel with water&#8208;wire arrays, providing insights into creating novel nucleoside&#8208;based water channels







Abstract
As artificial water channels have received widespread attention, various types of artificial water channels have been reported. However, apart from I&#8208;quartet channels, the development of 1D water channels with water wires constructed from small molecules has rarely been reported, because of the difficulty in precisely tuning the dipolar water molecules. Inspired by G&#8208;quartet functionalization strategies, this study explored C8 modifications of our previously reported molecule, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2FA), known for its strong hydration properties and self&#8208;assembly capabilities, and investigated its potential for constructing nucleoside&#8208;based water channel&#8208;like structures. Among all derivatives, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;D&#8208;adenosine can form an S&#8208;shaped channel as a tetramer, incorporating water wire arrays in the solid state. Such water channel&#8208;like structures in nucleoside self&#8208;assemblies provide new insights into the development of novel nucleoside&#8208;based supramolecular water channel materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mushroom is a rich source of enzymes and therefore is a promising biocatalyst for organic synthesis. This review highlights key advances in mushroom&#8208;mediated redox reactions using whole cells, purified enzymes or recombinant enzymes, including the reduction of carbonyl compounds and carboxylic acids, oxidation of C&#8722;H bonds, epoxidation of olefins and oxidative cleavage of alkenes.







Abstract
The application of biocatalysts in organic synthesis has grown significantly in recent years, and both academia and industry are continuously searching for novel biocatalysts capable of performing challenging chemical reactions. Mushrooms are a rich source of ligninolytic and secondary metabolite biosynthetic enzymes, and therefore were considered promising biocatalysts for organic synthesis. This review focuses on the broad utilization potential of mushroom&#8208;based biocatalysts and highlights key advances in mushroom&#8208;mediated redox reactions. It mainly includes the reduction of ketones and carboxylic acids, hydroxylation of aromatic and aliphatic compounds, epoxidation of olefins, oxidative cleavage of alkenes, and other uncommon reactions catalyzed by the whole cells or purified enzymes of mushroom origin. Overall, a comprehensive overview of the applications of mushrooms as biocatalysts in organic synthesis is provided, which puts this versatile microorganism in the spotlight of further research.

         <title>Emission&#8208;Tunable B&#8592;N Lewis Pair&#8208;Functionalized Naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three structurally distinct double B&#8592;N Lewis pair&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes were synthesized via a one&#8208;pot method that involved sequential electrophilic borylation and in situ functionalization. The borylation position and substituents on the boron atoms significantly affect the structure and optoelectronic properties, enabling tunable fluorescence from cyan to red (509&#8211;620&#8197;nm) and reducing the LUMO energy level to &#8722;3.12&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Herein, we simultaneously synthesized three different double B&#8592;N Lewis pair&#8208;functionalized naphthalenes including the asymmetric BNNY and BNNO and the mirror&#8208;symmetric BNNR, via a one&#8208;pot method. The annulation modes of the B&#8592;N Lewis pairs and the substituents on the boron atoms efficiently tune the molecular frontier orbitals and emission colors. &#945;&#8208;Position fusion leads to a significant enhancement of the HOMO energy level and a decrease in the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, while the electron&#8208;withdrawing groups attached to the boron atom make the LUMO energy level more stable. In particular, the LUMO energy level of BNNO is as low as &#8722;3.12&#8197;eV. BNNY, BNNO, and BNNR emit cyan, green, and red fluorescence at 509, 534, and 620&#8197;nm, respectively, with fluorescence quantum yields of 24&#8201;%, 49&#8201;%, and 30&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Catalytic Activity of Cellulose&#8208;Supported Platinum and Palladium Nanoparticles for Allylbenzene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum or palladium nanoparticles were immobilized on cellulose using a colloidal deposition method and their catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of allylbenzene was investigated. Compared to the commercial catalyst, the activities are higher, while the stability of the catalysts immobilized on cellulose was better for the platinum nanoparticles.







Abstract
Platinum and palladium nanoparticles were successfully deposited on tunicate cellulose via the photodeposition or microemulsion deposition method. Evenly distributed, small and narrow&#8208;sized particles in the range of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm were obtained for microemulsion&#8208;prepared cellulose catalysts. The photodeposition method led to larger particle sizes, broader size distribution, and occasional agglomerations. The catalysts were tested in the allylbenzene hydrogenation reaction at room temperature and the results were compared to commercially available catalysts. Because of smaller particles, both microemulsion&#8208;prepared catalysts and photodeposited ones show better activity than commercial catalysts. Even platinum and palladium nanoparticles were active for the hydrogenation, only cellulose&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles showed good stability. For palladium nanoparticles, stronger leaching from the surface of cellulose was observed. Cellulose&#8208;supported catalysts were recycled, and reusability is comparable to commercial catalysts. Therefore, cellulose could be used as an alternative catalyst support.

A sustainable Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed dual C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H annulation of 2&#8208;aryl imidazopyridines with N&#8208;substituted maleimides has established. The synthesized molecule displayed AEE and solvatochromic behavior and can also be utilized as a cellular imaging and picric acid sensing probe.







Abstract
A cobalt(III)&#8208;catalyzed dual C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp2)&#8722;H activation of 2&#8208;arylimidazopyridines and its annulation with N&#8208;substituted maleimides leads to polycyclic aromatic heterocycles. This sustainable oxidative annulation uses earth&#8208;abundant, less toxic, and cost&#8208;effective cobalt(III) catalyst that complement expensive 2nd and 3rd&#8208;row metals. This oxidative annulation features a broad substrate scope with very good functional group tolerance. These maleimide&#8208;fused imidazopyridines display strong fluorescence in the region of 527&#8722; 536&#8197;nm with a Stokes shift of 83&#8722;87&#8197;nm and possess an excited state lifetime of 14.6&#8722;16.1 ns. Interestingly, such luminescent compounds show aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission (AEE) behavior in the iPr&#8208;OH/hexane mixed solvent system. Furthermore, field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM) reveals their spherical nano&#8208;aggregates with an average diameter of ~216.8&#8197;nm. They can also be used as cellular&#8208;imaging and picric acid&#8208;sensing probes.

         <title>Tandem Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ Products Based on M&#8208;SACs/Cu Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem strategy demonstrates efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to produce C2+ products. M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem electrocatalysts have garnered significant interest owing to the high activity and selectivity of single atoms, along with their high conversion rates of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review focusing on the structure&#8208;activity relationship and design principle of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts in ECO2RR.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) is considered a highly promising method to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels, contributing significantly the artificial carbon balance. Plenty catalysts can facilitate the conversion of CO2 into mono&#8208;carbon (C1) products. Among these catalysts, Cu species exhibit a distinct role in the formation of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products characterized by enhanced energy density. However, the limited selectivity of C2+ products, along with the inferior stability, and high overpotential demonstrated by single&#8208;component Cu catalysts, hinders their applicability in industrial&#8208;scale production. The implementation of a tandem strategy, which involves coupling the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO pathway using Ag, Au, metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8208;SACs), etc., with the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion on Cu, represents a novel approach for the efficient generation of C2+ products. Given the high cost and restricted availability of noble metals, M&#8208;SACs have attracted substantial interest in tandem systems due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and efficient atom utilization. The systematic analysis of the design principles and structure&#8208;activity relationship is essential for the advancement of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts. Here we first introduce various prevalent design strategies of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts for ECO2RR and then systematically summarize the latest advancements of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem system, encompassing metal&#8208;organic frameworks/Cu (MOFs/Cu), covalent organic frameworks/Cu (COFs/Cu), and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support transition metal single atomic materials/Cu (M&#8722;N&#8722;C/Cu). Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities with the design and construction of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysis for ECO2RR.

         <title>Ordered Assembly of Natural Phenolic Building Blocks for Supramolecular Crystalline Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article provides a concise overview of recent advancements in crystalline materials constructed from natural phenolic building blocks. The discussion covers typical ordered assemblies such as frameworks and mesocrystals, highlighting their respective chemical mechanisms. Finally, the Concept outlines persistent challenges in this field and suggests potential directions for future development.







Abstract
Biomacromolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipids in nature are constructed by &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; assembly with diverse functions and structural ordered characteristics. Supramolecular assemblies have been employed to mimic the natural complexity by manipulating the subtle variations of functional groups. Nevertheless, the intricate design of the driving forces or sophisticated synthesis of molecular skeletons poses challenges in fabricating highly ordered assemblies. Natural phenolic molecules with anisotropic functional groups exhibit potential as versatile building blocks for a wide range of supramolecular crystalline materials with tailored assembly and controlled functionalities. The inherent and anisotropic phenolic groups engage in ordered assembly with various materials via directional covalent bonds (e.&#8201;g., condensation and coordination) as well as multiple molecular interactions (e.&#8201;g., hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions), leading to the formation of supramolecular crystalline materials with diverse functionalities. This Concept presents the assembly mechanisms of crystalline phenolic materials and their applications, showcasing the effective utilization of ordered assembly by natural phenolic building blocks.

         <title>Synthesis of Thiazolidinedione&#8208; and Triazole&#8208;Linked Organoselenocyanates and Evaluation of Anticancer Activities Against Breast Cancer with Mechanistic Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thiazolidinedione&#8208; and triazole&#8208;linked organoselenocyanates were rationally designed and synthesized as potential anticancer agents for the treatment of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer. The preliminary studies identified the unsubstituted benzylic analogue of thiazolidinedione&#8208;based organoselenocyanate 15&#8201;a as the lead compound. The compound exhibited the anticancer activity by arresting cells in G1&#8208;phase of the cell cycle with the downregulation of CDK4 and Cyclin D1 and via ERK/Akt signaling pathway.







Abstract
Organoselenocyanates are important classes of organoselenium compounds having potential pharmaceutical applications in cancer biology. In the present study, two different series of organoselenocyanates (15&#8201;a&#8211;15&#8201;c and 16&#8201;a&#8211;16&#8201;c) incorporating crucial heterocyclic pharmacophores such as 2,4&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione and 1,2,3&#8208;triazole were rationally designed. The organoselenocyanates were synthesized using multi&#8208;step organic synthesis and investigated for their anticancer activities against triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells. Based on the preliminary anti&#8208;proliferative activities and the selectivity index towards cancer cells over the normal cells, 2,4&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione&#8208;based selenocyanate 15&#8201;a was identified as the lead analogue for detailed investigations. In addition to the anti&#8208;migratory activity, compound 15&#8201;a induced G1&#8208;phase arrest of the cell cycle and led to early apoptosis. Further studies on the redox balance of MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells indicated the antioxidant nature of 15&#8201;a with the quenching of ROS level and upregulation of TrxR1 expression. Detailed mechanistic investigations with the expression levels of key&#8208;cancer marker proteins revealed that the selenocyanate 15&#8201;a induced the activation of ERK pathway by upregulating p&#8208;ERK expression with the subsequent downregulation of p&#8208;Akt and c&#8208;Myc levels leading to the inhibition of cellular proliferation. Therefore, the primary outcomes of the study would be valuable in the development of chemotherapeutic agents towards the treatment of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.

         <title>Enantiopure Macrocycles Based on Tr&#246;ger&#8216;s Base and Diphenyl Maleimide Exhibiting Strong Chiral Emission and Host&#8208;Guest Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pairs of enantiomeric macrocycles are synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura [2+2] cyclization, using Tr&#246;ger&#8242;s base and diphenyl maleimide as building blocks. These macrocycles display strong fluorescence with near&#8208;unity quantum yields. The chiral Tr&#246;ger&#8242;s base units confer excellent circularly polarized luminescence and well&#8208;defined cavities for efficient guest encapsulation..







Abstract
While a plenty of macrocyclic hosts have been developed in supramolecular chemistry, those that combine chiral luminescent properties and host&#8208;guest recognition abilities are still uncommon. Herein, two pairs of enantiomeric macrocycles were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura [2+2] cyclization reactions using Tr&#246;ger's base and diphenyl maleimide as the building blocks. The diphenyl maleimide units impart these macrocycles with highly strong fluorescence, achieving quantum yields up to 100&#8201;% in apolar solvents. Furthermore, the chiral, V&#8208;shaped Tr&#246;ger's base units provide the macrocycles with circularly polarized luminescence (|glum|=1.68&#215;10&#8722;3) and well&#8208;define cavity for hosting electron&#8208;deficient or positively charged guests with Ka up to 1.7&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1.

         <title>Development of a Synthetic Platform for Ent&#8208;Pimaranes Reveals their Potential as Novel Non&#8208;redox Active Ferroptosis Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a comprehensive account on the evolution of a synthetic platform for a subfamily of ent&#8208;pimaranes. For the most complex member, norflickinflimiod C, five distinct strategies relying on either cationic or radical polyene cyclizations to construct the requisite tricyclic carbon scaffold were explored. Insights from early and late stage oxidative and reductive dearomatization studies ultimately led to a mild, rhodium&#8208;catalyzed arene hydrogenation for the final synthetic route. A Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation was found to be suitable to render the platform enantioselective and diversification of a late&#8208;stage key intermediate culminated in the total synthesis of eight ent&#8208;pimaranes in 11&#8211;16 steps.&#160; These compounds were found to inhibit the formation of pro&#8208;inflammatory leukotrienes and other 5&#8208;lipoxygenase products. Notably, three ent&#8208;pimaranes exhibited low micromolar, non&#8208;redox active ferroptosis inhibition with remarkable structural specificity.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures, Chiroptical Properties, and Unexpectedly Facile Helical Inversion of Highly Elongated Anthracene&#8208;Fused Expanded Helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical fused anthracenes were elongated by fusing additional aromatic units at both ends to yield novel expanded helicenes. Compounds [5]HA2N and [7]HA consisting of 19 and 21 benzene rings, respectively, were synthesized by fourfold cycloisomerization of the corresponding terminal alkyne precursors.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Helical fused anthracenes were elongated by fusing additional aromatic units at both ends to yield novel expanded helicenes. Compounds [5]HA2N and [7]HA consisting of 19 and 21 benzene rings, respectively, were synthesized by fourfold cycloisomerization of the corresponding terminal alkyne precursors. The helical structures were confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis, where the aromatic frameworks stacked effectively with the helical turn numbers exceeding two.

         <title>The Chemical Recovery of PMMA into Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), commonly known as plexiglass, is widely used in the areas of aircraft, automobile, construction and transplants, due to its high mechanical strength, good corrosion resistance, and excellent compatibility with human tissue. With the increase in production and usage of PMMA, the vast accumulation of PMMA waste has posed a challenge to the recycling of PMMA waste. However, at present, only less than 10% of PMMA is recycled each year. The cost&#8208;effective chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer with high efficiency has attracted wide attention and has become one of the hot research subjects. The chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer are realized mainly via two approaches, including the pyrolysis of common PMMA at high temperature and the depolymerization of end&#8208;functionalized PMMA under mild conditions. The second approach has emerged and achieved significant progresses in the past several years. Herein, we provide a review about the researches of chemical recovery of PMMA into monomer. Firstly, the pyrolysis of general PMMA at high temperature is illustrated by typical research works. Subsequently, the depolymerization of end&#8208;functionalized PMMA under mild conditions is highlighted and discussed, as this approach is more in line with the green and sustainable development of polymer chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Insights on Gas Trapping of Noble Gases in MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Type Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks, MFU&#8208;4 and MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br, with anionic side ligands (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;), were synthesized for noble gas storage. Selecting the side ligand type fine&#8208;tuned the pore aperture size, effectively controlling gas entry and release. Experiments with krypton and xenon were complemented by computational modeling.







Abstract
Isostructural metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely MFU&#8208;4 and MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br, in which the pore apertures are defined by anionic side ligands (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;, respectively), were synthesized and loaded with noble gases. By selecting the type of side ligand, one can fine&#8208;tune the pore aperture size, allowing for precise regulation of the entry and release of gas guests. In this study, we conducted experiments to examine gas loading and release using krypton and xenon as model gases, and we complemented our findings with computational modeling. Remarkably, the loaded gas guests remained trapped inside the pores even after being exposed to air under ambient conditions for extended periods, in some cases for up to several weeks. Therefore, we focused on determining the energy barrier preventing gas release using both theoretical and experimental methods. The results were compared in relation to the types of hosts and guests, providing valuable insights into the gas trapping process in MOFs, as well as programmed gas release in air under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the crystal structure of MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br was elucidated using the three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3DED) technique, and the bulk purity of the sample was subsequently verified through Rietveld refinement.

         <title>Double Strain&#8208;Release (3+3)&#8208;Cycloaddition: Lewis Acid Catalyzed Reaction of Bicyclobutane Carboxylates and Aziridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a Sc(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition of highly strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butane carboxylates with protected aziridines. In this transformation, highly functionalized 2&#8208;azabiyclo[3.1.1]heptanes are accessed in single step under mild conditions. This is an example of strain&#8208;release driven transformation, where two highly strained rings combine to form bicyclic moieties which can serve as potential bioisosteres.







Abstract
A (3+3)&#8208;cycloaddition to afford 2&#8208;azabiyclo[3.1.1]heptanes was realized by reacting highly strained aryl bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCBs) carboxylates with tosylated aziridines. Under Sc(OTf)3 catalysis the transformation proceeded smoothly under mild conditions to the corresponding bicyclic products bearing at the bridgeheads of the embedded four&#8208;membered ring aryl and ester moieties, respectively. This reaction is a rare example of a cycloaddition of two highly strained ring systems under Lewis acid catalysis. Mechanistic experiments provided insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Scalable Production of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles for Optoelectronics Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scaling&#8208;up process of a continuous injection protocol used to produce tin&#8208;doped indium oxide nanocrystal dispersions is described. Synthesis and processing were controlled with special attention to increasing synthesis yield and controlling product quality.







Abstract
This work describes the scalability process of a continuous&#8208;injection protocol employed to produce tin&#8208;doped indium oxide nanocrystal dispersions. Different levels of manipulation starting from the synthesis and processing also related to the tuning of the optical response (considering the peculiar combination of UV and NIR absorption with visible transparency) make these materials incredibly versatile. But one of the most attractive features concern the modulation of their charge carrier density through chemical or post&#8208;synthetic doping, as for the case of core&#8208;shell materials, expanding the properties of the core composition. In addition, the colloidal nature of such materials allows for easy solution processing which enables an extensive use in different applications within current thin films base technologies. It is therefore important to push forward the lab&#8208;scale synthesis to properly address the commercial fabrication requirements without any loss in quality. Uniformity is crucial for industrial applications, ensuring predictable performance and facilitating the integration of these nanoparticles into optoelectronic devices. The method here developed allowed a transition from mg&#8208;scale to gram&#8208;scale product mass outputs, while retaining stability in terms of particle size distribution, morphology, crystallinity, and optical properties. This research establishes a robust framework for the scalable production of metal oxide nanoparticles with consistent properties, enhancing their viability for widespread use in optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Unraveling the Mechanism of Stereospecific Self&#8208;Promoted N&#8208;Glycosylations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We take a look into the mechanism of glycosylation by an in&#8208;depth analysis of the mechanism of self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;glycosylation. Despite these glycosylation taking place without any additives, a complex mechanistic pathway is revealed through both kinetic experiments, computational studies, and competition experiments.







Abstract
In this study, the mechanism of self&#8208;promoted N&#8208;glycosylations is extensively investigated through kinetic experiments, computational studies, and nucleophilic competition experiments. Based on the findings, the mechanism is proposed to be initiated by proton transfer from the acidic sulfonyl carbamate to the trichloroacetimidate, upon formation of an associated contact ion pair. This ion pair then collapses in an SN1&#8208;like fashion, with formation of an oxocarbeniumion&#8208;like intermediate. According to the proposed mechanism, stereospecificity arises from the associated nature of all intermediates formed throughout the reaction. During the mechanistic study, it was also found that the sulfonyl carbamates have catalytic properties if a competing nucleophile is present.

         <title>Exploring Glycan&#8208;Lectin Interactions in Natural&#8208;Like Environments: A View Using NMR Experiments Inside Cell and on Cell Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NMR methods are applied to uncover molecular recognition events between synthetic glycan molecules and lectin receptors within the cell and on the cell surface. The interaction between 15&#8197;N&#8208;labelled human galectin&#8208;7 with thioglycoside is monitored within living Danio rerio oocytes using HMQC experiments, while the binding epitope of a sialoside ligand to human Siglec&#8208;10, at the surface of HEK293F cells, is unraveled by STD&#8208;NMR.







Abstract
Glycan&#8208;mediated molecular recognition events are essential for life. NMR is widely used to monitor glycan binding to lectins in solution using isolated glycans and lectins. In this context, we herein explore diverse NMR methodologies, from both the receptor and ligand perspectives, to monitor glycan&#8208;lectin interactions under experimental conditions mimicking the native milieu inside cells and on cell surface. For the NMR experiments inside cells, galectin&#8208;7 is employed as model, since most galectins are soluble and carry out their functions in the cellular micro&#8208;environment. Using Danio Rerio oocytes, the 1H&#8208;15N HMQC NMR spectrum of a folded galectin has been observed inside cell for the first time, using a glycomimetic ligand (TDG) to overcoming the natural tendency of galectins to bind to numerous galactose&#8208;containing receptors within cells. Alternatively, most lectins, other than galectins, are displayed on the cell surface, providing a multivalent presentation to bind their glycan partners in cis (at the same cell) or in trans (on other cells). In this case, ligand&#8208;based STD&#8208;NMR experiments have been successfully applied to account for the interactions of natural glycans and glycomimetics with Siglec&#8208;10. These methodologies provide the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to open the door to the NMR analysis of the recognition of glycans in native&#8208;like settings.

         <title>Role of Secondary Structure and Time&#8208;Dependent Binding on Disruption of Phthalocyanine Aggregates by Guanine&#8208;Rich Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding of guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acids to a water&#8208;soluble cationic, regiopure zinc phthalocyanine (1) is reported. In contrast to double&#8208;stranded DNA, guanine systems GpG, (GpG)10, poly(G) and quadruplex DNA effectively disrupt phthalocyanine aggregates to disperse the monomeric state. Time&#8208;dependent binding is observed for all systems, especially poly(G). Such biomacromolecule interactions are expected to be important when rationalizing the photoactivity of phthalocyanines in&#8208;vivo.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines are versatile photodynamic therapy agents whose biological activity depends on their aggregation state, which is expected to be influenced by binding to biomolecules. Here, guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acid binding of a water&#8208;soluble cationic, regiopure C4h zinc phthalocyanine bearing four triethylene glycol methyl ether and four N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridinium substituents (1) is reported. In contrast to double&#8208;stranded DNA, guanine systems GpG, (GG)10, poly(G) and quadruplex DNA are shown to effectively disrupt phthalocyanine aggregates in buffered solution. This process is accompanied by evolution of the Q&#8208;band absorbance and enhanced emission. Increasing the sequence length from GpG to (GG)10 increases the binding and confirms the importance of multiple binding interactions. Enhanced binding in the presence of KCl suggests the importance of nucleobase hydrogen&#8208;bonded mosaics in phthalocyanine binding. Notably, the (GT)10 sequence is even more effective than quadruplex and pure guanine systems at disrupting the aggregates of 1. Significant time&#8208;dependent binding of 1 with poly(G) reveals biexponential binding over minutes and hours, which is linked to local conformations of poly(G) that accommodate monomers of 1 over time. The study highlights the ability of biomacromolecules to disrupt phthalocyanines aggregates over time, which is an important consideration when rationalizing photoactivity of photosensitizers in&#8208;vivo.

         <title>Synthesis of an Unsymmetrical Dialumane and Kinetic Analysis of its Alkene Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unsymmetrical dialumane was synthesized by the reaction of a nucleophilic alumanyl anion with a bromoalumane and structurally characterized to show the existence of the Et2O&#8208;coordination to the Al atom. Its reactivity toward ethylene and styrene into the Al&#8722;Al bond was examined, and the resulting insertion products underwent subsequent reactions. The reaction of the dialumane with styrene was decelerated by the presence of additional Et2O, suggesting that an Et2O dissociation occurred before the alkene insertion, which can be distinguished from an associative mechanism involving a five&#8208;coordinated Al intermediate.

         <title>Aqueous Dispersion of Xenes by Liquid Phase Exfoliation of Monoelemental Crystals in Melamine Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismouth, silicon, tellurium and tin powders are effectively exfoliated in water solution of melamine affording 2D nanostructures. These characteristic 2D Xenes are dispersed in water forming stable colloidal solutions.







Abstract
&#913;fter the impressive evolution of graphene and its derivatives, a large number of two dimensional (2D) materials with important optical and electrical properties have been successfully fabricated. Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of layered and non&#8208;layered materials has become a widely applied method for the preparation of 2D nanostructures with an extensive variety of applications. However, in most cases organic solvents are used as liquid phase which are often toxic and environmentally unfriendly and lead to low yields. In this work, we present water as a suitable liquid phase and dispersion medium for the exfoliation of layered and non&#8208;layered monoelemental solids from IVA, VA and VIA groups of the periodic table, such as silicon, tin, bismuth and tellurium. The 2D nanostructures, silicene, stanene, bismuthene and tellurene are therefore prepared by a completely sustainable and environmentally friendly method. The prepared Xenes, as they are called, are fully characterized by microscopic and spectroscopic techniques.

         <title>Switch of Five Contiguous Chiral Centers in the Synthesis of Both Enantiomers of Hajos&#8211;Parrish Ketone Analogs via Diphenylprolinol Silyl Ether&#8208;Mediated Domino Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five continuous chiral centers were switched with excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity, which is a very rare enantiodivergent reaction. Both enantiomers of the functionalized Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone analogs were synthesized in the domino reaction using the same chiral organocatalyst under two slightly different conditions. Mechanism of the enantiodivergency was clarified.







Abstract
Both enantiomers of functionalized Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone (HPK) analogs were prepared with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities using the same chiral catalyst under two slightly different conditions. In condition A, dioxane was used as the solvent with 3 equivalents of water. In condition B, acetonitrile was used as the solvent with 30 equivalents of water, followed by epimerization with a base in a one&#8208;pot. The reaction consisted of a domino reaction including a diphenylprolinol silyl ether&#8211;mediated asymmetric Michael reaction and an intramolecular Henry reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Five continuous chiral centers were switched with excellent diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity, which is a very rare enantiodivergent reaction. Both enantiomers of the functionalized Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone analogs were synthesized in the domino reaction using the same chiral organocatalyst under two slightly different conditions. Mechanism of the enantiodivergency was clarified.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both enantiomers of functionalized Hajos&#8211;Parrish ketone (HPK) analogs were prepared with excellent diastereoselectivities and enantioselectivities using the same chiral catalyst under two slightly different conditions. In condition A, dioxane was used as the solvent with 3 equivalents of water. In condition B, acetonitrile was used as the solvent with 30 equivalents of water, followed by epimerization with a base in a one-pot. The reaction consisted of a domino reaction including a diphenylprolinol silyl ether&#8211;mediated asymmetric Michael reaction and an intramolecular Henry reaction. In the Michael reaction, depending on the solvent and water amounts, &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-isomers were selectively synthesized with excellent enantioselectivity, in which the absolute configuration at C5 (indanone numbering) was opposite. The subsequent Henry reaction was diastereoselective, in which the C5 substituent controlled the three chiral centers in a highly diastereoselective manner. The final base treatment in condition B caused epimerization, changing the configuration at C6. Switching more than two chiral centers with high enantioselectivity is extremely difficult using the same chiral catalyst; the present reaction is a very rare enantiodivergent reaction that switches five continuous chiral centers with high enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A highly diastereo&#8208; and enatioselective Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed synthesis of densely substituted spiroisoindolinones from enamides and 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoindolinones is described. This method enables the synthesis of spiroisoindolinones with three contiguous stereogenic centers in high yields (up to 97&#8201;%) diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;2&#8201;:&#8201;0&#8201;:&#8201;0&#8197;dr) and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;2 e.r.) under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A highly stereoselective Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid catalyzed synthesis of densely substituted spiroisoindolinones from enamides and 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;isoindolinones is described. With simple Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acids, such as para&#8208;toluene sulfonic acid, spiroisoindolinones with three contiguous stereogenic centers are formed in high yields (up to 97&#8201;%) and diastereoselectivities (up to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;2&#8201;:&#8201;0&#8201;:&#8201;0&#8197;dr) under mild reaction conditions. With the use of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst, a diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of the corresponding spiroisoindolinones was achieved. Mechanistic investigations indicate a step&#8208;wise mechanism via an initial addition of the enamide to an electrophilic N&#8208;acylimine species followed by an intramolecular aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. Addition of a strong Lewis acid can be used to facilitate the second step for less reactive substrates.

         <title>Harnessing Cyanine&#8208;like Properties to Develop Bright Fluorogenic Probes Based on Viscosity&#8208;Sensitive Molecular Rotors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Playing on the electron&#8208;donor strength increases the absorptivity of hemicyanines, reaching cyanine&#8208;like photophysical properties. The resulting bright fluorescent molecular rotor can be used to develop fluorogenic probes for bioimaging. In particular, HaloTag fluorogens with increased brightness thanks to the improved absorption are obtained to label membrane proteins with high contrast in wash&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Dipolar fluorescent molecular rotors (FMRs) are environmentally&#8208;sensitive fluorophores that can be used in bioimaging applications to sense local viscosity and polarity. Their sensitivity to viscosity can also be used for the fluorogenic labeling of biomolecules such as DNA or proteins. In particular, we have previously used FMRs to develop a series of tunable fluorogens targeting the self&#8208;labeling protein tag Halotag for wash&#8208;free protein imaging in live cells. Despite these very useful properties, FMRs typically display moderate molar absorption coefficients that limits their overall fluorescence brightness. Herein, we synthesized a series of three model hemicyanines based on a styrylindolenium scaffold and performed a detailed study of their photophysical properties in solvents with various polarity and viscosity. We show that with a strong julolidine electron&#8208;donating group it is possible to combine intense cyanine&#8208;like absorption with the high sensitivity to viscosity of FMRs. We use this property to develop a lysosomal pH sensor and two bright cell&#8208;impermeant fluorogens targeting HaloTag for imaging membrane proteins. We believe that this bright fluorogenic scaffold based on a simple chemical structure can be used in the future to build up a variety of probes and sensors with efficient photophysical properties.

         <title>Influence of Ionic Liquid Film Thickness and Flow Rate on Macrocyclization Efficiency and Selectivity in Supported Ionic Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic setup consisting of a supported ionic liquid film situated on the inner surface of a mesoporous material and an organic transport phase, creates a liquid confinement that offers control over the spatial restraints in which a catalytic reaction occurs. Atomistic simulations are conducted and correlated with experimental observations to elucidate the molecular processes at the liquid&#8208;liquid interphase.







Abstract
Supported ionic&#8208;liquid phase (SILP) technology in a biphasic setting with n&#8208;heptane as the transport phase was applied to the Ru&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed macrocyclization of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;dienes to elucidate the effect of ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;film thickness, flow rate as well as substrate and product concentration on macrocyclization efficiency, and Z&#8208;selectivity. To understand the molecular&#8208;level behavior of the substrates and products at the n&#8208;heptane/IL interphase, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were conducted and correlated with experimental observations. The thickness of the IL layer strongly influences the Z/E ratio of the products in that a thin IL layer favors higher Z/E ratios by confining the catalyst between the pore wall and the liquid&#8208;liquid interphase whereas a thick IL layer favors formation of the E&#8208;product and Ru&#8208;hydride catalyzed isomerization reactions. Also, macrocyclization efficiency, expressed by the ratio of oligomers/macromonocycle (O/MMC), is influenced both by the flow rate and the thickness of the IL layer.

         <title>Carbon Monoxide and Alkoxycarbonyl Radical Enabled Migration Strategy for the Carbonylative Functionalization of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acylation&#8208;esterification type double functionalization of unactivated alkenes using alkyloxalkyl chlorides and CO as the reagents has been developed. The reaction proceeds through by the relay of carbon monoxide through the non&#8208;classical intramolecular functional group migration skeleton.







Abstract
Herein we report a &#8220;carbonylative migration&#8221; strategy for the acylation&#8208;esterification type double functionalization of unactivated alkenes using alkyloxalkyl chlorides and CO as the reagents. The transformation is proceeded by the alkoxycarbonyl radical addition to unactivated alkenes, followed by the insertion of carbon monoxide to induce intramolecular migration of heteroaryl groups, which is different from the traditional reaction modes. The reaction conditions were mild and well tolerated with varieties of functional groups. A variety of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with different ester groups were produced easily which has high potential applications in biology, medicine, and other fields.

         <title>New Concept on the Generation and Regulation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted tremendous attention because of its significant application prospect across multiple fields of three&#8208;dimensional display, data storage, and information encryption. Chirality and luminescence are two necessary prerequisites for the generation of CPL. However, controlling these two factors simultaneously in a rational manner remains a challenge. Herein, we highlight the recent advances in&#160;the rational generation and regulation of CPL through the new concept, named matching rules, mainly including fluorescence&#8208;selective absorption, circularly polarized fluorescence energy transfer, and chiral communication between excited state and ground state. An important commonality among these strategies is that they need a good overlap of the corresponding spectra between the luminescent part (fluorescence, phosphorescence, or CPL) and the chiral part (organic, inorganic, or organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials), which can be contactless and separate. Different from most previous studies, no covalent or noncovalent interactions between the two parts are required, which makes them more facile and convenient. Finally, we summarize the main advantages of these strategies and the current challenges. We expect this concept to offer insightful and novel understanding and inspiration on CPL generation and regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Designs and Applications of Tetraphenylethylene Macrocycles and Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles and cages are very attractive for the development of functional materials due to their unique inner cavities. Building blocks with interesting functions and synthetic conveniences are especially attractive. Tetraphenylethylene (TPE) is such an entity with C2 symmetry and tetrakis&#8208;functional groups easily modifiable. As a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active compound, TPE perfectly unites the functions of fluorescence and structural building blocks together. The unique marriage of the two roles into one component makes TPE an ideal platform for the development of functional molecular systems including macrocycles and cages. The TPE macrocycles and cages are not merely a simple combination of those two but also generate added values unseen in either component alone. The fluorescence properties of TPE in macrocycles/cages are greatly improved or modulated, which makes them more suitable for various applications compared to their linear counterparts. In this review, the chemistry and design principles of TPE macrocycles/cages are surveyed first. The unique properties of those compounds are also discussed to provide general guidance for their functionalization. A brief discussion of their applications focusing on the utilization of their unique fluorescence is also presented. In the last, outlooks and future perspectives of TPE macrocycles/cages are provided for further developments.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Incorporation of Fluorinated Prolines into Proteins and their Impact on Neighbouring Residues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of fluorinated amino acids into proteins provides new opportunities to study biomolecular structure&#8208;function relationships in an elegant manner. The available strategies to incorporate the majority of fluorinated amino acids are not site&#8208;specific or imply important structural modifications. Here, we present a chemical biology approach for the site&#8208;specific incorporation of three commercially available C&#947;&#8208;modified fluoroprolines that has been validated using a non&#8208;pathogenic version of huntingtin exon&#8208;1 (HttExon&#8208;1). 19F, 1H and 15N NMR chemical shifts measured for multiple variants of HttExon&#8208;1 indicated that the trans/cis ratio was strongly dependent on the fluoroproline variant and the sequence context. By isotopically labelling the rest of the protein, we have shown that the extent of spectroscopic perturbations to the neighbouring residues depends on the number of fluorine atoms and the stereochemistry at C&#947;, as well as the isomeric form of the fluoroproline. We have rationalized these observations by means of extensive molecular dynamics simulations, indicating that the observed atomic chemical shift perturbations correlate with the distance to fluorine atoms and that the effect remains very local. These results validate the site&#8208;specific incorporation of fluoroprolines as an excellent strategy to monitor intra&#8208; and intermolecular interactions in disordered proline&#8208;rich proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>A Pair of Dinuclear Fe(II) Enantiomers: Syntheses and Structures of &#923;&#916;/&#916;&#923;&#8208;Bis(Dihydridoborate) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In our effort to establish a direct synthetic approach for bis(dihydridoborate) complexes of first&#8208;row transition metals, we have investigated the reactivity of [Cp*Fe(dppe)Cl] (dppe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) with Na[BH3L] (L = 2&#8208;mercaptopyridine (mp) and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzothiazole (mbz)) that led to the formation of iron(II) dihydridoborate complexes, [Cp*Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(L))}] 1a&#8208;b (L = mp (1a) and L = mbz (1b)). Further, in an attempt to isolate the bis(dihydridoborate) complex of iron by the insertion of borane into the &#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;chelated iron complex, [(dppe)Fe{&#954;2&#8208;N,S&#8208;(mp)}2] (2), we have isolated and structurally characterized a rare example of dimeric iron bis(dihydridoborate) complex, [Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(mp))}2]2, &#923;&#916;/&#916;&#923;&#8208;3 as pair of enantiomers. Interestingly, these enantiomers &#923;&#916;/&#916;&#923;&#8208;3 have two trans&#8208;[Fe{&#954;3&#8208;S,H,H&#8208;(H2BH(mp))}2] moieties bridged through sulfur atoms of 2&#8208;mercaptopyridinyl ligands, where the iron centres are hepta&#8208;coordinated. The natural bond&#8208;orbital (NBO) analyses of &#923;&#916;&#8208;3 and &#916;&#923;&#8208;3 show considerable electron donation from the filled &#963;B&#8208;H bonding orbital to vacant&#160;dz2&#160;orbital of iron with a substantial contribution from the hydrogen atoms. The localized orbital bonding analyses (LOBA) method suggests that all the iron centres are in +2 oxidation state.</dc:description>

[1+1] near&#8208;planar bimolecular supramolecular macrocycles in compounds 4 and 5 were formed by multiple groups of effective intramolecular three&#8208;center hydrogen bonding and strong I&#183;&#183;&#183;N and I&#183;&#183;&#183;&#8315;O&#8211;N&#8314; halogen bonds.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive study on the physicochemical properties of gem&#8208;fluorinated O&#8208;heterocyclic substituents is reported. Systematic additive effects of introducing O&#8208; and gem&#8208;CF2 group introduction on acidic properties (pKa) of the corresponding carboxylic acids / protonated primary amines was demonstrated. The impact of the O/CF2 moieties on lipophilicity (LogP) were found to be complex; significant mutual influence of the corresponding polar moieties governed the compound&#8217;s overall properties in this case. Biological evaluation of MAPK kinase inhibitors incorporating the title substituents demonstrated their utility as promising fragments for bioisosteric replacements in drug discovery campaigns.</dc:description>

         <title>Silicon&#8208;based Linkers for Tunable Acid&#8208;Sensitive Drug Release from Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) may benefit from a carrier to improve their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Core&#8208;crosslinked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) are carriers for hydrophobic small molecule APIs. In CCPMs, APIs are generally covalently coupled to the core of the micelles by use of a linker, which can be tailored to adjust the release rate of the API. Acid triggered release is promising because of local acidic environment in the tissue of interest, and expected uptake via endocytosis. In the present study, silyl&#8208;based linkers were synthesized, and attached to gemcitabine as model API to investigate the tunability of release by introduction of different substituents. Attachment was achieved via an Si ether bond, with the linker coupled to the primary alcohol functionality on gemcitabine. By varying the substituents on the silyl atom, we could vary the release half&#8208;life (t1/2) of native gemcitabine from &lt;1 hour to &gt;96 hours at pH 5.0 at 37&#176;C, compared to a t1/2 of 24 to &gt;240 hours at pH 7.4 at 37&#176;C, respectively. The steric hinderance caused by substituents contributed to an increase of t1/2 at pH 5.0, as the largest substituents resulted in the slowest release. Extension to other APIs and other carriers is clearly possible.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Novel fused phenazines were synthesized through a combination of gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination and cascade cyclization reactions towards azaacenes. In total, 30 new compounds were synthesized and investigated with respect to their structural and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Synthesis of Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts between potassium dihydrogenpnictogenides and group 13 Lewis acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts between potassium dihydrogenpnictogenides [K(18c6)PnH2] (Pn = P, As) and Trialkylgallanes (GaMe3, GaEt3, GatBu3) as well as BH3 were synthesized. In the course of these investigations, we were able to fully characterize a row of compounds of the type [K(18c6)(thf)0&#8209;2][PnH2(ER3)2] (E = B: R = H; E = Ga: R = Me, Et, tBu). Based on the successful syntheses of these species, we also synthesized several compounds of the composition [K(18c6)(thf)0&#8209;2][Pn(SiMe3)2(ER3)n] (n = 1, 2) starting from [KPn(SiMe3)2] (Pn = P and As) and ER3 (E = B, Al, In: R = Me; E = Ga: R= Me, Et, tBu). All isolated compounds, were examined by NMR spectroscopy, infra&#8208;red spectroscopy and elemental analysis. A selection of the compounds presented were also examined by means of X&#8208;ray structure analysis on the single crystal. The obtained adducts of negatively charged [PnH2]&#8722; and [Pn(SiMe3)2]&#8722; fragments with Lewis acids are a class of compounds that has scarcely been investigated to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitride Zeolites from Ammonothermal Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermal synthesis of oxide zeolites is a commonly used procedure. As exchanging oxide ions by nitride ions is very promising for interesting material properties, we present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of some nitride zeolites using supercritical ammonia. The employed mineralizers have a major influence on the reaction outcome which can be utilized to control the formation of phase&#8208;pure products.







Abstract
Oxide zeolites are synthesized from aqueous solutions in an established way employing hydrothermal synthesis. Transferring this approach to nitride zeolites requires a solvent providing nitrogen for which ammonia has proven to be particularly suitable. We present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of the (oxo)nitridosilicate compounds Ce3[Si6N11], Li2RE4[Si4N8]O3 (RE=La, Ce) and K1.25Ce7.75[Si11N21O2]O0.75. Within this procedure, the usage of supercritical ammonia as a solvent as well as the utilization of the mineralizers NaN3, Li3N and KN3, respectively, allowed the targeted synthesis of large single crystals. Formation of these (oxo)nitridosilicates depends mainly on the employed mineralizer despite their similar degree of condensation. The three compounds were structurally characterized using X&#8208;ray diffraction and their crystal structures contain a wide range of different ring sizes within their tetrahedra networks. The zeolite(&#8208;like) crystal structures are elucidated and compared to known nitridosilicate representatives of the respective structure types. Their elemental composition was investigated using energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) spectroscopy and incorporation of the O rather than N&#8722;H functionality was confirmed by Fourier&#8208;Transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as well as by charge distribution (CHARDI) and bond valence sum (BVS) calculations. The presented examples demonstrate that ammonothermal synthesis provides a one&#8208;step access from elemental starting materials towards nitride zeolites.

         <title>Unraveling Mechanism and Enhancing Selectivity of a RuII&#8208;bis&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;morphocumin Complex with RAFT&#8208;Generated Glycopolymer Exploiting Warburg Effect in Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ruthenium bis&#8208;bipyridyl complex of Morphocumin, a known photoactive lysosome targeting curcumin derivative has been encapsulated with glucose functionalized polymeric nanoparticle to exploit the Warburg effect in cancer. This nanomolar potent metal&#8208;based chemotherapeutic agent can achieve selectivity in pancreatic tumors upon encapsulation. In presence of excess H2O2 it can release Morphocumin in the tumor vicinity.







Abstract
The Warburg effect, which generates increased demand of glucose in cancer cells is a relatively underexplored phenomenon in existing commercial drugs to enhance uptake in cancer cells. Here, we present a chemotherapeutic strategy employing a Ru(II)&#8208;bis&#8208;bipyridyl&#8208;morphocumin complex (2) encapsulated in a self&#8208;assembling glucose&#8208;functionalized copolymer P(G&#8208;EMA&#8208;co&#8208;MMA) (where G=glucose; MMA=methyl methacrylate; EMA=ethyl methacrylate), designed to exploit this effect for enhanced selectivity in cancer treatment. The P(G&#8208;EMA&#8208;co&#8208;MMA) polymer, synthesized via reversible&#8208;addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, has a number average molecular weight (Mn,NMR) of 8000&#8197;g/mol. Complex 2, stable in aqueous media, selectively releases a cytotoxic, lysosome&#8208;targeting compound, morphocumin, in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) prevalent in tumor microenvironments. Additionally, complex 2 promotes ROS accumulation, which may further enhance morphocumin release through a synergistic domino effect. Comparative studies reveal that 2 outperforms its curcumin Ru(II) complex (1) analog in solution stability, organelle specificity, and cellular mechanisms. Both 1 and 2 exhibit phototherapeutic effects under low&#8208;intensity visible light, but their chemotoxicity significantly increases with incubation time in the dark, highlighting the superior chemotherapeutic efficacy of the O,O&#8208;coordinating Ru(II) ternary polypyridyl complexes. Complex 2 induces apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway and shows a 9&#8208;fold increase in selectivity for pancreatic cancer cells (MIA PaCa&#8208;2) over non&#8208;cancerous HEK293 cells when encapsulated in the glucose&#8208;conjugated polymer (DP@2). Glucose deprivation in the culture medium further enhances drug efficacy by an additional 5&#8208;fold.

     alt="Unraveling Mechanism and Enhancing Selectivity of a RuII-bis-bipyridyl-morphocumin Complex with RAFT-Generated Glycopolymer Exploiting Warburg Effect in Cancer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Ruthenium bis-bipyridyl complex of Morphocumin, a known photoactive lysosome targeting curcumin derivative has been encapsulated with glucose functionalized polymeric nanoparticle to exploit the Warburg effect in cancer. This nanomolar potent metal-based chemotherapeutic agent can achieve selectivity in pancreatic tumors upon encapsulation. In presence of excess H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; it can release Morphocumin in the tumor vicinity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Warburg effect, which generates increased demand of glucose in cancer cells is a relatively underexplored phenomenon in existing commercial drugs to enhance uptake in cancer cells. Here, we present a chemotherapeutic strategy employing a Ru(II)-bis-bipyridyl-morphocumin complex (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) encapsulated in a self-assembling glucose-functionalized copolymer P(G-EMA-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-MMA) (where G=glucose; MMA=methyl methacrylate; EMA=ethyl methacrylate), designed to exploit this effect for enhanced selectivity in cancer treatment. The P(G-EMA-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-MMA) polymer, synthesized &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; reversible-addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, has a number average molecular weight (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;n,NMR&lt;/sub&gt;) of 8000&#8197;g/mol. Complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, stable in aqueous media, selectively releases a cytotoxic, lysosome-targeting compound, morphocumin, in the presence of excess hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;), a reactive oxygen species (ROS) prevalent in tumor microenvironments. Additionally, complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; promotes ROS accumulation, which may further enhance morphocumin release through a synergistic domino effect. Comparative studies reveal that &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; outperforms its curcumin Ru(II) complex (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) analog in solution stability, organelle specificity, and cellular mechanisms. Both &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; exhibit phototherapeutic effects under low-intensity visible light, but their chemotoxicity significantly increases with incubation time in the dark, highlighting the superior chemotherapeutic efficacy of the &lt;i&gt;O,O&lt;/i&gt;-coordinating Ru(II) ternary polypyridyl complexes. Complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; induces apoptosis &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the intrinsic pathway and shows a 9-fold increase in selectivity for pancreatic cancer cells (MIA PaCa-2) over non-cancerous HEK293 cells when encapsulated in the glucose-conjugated polymer (&lt;b&gt;DP@2&lt;/b&gt;). Glucose deprivation in the culture medium further enhances drug efficacy by an additional 5-fold. This work underscores the potential of glucose-functionalized polymers and ROS-responsive Ru(II) complexes in targeted cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Partially Sulfated Pillar[5]Arenes: Synthesis and Molecular Recognition Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pillar[5]arene sulfates P5Sn with different numbers of sulfate ionic groups are synthesized and fully characterized by spectroscopic, crystallographic, and computational methods. Isothermal titration calorimetry shows that the binding affinity of P5Sn toward cationic guests increases dramatically as N increases.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of sulfated pillar[5]arene hosts (P5S2&#8208;P5S10) that differ in the number of sulfate substituents. All five P5Sn hosts display high solubility in water (73&#8211;131&#8197;mM) and do not undergo significant self&#8208;association according to 1H NMR dilution experiments. The x&#8208;ray crystal structures of P5S6, P5S6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Me6HDA, P5S8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Me6HDA, and P5S10&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Me6HDA reveal one intracavity molecule of Me6HDA and several external molecules of Me6HDA which form a network of close methonium&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;sulfate interactions. The thermodynamic parameters of complexation between P5Sn and the panel of guests was measured by direct or competitive isothermal titration calorimetry. We find that the binding free energy toward a guest becomes more negative as the number of sulfate substituents increase. Conversely, the binding free energy of a specific sulfated pillar[5]arene toward a homologous series of guests becomes more negative as the number of NMe groups increases. The ability to tune the host&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;guest affinity by changing the number of sulfate substituents will be valuable in supramolecular polymers, separation materials, and latching applications.

         <title>An Organic EnT Photocatalyst 4CzMeBN and the Application in the Synthesis of cis&#8208;Fused Azetidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic EnT photocatalyst 4CzMeBN was developed as an alternative of widely used Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbbpy)PF6. 4CzMeBN was prepared facilely from commercially available 4CzIPN and features high triplet state energy and long lifetime of triplet state. The powerful catalytic performance of 4CzMeBN was demonstrated by the photosynthesis of cis&#8208;fused azetidines.







Abstract
A powerful EnT photocatalyst 4CzMeBN has been developed and utilized in the synthesis of cis&#8208;fused azetidines via dearomative [2+2] cycloaddition under visible light. The photocatalyst 4CzMeBN is a donor&#8208;acceptor cyanoarene and features high triplet state energy and long lifetime of triplet state, which would be an alternative to widely used EnT photocatalyst Ir[dF(CF3)ppy]2(dtbbpy)PF6. The photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition provides a facile method to synthesize valuable dihydroisoquinolone&#8208;fused azetidines with high efficiency.

Unveiling the power of &#960;&#8208;spacer engineering, two novel carbazole&#8208;based bis&#8208;cyanostilbenes featuring phenyl and thiophene reveal distinct photophysical behaviors. The thiophene derivative shifts to far&#8208;red/NIR solid&#8208;state emission (732&#8197;nm), while the phenyl analogue stands out with exceptional quantum yields and strong solid&#8208;state luminescence. Both compounds demonstrate strong AIE, thermal stability, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior, highlighting their potential for next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;emissive optoelectronic materials.







Abstract
In this study, we report the design and synthesis of two novel carbazole&#8208;based bis&#8208;cyanostilbenes incorporating phenyl and thiophene &#960;&#8208;spacer units to investigate their distinct impacts on photophysical properties. Notably, the thiophene&#8208;based derivative exhibits remarkable far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) solid&#8208;state emission, with an emission peak at 732&#8197;nm, which shifts to 750&#8197;nm upon mechanical grinding, demonstrating pronounced mechanochromic fluorescence in the NIR region. Although its quantum yield is moderate, the ability to modulate its emission through mechanical stimuli opens exciting opportunities for stimuli&#8208;responsive NIR applications. Conversely, the phenyl&#8208;based analogue shows excellent solid&#8208;state emission at 596&#8197;nm, achieving significantly higher quantum yields, due to suppressing &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. Both compounds also exhibit strong AIE, with the thiophene system emitting at 730&#8197;nm and the phenyl&#8208;based analogue at 580&#8197;nm in the aggregate state. In addition to their optical properties, both derivatives demonstrate remarkable thermal stability and reversible MFC. These intriguing behaviors highlight the critical role of &#960;&#8208;spacer engineering in fine&#8208;tuning solid&#8208;state emission, enhancing stimuli&#8208;responsive capabilities, and ensuring robust thermal performance. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the design of next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;emissive materials, with promising potential for advancing applications in optoelectronics, bioimaging, and smart sensing technologies.

         <title>Hybrid Strategies for Enhancing the Multifunctionality of Smart Dynamic Molecular Crystal Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic crystals are an emerging class of engineering materials that possess unique ability to convert external energy into mechanical motion. However, the inherent defects of molecular crystals like brittleness, short&#8208;life and fatigue, have significantly impeded their practical applications. Building stimuli&#8208;response composites materials can be regarded as one of the ways to break through the current limitations of molecular crystals.







Abstract
Dynamic molecular crystals are an emerging class of smart engineering materials that possess unique ability to convert external energy into mechanical motion. Moreover, they have being considered as strong candidates for dynamic elements in applications such as flexible electronic devices, artificial muscles, sensors, and soft robots. However, the inherent defects of molecular crystals like brittleness, short&#8208;life and fatigue, have significantly impeded their practical applications. Inspired by the concept of &#8220;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&#8221; in the field of biology, building stimuli&#8208;response composites materials can be regarded as one of the ways to break through the current limitations of dynamic molecular crystals. Moreover, the hybrid materials can exhibit new functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single object. In this review, the focus was placed on the analysis and discussion of various hybrid strategies and options, as well as the functionalities of hybrid dynamic molecular crystal materials and the important practical applications of composite materials, with the introduction of photomechanical molecular crystals and flexible molecular crystals as a starting point. Moreover, the efficiency, limitations, and advantages of different hybrid methods were compared and discussed. Furthermore, the promising perspectives of smart dynamic molecular crystal materials were also discussed and the potential directions for future work were suggested.

However, the inherent defects of molecular crystals like brittleness, short-life and fatigue, have significantly impeded their practical applications. Inspired by the concept of &#8220;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&#8221; in the field of biology, building stimuli-response composites materials can be regarded as one of the ways to break through the current limitations of dynamic molecular crystals. Moreover, the hybrid materials can exhibit new functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single object. In this review, the focus was placed on the analysis and discussion of various hybrid strategies and options, as well as the functionalities of hybrid dynamic molecular crystal materials and the important practical applications of composite materials, with the introduction of photomechanical molecular crystals and flexible molecular crystals as a starting point. Moreover, the efficiency, limitations, and advantages of different hybrid methods were compared and discussed. Furthermore, the promising perspectives of smart dynamic molecular crystal materials were also discussed and the potential directions for future work were suggested.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Critical Evaluation of Childs Method for the NMR Spectroscopic Scaling of Effective Lewis Acidity: Limitations and Resolution of Earlier Discrepancies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper evaluates trans&#8208;crotonaldehyde, Childs Method, as a probe to scale effective Lewis acidity by experimental and computational means. The restriction of the binding equilibrium results in an underestimation of effective Lewis acidity. Solvent effects and potential anisotropy effects cause secondary interaction, which yield misleading conclusions and assumptions.







Abstract
Quantifying Lewis acidity is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of Lewis acids in diverse applications. Next to the widely accepted Gutmann&#8208;Beckett (GB) method, using triethyl phosphine oxide (TEPO) as a probe, the Childs method&#8212;employing trans&#8208;crotonaldehyde (TCA)&#8212;gained attention as an NMR&#8208;based technique for measuring effective Lewis acidity (eLA). Despite its steady use, the robustness of Childs method and its correlation with other measures remain underexplored. Previous comparisons between the GB and Childs scales revealed significant discrepancies, suggesting that hard and soft acid/base (HSAB) characteristics may be operative. In this study, we compare thermodynamic data for TCA binding to 117 Lewis acids (representing global Lewis acidity, gLA) with their corresponding NMR&#8208;induced chemical shifts in TCA. Our findings showcase notable deviations that reinforce key distinctions between eLA and gLA perspectives. Moreover, we identify significant limitations in the Childs method. First, the weak donor strength of TCA limits its applicability to only the strongest Lewis acids. Second, the exposed protons of TCA are prone to secondary interactions, obscuring the measurement of true Lewis acidity. Finally, our analysis reconciles discrepancies, refuting earlier assumptions that these arise from HSAB effects.

         <title>Polysilsesquioxane Open Hollow Spheres for Heavy Metal Ions Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polysilsesquioxane open hollow spheres are fabricated through a step&#8208;growth formation process assisted by polystyrene microsphere templates. The openness of the hollow sphere is significantly influenced by the vortex flow generated by magnetic stirring. The material exhibits remarkable adsorption efficiency for heavy metals, attributed to its unique open hollow structure and the presence of thiol groups on its surface.







Abstract
Hollow microspheres with open windows on the shells have shown significant potential in adsorption, catalysis, and drug delivery fields, owing to their low density, large interior volume, high specific surface area, and abundant availability of adsorption sites. However, creating open hollow spheres with structurally stable and entirely organic&#8208;functionalized surfaces remains a challenge. Herein, we fabricated polysilsesquioxane open hollow spheres using trialkoxysilane containing mercaptopropyl groups under vigorous stirring, employing polystyrene microspheres as a template. Various reaction parameters were explored, revealing stirring speed as the key factor influencing the morphology and openness of the microspheres. By examining the morphology of intermediate products at different reaction times, we proposed a step&#8208;growth mechanism for microsphere formation. The resulting materials exhibited high adsorption capacity and selectivity towards Hg2+ and Pb2+, attributed to the presence of thiol groups and the open&#8208;hollow structure. Our approach provides a robust method for producing open hollow materials with functionalized surfaces, offering potential applications in the adsorption field.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Chloride&#8208;Dependent Uncaging Reaction of Propargyl and Allene&#8208;Protected Substrates by Pd&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the impact of chloride ions, this study highlights the high performance of a Pd(II) complex in the deallenylation uncaging reaction of an allene&#8208;protected fluorophore and a chemotherapeutic drug. The Pd complex demonstrated superior performance in high chloride concentrations, while the novel Alle&#8208;5&#8208;Fluorouracil prodrug was effectively activated at low concentrations of the Pd complex, underscoring its potential for targeted drug activation in cancer therapy.







Abstract
This study investigates the effect of chloride levels on the mode of action of palladium complexes for the activation of propargyl&#8208; and allene&#8208;protected fluorophores and chemotherapeutic drugs through uncaging reactions. Four Pd(II) complexes were synthesized and characterized using various spectroscopic techniques to confirm their structure and electronic properties. Kinetic studies and density functional theory calculations revealed that chloride ions in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) significantly enhance catalytic efficiency, particularly for allenyl&#8208;protected substrates compared to propargylic counterparts. This enhancement is attributed to the neutral charge nature of the Pd complex. The data suggest that neutral complexes are less prone to chloride exchange by water molecules. Additionally, chloride ligands counterbalance the unusually high stability of the key &#963;&#8208;bound &#951;1&#8208;Pd intermediates in the aquo complexes in PB, leading to an overall higher reactivity. These results highlight the impact of fine&#8208;tuning the electronic properties of the metal center through both designed ligands and environmental factors. Bench evaluations and tests with living breast cancer cells demonstrated that a Pd catalyst complex with a bidentate ligand effectively activates the prodrugs propargyl&#8208;5&#8208;fluorouracil (Prop&#8208;5FU) and allene&#8208;5&#8208;Fluorouracil (Alle&#8208;5FU), the latter being a novel prodrug. The Pd catalyst successfully released the active drug, inducing significant cytotoxicity, especially with Alle&#8208;5FU, which operates at lower catalyst concentrations than Pro&#8208;5FU.

         <title>Adsorption and Thermal Evolution of the Carbonyl&#8208;functionalized Ionic Liquid [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im][NTf2] on Pt(111): A Combined IRAS, STM, and DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In solid catalysts with ionic liquid layers (SCILL), ionic liquid (IL) coatings are used to modify noble mtal catalysts. The functionalised IL improves the SCILL by increasing the selectivity, with the functional group playing a crucial role in this process. To understand the mechanisms behind this selectivity control, we performed model studies using surface science techniques under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions.







Abstract
The coating of heterogeneous catalysts with ionic liquids enables precise tuning of catalytic activity and selectivity. Recently, the fundamentals of solid catalysts with ionic liquid layers have been extensively studied. So far, investigations have focused on simple ILs without specialized functional groups. In our current work, we aim to involve functionalized ILs to take advantage of the interactions between these functional groups, the catalyst, and the reactants. In this study, we investigated the interaction, and thermal stability of the carbonyl&#8208;functionalized IL [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im][NTf2] on Pt(111) by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. In addition, we performed density functional theory calculations to support our interpretation. At 200&#8197;K and low coverage, the carbonyl group of the [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im]+ cation is oriented parallel to the Pt(111) surface. With increasing coverage, the alkyl chain detaches from the surface and orients towards the vacuum. The [NTf2]&#8722; anion adsorbs parallel to the surface via the oxygen atoms of the SO2 groups. At higher coverage, at least one of the SO2 groups completely detaches from the surface. Upon heating to 250&#8197;K, we observe decomposition and partial desorption of [5&#8208;oxo&#8208;C6C1Im][NTf2], with further decomposition and desorption occurring between 350 and 400&#8197;K.

         <title>Triskelion&#8208;Shaped Hexabenzocoronenes: Synthesis and Characterization of Tris&#8208;Substituted HBC Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new five step synthetic approach for tris&#8208;iodinated hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs). These molecules serve as precursors for the synthesis of a library of seven triskelion&#8208;shaped HBCs via Sonogashira cross coupling reactions.

Abstract
The synthesis of unprecedented triskelion&#8208;shaped hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes with C3, C3h or D3h symmertry is reported. We present a new, five step synthetic access to tris&#8208;iodinated HBC derivatives carrying different solubilizing moieties (tert&#8208;butyl and mesityl), which serve as suitable building blocks for further functionalization. These molecules can undergo Sonogashira cross coupling reactions to obtain a series of seven ethynyl tris&#8208;substituted HBCs. The coupling partners range from carbon&#8208;based aromatic scaffolds (tBu&#8208;benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene) to ligands for metal complexes (bipyridine, phenanthroline, terpyridine, acetylacetone). The optoelectronic properties were investigated by UV/vis absorption spectroscopy resulting in a significant bathochromic shift of the absorption maximum compared to the iodinated starting material. Semiempirical calculations were used to determine the conformation and symmetry of the compounds.

         <title>Constructing AgO/Ag2O Electrocatalysts with Highly Exposed and Tightly Contacted Active Facets for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the elucidation of their underlying mechanisms are crucial for overcoming the low efficiency of hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water. Utilizing the electrochemical anodic oxidation method, a series of silver&#8208;based electrocatalysts (Ag&#8208;x, where x signifies the applied direct current (DC) voltage, x = 0, 5, 10, 15) were prepared employing metallic silver wire as the anode under DC voltages. The resulting silver&#8208;based electrodes have been oxidized and reconstructed, yielding AgO/Ag2O composite on the surface. Notably, the Ag&#8208;10 electrode exhibited the lowest overpotential (399 mV at 50 mA cm&#8722;2 and 456 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2), along with good stability. The superior OER performance of Ag&#8208;10 is not only attributed to the high exposure and tight interface of the AgO (&#8722;111) and Ag2O (111) crystal phases, as well as the higher prevalence of Ag&#8722;O&#8722;O&#8722;Ag species on its surface, but also its larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). This work provides insight for the synthesis of metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts and understanding the electrocatalytic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Red Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Non&#8208;Aromatic Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving red organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains a significant challenge, especially in a non&#8208;aromatic system. Herein, red RTP with emission at 605 and 645 nm is achieved through inducing and confining carboxyl dimer association (CDA), a unique hydrogen&#8208;bonded coupling red phosphorescence unit, in non&#8208;aromatic carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The CPDs are synthesized via microwave method by using polyacrylic acid (PAA), succinic acid (SA), and traces of phosphoric acid as precursors. Small molecule SA can flexibly enter the polymer cluster of PAA and pair with the isolated carboxyl groups to form CDA. The intrinsic local carbonized structure formed in CPDs can effectively stabilize CDA to achieve red RTP. The red afterglow can last for 1 s to naked eye, and the corresponding lifetimes for emission at 605 and 645 nm were 61 and 45 ms, respectively, after 365 nm excitation off. This work not only reported the non&#8208;aromatic red organic RTP materials for the first time, but also explored CPDs as an effective platform for achieving such non&#8208;aromatic long&#8208;wavelength RTP.</dc:description>

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Tunable Dual Emission Mechanism of the Hybridized Local and Charge Transfer (HLCT) and the Excited State Conjugation Enhancement (ESCE)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular design of dual&#8208;fluorescent probes requires precise adjustment of the energy levels of two excited states and the energy barrier between them. While the hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) state has been recently focused as an important excited state for high emission efficiency with a tunable energy level, a dual emission involving the HLCT state has been only achieved with the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) system. Here, a series of dual&#8208;fluorescent molecules involving an HLCT excited state with the excited&#8208;state conjugation enhancement (ESCE) motif is presented as the first case. The energy level of the HLCT state has been adjusted by changing substituents and solvents, separately from the ESCE energy level. The HLCT&#8208;ESCE molecular design with tunable fluorescence properties proposes a new strategy for the development of advanced fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;stabilized charge transfer: An efficient supramolecular approach toward a heterogeneous organic photocatalyst for aerobic oxidation reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Host&#8208;stabilized charge transfer (HSCT) has been widely utilized in macrocycle&#8208;derived supramolecular assemblies and architectures. However, there has been less research attention focused on the direct fabrication of pure organic photocatalysts using HSCT. Herein, four viologen derivatives (m&#8208;PV2+, m&#8208;BPV2+, d&#8208;PV2+, and d&#8208;BPV2+) with different electron donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structures were synthesized. Their host&#8208;guest complexes with cucurbit[8]uril (Q[8]) in an aqueous solution could be switched using the substituted electron donor moieties, in which the host&#8208;guest complexes of m&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] andd&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] exhibited HSCT interactions. Control experiments revealed that the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex had the strongest ability to sensitize singlet oxygen (1O2). This was ascribed to the increased &#960;&#8208;conjugation of d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8], which led to more effective HSCT upon encapsulation by the Q[8] host. Consequently, the d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] complex could be easily employed as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photooxidation reaction of thioether com&#8208;pounds with high selectivity. In particular, d&#8208;BPV2+@Q[8] was successfully applied to the synthesis of sulfoxide drugs, such as the con&#8208;version of inexpensive Iberverin ($7.0 per gram) to the expensive bioactive inhibitor Iberin ($19500.0 per gram) in high yield (94%).</dc:description>

The high spin state and octahedral coordination of the Fe(III) complex are confirmed by EPR spectra and DFT optimized structure, respectively. The formation constant (&#8208;log K) of Fe(BioL)3 is determined as 45, which is higher than the known, more stable complex [Fe(EDTA)]. The complex Fe(BioL)3 exhibited r1 relaxivity of 3.09 &#177; 0.10 and 1.95 &#177; 0.09 mM&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C and 37 &#176;C, respectively, at 1.41T and pH 7.35 via second&#8208;sphere water interactions as due to the absence of inner water coordination. The interaction of Fe(BioL)3 with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human serum albumin (HSA) displayed enhanced relaxivity of 5.16 &#177; 0.15 and 10.0 &#177; 0.19 mM&#8208;1s&#8208;1, respectively, at 25 &#176;C and pH 7.3 possibly via lengthening of rotational correlational time. The complex Fe(BioL)3 uptake studies with the avidin, a biotin&#8208;binding protein pocket, showed 46 and 37% enhancements of r1 and r2 relaxivities. Complex Fe(BioL)3 showed 80% cell viability of the human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells, and 89% of iron has been uptaken into cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Directly Fused Porphyrin&#8208;Tetracyanopentacenequinone Conjugates: Role of the Cross&#8208;Conjugated, Powerful Electron Acceptor in Promoting Highly Efficient Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetracyanopentacenequinone, a powerful electron acceptor, is fused directly to the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;system to create a new class of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates.&#160; Owing to the direct fusion and electron&#8208;deficient property of tetracyanopentacenequinone, strong intramolecular charge transfer both in the ground and excited states was witnessed.&#160; As a control, porphyrin fused with pentacenequinone was also investigated.&#160; Upon complete spectral and electrochemical characterization, the excited state properties were initially probed by time&#8208;dependent DFT studies, and the occurrence of electron transfer from different excited states was established.&#160; Free&#8208;energy calculations revealed higher exothermic electron transfer (&gt; 600 mV) than the control pentacenequinone&#8208;porphyrin systems.&#160; Pump&#8208;probe studies covering broad spatial and temporal regions revealed efficient excited state charge separation.&#160; This was unlike the control pentacenequinone&#8208;porphyrin system, where slow charge separation was witnessed only in the case of the zinc derivatives but not the free&#8208;base ones. &#160;The lifetimes of the charge&#8208;separated states ranged between 30&#8208;500 ps depending on the solvent and metal ion in the porphyrin cavity.&#160; The significance of cross&#8208;conjugated tetracyanopentacenequinone fused directly to the porphyrin &#960; system in promoting highly exothermic and efficient charge separation, irrespective of its cross conjugation, is borne out from this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Zero&#8208;Dimensional Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystals for the Sensitive Detection of Visible Light and X&#8208;Rays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excellent performance and facile fabrication process of perovskite semiconductor materials make them highly promising candidates in the field of optoelectronic devices. Whether for visible light or X&#8208;rays, detectors with low detection limits can better identify weak light signals, significantly reducing the intensity of the received light source during device operation. In particular, for X&#8208;ray detectors, reducing X&#8208;ray dosage can greatly enhance the safety of X&#8208;ray imaging technology. This work develops detectors with low detection limit based on zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) MA3Bi2I9 single crystals. The anisotropy of MA3Bi2I9 and its influence on the detector's performance were investigated in detail. Detectors perpendicular to the (001) crystal plane have better weak light detection capability and require significantly less light intensity compared to devices parallel to the (001) crystal plane. X&#8208;ray detector with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.68 nGyair s&#8210;1 and sensitivity of 5072 &#956;C Gyair&#8210;1 cm&#8210;2 was obtained. The present study offers comprehensive insights into the operational mechanism of layered perovskites, which can provide valuable guidelines for future designs and fabrications of highly sensitive photo and X&#8208;ray detectors.</dc:description>

         <title>Reusable Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF Catalyst for Dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles Under Milder Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have demonstrated the design and synthesis of a novel Ni&#8208;immobilized MOF as heterogeneous catalyst for the dehydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles. A series of five and six&#8208;member N&#8208;heteroarenes bearing one or more heteroatoms were synthesized in up to 98% yield (&gt; 33 examples). Late stage functionalization to the synthesis of b&#8208;glucuronides inhibitor, antimalarial drug quinine, and the nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin were obtained under milder reactions conditions. A series of mechanistic studies revealed the detection of H2 and H2O2 during the progress of the reactions and suggested the involvement of enamine&#8208;imine intermediate species for sequential dehydrogenation. Detailed characterization of the fresh catalyst and reused catalyst were performed using SEM, TEM, BET, PXRD, and EDX elemental mappings. The catalyst could be recycled up to four&#8208;times without much loss in catalytic activities. In&#8208;situ formed defects, pore size enlargement and additional Lewis acid sites within catalyst nanocrystals assisted in attaining high activity and selectivity to N&#8208;heteroarenes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This mini&#8208;review focuses on recent developments in hydroxamate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibit unique structures and properties distinct from those of carboxylate&#8208;based MOFs. Hydroxamates (RCONHO&#8722;), which are bioisosteres of carboxylates (RCOO&#8722;), form MOFs with novel structural motifs and functionalities. In this review, synthetic strategies, structural characteristics, and functional applications of key examples of hydroxamate&#8208;based MOFs are described, providing insights into the influence of the hydroxamate ligand on the MOF properties compared to the carboxylate&#8208;based analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>General Acetal&#8208;Protected Aldehyde Strategy for Facile Synthesis of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Splendid Crystallinity and Uniform Morphology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallinity and morphology are critical factors that closely related to the properties and applications of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). However, the controlled synthesis of COFs with both high crystallinity and uniform morphology remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable polymerization and complex reaction conditions. In this work, we present a general acetal&#8208;protected aldehyde protocol for the facile synthesis of imine&#8208;linked COFs, which enables the simultaneous optimization of crystallinity and morphology. Of the acetal&#8208;protected aldehydes explored, ethanediol&#8208;protected terephthalaldehyde (Tp&#8208;E) emerged as the most effective, balancing stability and reactivity to yield highly crystalline Py&#8208;COF&#8208;E with a well&#8208;defined hollow spherical morphology and a significantly enhanced BET surface area compared to its aldehyde&#8208;based counterpart Py&#8208;COF. This synthetic approach demonstrates broad adaptability across various framework topologies, precursor species, and synthetic solvent systems, simplifying the typically laborious solvent screening process in COF synthesis. Furthermore, Py&#8208;DBT&#8208;COF&#8208;E showed superior photocatalytic H&#8322; evolution performance relative to Py&#8208;DBT&#8208;COF, despite their identical chemical compositions, emphasizing the critical role of crystallinity and morphology in determining functional performance. Overall, this study provides a versatile methodology for the controlled synthesis of COFs and offers valuable insights into the interconnected roles of morphology, crystallinity, and material performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination of phenylsilsesquioxane and acetate ligands as an approach to a record high nuclear Cu13Na2&#8208;cage. Synthesis, unique structure, and catalytic activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly synthesis of mixed&#8208;ligand (silsesquioxane/acetate) complex allows to isolate record high nuclear copper(II) Cu13&#8208;cage (1). In the presence of two additional sodium ions, a unique molecular architecture, with triple combination of ligands (cyclic and acyclic silsesquioxanes as well as acetates), has been formed. The structure was established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction based on the use of synchrotron radiation. Complex 1 was evaluated as precatalyst in the Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone towards &#949;&#8208;caprolactone, employing hydrogen peroxide, tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) or m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) as oxidants, in an aqueous acidic acetonitrile medium. The direct formation of the lactone from cyclohexane via a tandem peroxidative oxidation/Baeyer&#8208;Villiger oxidation was also studied. For both substrates, the best results (&#949;&#8208;caprolactone yields up to 100% or 26%, from cyclohexanone or cyclohexane, respectively) were achieved with mCPBA under considerably mild conditions, i.e., conventional heating at 50 &#176;C for 4 h or microwave (MW) irradiation at 80 &#176;C for only 30 minutes.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Oxygen Vacancy of CuOx&#8208;CeO2 Enhances H2O2 Activation and Pollutant Degradation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the Fenton process, the development of catalysts with a wide pH range and good stability has been a long&#8208;term goal in water treatment technology. This study proposes a strategy to solve this problem by preparing supported catalysts CuOx@CeO2&#8208;IE using an ion exchange reversed loading method. The generation of a large number of interfacial oxygen vacancies with Cu&#8208;OV&#8208;Ce (OV represents an oxygen vacancy site) structures prolongs the O&#8208;O bond of H2O2, promotes the rupture of the peroxide bond of H2O2, and thereby promotes the activation of H2O2 on the surface of the catalyst. The results show that with a H2O2 concentration of 5 mM and CuOx@CeO2&#8208;IE at 50 mg/L, the removal rate of bisphenol A is 94.1% in 60 min, in which &#8226;OH dominates the degradation process. Moreover, the system can operate well within a relatively wide pH range (4&#8208;8). This study provides a novel strategy for the design of Fenton catalysts with a wide pH suitability and excellent stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced ArC(sp3)&#8722;F Bond Activation in Aqueous Media: From DFT Study to Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trifluoromethylarenes (ArCF3) are crucial bioisosteres in medicinal chemistry, but catalyst&#8208;free and controlled photo&#8208;activation of the ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond remains a significant challenge. The photo&#8208;induced defluorination acyl fluoride exchange (photo&#8208;DAFEx) of m&#8208;trifluoromethylaniline, induced by ultraviolet light, emerges as a promising novel photo&#8208;click reaction for photoaffinity drug discovery. However, the photophysical properties of NMe2PhF2C(sp3)&#8722;F derivatives and factors affecting ArC(sp3)&#8722;F bond activation in photo&#8208;DAFEx are not yet fully understood, hindering the development of new photo&#8208;defluorination reagents with longer absorption wavelength for the photo&#8208;DAFEx. Herein, the photophysical properties, the related mechanism and their affecting factors of a series of ArCF3 compounds are systematically studied using (TD)DFT methods. The skeleton of aromatic core is found to be intimately related to the absorption wavelength needed for ArC(sp3)&#8208;F bond activation. A photo&#8208;induced intramolecular single&#8208;electron activation model was proposed to rationalize the photo&#8208;activation of the ArC(sp3)&#8208;F bond. The transfer of excited electron to C(sp3)&#8208;F antibonding orbital determined the activation. Based on the above knowledge, three novel ArCF3 reagents with extended excitation wavelength were designed and predicted, and the absorption spectra and photo&#8208;defluorination reactivity of two of them with visible absorption wavelength were validated experimentally, which provided a theoretical guidance for designing next&#8208;generation photo&#8208;DAFEx.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrocoupling of Ammonia/Amine Boranes and Related Transformations Catalysed by Group 4 Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia boranes and amine boranes are main group analogues of alkanes, which are characterised by their large gravimetric hydrogen content. This hydrogen can be released in dehydrocoupling and dehydropolymerisation reactions to obtain B&#8208;N oligomers and polymers that are of importance as precursors for functional B&#8208;N materials. Furthermore, amine boranes are potent reagents for application in transfer hydrogenation reactions, representing a versatile, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle alternative to the use of gaseous hydrogen for the reduction of organic compounds. Compared to late transition metals,&#160;complexes of readily available and comparatively inexpensive electropositive group 4 metals have been used to a much lesser extent. This review summarises the developments in the field of dehydrocoupling of amine boranes and transfer hydrogenation with these reagents, catalysed by complexes of group 4 metals. We analyse the background for these developments using examples and reaction mechanisms and provide an outlook for future developments in this field of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Higher Assemblies of Coordination Cage&#8208;Catenanes Linked by Copper(II) Chloride Clusters: Networks and Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cage&#8208;catenanes are chemical constructs where two or more cage&#8208;like molecules or assemblies are mechanically interlocked together. We report a new class of cage&#8208;catenanes where dimeric metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;catenanes are linked into larger assemblies through additional bridging metal chloride links. These crystalline materials are obtained from the reaction of tris(nicotinoyl)cyclotriguaiacylene (L1) with Cu(II) salts, and all feature a tetramer of cages where two {Cu3(L1)2(X)6} cages (X = anion) are mechanically interlocked, and link to each other and to another {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}2 cage&#8208;catenane through a planar, linear tetranuclear {Cu4(&#956;&#8722;Cl)6Cl2} cluster. The complex of discrete tetrameric {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}4 assemblies (dimers of cage&#8208;catenanes) transforms through solvent&#8208;exchange processes to 1D coordination chain structures through additional {Cu2(&#956;&#8722;Cl)2} bridges between the tetrameric {Cu3(L1)2(X)6}4 assemblies. Complex [Cu6(L1)4Cl12(H2O)3]&#183;(H2O)&#183;15(DMF) C2 features a 2D coordination network of 63 topology linked through three different Cu(II) clusters, namely {Cu4(&#956;&#8722;Cl)6}, {Cu2(&#956;&#8722;Cl)2} and a rare linear {Cu2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)} linkage. Break&#8208;down of C2 in water likely proceeds through hydrolysis of this unusual linear Cu&#8208;Cl&#8208;Cl bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of supramolecular double helix from a tetrapeptide and direct visualization by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work reports single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and quantum mechanics calculations of the 310&#8208;helical peptide Z&#8208;(Aib)2&#8208;L&#8208;Dap(Boc)&#8208;Aib&#8208;NHiPr (Aib, &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid; Dap, 2,3&#8208;diaminopropionic acid; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; Boc, t&#8208;butoxycarbonyl). The peptide forms a double&#8208;helical superstructure, studied by XRD and STM. Such architecture is rare in short peptides. Here, we show, by combining XRD, STM that this intriguing conformational feature is not driven by crystal packing; rather, it is an intrinsic property of this peptide. Indeed, the double helix is clearly detected also by STM, where crystal packing cannot be invoked. XRD reveals that intermolecular H&#8208;bonds stabilize two left&#8208;handed supra&#8208;helices (tertiary structure) that develop around a 6&#8208;fold screw axis. Then, two supra&#8208;helices are intertwined in a quaternary structure as a left&#8208;handed, double supra&#8208;helix, where C&#8211;H&#8943;&#960; interactions play a crucial role. STM images show the formation of long, isolated &#8220;necklaces&#8221; (&gt; 110 nm). They are of left and right helical handedness. Their size agrees with the XRD finding. DFT calculations allowed us to weigh the contribution of the different intermolecular interactions in the two single supra&#8208;helices and the supramolecular double&#8208;helix. Interestingly, we were able to conclude that the contribution of the C&#8208;H&#8943;&#960; interactions to the binding energies is close to 50%.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel/Photoredox Catalyzed Aryl&#8208;Alkyl Cross&#8208;Coupling with Alkyl Boronic Esters as Radical Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel/photoredox dual catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl halides with alkylboron compounds is one of the effective methodologies for the construction of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds. Although elegant results have been achieved by using alkyl trifluoroborates as alkyl radical precursors, the generation of alkyl radicals from readily available alkyl boronic esters is still limited due to their high oxidation potential. We disclosed here that activation of alkyl boronic esters by MeOLi is highly efficient for the generation of alkyl radicals under photocatalysis conditions. The reaction featured with a wide substrate scope, high functional group tolerance, and late&#8208;stage modification of bioactive substances. In addition, the method was also successfully extended to alkyl boronic acids. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicated that the cross&#8208;coupling likely proceeds via a Ni(I)&#8208;catalyzed pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>B(C6F5)3 Catalyzed Regiodivergent Thioetherifications of Alkenes via Thiiranium Intermediates: Experimental and Computational Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise control of selective alkene functionalization is a continuing challenge in the chemical community. In this study, we develop a substitution&#8208;controlled regiodivergent thioetherification of di&#8208; or trisubstituted alkenes using 10 mol% tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] as a catalyst and N&#8211;thiosuccinimide as a sulfenylating reagent. This metal&#8208;free borane catalyzed C&#8211;S bond forming method is utilized for a Csp2&#8211;H sulfenylation reaction to synthesize an array of diphenylvinylsulfide derivatives with good to excellent yields (25 examples, up to 91% yield). Some of the products exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen properties used in organic light&#8211;emitting diodes (OLEDs), chemical sensors, and biological imaging units. Depending upon the starting alkene, Csp3&#8211;S sulfenylation products could also be generated regioselectively. A variety of allylic thioethers from &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted styrenes were isolable in good yields and selectivities (14 examples, up to 67% yield). The DFT&#8208;supported mechanistic study confirms that the reaction proceeds via a thiiranium ion intermediate, where the regioselectivity and product formation are determined by the alkene substituents which influences the activation barriers and energy profiles. Diphenylvinylsulfide derivatives can also be efficiently transformed into a range of synthetically valuable compounds, including vinyl sulfoxides, vinyl sulfones, and vinyl sulfoximines.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Dimerization of Methylcyclopentadiene inside Cucurbit[7]uril</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular confinement within rigid macrocyclic receptors can trigger catalytic activity and steer the selectivity of organic reactions. In this work, the dimerization of methylcyclopentadiene (MCPD) isomers in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) was found to display, besides a large rate acceleration, a striking regioselectivity in aqueous solution at pH 3, different from the thermodynamic products predominating in the absence of the supramolecular catalyst. Among the different possible regioisomers and diastereomers, the endo&#8208;3,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3a,4,7,7a&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;4,7&#8208;methanoindene adduct was selectively formed, which is otherwise found only as a minor product in the dimerization of neat MCPD or in commercial dimeric mixtures. This product originates from the reaction of the heteroternary complex of 1&#8208;MCPD and 2&#8208;MCPD within CB7, in which the methyl groups are positioned in an "anti&#8208;diaxial" arrangement and point towards the open portals of the macrocycle, resulting in a preferred packing of the reacting cyclopentadiene rings. The selectivity of the dimerization of MCPD in the absence and presence of CB7 is supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Insert abstract text here.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine&#8208;tune the structural components of porous frameworks for photocatalytic hydrogen production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the depletion of fossil fuels and increasing pollution problems, green and sustainable energy supply attracts worldwide attention. Hydrogen is a green and high&#8208;density energy substance, and photocatalytic hydrogen generation is an effective and sustainable method.&#160;Therefore, developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts plays a crucial role in practical application. Porous frameworks with large surface areas and diversified structures are considered promising candidates for photocatalysts. This review summarizes the recent progress on porous frameworks and their derivatives through fine&#8208;tuning structural components in terms of building monomers, functional groups, and metal hybridization for photocatalytic production of hydrogen. A&#160;detailed correlation is conducted between the structural features of porous frameworks and photocatalysis capability. In addition, we summarized the advantages of porous materials for photocatalytic hydrogen production and future development.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stable Carbon&#8208;centered Radical Showing Six Amphoteric Redox States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable hydrocarbon radical with four six&#8208; and three five&#8208;membered rings alternately fused to a heptacycle was obtained by ortho fusion in a suitably ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;substituted diphenylfluorene and subsequent re&#8208;establishment of the conjugation. The radical was obtained in five consecutive steps from commercially available starting materials with a total yield of 34%; key steps are Suzuki couplings and cyclizing SEAr reactions. Mesityl substituents at the five&#8208;membered rings ensure the stability of the radical. This cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) was characterized by EPR and UV/Vis spectroscopy and by cyclic voltammetry. Quantum chemical calculation disclosed further properties and led to simulated spectra (spin densities, aromaticity, orbital energies, and UV/Vis/NIR). This radical is best described with the unpaired electron centered in the outer five&#8208;membered rings; this resonance formula shows the largest number of fully intact benzene rings. Its triradical character was computed to be very small and can be neglected. The five&#8208;membered rings show notable antiaromatic character, especially in the central ring. The constitution of the radical could be further substantiated by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of its direct precursor.</dc:description>
