         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning of Physicochemical Properties of 3,3&#8208;Disubstituted Oxetanes Introducing Fluorine Atom(s) on the Building Blocks Level</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research has shown the impact of the fluorine atom on changing the physicochemical properties of oxetane&#8208;based building blocks compared to other close analogs and fluorine&#8208;free derivatives. This knowledge can be utilized by the chemical community for fine&#8208;tuning of the abovementioned properties.








Abstract
Fluorinated oxetane derivatives garner significant attention due to their unique physicochemical properties and diverse bioisosteric possibilities for potential applications in medicinal chemistry. We developed robust methodologies for the synthesis of 3&#8208;fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted oxetanes, leveraging nucleophilic substitution, deoxy&#8208; and deoxofluorination, as well as fluoroiodination as key steps of introduction of fluorine atoms directly to the oxetane core or adjacent alkyl groups. Optimized reaction sequences enabled the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of various small building blocks, i.e., amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, etc. Physicochemical studies revealed that fluorination significantly impacts acidity, with oxetane derivatives demonstrating the decrease of pKa values on up to three units in the case of replacement of gem&#8208;dimethyl, cyclopropyl&#8208; or cyclobutylidene moieties. These findings underscore the utility of fluorinated oxetanes as versatile building blocks for future applications in drug design and advanced materials.

         <title>Cover Feature: Pd[B(S2O7)2]2 and Pd[B(SO4) (S2O7)]2: Two Borosulfates with Pd2+ in Octahedral and One with Pd2+ in Square Planar Oxygen Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different palladium borosulfates have been synthesized by the reaction of elemental palladium with B2O3 and SO3. The compounds exhibit Pd2+ cations either in typical square&#8208;planar or even in octahedral oxygen coordination. The latter results in the formation of blue crystals, whereas the former forms red crystals. Due to the d8 high&#8208;spin configuration, the blue species are paramagnetic. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. P&#246;ttgen, M. Suta, J. Bruns and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202501515).

The structure of the mineral dugganite was modified to give rise to interesting new colored compounds, some of which were shown to be active towards the oxygen evolution reaction. The non&#8208;centrosymmetric nature of the structure was found to give good second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) behavior. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Multifunctionality, Catalytic Mechanisms, and In Situ Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer multifunctional platforms to suppress the shuttle effect, catalyze polysulfide conversion, and enable stable cycling in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This review dissects their diverse roles, catalytic mechanisms, and the application of in situ techniques for mechanistic analysis&#8212;highlighting COFs as powerful enablers for advanced lithium&#8211;sulfur chemistry.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, challenges such as polysulfide shuttle, sluggish redox kinetics, and electrode instability hinder their practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer multifunctional platforms to suppress the shuttle effect, catalyze polysulfide conversion, and enable stable cycling in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This review dissects their diverse roles, catalytic mechanisms, and the application of in situ techniques for mechanistic analysis&#8212;highlighting COFs as powerful enablers for advanced lithium&#8211;sulfur chemistry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) are promising next-generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density and cost-effectiveness. However, challenges such as polysulfide shuttle, sluggish redox kinetics, and electrode instability hinder their practical applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring high porosity, tunable functionality, and structural regularity, have emerged as versatile materials to address these issues. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in COF-based strategies for LSBs, including their multifunctional roles as sulfur hosts, separators/interlayers, and catalytic additives. The predominant catalytic mechanisms associated with COFs are further elucidated, with specific focus being placed on electrostatic field catalysis, supramolecular channel catalysis, redox-mediated catalysis, and metal-coordination catalysis. While conventional characterization techniques have been extensively described in previous reviews, particular emphasis is placed on the application of in situ characterization techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD), which offer mechanistic insights into COF-catalyzed polysulfide conversion. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure&#8211;function&#8211;performance relationship of COFs and guide the rational design of next-generation COF-based materials for high-performance LSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Alkenes and Alkynes via Single&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Atom Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically surveys progress since 2017 in single&#8208;carbon insertion into alkenes and alkynes, emphasizing mechanistic insights, substrate scope, and synthetic utility. We highlight key methodologies, discuss unresolved challenges, and outline future directions for this rapidly evolving field, with potential applications in complex molecule synthesis and functional material design.








Abstract
Skeletal editing has emerged as a pivotal complement to retrosynthetic analysis strategies. This approach enables simple bulk chemical feedstocks to achieve precise atomic&#8208;level modifications&#8212;such as insertion, deletion, or swapping&#8212;facilitating the rapid assembly of complex, high value&#8208;added functional organic molecules. Currently, single&#8208;carbon&#8208;atom insertion reactions predominantly emphasize the functionalization of (hetero)aromatic systems, leaving the site&#8208;specific editing of unsaturated C&#9472;C bond frameworks such as alkenes and alkynes, comparatively underexplored. This review provides detailed analysis and summary of recent progress in the skeletal editing of functional alkenes and alkynes derivatives via single&#8208;carbon&#8208;atom insertion, and outlining the future potential directions of this technology.

         <title>Phase Selective Synthesis of SBT and FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS Intergrown Zeolites Using Asymmetric Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agents for Upgrading of Polyethylene Pyrolysis Oil</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
SBT zeolites and FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS triple intergrowth zeolites were synthesized using three asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary ammonium salts as structure&#8208;directing agents. The FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS intergrowth exhibited higher selectivities for ethylene and propylene than that of Y zeolite in catalytic upgrading of polyethylene pyrolysis oil, owing to presence of more strong acid sites.








Abstract
Organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) based on asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary ammonia compounds have been rarely explored in crystallization of zeolites, owing to difficulties in structural control. Their use holds promise to regulate physicochemical properties of zeolitic materials toward enhancing the relevant catalytic performances. In this study, a stepwise alkylation of 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Dab) to generate asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary derivatives has been established, enabling their use as OSDAs in large pore zeolite synthesis. Through exploratory syntheses, we showed that small Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;Et can direct the formation of SBT zeolite in multiple inorganic cation (Cs+&#9472;Na+) crystallization, while the bulky Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;iPr and Me&#8208;Dab&#8208;sBu lead to the formation of FAU&#8208;SBT&#8208;SBS intergrowths. The obtained SBT zeolite exhibited higher olefin selectivity in catalytic upgrading of pyrolysis oil derived from polyethylene, with respect to alike cage&#8208;containing faujasite (FAU) zeolite. Our findings expand the library of asymmetric di&#8208;quaternary OSDAs and highlight their capability to achieve phase selective synthesis of large pore zeolites.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Mn2+/Octadecylamine Codecorated Carbon Dots with Ultrabroadband Yellow Emission for High&#8208;CRI White LEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the synergy of Mn2+ and ODA codecoration, CDs with ultrabroadband and efficient yellow fluorescence in the solid state were synthesized through a simple one&#8208;step solvothermal process. These synthetic phosphors exhibit a production yield of 80%, an FWHM of 98&#160;nm, and a solid&#8208;state quantum yield up to 62.8%, allowing for high&#8208;CRI white LEDs in green and health lighting.








Abstract
Exploiting environment&#8208;friendly and efficient phosphors is crucial to constructing high&#8208;quality and sustainable white light&#8208;emitting devices. Here, we demonstrate a facile and high&#8208;yield approach to synthesize Mn2+/octadecylamine (ODA)&#8208;codecorated carbon dots (CDs) with ultrabroadband and efficient yellow fluorescence in the solid state. The dots are prepared from anhydrous citric acid (CA), 1&#8208;ODA, and manganese acetate through a simple one&#8208;step hydrothermal process, with a production yield of 80%, a full width at half maxima (FWHM) of 98&#160;nm, and a solid&#8208;state quantum yield up to 62.8%. Utilizing the synthetic CDs powder as a phosphor to directly coat on a blue light&#8208;emitting chip, the device exhibits warm white emission, with a high color rendering index (CRI) of 88, correlated color temperature (CCT) of 4215&#160;K, and Commission International de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.33, 0.31), endowing great potential applications in green and health lighting.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of void occupancies on the ionic conductivity of the novel Zintl phases Li5Sr2AlP4 and Li2Sr2Al2P4 is investigated. Their structures and structural relationships are discussed in detail and compared to the known Li4Sr2SiP4. Additionally, a solid solution between Li5Sr2AlP4 and Li4Sr2SiP4 is presented. Methods of investigation include X&#8208;ray diffraction, MAS NMR, impedance, and Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich ternary lithium phosphides have proven to be good model systems for ionic conductivity, achieving lithium&#8208;ion conductivities up to 4.5 mS/cm (&#969;&#8208;Li9GaP4). Compounds in which lithium is partially substituted by alkaline&#8208;earth metals bear the possibility of vacancy generation and thus the possibility to reach better ion conductivity and also to gain further insight into structure&#8208;property relationships. Based on the recent report on the quaternary compound Li4Sr2SiP4, we investigated the substitution of Si by Al and found the new compounds Li5Sr2AlP4 and Li2Sr2Al2P4. The examination of the solid solution Li5&#8722;xSr2Al1&#8722;x SixP4 for x =&#160;0.0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.875, and 1.0 resulted in a series of crystalline materials that adopt two different structure types in dependency of x. Compounds crystallize either in space group P3&#175;$\bar{3}$;m1 (No.&#160;164) (Li5Sr2AlP4, Li5&#8722;xSr2Al1&#8722;xSixP4 with x&#160;&lt;&#160;0.5) or in space group P21/m (No.&#160;11) (Li2Sr2Al2P4, Li5&#8722;xSr2Al1&#8722;xSixP4 with x&#160;&#8805;&#160;0.5). Li5Sr2AlP4 is structurally related to Li4Sr2SiP4 but exhibits an additional statistical disorder of Al and Li atoms, which is also found in Li2Sr2Al2P4.

Additionally, a solid solution between Li&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AlP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is presented. Methods of investigation include X-ray diffraction, MAS NMR, impedance, and Raman spectroscopy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium-rich ternary lithium phosphides have proven to be good model systems for ionic conductivity, achieving lithium-ion conductivities up to 4.5 mS/cm (&#969;-Li&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;GaP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Compounds in which lithium is partially substituted by alkaline-earth metals bear the possibility of vacancy generation and thus the possibility to reach better ion conductivity and also to gain further insight into structure-property relationships. Based on the recent report on the quaternary compound Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, we investigated the substitution of Si by Al and found the new compounds Li&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AlP&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The examination of the solid solution Li&lt;sub&gt;5&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; Si&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning the Motion of Tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;Benzoquinone within Charge&#8208;Transfer Cocrystals Through Variation of the Donor: An Entropic and Enthalpic Point of View</title>

Five CT cocrystals using TFBQ and fused, polycyclic donors derived from fluorene are synthesized. The &#960;&#8208;stacking in all cocrystals provides a platform for the displaying of in&#8208;plane molecular motions of TFBQ, which is by supramolecular interactions. This methodology provides a platform for the development and modulation of crystalline, organic materials with motion&#8208;mediated photophysical applications.








Abstract
In this work, we report a detailed investigation on the factors affecting the in&#8208;plane motion of tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TFBQ) within a series of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) cocrystals formed with various fused aromatic donors. Six crystalline materials were obtained, including four cocrystals, a polymorph, and a solid solution. These were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC XRD), solid&#8208;state NMR, FTIR, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. All cocrystals exhibited short &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and varied noncovalent interactions (NCI) modulating the in&#8208;plane motion of TFBQ. 19F T&#8321; relaxation measurements allowed the quantification of the activation enthalpies (&#916;H&#8225;) and entropies (&#916;S&#8225;), with theoretical calculations backing these results. Cocrystal 4 is the solid with the most restricted motions due to the presence of strong hydrogen bonds. In contrast, cocrystal 3a depicts the highest in&#8208;plane motional frequencies (up to 2.2&#160;MHz at 300 K), owing to the weak contacts around TFBQ. Surprisingly, a solid solution (5), which resembled a mixture of cocrystals 2 and 3a, displayed no significant in&#8208;plane motions, despite having similar packing and relaxation behavior to the binary cocrystals. This work illustrates how subtle variations in donor structure affect the in&#8208;plane motions and photophysical properties of CT cocrystals, providing valuable insight into the rational design of functional materials.

         <title>The Dugganite Structure as a Host for New Colored Compounds and for Oxygen Evolution Studies</title>

The transition metal substituted dugganite compounds were explored toward new colored compounds and as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reactions. The compounds were also investigated for their second harmonic generation and dielectric behavior at room temperature. The theoretical calculations support the findings of experimental investigations.








Abstract
A family compounds with the general formula A3BC3D2O14 (A&#160;=&#160;Pb, Ba, Sr; B&#160;=&#160;Te, Sb; C&#160;=&#160;Al, Ga, Fe, Zn, Mg, Co, Ni, Cu; D&#160;=&#160;P, V, As, Si, Ge) stabilized in the dugganite structure has been prepared and characterized. The transition metal ions substituted at the tetrahedral sites in place of Zn2+ ions, gave rise to brightly colored compounds. The origin of colors in the compounds were understood based on the allowed d&#8208;d transitions and possible metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) transitions involving the different transition elements. The white compounds exhibited good near infrared (NIR) reflectivity as well as deep UV&#8211;cut off (85&#8211;90%), which indicates possible use as UV&#8208;NLO materials. The compounds exhibited reasonable second harmonic generation (SHG) activity with values that are 3&#8211;5 times higher than KDP. The dielectric studies indicated reasonable values for the dielectric constant with low dielectric loss. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) studies on Pb3TeCo3V2O14 and Pb3Te(Co2Fe)(VSi)O14, exhibited good OER behavior in alkaline medium with long&#8208;term stability. The change in the band gap values for the transition metal substituted compounds were understood through density functional theory calculations, which support the findings of the experimental investigations. The present study clearly indicates that it is profitable to explore mineral structures as hosts toward new colored compounds, substitution of transition elements that result not only in new and also for application as electrocatalysts through careful band engineering.

         <title>Regulated &#914;&#8208;Phase Crystallization of Strong and Tough Polypropylene Through Hyperbranched Topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>

This work demonstrates the regulating crystallization and morphology of &#946;&#8208;nucleated PP with a HBPN and provides a new perspective on toughening polypropylene using hyperbranched topology.








Abstract
Achieving both enhanced strength and improved toughness of polypropylene (PP) remains a significant challenge for industrial applications. The present study addresses this limitation by constructing a robust crystalline network through the strategic integration of hyperbranched topology. We demonstrate that a hyperbranched nucleating agent (HBPN) effectively induces high&#8208;content &#946;&#8208;crystal formation in PP, which organizes into an interconnected crystalline architecture. This &#946;&#8208;phase network significantly enhances the mechanical performance of PP, with tensile strength and notched impact strength increasing by 35.78% (to 42.5&#160;MPa) and 140% (to 13.2 KJ/m2), respectively, compared to pure PP. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergy between strength and toughness originates from HBPN mediated &#946;&#8208;phase crystallization, which refines the morphology of spherulites and increases the degree of crystallinity. The hyperbranched topology of HBPN inhibits entangled PP chains and facilitates crystallization of PP chains. Thus, it contributes to efficient stress redistribution by dissipating localized energy through multidirectional load transfer, while arresting crack advancement via microvoid&#8208;induced stress relaxation. This work demonstrates an effective conceptual approach to engineering high&#8208;performance PP, unlocking its potential for various value&#8208;added applications.

         <title>Fe3+ Oxidation Strategy Enhances the Nonradiative Transition Ability of a Near&#8208;Infrared BODIPY Photosensitizer for Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>

By constructing near&#8208;infrared photothermal reagents with intramolecular charge transfer properties using high&#8208;priced metal oxides, effective killing of tumor cells was achieved.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) BODIPY&#8208;based photosensitizer NIR&#8208;2BDP is constructed through an Fe3+ oxidation strategy. Theoretical calculations and experimental results show that intramolecular charge separation effectively reduces the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap, broadens the light absorption range, and suppresses radiative transition (RT) processes. The decrease in the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap enhances the intersystem crossing (ISC) ability of NIR&#8208;2BDP (the spin&#8208;orbit coupling constant (S1&#8594;T1) is 2.5 times that of NIR&#8208;BDP, and the singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yield is 2.1 times that of NIR&#8208;BDP). The low RT (only 2.2% fluorescence quantum yield) and relatively low triplet generation (11.7% 1O2 quantum yield) suggest that NIR&#8208;2BDP should have a stronger contribution of nonradiative transition (NRT) processes (and hence a higher photothermal conversion capability). Nanoparticles constructed from NIR&#8208;2BDP and DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000 exhibit good photothermal conversion efficiency (41.4%) and killing efficiency to tumor cells in the NIR&#8208;II window (1000&#8208;1700&#160;nm). Therefore, this study extends the sensitization window and improves the NRT ability, paving the way for the construction of multi&#8208;functional NIR BODIPY&#8208;like photosensitizers.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Metalated Ge9 Zintl Clusters as Single&#8208;Site Homogeneous Catalysts</title>

A Ni0 atom is fixed into a nine atomic germanium cluster core and remains active in the isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene. This clearly confirms the idea to use Zintl cluster as support material for catalytically active transition metals.








Abstract
Homogeneous catalytic reactions performed without or with highly abundant transition metals is an increasing field of research due to cost&#8208;effectiveness and sustainability. Therefore, using main group element Zintl cluster as support material for transition metals via synthesizing single site homogeneous catalysts (SSHoC) could be a way to make such metals feasible for catalysis, without the risk of metal loss or agglomeration like in classical single site catalysts. A synthetic protocol for four cluster compounds K[Hyp3Ge9Ni(PR3)] (Hyp&#160;=&#160;Si{SiMe3}3; R&#160;=&#160;Ph, ptolyl, iPr, Me, 1&#8211;4) is presented, in which the nickel atom is embedded into the cluster core. The products were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, ESI/MS as well as for 1 and 3 by single crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination comprising a closo&#8208;[Ge9Ni] core. The cleavage of the triphenylphosphine ligand in 1 in THF, with and without 2.2.2&#8208;crypt, and acetonitrile as well as the isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene in the same solvents have been investigated via NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Ni&#9472;C Bond Formation via Selective Gas&#8208;Phase C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage in 1,3&#8208;Diketones</title>

CID experiments reveal that [(phen)NiL]+ (where L and phen represent the 1,3&#8208;diketone ligand and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, respectively), cations facilitate the selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds, with the formation of alkyl&#8208;metal ions possessing M&#9472;C bonds.








Abstract
Mechanistic investigations into the selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds to form M&#9472;C (M: metal) bonds are crucial for the comprehension, optimization, and design of chemical reactions. In this study, collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) experiments reveal that [(phen)NiL]+ (where L and phen represent a 1,3&#8208;diketone ligand and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, respectively), cations facilitate the selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds, leading to the formation of alkyl&#8208;metal ions possessing M&#9472;C bonds. In contrast, the [NiL]+ cation, without the phen ligand, produces small neutral molecules, such as CH4, CO, and C6H6. Theoretical calculations suggest that a decarboxylation&#8208;like mechanism is responsible for the generation of the M&#9472;C bond in [(phen)Ni(bac)]+ (bac&#160;=&#160;benzoylacetone). Although the phen ligand is not directly involved in the fragmentation of nickel complex cations, it significantly alters the electronic structures and fragmentation mechanisms of nickel complex cations. This work presents a novel approach for the generation of M&#9472;C bonds through a gas&#8208;phase method and provides molecular&#8208;level insights into the selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds in homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Pd[B(S2O7)2]2 and Pd[B(SO4) (S2O7)]2: Two Borosulfates with Pd2+ in Octahedral and One with Pd2+ in Square Planar Oxygen Coordination</title>

         <dc:description>
Two polymorphs of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2 have been obtained as blue crystals, respectively. The [B(S2O7)2]&#8722; &#8211;anions coordinate the central Pd2+ cations via oxygen atoms in octahedral fashion. With Pd2+ as d8 high&#8208;spin cations the bulk samples are paramagnetic. Furthermore, Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)] has been obtained as side product in form of red crystals. The structure exhibits chain&#8208;like borosulfate anions and Pd2+ cations in square planar coordination.








Abstract
The reaction of elemental palladium with B2O3 and SO3 at elevated temperature results in the formation of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Dependent on the reaction conditions, the compound crystallizes in two different polymorphs obtained as bulk samples. In both structures the Pd2+ cations are coordinated by six oxygen atoms in form of an almost perfect octahedron. All oxygen atoms belong to the borosulfate anions [B(S2O7)2]&#8722; and link via Pd2+ cations to an extended network structure. Within the uncommon octahedral oxygen coordination, the Pd2+ cations reveal a d8 high&#8208;spin configuration, which leads to paramagnetism. Occasionally, red crystals are formed during the reaction next to the major fraction of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis on the red crystals reveals the sum formula Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)]2 with Pd2+ in square&#8208;planar coordination.

Single crystal X-ray structure analysis on the red crystals reveals the sum formula Pd[B(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with Pd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in square-planar coordination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Luminescent Systems with High&#8208;Contrast Fluorescence and Phosphorescence Through a Host&#8208;Guest Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient phosphorescent systems are constructed by doping weakly emissive hosts and guests. The doping systems exhibit high&#8208;contrast multi&#8208;stimuli response in both fluorescence and phosphorescence, which is rarely reported.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted significant attention because of their potential applications in information storage, bioimaging, sensors, among others. However, the design of high&#8208;performance stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP materials remains challenging. In this work, multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP systems are constructed by utilizing the acid&#8208;base responsive properties of the pyridine group, the heavy&#8208;atom effect of halogen and sulfur atoms, and d&#8208;p&#960; bonds. Six phenothiazine derivatives are designed and synthesized. A systematic investigation is conducted on the effects of molecular structure, molecular conformation, stacking arrangements, and intermolecular interactions on their luminescence properties. Employing phenothiazine derivatives as the guest and their corresponding 5,5&#8208;dioxide phenothiazine derivatives as the host, host&#8208;guest doping is achieved through the slow solvent evaporation and the melting&#8208;blending methods. The host&#8208;guest doping system exhibits highly efficient and long&#8208;lifetime phosphorescence through the formation of triplet exciplexes, with a phosphorescence quantum yield of up to 63.6%. The doping systems exhibit higher&#8208;contrast acid&#8208;base, acid&#8208;thermal, and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive luminescence characteristics than the single compounds. The potential applications of these systems in sensors, multicolor patterning, and multi&#8208;information encryption are explored.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release of Branched Pro&#8208;Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>

Alkene&#8208;azide click&#8208;to&#8208;release branched prodrugs can amplify the amount of cargo activated. However, balance between the &#8220;click&#8221; and &#8220;release&#8221; steps is essential. Branched pro&#8208;fluorophores provided the fastest&#8208;to&#8208;date click reaction of aryl azides and TCOs. The second branched core enabled the self&#8208;immolation, releasing higher levels of fluorophore than the corresponding monomeric profluorophores.








Abstract
Bioorthogonal click&#8208;to&#8208;release prodrug activation strategies should be fast and high yielding. However, in strain&#8208;promoted alkene&#8208;azide click&#8208;to&#8208;release, a fast click&#8208;step translates to slow and inefficient drug release. To improve drug yield, branched dual&#8208;core scaffolds that increase drug release are reported. The dual&#8208;core consists of an exposed electron&#8208;deficient aryl azide (core&#8208;1) attached to an electron&#8208;rich self&#8208;immolating branched linker (core&#8208;2). Core&#8208;1, a tetrafluoroaryl azide with methyl&#8208;substitution at the benzylic carbon, facilitates a rapid click reaction with trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCOs). Core&#8208;2 had an N&#8208;methyl carbamate or ether linker and a 1,4/1,4&#8208; or 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating scaffold. Various release rates of a fluorophore were observed across the series, with 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating core&#8208;2, linked via the N&#8208;methyl carbamate, having sustained and enhanced fluorophore release. The second&#8208;order rate constant for cycloaddition of this 1,4/1,6&#8208;self&#8208;immolating analogue and d&#8208;TCO is, to the best of our knowledge, the fastest to date (22.0 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). A persistent intermediate was observed, leading to a long, sustained release of fluorophore from the branched scaffold, though activation under acidic conditions (pH&#160;=&#160;5.5) led to&#160;&#8776;&#160;15% higher fluorophore release compared to activation at pH 7.4. Therefore, combinations of core&#8208;1 and core&#8208;2 could improve future pretargeted in vivo bioorthogonal click&#8208;to&#8208;release prodrug strategies, especially in the acidic tumor environment.

         <title>Vacuum Condensation of Hybrid Polymeric Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Extended Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vacuum condensation route was developed to synthesize g&#8208;CN with a hybrid polymeric structure, consisting of melon&#8208;type chains combined with completely condensed domains. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated system can be effectively extended for more efficient visible&#8208;light absorption and exciton dissociation, leading to a significantly improved hydrogen evolution activity, particularly in the extended spectral region up to 520&#160;nm.








Abstract
Polymeric graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) has attracted considerable attention as a promising photocatalyst; however, its practical application is still hindered by the poor visible&#8208;light absorption and rapid recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. Herein, we report a vacuum&#8208;condensation approach for synthesizing g&#8208;CN with a hybrid polymeric structure that contains melon&#8208;type chains combined with completely condensed domains, which induces a notable structural disorder with the N/C atomic ratio less than 1.5 (the nominal value of melon). This hybrid polymeric structure intrinsically extends the &#960;&#8208;conjugated system of the heptazine&#8208;based framework, narrows its band gap, accelerates the exciton dissociation, and thus substantially improves its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance. Compared to the counterparts synthesized under inert atmospheres (N2 and Ar), the vacuum&#8208;polycondensed g&#8208;CN exhibits a threefold enhancement for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production. In particular, its PHE activity can be effectively maintained under the light wavelength extended to 520&#160;nm. This work presents a promising strategy to break through the limitation of linear polymerization pathway during the conventional g&#8208;CN synthesis and offers new opportunities for rational design of more efficient g&#8208;CN&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Quasiracemic Crystallization of Luminescent Chiral Molecules: Mechanochromic Luminescence and Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>

A pair of naphthalene&#8208; and benzothiadiazole&#8208;substituted (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;binaphthol derivatives was designed as luminescent quasiracemates. Quasiracemic crystals of these compounds exhibit CPL, which cannot be observed in racemic crystals.








Abstract
The arrangement of molecules plays a crucial role in governing the luminescent properties of organic crystals. While quasiracemic crystallization, based on the co&#8208;crystallization of two structurally similar but nonidentical enantiomeric molecules, offers a promising strategy for organizing distinct species within a single crystal, its potential for tuning luminescent behavior remains largely unexplored. Herein, we have prepared quasiracemic crystals from a pair of enantiomeric binaphthyl derivatives functionalized with either ethynylnaphthalene or ethynylbenzothiadiazole groups. The molecular arrangement of the quasiracemic crystal is analogous to that of the racemic ethynylnaphthalene derivative, whereas the quasiracemic crystals exhibit mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) behavior similar to that of the racemic ethynylbenzothiadiazole derivative. Notably, the quasiracemic crystals exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and the CPL sign is inverted relative to that of the enantiopure crystal of the ethynylbenzothiadiazole derivative. These results highlight quasiracemic crystallization as a new strategy for modulating MCL and CPL properties.

Mkrtchyan and Iaroshenko et&#160;al. report a mechanochemical approach for the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot direct trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols to deliver the respective trifluoromethyl arenes and aryl trifluoromethyl ethers under the synergy of trifluoromethylacetamide and pyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Pyry&#8208;BF&#8324;).








Abstract
We report a mechanochemical approach for the ruthenium catalyzed trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols under the synergy of trifluoromethylacetamide and pyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Pyry&#8208;BF&#8324;). This is the first ever report on trifluoromethylation using in situ generated N&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate as the CF3 source under ball&#8208;milling conditions. The present one&#8208;pot transformation enabled direct trifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids and phenols to deliver the respective trifluoromethyl arenes and aryl trifluoromethyl ethers. It has also shown a remarkable compatibility toward aroyltrifluoroborates for the mechanochemical synthesis of aryl trifluoromethyl ketones. This method offers several advantages, including operational simplicity and broad substrate compatibility. Moreover, the current mechanochemical approach not only proceeds under sustainable conditions but also provides a practical route for the late&#8208;stage modifications of related substrates to access the valuable fluorinated compounds.

         <title>New Click on the Block: Photocaged Hydroxylamine, an Addition to the Light&#8208;Activatable Bioorthogonal Toolbox</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The retro&#8208;Cope bioorthogonal reactivity of hydroxylamines was disabled transiently with a coumarin photolabile protecting group, which could be recovered upon removal of the protecting group by a short, 400 nm light illumination. Light&#8208;controlled recovery of reactivity was demonstrated in bioorthogonal fluorescent labeling schemes of intracellular proteins in live cells.








Abstract
A new photoactivatable bioorthogonal function was added to the photoactivatable bioorthogonal toolbox by transiently disabling the bioorthogonal reactivity of the hydroxylamine moiety with a photolabile protecting group. The photocaged bioorthogonal function was further equipped with a HaloTag substrate to enable its use in live&#8208;cell labeling schemes. Light&#8208;controlled recovery of reactivity was demonstrated by bioorthogonal fluorescent labeling of intracellular proteins in live cells.

         <title>Single Sodium&#8208;Ion Conducting Sulfonated Polytriazole and Composite Electrolyte Membranes</title>

The table of contents illustrates the structural engineering of the polymer electrolytes, which results in a self&#8208;assembled, phase&#8208;separated morphology. This morphology resulted&#160;in enhanced solvent absorption and wettability, which in turn leads to improved ionic conductivity that is suitable for alkali metal battery applications.








Abstract
The ongoing energy crisis and the increasing demand for lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have raised concerns about the availability and affordability of lithium. In light of their abundance and lower production costs, sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have the potential to replace LMBs. However, due to the reactivity of organic electrolytes with the sodium anode, it is essential to design safer electrolytes to prevent short&#8208;circuiting. This study focuses on the design and evaluation of fillers and single&#8208;ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs), including sodium salt of sulfonated graphene oxide (Na&#8208;SGO), sulfonated polytriazole (PTSICPE&#8208;90), and various blend composites, which outperform Celgard 2400 in terms of thermal, mechanical, and dimensional stability. The Na&#8208;SGO filler demonstrated a desirable Na&#8208;ion conductivity of 11.91&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 Scm&#8722;1 at 90 &#176;C in a solvated state. Due to the high solvent absorption (70&#160;wt.%), good wettability (22.2&#176;), and significant porosity (58%) of the SICPEs, notable Na&#8208;ion conductivities of 0.23&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 Scm&#8722;1 (nonsolvated at 30 &#176;C) and 1.17&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 Scm&#8722;1 (solvated at 40 &#176;C) were observed. These properties make them an appealing choice for electrolytic applications in SMBs.

         <title>Bis(phenylsulfonyl)Methane (BPSM) as Multifunctional Electrolyte Additive Constructing a Stable Interfaces for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Graphite Batteries at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (BPSM) as an electrolyte additive enhances the performance of NCM811/graphite batteries. BPSM facilitates the formation of a more stable interfacial film on the electrode surface. The available data demonstrate that the capacity retention of the battery at low temperature is significantly improved. BPSM showcases potential as an influential additive for NCM811/graphite batteries under the condition of low temperature.








Abstract
Bis(phenylsulfonyl)methane (BPSM) is used as a functional electrolyte additive to assist in the construction of stable electrode/electrolyte interfacial films to improve the performance of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite batteries at room and low temperatures and compared to the non&#8208;BPSM&#8208;containing batteries, rate and cycling performance of BPSM&#8208;containing batteries can also be enhanced. After 1200 cycles at 25 &#176;C, the capacity retention of the battery with BPSM increases from 8.68% to 83.07%. After 130 cycles at &#8722;10 &#176;C, the capacity retention of the battery with BPSM increases from 21.01% to 98.97%. The spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that BPSM is preferentially oxidized and reduced on the cathode and anode, respectively, to construct stable and high&#8208;conductivity electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. The enhanced performance reveals that BPSM is an effective film&#8208;forming additive with promising applications in nickel&#8208;rich lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Unraveling Structural Evolution of Cobalt&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Boosting Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zeolitic imidazole framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) with Co&#8208;N units and Co3(hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Co&#8208;HHTP) with Co&#8208;O units on carbon paper (CP) exhibit structural evolution into Co(OH)2 during catalytic process, which could promote the more favorable activation of *H2O and hydrogenation of *NO3 and *NO toward the wide&#8208;potential and high&#8208;yield electrochemical ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied for various complex electrocatalytic reactions, such as nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) to ammonia. Currently, their real active sites are controversial due to the inevitable structure transformations of MOFs during the catalytic process, limiting the rational design of effective electrocatalysts. Here, we clarified the structural evolution of zeolitic imidazole framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) with Co&#8208;N units and Co3(hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Co&#8208;HHTP) with Co&#8208;O units on carbon paper (CP) toward enhancing NO3RR. Both ZIF&#8208;67/CP and Co&#8208;HHTP/CP achieve NH3 Faradaic efficiencies more than 95% within the wide potential range of &#8208;0.2 to &#8208;1.0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). At &#8208;1.0&#160;V versus RHE, they deliver NH3 yield rates of 87.41 and 79.11&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, respectively, which outperform the most reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Combining with in&#8208;situ Raman and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, we verified the faster transformation of ZIF&#8208;67 into Co(OH)2 compared to Co&#8208;HHTP. The newly generated Co(OH)2 was recognized as the catalytic species and presented more favorable hydrogenation as elucidated by in&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy. This work offers insightful understanding on the active phase of MOFs for designing reasonable active units toward different electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Structural Rearrangement in an M8L2 Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;rich ligand, based on the so&#8208;called exTTF moiety, self&#8208;assembles with a bimetallic ruthenium complex to provide an M8L2 architecture, where the two ligands adopt a perpendicular orientation. Thanks to the unique electronic and geometric features of the exTTF core, this discrete structure undergoes a structural transformation into a new M8Lox2 species upon oxidation, in which both dicationic ligands rotate in a face&#8208;to&#8208;face fashion, yielding a cage&#8208;like structure.








Abstract
Due to the reversible nature of the metal&#8211;ligand bond, coordination cages are inherently dynamic architectures which can undergo structural transformations upon appropriate external stimulations. This adaptability has been widely explored in various fields. Herein, we report the preparation of a redox&#8208;responsive discrete (Ru2)4L2 architecture through a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach, where Ru2 is a bis(ruthenium(II)) complex and L a tetrapyridyl ligand. Importantly, ligand L is designed around the &#960;&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene framework (exTTF), whose geometry is highly sensitive to its redox state. The resulting (Ru2)4L2 assembly was fully characterized, revealing a twisted configuration with two orthogonally oriented L units in close spatial proximity. Remarkably, this assembly undergoes an oxidation&#8208;induced transformation into a (Ru2)4Lox&#8322; structure, in which the two dicationic ligands are now spatially separated and aligned according to a face&#8208;to&#8208;face arrangement, affording a cage&#8208;like structure. This reorganization is driven by the redox&#8208;induced geometric and electronic changes of the exTTF cores and the resulting electrostatic repulsions occurring between both oxidized ligands. The process is fully reversible upon chemical reduction, restoring the original (Ru2)4L&#8322; structure.

         <title>Tailored Watson&#8211;Crick Pairing Partners for Xanthosine in RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNAs with kappa&#8208;xanthosine (K&#8211;X) or 2&#8208;iminocytidine&#8208;xanthosine (2imC&#8211;X) base pairs form stable double helices that have higher melting temperatures than those of the A&#8211;U or G&#8211;U references. Access to these novel 2imC&#8208;modified RNAs is possible through the mild, selective chemical conversion of 2&#8208;thiocytidine RNA precursors.








Abstract
The deamination of guanosine nucleobases results in the formation of xanthosine (X)&#8208;containing RNA. This process formally resembles adenine deamination (A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing). The biological significance and basic chemical consequences of X&#8208;modified RNA are poorly understood. In this study, we examine xanthosine interactions with tailored pyrimidine nucleobases. We synthesized RNAs that provide either the 2,4&#8208;diaminopyrimidine C&#8208;nucleoside kappa (K) or 2&#8208;iminocytidine (2imC) as an &#8220;ideal&#8221; tridendate Watson&#8211;Crick pairing partner. For K&#8208;modified RNA, we used a phosphoramidite previously introduced for RNA solid&#8208;phase synthesis. For 2imC&#8208;modified RNA, we developed access via synthetic 2&#8208;thiocytidine (2sC)&#8208;modified RNA, followed by osmium tetroxide (OsO&#8324;)&#8208;ammonium chloride (NH&#8324;Cl)&#8208;mediated transformation into 2imC&#8208;modified RNA. RNAs with K&#8211;X or 2imC&#8211;X base pairs indeed showed stable duplex formation with significantly higher melting temperatures than X&#8211;C or X&#8211;U containing RNAs and higher still than A&#8211;U or G&#8211;U containing RNA references. Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure analysis confirmed the tridendate Watson&#8211;Crick pair geometry of K&#8211;X within an RNA double helix. Our findings suggest that K&#8211;X and 2imC&#8211;X pairs could be used in RNA decoding processes, thereby expanding the RNA genetic alphabet. However, their potential for use in biochemical and cellular applications remains to be seen.

         <title>Tuning NIR Absorption and Emission of Diphenyl&#8208;Dihydrophenazine&#8208;Based Merocyanines with Ultra Narrow Band Gap</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel merocyanine derivatives with a strong diphenyl&#8208;dihydrophenazine donor and a series of strong electron acceptors were developed. The indanone and indandione acceptor units were modified by dicyanovinylene groups to tune acceptor strength. Among these derivatives, DPPZ&#8208;IDD realized an ultranarrow electrochemical gap of 0.93 eV and an optical band gap of 1.09 eV. Fluorescence in the visible to NIR region was also achieved in solution and solid states.








Abstract
Five merocyanine derivatives with a 5,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;dihydrophenazine donor and various indanone&#8208;and indandione based&#8208;acceptors with one or two dicyanovinylene groups were prepared by Knoevenagel condensation for tuning absorption and fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared region. Molecular conformation, bond length alternation, and molecular packing in the solid state were studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction of single crystals in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By enhancing electron&#8208;accepting ability, a considerable decrease of lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) energy by 1.01 eV and retained highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) energy within 0.13 eV were estimated by cyclic and rotating disc electrode voltammetry, relating semi&#8208;quantitatively to DFT prediction. Optical properties in solutions with various polarity, neat amorphous films, and crystalline powder states were studied. The absorption maxima of the neat films evolved from 545 nm to 931 nm. An ultranarrow optical band gap of DPPZ&#8208;IDD (1.09 eV) was found from the onset of thin film absorption and well agreed with the electrochemical gap of 0.93 eV. Detectable fluorescence in the NIR region was observed in the film and polycrystalline powder states.

         <title>A Tour in the Chemistry of a Tricoordinate Rh(&#8722;I) Complex</title>

The low&#8208;coordinated Rh(&#8722;I) complex displays a nonconventional reactivity, affording a Rh(I) compound in a trigonal&#8208;pyramidal geometry, a rare true metalloradical Rh(0) complex, a highly unsaturated 14 eV complex featuring a Rh&#160;&#8722;&#160;Si bond, and catalyzes a dimerization of aldehydes to the ester through a Rh(&#8208;I)/Rh(I) catalytic cycle with catalyst deactivation to an allylrhodium complex.








Abstract
The finding of the unprecedented 16&#8208;e tricoordinate planar rhodium(&#8722;&#921;) complex, K[Rh(IPr)(dvtms)] (K[1]) (IPr&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, dvtms&#160;=&#160;divinyltretramethyldisiloxane) prompted us to explore its reactivity. K[1] reacts as a nucleophile with methyliodide to give [Rh(IPr)(dvtms)Me], a Rh(&#921;) compound with an exceptional trigonal&#8208;pyramidal structure. Other haloalkanes abstract one electron from K[1] to give the previously reported [Rh0(IPr)(dvtms)] complex. K[1] also reacts with protonic acids and weak proton sources such as water and ketones to eventually give the rare tricoordinate 14&#8208;electron complex [RhI(IPr)(SiMe2OSiMe2CH&#160;=&#160;CH2)] with a Rh&#160;&#8722;Si bond. The 16&#8208;electron complex [RhI(IPr)(SiMe2OSiMe2CH&#160;=&#160;CH2)(H2C&#160;=&#160;CH2)] was characterized as an intermediate in this reaction. Furthermore, K[1] runs up to five cycles of catalytic condensation of nonenolizable aldehydes to esters, such as p&#8208;tolylaldehyde, before being fully converted into the inactive complex Rh(IPr)(&#951;3&#8208;C3H4ptolyl)(C2H4)] with fragmentation of the diolefin dvtms. Computational studies have provided valuable insights into the reactivity patterns and behavior of this complex, including those of the rhodium(&#8722;I)/rhodium(I) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Annulation of 2&#8208;Arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]Pyridines with Maleimides: Regioselectivity Switch and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report presents the first example of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed switch in regioselectivity during the annulation of 2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with maleimides, achieved under low catalyst loading (1.5 mol%). The observed switch in regioselectivity is attributed to the preferential activation of the pyridine&#8208;ring hydrogen over that of the aryl ring. Photophysical studies of the annulated products revealed impressive quantum yields of up to 0.78. Notably, compound 3ba exhibited 63% quenching of picric acid, underscoring its potential for sensing applications.








Abstract
Herein, we report a palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed dehydrogenative annulation of 2&#8208;arylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines with maleimides, representing the first example of the regioselectivity reversal for this class of substrates. Notably, the transformation proceeds efficiently with a low catalyst loading (1.5&#160;mol%). A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed, supported by control experiments and in situ HRMS analysis. Photophysical investigations of the annulated products reveal moderate to high quantum yields, highlighting their potential for optoelectronic applications. Furthermore, these molecules demonstrate promising sensitivity as picric acid&#8208;sensing probes.

         <title>High Dispersion of Copper Nanoparticles on Carbon Black in Minimal Loadings Enhances the Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 42, July 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A few copper nanoparticles (less than 1&#160;mg/cm2) supported on CB and deposited on a carbon&#8208;based GDL can achieve Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 60% for CO formation at 100&#160;mA/cm2 due to their homogeneous dispersion and separated catalytic sites.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO&#8322; reduction (ECR) offers a promising route for converting CO&#8322; emissions into valuable chemicals. To enhance economic viability, the development of efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts based on nonnoble metals is crucial. This study focuses on copper (Cu) nanoparticles highly dispersed on a carbon black (CB) support, synthesized via a solvothermal method that allows for precise control over particle size and loading. We demonstrate that tuning these properties is essential to steer the selectivity of CO&#8322; reduction toward carbon monoxide (CO). Notably, a low catalyst loading of only 0.159&#160;mg/cm2 was sufficient to achieve high performance. The optimized catalyst delivered a CO partial current density of 66&#160;mA/cm2 (total current density of 100&#160;mA/cm2 with 66% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO) at a cell voltage of 3.2&#160;V. Furthermore, our results highlight the critical role of the gas diffusion layer (GDL), showing that its composition significantly impacts catalyst activity. This underscores the necessity of engineering advanced GDLs with tailored conductivity, stability, and hydrophobicity to further boost the performance of Cu&#8208;based catalysts in CO&#8322; electrolysis.

Let's scrap and build! Skeletal editing induced by two&#8208;electron oxidation of selenadiazole&#8208;fused quinodimethane enables preparative&#8208;scale synthesis of hexacyclic derivatives of phenanthroline, which afford fluorescent metal complexes. In this process, the two nitrogen atoms within a single heterocycle in the starting material are segregated into two different ring systems in the product.








Abstract
Intramolecular double C&#9472;N bond formation followed by deselenylation enables a one&#8208;pot skeletal editing of selenadiazole&#8208;fused naphthoquinodimethanes into previously unknown tribenzophenanthroline derivatives, which serve as precursors to fluorescent metal complexes. This transformation involves the disappearance of the original selenadiazole ring containing two nitrogen atoms and the concurrent formation of two new pyridine rings, each containing a single nitrogen atom. This &#8220;heterocyclic segregation (Het&#8208;Seg)&#8221; reaction is triggered by two&#8208;electron oxidation of sterically congested quinodimethane substrates with a folded geometry. The resulting twisted dicationic intermediates are crucial for driving the unique skeletal reorganization.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of NICOL, A Coligand Secreted Protein Mediating Mammalian Male Reproductive Tract Trans&#8208;luminal Signaling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NICOL is a small protein engaged the sperm maturation in the epididymis. The recombinant expression of NICOL is low&#8208;yielding and highly heterogeneous, which retards the precise understanding of the function of NICOL. Therefore, we determined the SS pairings and succeeded in the chemical synthesis of highly pure NICOL, which is useful for the structural and functional analyses of NICOL.

The NELL2&#8208;interacting cofactor for lumicrine signaling (NICOL) is a small protein which forms a complex with the neural epidermal growth factor&#8211;like like 2 (NELL2) and engaged in sperm maturation in the epididymis. At present, the recombinant expression of NICOL is not efficient, which limits the precise understanding of the structure and function of NICOL. In this study, we first succeeded in the chemical synthesis of NICOL with NELL2 binding affinity. The synthesized NICOL possesses correct SS bond pairing, and its secondary structure is indistinguishable from that of the recombinant protein, indicating that the synthetic NICOL will be useful for structural and functional analyses of lumicrine signaling.

&lt;p&gt;NICOL is a small protein engaged the sperm maturation in the epididymis. The recombinant expression of NICOL is low-yielding and highly heterogeneous, which retards the precise understanding of the function of NICOL. Therefore, we determined the SS pairings and succeeded in the chemical synthesis of highly pure NICOL, which is useful for the structural and functional analyses of NICOL.

         <title>Novel Synthesis of the Antifungal Cyclic Lipopeptide Iturin A and Its Fluorinated Analog for Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iturin A is an antifungal lipopeptide with a wide range of applications. In this study, we present a novel synthesis of iturin A via enantiomeric synthesis of the &#946;&#8208;amino fatty acid and on&#8208;resin cyclization. We also obtained the (S)&#8208;epimer of iturin A, showing a dramatic loss of bioactivity, and a monofluorinated analog, which retained the bioactivity of the natural compound and can be a useful fluorine NMR probe for mechanistic studies.








Abstract
The rapid development of antifungal resistance poses a threat to the health and agricultural sectors. Iturin A, a cyclic lipopeptide with pronounced antifungal properties produced by Bacillus sp., holds promise against several pathogens. Here, a novel synthesis of iturin A is presented, which enables access to different analogs for the study of its mode of action. The route includes the enantioselective synthesis of the &#946;&#8208;amino fatty acid present in the lipopeptide structure, followed by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and on&#8208;resin cyclization. This robust synthesis was used to obtain natural iturin A. Furthermore, the synthesis of two analogs is described: an epimer with an inverted stereochemistry of the &#946;&#8208;amino fatty acid, which was designed to shed light on the role of this stereocenter on iturin A's bioactivity, and a monofluorinated analog to assess fluorination's impact on bioactivity and as a fluorine NMR probe for mechanistic studies. Antifungal assays against Candida albicans and Fusarium graminearum showed that the epimer of iturin A lost all bioactivity, while the monofluorinated analog retained the bioactivity of the natural compound, thus confirming its potential as an NMR probe.

         <title>Tuning the 2LMCT Deactivation of Cyclometalated Iron Carbene Complexes with Electronic Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bromo&#8208; or furanyl&#8208;substituents on a cyclometalated iron(III) N&#8208;heterocyclic complex stabilize the 2LMCT state to very different extent. With substantially different 2LMCT energies and lifetimes, the two cases illustrate the balance between non&#8208;radiative deactivation directly to the ground state or via metal&#8208;centered states.








Abstract
FeIII complexes based on the [FeIII(ImP)2]+ motif (ImP&#160;=&#160;bis(2,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenylene)), where the ligand contains both carbene and cyclometalated moieties, are a promising class of photoactive materials made from this abundant metal. In this work, it is shown that bromo or furanyl substituents attached to the cyclometalating moiety of the ImP ligands stabilize the 2LMCT excited state to very different extent resulting in opposing effects on the 2LMCT lifetime. For [FeIII(ImPBr)2]+, the lifetime (255&#160;ps) of its moderately stabilized 2LMCT state (1.85&#160;eV) is slightly increased compared to the parent complex (1.90&#160;eV, 240&#160;ps) pointing to an increased barrier for deactivation via the 4MC state and enabling applications as photoredox catalyst. In contrast, the 2LMCT energy of [FeIII(ImPFur)2]+ is lowered substantially to a value of 1.63&#160;eV due to the extended &#960;&#8208;system of the ligands and the reduced energy gap favors internal conversion directly to the ground state resulting in a considerably reduced 2LMCT lifetime of 59&#160;ps. These findings have general implications for design of ligand modifications aiming at extended LMCT lifetimes and/or modified ground and excited state potentials.

         <title>Layer Sliding&#8208;Induced Fluorescence Changes in a Flexible Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescence color change from blue to green of pyrene&#8208;based HOFs was achieved by the sliding of the H&#8208;bonded 2D network layers. Single&#8208;crystal XRD analysis revealed that the 2D&#8208;layer sliding forms a pyrene dimer, which results in the green color of the HOF emission including the excimer contribution.








Abstract
Flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) capable of changing their fluorescence properties upon structural transformation have gained much attention, while their design strategies have not been established. Herein, we demonstrate that sliding of the robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded 2D layers can induce dynamic emission color changes of HOFs. Layered HOF CP&#8208;tBPy&#8208;1, which is composed of tert&#8208;butylpyrene derivative with four carboxyphenyl groups (CP&#8208;tBPy), transformed to another crystalline form, CP&#8208;tBPy&#8208;2, upon release of guest solvent molecules. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that the sliding of the layers changed the pyrene cores from monomeric to dimeric species, giving rise to fluorescence color changes from blue to green. Fluorescence spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystals microscopy disclosed details of the photobehaviors of these HOFs. These results are the first example of fluorescence changes of HOFs due to sliding of hydrogen&#8208;bonded 2D network layers, providing a new design strategy to construct functional fluorescent porous materials.

A series of Pd(II)&#8208;NHC complexes incorporating &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;methylnaphthyl ligands were synthesized via a simple weak&#8208;base method. The catalytic effects of these ligands were evaluated in Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination, and Miyaura borylation reactions. The &#945;&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;methylnaphthyl variant showed superior performance, particularly in catalyst activation, compared to both the &#946; isomer and cinnamyl&#8208;based analogs.

A series of well&#8208;defined [Pd(NHC)(&#945;/&#946;&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;MeNAP)Br] (MeNAP&#160;=&#160;methylnaphthyl) pre&#8208;catalysts has been synthesized by reacting [Pd(&#945;/&#946;&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;MeNAP)Br]2 and various NHC&#183;HCl precursors in the presence of K2CO3 in acetone. The synthesized Pd(II)&#8208;NHC derivatives displayed good to excellent catalytic activity, and rapid activation in classical Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig, and Miyaura borylation reactions. Additionally, the synthesis of [Pd(IPr)(&#945;&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;MeNAP)Br] (IPr&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) was successfully achieved employing aqueous ammonia as the base.

         <title>Activation of S1PR1 by Ponesimod for Multiple Sclerosis Therapy: Uncovering MAPK and PI3K Pathway Mechanisms and Repurposing Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ponesimod, a selective S1PR1 modulator approved for MS, might activate the S1PR1 by triggering key signaling pathways like MAPK/ERK and PI3K&#8208;Akt to inhibit lymphocyte migration. This work provides new insights into the mechanism of ponesimod in MS treatment and highlights the potential of drug repurposing to advance MS therapy.








Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting over 2 million people globally, primarily causes neurological disability in individuals under 40. This autoimmune disorder involves the immune system attacking the myelin sheath in the central nervous system. Sphingosine&#8208;1&#8208;phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is a promising therapeutic target, with approved drugs like ponesimod acting as S1PR1 agonists. However, the exact mechanism of ponesimod's action on S1PR1 and its therapeutic effects in MS remains unclear. Our study, combining metadynamics, single&#8208;cell transcriptomics, and drug repurposing, shows that ponesimod binds to S1PR1, causing the W2696.48 amino acid to flip downward. This flip weakens interactions within the phosphorylation&#8208;independent binding (PIF) motif while maintaining the N3077.49&#8208;F2656.44 interaction, activating Gi signaling. The downstream effects primarily involve the MAPK/ERK and PI3K&#8208;Akt pathways, which inhibit lymphocyte migration to lymph nodes, a crucial factor in ponesimod's clinical efficacy. Single&#8208;cell transcriptomic analysis further elucidates the regulatory network and pathways modulated by ponesimod in MS. Notably, due to potential hepatotoxicity, we identified valproic acid (VPA) as a potential adjunct therapy through drug repurposing. VPA reduces hepatotoxicity and demonstrates efficacy in treating MS in animal studies. This research provides valuable insights into ponesimod's mechanism in MS treatment and highlights the potential of drug repurposing to improve MS therapy.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Divergent Synthesis of Sulfonylated Dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;Carboxaldehydes and Tricyclic Sulfones via Sulfonyl Radical Source Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insert text for Table of Contents here. This study introduces an environmentally friendly and efficient photocatalytic approach, wherein the sulfonyl radical&#8208;induced cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes facilitates the selective synthesis of sulfonylated dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes and tricyclic benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. The strategy's tunability arises from the sulfonyl radical source, which directs the reaction toward either radical cyclization or cascade cyclization.








Abstract
In this study, we present a green and efficient photocatalytic strategy, where sulfonyl radical&#8208;triggered cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes enables the selective formation of the sulfonylated dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes and tricyclic benzofused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. The switchable nature of the strategy relies on the selective control between radical cyclization and radical cascade cyclization, dictated by the choice of sulfonyl radical source. Under the photocatalytic conditions, selenosulfonates yielded sulfonylated heterocyclic carboxaldehydes, while sodium aryl sulfinates led to the formation of tricyclic benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. Under blue LED irradiation, selenosulfonates generate sulfonyl and phenylselenyl radicals. The sulfonyl radical adds chemoselectively to the alkene, triggering a 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization to form a vinyl radical, which is trapped by the phenylselenyl radical. Oxygen and EY&#8208;Na&#8322; facilitate the conversion of selenosulfonylated intermediates into sulfonylated 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes. A range of 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrrole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxaldehydes was synthesized using the developed method. Sodium aryl sulfinates, under blue LED irradiation and in the presence of 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;Hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol&#160;(HFIP)1,1&#8208;Diphenylethylene, react with 1,6&#8208;enynes to afford tricyclic benzo&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered sulfones. Additionally, the tricyclic sulfone can be readily transformed into a unique bicyclic seven&#8208;membered sulfone bearing an exocyclic double bond. A variety of control experiments was performed, providing important mechanistic understanding of both steps in the transformation.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Structural Determination of the Inositol Glycan Head of Plant Sphingolipid GIPC in Brassicaceae</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first experimental identification of the IG head structure of naturally occurring plant GIPCs in Brassicaceae was achieved through the chemical synthesis of three hexose&#8208;type IGs containing d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, or d&#8208;mannose as the second monosaccharide linked to d&#8208;glucuronic acid&#8208;&#945;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;myo&#8208;inositol. Comparison with synthetic standards using analytical techniques revealed that natural IG from cabbage contains d&#8208;mannose with an &#945;&#8208;glycosidic linkage as the second monosaccharide.








Abstract
Glycosylinositol phosphoceramides (GIPCs), a major class of plant sphingolipids, are key components of the plasma membrane and play important roles in plants. These molecules consist of a ceramide 1&#8208;phosphate tail attached to an inositol glycan (IG) head, which typically contains an d&#8208;glucuronic acid (GlcA)&#8208;&#945;(1&#8594;2)&#8208;myo&#8208;inositol structure. The second monosaccharide linked to the O&#8208;4 position of the GlcA residue differs depending on plant species and cell tissues. In Arabidopsis, the predominant second monosaccharide has been identified as hexose (Hex) using LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. However, the stereochemistry and anomeric configuration of the Hex have not yet been determined using spectroscopic techniques. In this study, we chemically synthesized three different Hex&#8208;type IGs in which the GlcA residue binds to d&#8208;glucose, d&#8208;galactose, or d&#8208;mannose (Man) as the second monosaccharide. Using the synthetic standards, we determined the IG head structure of naturally occurring GIPCs&#160;isolated from cabbage by using several analytical methods. We successfully confirmed that Hex as the second monosaccharide linked to the GlcA residue is d&#8208;Man with an &#945;&#8208;glycosidic bond.

         <title>Engineering Alloxazines by Boron Coordination and Click Chemistry toward Small&#8208;molecule Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of fluorescent molecules inspired by natural cofactors to monitor biological processes carries some intrinsic advantages. This is particularly relevant in the case of redox cofactors with innate fluorescence properties, such as flavins, and synthetic strategies toward their functionalized analogues are of high interest to modulate properties. This work reports easy access to bioinspired fluorescent alloxazines (flavin analogues) with a boron difluorocatecholate moiety and further chemical elaboration through a CuAAC (copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition) click chemistry strategy, which opens the way to easy derivatization and further addressing. This molecular approach provides a design concept that could lead to bimodal probes detectable by fluorescence and 19F NMR spectroscopy.








Abstract
Selective and strategic modification of redox cofactors offers significant advantages for the design of molecular probes, including high compatibility and affinity. This is particularly relevant in the case of redox cofactors with innate fluorescence properties, such as flavins, and synthetic strategies toward their functionalized analogues are of high interest to modulate properties. However, the synthetic elaboration of flavins and their alloxazine isomers still suffers from limitations. We report easy access to bioinspired fluorescent alloxazines with a boron difluorocatecholate moiety and explore the impact of core aromatic substitution on their photophysical properties. Further chemical elaboration through a CuAAC (copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition) click chemistry strategy opens the way to easy derivatization and further addressing.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Single&#8208;Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks: The Use of Modulator for Reversible Bond Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile materials owing to their ordered crystalline structures, tunable topologies, and high surface areas. Accurate structural determination is essential for understanding the correlation between their structural features and physical properties. This review emphasizes recent progress in growing single&#8208;crystalline COFs via modulator&#8208;assisted strategies, enabling SCXRD analysis and expanding their functional applications.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), notable for their well&#8208;organized crystalline structures, varied framework topologies, and large surface areas, have been actively studied for diverse applications. Their distinct properties are related primarily to their crystalline frameworks; therefore, obtaining accurate structural information is important. Notable advances in the structural analysis of COFs using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and Pawley or Rietveld refinement have been made; however, these methods sometimes encounter limitations. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) has been suggested as an alternative technique for obtaining accurate structural information on COFs. However, harvesting COFs of sufficiently high purity and quality, with crystals of sufficient size for SCXRD analysis, is difficult. Significant research on growing single&#8208;crystalline COFs (SC&#8208;COFs) with large crystals using modulators for reversible bond control has recently enabled SCXRD studies. In this review, we introduce various strategies, including molecular design and synthesis methods, for growing SC&#8208;COFs, and highlight several notable examples that leverage precise structural information for specific applications.

         <title>Mechanical Strain&#8208;Controlled Aromaticity in Cyclo[n]Carbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical strain can influence the (anti)aromaticity of C16 and C18 cyclocarbons. While uniaxial tension has a minor weakening effect, radial expansion leads to an almost complete loss of aromaticity in both systems. Radial contraction, especially in C18, significantly enhances aromaticity, offering a strategy for designing more stable cyclocarbons in mechanically interlocked architectures.








Abstract
Cyclocarbons have unique electronic and mechanical properties, but their extreme reactivity makes experimental studies and practical applications highly challenging. In this work, we use molecular modeling to investigate how mechanical strain, including uniaxial tension and radial contraction/expansion, affects the aromaticity of C16 and C18 cyclocarbons. Aromaticity was evaluated using magnetic (NICS, GIMIC) and electronic (&#960;&#8208;EDDB, AV1245) indices to provide a comprehensive assessment. Our results show that uniaxial tension slightly reduces the (anti)aromaticity of both cyclocarbons, with C16 becoming less antiaromatic and C18 less aromatic. Radial expansion leads to almost complete loss of aromaticity, regardless of the initial electronic nature of the cyclocarbon. In turn, radial contraction appears to be an effective approach to enhance electronic delocalization in cyclocarbons, with a particularly notable effect for C18. One of the most significant findings is that an 8% radial contraction transforms moderately aromatic C18 into a highly aromatic system with fully equalized bond lengths, offering a potential strategy for designing more stable cyclocarbon systems within mechanically strained architectures.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermo&#8208;Mechanochemical Syntheses of Metal Phthalocyanines and Polyphthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we report the thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines using a ball mill with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120&#160;&#176;C within 2 h. The parameter screenings revealed an insight into the reactivity of the reaction. Furthermore, various metal centers and building blocks were utilized to emphasize the variability of this approach. Lastly, a crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine was synthesized with&#160;&gt;99% yield.








Abstract
We present a thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines with varying metal centers and building blocks. The reactions were performed using a Retsch Mixer Mill 400 equipped with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120&#160;&#176;C within 2 h. A systematic screening of reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, frequency, and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG), revealed that temperature and time significantly influence the reaction outcome, as well as the use of LAG compared to neat grinding, which further enhances the yield. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the obtained metal phthalocyanines confirmed the presence of different polymorphs, suggesting a correlation between reaction conditions and crystallinity. Furthermore, the crystalline cobalt polyphthalocyanine (CoPPc) was successfully synthesized with a yield of&#160;&gt;99%.

Interaction of a membrane protein of Acinetobacter baumanii with human fibronectin unraveled using &#181;s&#8208;scale molecular dynamic simulations.








Abstract
Bacterial resistance and nosocomial infections are serious threats compromising public health in numerous countries. Acinetobacter baumannii has been identified as one of the most serious pathogens, due to its potential virulence and the development of multiple resistance. In this contribution by using all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulation, we analyze the structure and the properties of the OmpA protein, which is present in the bacterial external membrane. We also analyze the structure of possible protein/protein complexes formed between OmpA and the human fibronectin, which may ultimately lead to the immune escape of the bacteria. We provide a plausible structure of the complex, also identifying suitable amino acids mediating the interaction, and thus, constituting suitable drug targets to disrupt the complex formation.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescent Ru(II) and Os(II) Complexes</title>

Readily&#160;accessed&#160;Ru(II) and Os(II) phenanthroline&#8208;pyridylidene&#160;complexes&#160;exhibited near infrared luminescence up to 840&#160;nm.








Abstract
Two Ru(II) and Os(II) homoleptic complexes based on a phenanthroline&#8208;pyridylidene tridentate ligand have been designed to reach NIR emission by combining strong &#963;&#8208;donation, provided by the unconventional N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) pyridylidene moiety, with the low&#8208;lying &#960;&#8208;accepting phenanthroline scaffold. Detailed experimental and computational investigations of the photophysical properties of this novel family of cyclometallated complexes reveal emission squarely falling in the NIR domain peaking at &#955;em = 790&#160;nm for the Os(II) complex, while emission is hypsochromically shifted at &#955;em = 747&#160;nm for the Ru(II) homologue in deaerated CH3CN solution at room temperature. Despite the triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) nature that characterizes the excited state in both complexes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations allow to ascribe the remarkable optical shift observed in the latter to the larger spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects exerted by the heavier metal.

&lt;p&gt;Two Ru(II) and Os(II) homoleptic complexes based on a phenanthroline-pyridylidene tridentate ligand have been designed to reach NIR emission by combining strong &#963;-donation, provided by the unconventional &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) pyridylidene moiety, with the low-lying &#960;-accepting phenanthroline scaffold. Detailed experimental and computational investigations of the photophysical properties of this novel family of cyclometallated complexes reveal emission squarely falling in the NIR domain peaking at &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt; = 790&#160;nm for the Os(II) complex, while emission is hypsochromically shifted at &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt; = 747&#160;nm for the Ru(II) homologue in deaerated CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN solution at room temperature. Despite the triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;MLCT) nature that characterizes the excited state in both complexes, density functional theory (DFT) calculations allow to ascribe the remarkable optical shift observed in the latter to the larger spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effects exerted by the heavier metal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth La&#8208;modulated NiFeP composites were prepared via a facile co&#8208;precipitation route followed by in situ phosphatization of La&#8208;doped NiFe&#8208;LDH precursors. Benefiting from the optimized electronic structure, the La0.3&#8208;NiFeP catalyst demonstrates remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. In 1&#160;M KOH, this catalyst delivers 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of only 97&#160;mV (HER) and 271&#160;mV (OER), while demonstrating excellent operational durability. When configured as a dual&#8208;electrode water electrolyzer, La0.3&#8208;NiFeP divers overall water splitting at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a low cell voltage of 1.59&#160;V and retains performance for over 24 hours, surpassing most reported transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Mediated Photochemical Reduction of Naphthol to Generate Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excited&#8208;state quenching of 7&#8208;bromonaphthol by ferrocene leads to a reduced naphthol and H2 generation. This simple, and sustainable, system is operational at mild applied potentials under photoelectrochemical conditions.








Abstract
The storage of solar energy in chemical bonds can be achieved utilizing more sustainable first row transition metals and organic compounds. Here we show that the weak acid, 7&#8208;bromonaphthol, can generate H2 upon photoexcitation and subsequent electron transfer mediated by ferrocene under photochemical and photoelectrochemical conditions. Evidence is presented to show that near visible, UV&#8208;light absorption by 7&#8208;bromonapthol generates an excited&#8208;state molecule that is reductively quenched by ferrocene. UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy shows the buildup of ferrocenium, and gas chromatography shows the generation of H2 when an acetonitrile solution of 7&#8208;bromonaphthol and ferrocene are irradiated with 365&#160;nm light. This reactivity can be translated to photoelectrochemical conditions. In the presence of 7&#8208;bromonaphthol in acetonitrile, carbon electrodes modified with ferrocene exhibit higher current responses compared to unmodified carbon electrodes at an applied potential of just &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). These results highlight the ability of ferrocene to mediate electron transfer to the naphthol molecule and the possibility to translate this reactivity into photoelectrochemical devices.

         <title>Mass Spectrometric Studies of Reductive Elimination from Si(IV) Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive elimination of ArO&#9472;H (Ar = aromatic residue) bonds from pentacoordinate SiIV is characterized by mass spectrometric methods. A Hammet study of substituent effects combined with DFT calculations supports a stepwise mechanism involving a loosely bound aryloxide/hydrosilane ion&#8208;molecule complex as an intermediate.








Abstract
Reductive elimination (RE) is one of the most significant obstacles to developing main&#8208;group catalysts for bond coupling processes based on conventional oxidative addition/reductive elimination steps. Here, we report an electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) study demonstrating RE from SiIV hydrosilicates [(tmim)SiH(OArR)]&#8722; (tmimH3 = tris(3&#8208;methylindol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methane) generated in solution by oxidative addition of phenols (ArRO&#9472;H) to an anionic SiII centre (silanide) incorporated in a bicyclic cage structure ([(tmim)Si]&#8722;). The activation energy for the reductive elimination linearly decreased with the increasing electron&#8208;withdrawing character of the aryl substituents, suggesting that a negative charge develops in the para position in the rate&#8208;limiting step (RLS). In agreement with experiments, a DFT study supports an ionic mechanism in which the formation of an ion/molecule complex by transient weakening of the Si&#9472;O bond is the RLS, as would be intuitively expected from the developing negative charge in the para position. This is a rare example of direct observation of reductive elimination from SiIV to SiII and, to our knowledge, the first involving anionic species.

         <title>Optimization of Prodrug Activation by Enzymatic Cleavage of the &#946;&#8208;lactam Ring of Carbapenems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report synthetic routes that yield prodrugs consisting of two carbapenems connected by benzyl carbonate linkers. A mass spectrometry assay was elaborated to monitor, in a single kinetic experiment, the acylation of a bacterial target (a peptidoglycan transpeptidase) by these prodrugs, the resulting cleavage of the linker, and the release of their warhead moiety in an active form.








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics remain the best treatment to fight bacterial infections. Among various antibiotics used today, &#946;&#8208;lactams belonging to the carbapenem class are last resort drugs active against many multiresistant Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Carbapenem antibiotics are prone to hydrolysis by certain &#946;&#8208;lactamases, leading to the opening of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring and drug inactivation. This mechanism can be repurposed for targeted molecular fragmentation. Here, we report the synthesis of model prodrugs consisting of two carbapenems connected by original self&#8208;immolative linkers. A mass spectrometry assay was developed to simultaneously monitor acylation of a &#946;&#8208;lactam target by the prodrugs and by their sacrificial and warhead moieties. The linker connecting the two carbapenems was optimized with respect to prodrug stability and effective release of the activated warhead upon carbapenem ring opening.

         <title>Probing How Anti&#8208;huntingtin Antibodies Bind the Fibrillar Fuzzy Coat Using Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibodies are widely used to recognize, detect, and target aggregated and misfolded amyloid&#8208;forming proteins, including those associated with HD. Studying such interactions on a structural level is a challenge. Parlato and colleagues report on their use of solid&#8208;state NMR and electron microscopy to probe how such antibodies bind to the fuzzy coat of HTT fibrils, modulating their structure and supramolecular assembly.








Abstract
Antibodies are critical for the immune response and serve as important tools due to their ability to recognize specific amino acid sequences, or epitopes. Based on the latter, they are utilized as diagnostic tools in biological and biomedical research. Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative condition caused by CAG repeat expansions in the huntingtin (HTT) gene and characterized by amyloid&#8208;like protein deposits in patients. Multiple anti&#8208;HTT antibodies are used in HD research for their ability to recognize specific HTT inclusions in both post&#8208;mortem tissue and in laboratory conditions. Some of the antibodies are seen as detectors of distinct structural motifs. However, most knowledge of their binding mechanism stems from studies of soluble monomers or short fragments of the epitopes, rather than the aggregated, misfolded target protein. Here, we investigate how MW8 antibodies interact with HTT exon 1 (HTTex1) fibrils, using solid&#8208;state NMR, electron microscopy, and complementary techniques. Magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR revealed localized impacts of the antibody on exposed parts of the HTTex1 fibrils: the flanking segments that form its &#8220;fuzzy coat&#8221;. Antibody binding affected the structure and dynamics of the fuzzy coat, but also modulated the propensity for forming supramolecular fibril clusters, which has important implications for (reducing) cytotoxicity.

&lt;p&gt;Antibodies are widely used to recognize, detect, and target aggregated and misfolded amyloid-forming proteins, including those associated with HD. Studying such interactions on a structural level is a challenge. Parlato and colleagues report on their use of solid-state NMR and electron microscopy to probe how such antibodies bind to the fuzzy coat of HTT fibrils, modulating their structure and supramolecular assembly.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies are critical for the immune response and serve as important tools due to their ability to recognize specific amino acid sequences, or epitopes. Based on the latter, they are utilized as diagnostic tools in biological and biomedical research. Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative condition caused by CAG repeat expansions in the huntingtin (HTT) gene and characterized by amyloid-like protein deposits in patients. Multiple anti-HTT antibodies are used in HD research for their ability to recognize specific HTT inclusions in both post-mortem tissue and in laboratory conditions. Some of the antibodies are seen as detectors of distinct structural motifs. However, most knowledge of their binding mechanism stems from studies of soluble monomers or short fragments of the epitopes, rather than the aggregated, misfolded target protein. Here, we investigate how MW8 antibodies interact with HTT exon 1 (HTTex1) fibrils, using solid-state NMR, electron microscopy, and complementary techniques. Magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR revealed localized impacts of the antibody on exposed parts of the HTTex1 fibrils: the flanking segments that form its &#8220;fuzzy coat&#8221;. Antibody binding affected the structure and dynamics of the fuzzy coat, but also modulated the propensity for forming supramolecular fibril clusters, which has important implications for (reducing) cytotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design and Mechanistic Insights Into Transition Metal&#8208;Based Spin&#8208;Modulated Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although numerous theories have been widely applied to explain the enhanced OER activity, the mechanism involving spin configurations that tune the OER process remains unclear. This short review highlights some recent advances in understanding spin&#8208;modulated oxygen evolution of transition metal&#8208;based catalysts and provides insights into the fundamentals of the spin effect and design strategies for spin&#8208;modulated OER catalysts.








Abstract
Harnessing secondary energy sources for water electrolysis to generate &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; is instrumental in constructing a zero&#8208;carbon&#8208;emission hydrogen value chain. However, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) presents a bottleneck due to its complex four&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Investigation of high&#8208;performance anodic OER catalysts has developed into a hot research field. The high kinetic barrier associated with OER is strongly linked to the interplay between the singlet state of OH&#8722;/H2O and the triplet state of O2, this interconversion process is significantly influenced by the spin states of metal centers in catalysts. In this short review, the fundamental mechanisms of spin effects in oxygen evolution are briefly discussed with respect to the thermodynamics, active species formation, and reaction mechanisms. In addition, the recent approaches to modulate spin configuration of electrocatalysts are summarized, such as lattice substitution, defect engineering, interface regulation, ligand adsorption, and size modulation. In the last section, the challenges and perspectives for future development of spin&#8208;related catalysis are discussed, aiming to provide insights into spin effects in water oxidation and guidance for designing efficient OER catalysts.

         <title>Nanobodies in Immunoanalysis: From Molecular Engineering to Advanced Detection Strategies for Foodborne Natural Toxins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a bottom&#8208;to&#8208;top overview of emerging nanobody&#8208;based immunoassays, from fundamental nanobodies to advanced applications in natural toxin detection.








Abstract
Natural toxins in food pose significant health risks, such as cancer, deformities, etc., demanding efficient and accurate surveillance techniques. Immunoassays become reliable alternatives to traditional chromatographic technologies for rapid, routine, and large&#8208;scale detection of natural toxins, but their performance depends highly on antibodies used, which are limited by stability issues and productions challenge. Nanobodies (Nbs) overcome these limitations, enhancing immunoassay sensitivity, specificity, and practicality for low&#8208;abundance toxin detection due to their good penetration/binding ability, inherent stability, and scalable production. This review offers a comprehensive, bottom&#8208;to&#8208;top overview of emerging Nb&#8208;based immunoassays, from foundational Nbs to advanced applications in natural toxin detection. The bioactivity of Nbs was summarized, focusing on their structural and functional characteristics critical for advancing immunoassays. Subsequently, the advanced methods for their screening, expression, and purification were outlined. Based on the natural toxins they target, both conventional and innovative Nb&#8208;based immunoassays are reviewed, in which corresponding Nbs modification strategies are highlighted for improving the affinity and sensitivity. The current challenges, potential strategies, and future opportunities for developing and applying Nb&#8208;based immunoassays are also discussed in natural toxin detection. This review, bridging fundamental Nb advances and immunoassay innovation, offers valuable perspectives to guide future development of Nb&#8208;based detection platforms.

         <title>Clickable Pyclen&#8208;Based Luminescent Lanthanide Complexes: Application to Two&#8208;Photon Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents two pyclen&#8208;based lanthanide complexes (Eu3+ and Sm3+) bearing an alkynyl&#8208;linker dedicated to bioconjugation. Featuring strong luminescence and two&#8208;photon (2P) absorption, they were conjugated to a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide thanks to copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. The resulting luminescent conjugates reach efficiently the cytosol of living HeLa cells and allow two&#8208;photon microscopy imaging at low concentrations, down to 50&#160;nM&#160;in the case of Eu3+.








Abstract
Lanthanide luminescent bioprobes incorporating a reactive group for the functionalization of biomolecules via click chemistry are of high interest for the straightforward preparation of smart luminescent tools for biological imaging and sensing applications. This article describes the synthesis and the photophysical properties of two lanthanide complexes based on the pyclen macrocycle bearing a terminal alkyne group on its pyridine moiety and a 4&#8208;(4&#8208;alkylthiophenyl)picolinate charge transfer chromophore to sensitize the lanthanide luminescence. The Eu3+ and Sm3+ complexes show excellent two&#8208;photon absorption and emission properties. These complexes were conjugated to a cell penetrating peptide bearing an azide via copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition. The resulting conjugates exhibit luminescence properties comparable to those of the parent alkyne&#8208;complex. Two&#8208;photon microscopy imaging of live HeLa cells was performed with both the Eu3+ and the Sm3+ conjugates. These bioprobes are efficiently delivered to the cytosol of the living cells. The Eu3+ luminescence was detected in cells even at very low incubation concentration (50&#160;nM) and the Sm3+ complex gave excellent quality images despite a low emission quantum yield (&lt; 1&#160;%).

         <title>A Water Stable U(IV) Complex Based on a Macrocyclic Ligand Displaying NIR Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;stable U(IV) complex is obtained by coordination of U(IV) with a nonadentate macrocyclic ligand based on a triazacyclononane platform. The U(IV) cation is fully protected from coordination of water molecules, and upon excitation into the UV&#8208;Visible region, the complex displays an unprecedented NIR emission from U(IV).








Abstract
Complexation of U(IV) by encapsulation into the cavity of a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclonane (tacn) macrocycle functionalized by phosphonated pyridyl arms affords a water&#8208;stable and soluble [U(IV)L] complex. The coordination process was monitored by electronic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption spectroscopy and the corresponding complex was characterized by 1H&#8208;, 13C&#8208; and 31P&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and by mass spectrometry. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling shows the cation to be embedded into the cavity of the nonadentate ligand, as confirmed by analysis of the paramagnetic contributions of U(IV) on the chemical shifts of the proton nuclei. This effective chelation enabled the observation of a broad NIR emission band centered at 1080&#160;nm observed for the first time in addition to UV&#8208;visible emission arising from the U(IV) cation upon electronic excitation in the UV&#8208;blue region. The [U(IV)L] complex was shown to be hydrolytically stable for several weeks in aqueous solutions over a broad range of pH values (from 1.6 to 10) under aerobic conditions.

Peptide&#8208;based cationic [2]catenanes are resistant to proteases and efficiently complex siRNA, providing protection from degradation by nucleases.








Abstract
Cationic [2]catenanes bearing l&#8208;arginine residues were synthesized via dynamic covalent self&#8208;assembly in water. These peptide&#8208;based mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) exhibit proteolytic stability, efficiently complex small&#8208;interfering RNA (siRNA), and protect it from nuclease degradation. Their performance in siRNA binding is attributed to multivalency and preorganization enforced by the mechanical bond.

         <title>From Ketoesters, Diynes, and Arynes to Functionalized Pyranones, Naphthalenes, and Anthracenes</title>

A novel, regioselective approach enabling the synthesis of aryl&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;arenes, including naphthalene and anthracene derivatives, via tandem [2&#160;+&#160;1&#160;+&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1] and subsequent [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloadditions, has been discovered. The first step provides new 2&#8208;pyranones characterized by extensive conjugation as well as tunable optical and electrochemical properties. This approach opens new paths for further transformation of both pyranones and arenes.








Abstract
This study aimed to create new possibilities in the syntheses of aryl&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;naphthalene and anthracene derivatives. Starting from simple structures, i.e., &#223;&#8208;ketoesters, 1,4&#8208;di(aryl, heteroaryl)buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diynes, and arynes, via 5&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;(arylethynyl)pyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones, the target structures were successfully obtained by a simple procedure (in a one&#8208;pot or a two&#8208;step version). On the way to the final structures, an innovative and very effective synthetic method for obtaining aryl&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones was developed. This unprecedented procedure turned out to be fully regioselective, namely only 5&#8208;aryl&#8208;4&#8208;(arylethynyl)&#8208;3,6&#8208;dimethylpyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones were obtained in the reaction involving ethyl 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxobutanoate and 1,4&#8208;diarylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyne mediated by a Re&#8208;catalyst. It seems that steric effects associated with the Re&#9472;C and C&#9472;C bond lengths play a decisive role with regard to the regioselectivity. Importantly, the aforementioned procedure is very simple, which makes it completely different from the only previously described procedure dedicated to structurally similar pyranones. Undoubtedly, such substituted 2&#8208;pyranones, naphthalenes, and anthracenes are practically unavailable via any other way, especially via such a simple and convenient synthetic route. All the newly obtained aryl&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;ones and aryl&#8208;arylethynyl&#8208;arenes were fully characterized, including DFT calculations and thermal, optical, and electrochemical properties. The presence of a triple bond in the obtained compounds definitely changes their properties, especially in comparison to structures without a triple bond.

         <title>Boron Cluster Functionalization: From Vertex&#8208;Specific Modifications to Boron Cage Extension</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D extended molecular systems constructed from boron clusters have attracted considerable attention owing to their unique structures and properties. Recent advances in functionalizing boron clusters, particularly through methodologies such as boron cage extension to create hybrid polycyclic conjugates, have been reviewed. These studies present new synthetic strategies for assembling the intricate molecular architectures, while also emphasizing their potential in driving innovations across materials science and chemistry.








Abstract
Polycyclic molecular systems, which play a crucial role in the fields of materials science and pharmacology, typically consist of 2D extended organic aromatic rings. Extensive research has been conducted on conjugates formed through &#960;&#8208;extension, leading to substantial advancements in the field. However, further exploration of novel conjugate systems is essential. This is necessary to enhance structural diversity and facilitate the development of advanced applications. Boron clusters, such as carboranes, are 3D aromatic structures featuring multiple C/B&#8211;H bonds. The functionalization of these C/B&#8211;H bonds offers a pathway for constructing a diverse array of carborane derivatives. In recent years, the extension of boron cages through the functionalization of boron clusters to generate hybrid polycyclic conjugates has attracted significant attention due to the promising properties and applications of these molecules. This review highlights the progress in boron cage modifications and boron cage extension over the past few years. It focuses on synthetic strategies and structure&#8208;property relationships of these hybrid conjugates.

         <title>Gold Nanocluster&#8208;Based Luminescence Microcomposites by Interfacial Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent gold nanoclusters were spontaneously adsorbed at the oil/water interfaces, functioning as monomers in conjunction with hexamethylene diisocyanate during interfacial polymerization. This process results in the formation of gold nanocluster&#8208;based luminescence microcomposites. By incorporating appropriate dyes into the cavities, it is possible to achieve tunable luminescent colors, including the production of white light.








Abstract
Controlled interfacial polymerization in conventional or Pickering emulsions enables the precise fabrication of cavity&#8208;like architectures, providing a versatile platform for the composite construction. Fluorescent gold nanoclusters, acting as interfacial stabilizers, not only enhance emulsion stability but also simultaneously impart luminescent properties to the resulting composites. In this study, modified gold nanoclusters were used as one of the monomers in the interfacial polymerization process to prepare emulsions with fluorescent properties. These gold nanoclusters were localized on the droplet surfaces, forming spherical shell structures. To further enhance the functionality of these structures, we incorporated an additional fluorescent dye as a filler within the spherical shells, resulting in microcomposites with unique optical characteristics. The combination of two luminophores produced white luminescence, which could shift to different colors depending on the incident light. This innovative approach offers new possibilities for applications of advanced optical technologies.

A heavy&#8208;atom free BODIPY photosensitizer localizing in the endoplasmic reticulum that efficiently generates singlet&#8208;oxygen causing cell death upon light activation.








Abstract
The organelle&#8208;localized photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become a promising strategy for efficient cancer treatment. The photogeneration of reactive oxygen species in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to lipid oxidation and causes cell apoptosis or necrosis. However, most of the commercially available ER&#8208;localized phototherapeutic agents exhibit dark cytotoxicity related to the presence of heavy atoms. In this contribution, we developed a novel heavy&#8208;atom free BODIPY photosensitizer that localizes selectively in the ER with good biocompatibility, small dark cytotoxicity and efficient singlet oxygen generation, causing cellular death in a PDT experiment. The molecular design of the BODIPY PS involves two key elements: (i) replacing of the common BF2 group with the 9&#8208;borafluorene which strongly enhances intersystem crossing to the triplet state responsible for photogeneration of singlet oxygen, and (ii) introduction of the pendant coumarin group ensuring ER&#8208;localization and serving as light&#8208;harvesting antenna for energy transfer to BODIPY core structure. The localization of BODIPY&#8208;based PS was confirmed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) imaging, and co&#8208;staining revealed strong localization within the ER.

Chiral dominance observed in binary assemblies composed of dibenzoyl&#8208;substituted tartaric acid (a1) and enantiomeric pyridine derivatives (R/S&#8208;py). Protonation of R/S&#8208;py enables a1 to override co&#8208;assembly chirality via in situ cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, inducing stereoconfiguration&#8208;locked H&#8208;aggregates.








Abstract
Controlling supramolecular chirality in multicomponent systems remains a significant challenge due to competing stereochemical interactions. In this study, we report a case of competitive chiral dominance in binary co&#8208;assemblies composed of enantiomeric tartaric acid derivatives (a1 and a2) and enantiomeric pyridine derivatives (R/S&#8208;py). The dibenzoyl&#8208;substituted tartaric acid (a1) is capable of overriding the chirality of the co&#8208;assemblies by protonating the chiral pyridines to form pyridinium&#8211;carboxylate pairs. This interaction induces in situ cation&#8211;&#960; interactions, leading to the formation of stereoconfiguration&#8208;locked H&#8208;aggregates. In contrast, the pivaloyl&#8208;substituted tartaric acid (a2) exhibits chirality bias governed by the enantiopure pyridine derivatives, attributed to its increased steric bulk and the absence of cation&#8211;&#960; interactions. These findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of stereochemical communication but also offer a new strategy for controlling hierarchical chirality in complex supramolecular systems.

Palladium&#8208;catalyzed non&#8208;directed C&#9472;H alkenylation of simple arenes with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrene derivatives is accomplished using 2&#8208;pyridone ligands, which significantly enhances both yield and selectivity.

Abstract
Herein, we report the palladium&#8208;catalyzed non&#8208;directed C&#9472;H functionalization reaction of simple arenes with &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrene derivatives.

Overall, a robust reaction is developed as described by a sensitivity screening. Detailed experimental studies on the reaction were performed to further understand the mechanism.

         <title>Conformational Transition of Viral Nucleic Acids in a Capsid&#8208;Like Confined Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viruses encapsulate their nucleic acids within the confined ionic environment of the capsid that can be mimicked using reverse micelles (RMs). Smaller RMs preferentially stabilize the G&#8208;quadruplex structure, whereas larger RMs shift the equilibrium toward the hairpin conformation. Understanding this conformational transition provides a novel strategy for modulating regulatory mechanisms of viral genes and their impact on viral gene expression.








Abstract
Nucleic acid molecules within viral genomes can fold into noncanonical structures, such as G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), which play crucial roles in regulating viral gene expression. These genomes are confined within capsid environments that vary in dimensions and ionic compositions. Structural transitions in RNA or DNA within these confined environments are essential for modulating viral biological functions; however, these transitions remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that an RNA sequence derived from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV&#8208;1) genome adopts a dynamic equilibrium between G4 and hairpin (Hp) structures modulated by ionic conditions. The equilibrium shifts toward the G4 conformation in the presence of potassium (K&#8314;) and magnesium (Mg2&#8314;) ions. Using reverse micelles (RMs) as mimetics of the intracapsid environment, we showed that the size of the RM water pool influences significantly this equilibrium: smaller water pools favor G4 formation, whereas larger pools prefer the Hp structure owing to variations in the dielectric constant. Notably, the addition of Mg2&#8314; ions alters the size&#8208;dependent effects of RMs by stabilizing the G4 structure. These findings highlight the critical roles of environmental confinement and ionic conditions in regulating viral RNA structural dynamics, offering new insights into RNA&#8208;based regulatory mechanisms and their impact on viral gene expression.

         <title>A Polymer&#8208;Oriented Synthesis Of Triazinyl Functionalized Mesoporous Organic Polymer Encapsulating Uitrafine Metal Clusters for Alkynes Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

A polymer&#8208;oriented synthesis strategy is firstly proposed for the synthesis of triazinyl functionalized mesoporous organic polymer. Pd@TRI&#8208;MOP exhibits exceptional catalytic performance in semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes.








Abstract
Preparation of highly dispersed ultrafine metal clusters (MCs)&#8208; based catalysts with good stability and preeminent catalytic performance is a challenging problem for heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we design and controllably synthesize a triazinyl functionalized mesoporous organic polymer (TRI&#8208;MOP) through a polymer&#8208;oriented synthesis strategy using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as pore&#8208;forming agent. The obtained TRI&#8208;MOP material possesses abundant worm&#8208;like mesopores, rich triazinyl groups, and high stability. Ultrafine Pd clusters with a small size (&#8776;0.76&#160;nm) are successfully anchored in the mesoporous channel of TRI&#8208;MOP by a simple impregnation&#8208;reduction approach. The as&#8208;prepared Pd@TRI&#8208;MOP catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity (96%) and selectivity (97%) in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene under very mild reaction conditions. The exceptional performance of Pd@TRI&#8208;MOP catalyst is attributed to the small size effect of Pd clusters, the electron coupling effect between the supports and the Pd and enriched meso&#8208;scaled pores. Therefore, this work provides a new platform for designing and preparing stable functional porous organic polymer materials to confine size&#8208;controlled MCs with superior catalytic performance for diversified potential catalysis applications.

         <title>Tuning the Transparency and Exciton Transition of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D Type Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Literature&#8208;based molecule preselection has been combined with TDDFT calculations to enhance the discovery of transparent organic small molecules. 54 candidates featuring a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D architecture were identified, and 24 molecules were selected for synthesis based on their favorable transparency. Among them, 6 molecules exhibit broad optical windows with selective absorption in the UV and NIR regions.








Abstract
Organic small molecules possess significant potential for semitransparent optoelectronic applications due to their tunable optical properties and inherent transparency. However, tailoring these materials is challenging as their optoelectronic properties are sensitive to subtle structural changes, compounded by the existence of over a million potential structural designs. To address these complexities, we present a material discovery workflow that combines literature&#8208;based molecule preselection with TDDFT calculations, creating customized small molecule structures with adjustable transparency windows. We identified fifty&#8208;four small molecules with a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D architecture, incorporating nine central (A) and six end (D) units connected by a thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge. Through TDDFT calculations, we determined the theoretical absorption spectra and energy levels of the identified molecules. Ultimately, we synthesized twenty&#8208;four molecules that exhibit promising transparency properties by selectively absorbing photons in the ultraviolet (UV) and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions, with a significant optical transmission band relevant to the visible spectrum, which we will refer to as &#8220;optical window&#8221;. Characterization of the resultant small molecules revealed that six of them, in particular, exhibited selective absorption with the broadest &#8220;optical window&#8221;. We believe that our study will provide valuable insights to establish an effective material discovery workflow for highly transparent conjugated organic small molecules.

Although octupolar and quadrupolar DMAQ&#8208;derived probes showed superior &#949; and two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) values relative to the dipolar one (1), the fragmentation efficiency exhibited inverse trend, and 1 emerged as the most effective caging group achieving Q&#160;=&#160;12% quantum yield with &#963;2&#160;=&#160;86 GM and uncaging cross&#8208;section &#948;u&#160;=&#160;10.2 GM at 735&#160;nm.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;branched probes based on 2&#8208;hydroxymethylene 8&#8208;dimethylaminoquinoline (8&#8208;DMAQ) and triphenylamine (TPA) have been synthesized and compared under UV and femtosecond near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon (2P) activation conditions. While octupolar (3) and quadrupolar (2) DMAQ derivatives showed superior &#949; and 2P absorption cross&#8208;section (&#963;2) values relative to the dipolar (1) probe, the fragmentation efficiency exhibited an inverse correlation with the enhanced absorption. Compound 1 emerged as the most effective probe reported to date for the release of organic substrates under both UV and 2P activation conditions at wavelengths accessible to commercially available lasers, achieving a quantum yield (Q) of 12% with &#963;2&#160;=&#160;86 GM and uncaging cross&#8208;section &#948;u&#160;=&#160;10.2 GM at 735&#160;nm.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Guided Control of Azoarene Photoswitching: Tuning Excited&#8208;State Energies Through Electronic Property Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photophysical properties of ortho&#8208;tellurium&#8208;substituted azoarenes are tunable via aryl substituent electronics and tellurium oxidation state. Electron&#8208;donating groups destabilize the excited state three&#8208;electron &#963; bond, enhancing photoisomerization. Oxidation removes the tellurium lone pair required for the described interaction, further boosting switching.








Abstract
In recent years, chalcogen bonding has emerged as a promising alternative to classical supramolecular interactions such as hydrogen or halogen bonds. While its behavior in the electronic ground state has been extensively studied, its role in the excited state is gaining increasing attention. We recently demonstrated that the lack of photoswitchability of ortho&#8208;tellurated azobenzenes is due to an excitation&#8208;induced conversion of the classical chalcogen bond into a more pronounced, electron&#8208;rich three&#8208;electron &#963; bond. This transformation significantly strengthens the interaction between the chalcogen and the Lewis base center, effectively preventing isomerization. Based on these findings, we have now investigated the photoswitching behavior of ortho&#8208;tellurium&#8208;substituted azoarenes by modulation of the electronic properties of the aryl substituent and the oxidation state of the tellurium center. Our results show that electron&#8208;donating groups destabilize the excited&#8208;state geometry associated with the formation of a three&#8208;electron &#963; bond, thereby restoring photoisomerizability. Furthermore, oxidation to the Te(IV) species disrupts this bonding interaction, leading to significantly enhanced photoswitching properties. Together, these findings provide valuable design principles for the development of multiresponsive molecular switches based on chalcogen bonding and excited&#8208;state control.

         <title>Polarization and Dipole Moment Effects on Sigma&#8208;Hole Potential in Tin(IV)&#8208;Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through this work with experimental and computational studies we have systematically investigated the role of interplay of electronic effects such as polarization, dipole moment and resonance on the sigma&#8208;hole potential in macrocyclic system like, metalloporphyrin system. The behavior of the sigma&#8208;hole potential of equatorial iodine atom of metalloporphyrin has been studied upon changing substituted ligands at axial position in metalloporphyrin.








Abstract
This study investigates how electron&#8208;withdrawing substitution, molecular polarization, and dipole moment influence the &#963;&#8208;hole potential in six&#8208;coordinate metalloporphyrins. To evaluate halogen bonding tendencies, we synthesized a series of five Sn(IV)&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;iodophenyl)porphyrin complexes with various fluorinated phenolate axial ligands. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed distinct halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular motifs, which vary depending on the degree of fluorination at the axial ligands. Our findings highlight the critical role of ligand&#8208;induced polarization and dipole moment variations in modulating the &#963;&#8208;hole characteristics of the equatorial iodine atoms. Computational modelling showed that increased fluorine substitution reduces both the atomic dipole moments of fluorine and the polarizability of the central tin ion. However, despite these changes, the axial fluorination has a negligible effect on the &#963;&#8208;hole potential at the iodine atoms. This limited influence is attributed to the orthogonal orientation between the porphyrin core and the peripheral phenyl rings, which suppresses resonance interactions. Overall, this work emphasizes the importance of understanding electronic effects at the molecular level, particularly in the design and formation of halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular architectures.

         <title>Base&#8208;Assisted Formation of Ferryl Species from TMC with Pendant N&#8208;Methylimidazole: Ligand and Base Effects on FeIV&#8208;Oxo Generation via O&#8208;O Bond Heterolysis</title>

[FeIV(O)(TMC&#8208;NMe&#8208;im)]2+ (2) was characterized by spectroscopy and crystallography. It forms via PhIO or H2O2 under weak to strong basic conditions. Replacing N&#8208;methylimidazole with pyridine doubles the FeIV&#8208;oxo formation rate. Eyring analysis of forming [FeIV(O)(TMC&#8208;NMe&#8208;im)]2+ (2) and [FeIV(O)(TMC&#8208;py)]2+ (4) suggests a heterolytic O&#8211;O bond cleavage mechanism.








Abstract
FeIV&#8208;oxo species can be generated using hydrogen peroxide via peroxidases, where the iron heme active site has a trans&#8208;imidazole. Here, we report the synthesis of FeII(TMC) complexes bearing pendant N&#8208;methylimidazole or pyridine donors using a modified reductive amination method. The structural characterization of complex 1 using ESI&#8208;Ms spectrometry, 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry (&#964;&#160;=&#160;0.45). The Fe&#8211;Nimidazole bond to N&#8208;methylimidazole was significantly shorter (2.066(6)&#160;&#197;) than that to pyridine (2.112&#160;&#197;), indicating stronger electron donation from N&#8208;methylimidazole. For complex 2, the corresponding FeIV&#8208;oxo species was successfully generated using iodosylbenzene (PhIO)/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and characterized by UV&#8211;vis, 1H&#8208;NMR, FTIR spectroscopy, ESI&#8208;Ms spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The second&#8208;order rate constants (k2) of 2 with CHD and PPh3. are 0.14(0) and 0.50(1)&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, respectively. In addition, the Kinetic analysis demonstrated a 1000&#8208;fold increase in the FeIV&#8208;oxo formation rate (kobs&#160;= 1.1(1)&#215;10&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for 2; 2.7(2)&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for 4) when 2,6&#8208;lutidine was replaced with triethylamine in the presence of H2O2. Eyring analysis revealed a heterolytic O&#8211;O bond cleavage mechanism for H2O2 (&#916;H&#8225;&#160;= 19(1)&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1, &#916;S&#8225;&#160;= &#8722;197(4)&#160;J/mol&#160;K for 2; &#916;H&#8225;&#160;= 18(0)&#160;kJ/mol, &#916;S&#8225;&#160;= &#8722;188(2)&#160;J&#160;mol&#8722;1K&#8722;1 for 4).

         <title>Amorphous Nickel Hydroxide Shell Encloses the Nickel Sulfide for Electrochemical Water Oxidation at Low Overpotential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NiSx/Ni(OH)2 catalyst with an amorphous/crystalline heterointerface was fabricated via precise phase modulation. The Ni(OH)2 shell coating significantly boosts catalytic activity, enhances long&#8208;term stability, and improves overall performance compared to pristine NiSx.








Abstract
Despite the remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance demonstrated by transition metal sulfides, their practical application in overall water splitting remains constrained by insufficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, particularly under alkaline conditions. This limitation primarily arises from unstable active sites and sluggish reaction kinetics at high oxidation potentials. To address these challenges, we present a novel heterostructure engineering strategy through gradient phase control. The core innovation of this work lies in the construction of a unique amorphous/crystalline heterointerface through precise phase modulation. Our hierarchical architecture features phase&#8208;mixed nickel sulfides of NiS and Ni3S2 (use NiSx abbreviation) encapsulated by an amorphous Ni(OH)2 shell. In which the NiSx provides rapid electron transport channels, and the amorphous shell serves as both protective and activation functions through dynamically reconfigurable surface coordination. As expected, the synthesized NiSx/Ni(OH)2 catalyst achieved excellent performance, it achieves a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 at only 160&#160;mV overpotential, significantly outperforming its precursor materials, Ni(OH)&#8322; (446&#160;mV) and NiSx (212&#160;mV). More significantly, the catalyst demonstrates exceptional operational stability with&#160;&lt;&#160;2% activity decay during prolonged 200&#8208;h continuous electrolysis. This provides a new way to commercialize non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts instead of precious metal catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis and Self&#8208;Assembly of a Discotic Oligo&#8208;Carboxylate Tetra&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Perylenebisimide Amphiphile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the synthesis of a new amphiphilic tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;porphyrin PBI pentad. The pentads are characterized by quenching of the fluorescence emission, indicating efficient photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer. The amphiphiles show solubility in basic aqueous solutions of THF, where high water contents lead to a PBI&#8208;centered aggregation. TEM imaging reveals the morphology as randomly coiled sheets consisting out of highly regular assemblies.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of an amphiphilic tetra&#8208;porphyrin perylenebisimide (PBI) conjugate via four&#8208;fold Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling at the PBI ortho&#8208;position. Oligo&#8208;carboxylate Newkome&#8208;type G1 dendrons attached at the porphyrin periphery serve as polar head groups. Theoretical modelling corroborated the assumed planar discotic geometry. The amphiphile is very soluble in mixtures of basic water and THF, where it displays strong aggregation at high water content. Insights into the self&#8208;assembly process were obtained by tracking the individualization through THF addition using UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy. Here, a PBI&#8208;centred aggregation motif becomes evident. Further evaluation of the morphology via STEM and TEM imaging reveals that the assembly is guided by hydrophobic interactions as well as interactions of the carboxylates. These ortho&#8208;linked tetra&#8208;porphyrin PBI architectures fill a gap within the known families of porphyrin&#8208;PBI conjugates. Furthermore, the amphiphile is a valuable addition to the library of amphiphilic porphyrin&#8208;PBI conjugates, representing a discotic counterpart to the known calamitic architectures.

         <title>Mono&#8208; IrIII versus Heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;AuI Complexes for Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two enantiopure heterobimetallic complexes, namely &#916;&#8208;IrAu&#8208;4 and &#923;&#8208;IrAu&#8208;4, have been synthesized. The photophysical and chiroptical properties were characterized and compared with the archetypal &#923;/&#916;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac), highlighting an increase in gLum value moving from mono&#8208; to heterobimetallic Ir(III) complexes. This work provides valuable insights on the design of better and more efficient CPL&#8208;active complexes and materials for CP&#8208;optoelectronics.








Abstract
Fundamental rationalization of the structural&#8212;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity relationship is a challenging task. Herein, a pair of enantiopure, heterobimetallic IrIII&#9472;AuI complexes IrAu&#8208;4 featuring chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is thoroughly investigated by means of spectroscopical and computational techniques, also including spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects. Upon resolution of the racemic mixture of the starting chloro&#8208;bridged dimer via a chiral auxiliary ligand, the complexes IrIII&#9472;AuI are straightforwardly prepared in a stepwise procedure with retention of configuration in good yields. The IrAu&#8208;4 complexes display moderate orange phosphorescence arising from an admixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT/3LLCT) excited state and good chiroptical activity, as shown by both electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and CPL spectroscopy. A comparison between the parental mononuclear pairs &#916;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac) and &#923;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac) and the binuclear IrAu&#8208;4 counterparts also provides interesting insights. The latter possess higher dissymmetry factor (gLum) values despite the very similar ECD activity of the lower&#8208;lying 1MLCT band with enantiospecific polarization bias of the light dictated by the chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal configuration. The different nature of the emissive excited state between the two families of complexes and its implication onto the radiative rate constant and the dipolar force is tentatively accounted for the increased CPL&#8208;activity observed in IrAu&#8208;4.

         <dc:description>
The arene&#8208;encapsulated M+ cations of the group 1 alumanyls, [{SiNDipp}AlM]2 ({SiNDipp} = {CH2SiMe2N(Dipp)}2; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3); M&#160;=&#160;Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs] may be interconverted by redox reactions with the elemental alkali metals. These observations contradict the established E0 data and allow access to an otherwise inaccessible sodium derivative.

&lt;p&gt;Rationalized by a thermochemical evaluation using both theoretical density functional theory (DFT) and empirical data, we show that the arene-encapsulated M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cations of the group 1 alumanyls, [{SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;}AlM]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ({SiN&lt;sup&gt;Dipp&lt;/sup&gt;} = {CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N(Dipp)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;); M&#160;=&#160;Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs] may be interconverted by redox reactions with the elemental alkali metals. These observations contradict the established &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; data and allow access to an otherwise inaccessible sodium derivative.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatially Coordinated Delivery of siRNA and Peptide Antagonist by Using Quantum Dots for Synergetic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Quantum dots (QDs) facilitate ElP103&#8208;mediated siEZH2 delivery by forming RPQDs, which enhance cellular uptake and promote efficient lysosomal escape.








Abstract
We present in this work a quantum&#8208;dot (QDs)&#8208;based delivery strategy for siRNA which shows pronounced improvements of stability against enzymatic degradation by ribonucleases, cellular uptake due to positively charge, and release from endosomes. The introduction of RNA&#8208;binding peptide to the QDs surface enables the dual delivery of the siRNA&#8208;peptide assembly. Briefly, EZH2&#8208;targeting peptide (EIP103) was first introduced to QDs surface via biotin&#8208;streptavidin interaction (PQDs), followed by incubation of siRNA that silences EZH2 (siEZH2). The self&#8208;assembly of EIP103 and siEZH2 on the QDs surface (RPQDs) was achieved via electrostatic attraction between the cationic EIP103 and the negatively charged siEZH2. The results revealed that the obtained RPQDs not only protect both EIP103 peptides and siEZH2 from enzymatic hydrolysis but also promote their endocytosis and endosome escape. This study demonstrates the feasibility of dual delivery and targeting of peptides and siRNA, offering a novel strategy for the synergistic cancer therapy.

         <title>BN&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Heteroarenes Containing Thiopyran Moieties: Synthesis, Aromaticity, and Dual&#8208;Chromic Behavior</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BN&#8208;fused thiopyran derivatives have been designed and successfully synthesized. Unlike the fluoride ions coordinating to the azaborine rings, the protons are introduced on the cyclopenta[b]thiopyran units. This work not only provides the first construction of BN&#8208;fused thiopyran derivatives but also develops new candidates for dual&#8208;chromic smart materials.








Abstract
BN&#8208;fused polycyclic heteroarenes have attracted extensive attention due to their distinctive structures and optoelectronic properties. However, the fusion of an azaborine ring on a six&#8208;membered thiopyran ring remains unexplored, limiting the chemical diversity and optical tunability of this unique material family. Herein, BN&#8208;embedded thiopyran derivatives with different conjugation lengths have been straightforwardly synthesized, and their photophysical properties, aromaticities, and dual&#8208;chromic behaviors have been systematically investigated. The successful incorporation of the thiopyran ring into BN&#8208;embedded heteroarenes endows the rigid molecules with a narrow optical band gap. Moreover, the BN&#8208;fused thiopyran derivatives exhibit dual&#8208;chromic behaviors in response to fluoride ions and protons. Unlike the fluoride ions coordinating to the azaborine rings, the protons are introduced on the cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties, as revealed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and theoretical calculations. Additionally, fluorination brings about the loss of aromaticity for the azaborine ring, while protonation induces the aromaticity enhancement for the thiopyran ring. Furthermore, dual&#8208;chromic pictures based on the BN&#8208;embedded thiopyran derivates are demonstrated. Overall, this work not only provides the first construction of BN&#8208;fused thiopyran derivatives but also develops new candidates for dual&#8208;chromic smart materials.

         <title>Polymerization Order in the Synthesis of 2D Block Supramolecular Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, it is shown that, as in the case of block copolymerization in covalent polymer chemistry, the order of the polymerization of two monomers has a critical effect in the synthesis of 2D block copolymers of porphyrin&#8208;based monomers. In one of the orders of polymerization, secondary nucleation is involved, leading to nanosheets with uncontrolled areas and edge roughness.








Abstract
In the synthesis of block polymers through living polymerization, the order in which the monomers are copolymerized can have a critical effect on the polymerization efficacy. The same should hold true for the synthesis of block supramolecular polymers; however, this remains unexplored. The effect of the order of the polymerization of the monomers in 2D seeded/living supramolecular block copolymerization of porphyrin&#8208;based monomers is investigated. Unlike 1D living polymers, 2D supramolecular polymers (or nanosheets) have two distinct propagation sites. It is shown that inverting the order of polymerization can lead to distinct growth modes; importantly, secondary nucleation is involved in one of these cases. If secondary nucleation takes place at the edges of the seeds prior to 2D growth, the resulting nanosheets tend to exhibit uncontrolled areas and edge roughness.

         <title>A Convergent Radical Cascade for the Synthesis of Azaindanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent approach for synthesising diverse azaindanes through visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical cyclisation is explored. Using Katritzky salts and alkenes, this method tolerates various functional groups and does not require the addition of oxidants or photocatalysts. The exploration of a broad scope enable the definition of the requirements for a successful process. Additionally, the roles of the acid additive and the triphenylpyridine by&#8208;product are investigated.








Abstract
The azaindane motif is present in a number of drug candidates and combines the benefits of both a high sp3&#8208;fraction and an heteroaromatic ring. However, only a limited number of efficient approaches for the elaboration of this motif have been reported, and very few are flexible enough to enable the fast generation of analogues. Here we report the exploration of a convergent process for the construction of a variety of azaindanes and related semi&#8208;saturated fused heterocycles from an heteroaromatic triphenylpyridinium (Katritzky Salt) and an alkene coupling partner. In this process, two new C&#9472;C bonds are formed in a single step involving the activation of a pyridine&#8208;containing Katritzky salt under visible light irradiation in acidic conditions without the use of additional reductant/oxidant or photocatalyst. Under these operationally simple conditions, a variety of functional groups are tolerated, but the outcome of the reaction is dependent on the electronic nature of the pendant heterocycle and the alkene reaction partner. To help the exploration of future substrates, guidelines are established to predict the outcome of the reaction. Additionally, mechanistic studies shed light on the role played by the acid additive as well as the triphenylpyridine by&#8208;product in this process.

         <title>Expanding the Scope of BICAAC Organocatalyst: Hydroboration of Carbonyl and Alkyne Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BICAAC efficiently mediates the hydroborative reduction of carbonyls and alkynes. In situ control experiments, 1H NMR monitoring, and DFT calculations show BICAAC acts as a pre&#8208;catalyst, forming the active species in situ via oxidative addition of the B&#9472;H bond at the carbene center. This species lowers the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap between benzaldehyde and HBpin, enabling the reaction. These insights elucidate BICAAC's mechanistic role and highlight its potential in advancing metal&#8208;free catalytic systems.








Abstract
Bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (BICAAC) (I) has been used as a highly effective catalyst for hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones, and alkynes. The catalyst is effective across a broad range of substrates bearing both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, indicating its robust functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, supported by both experimental studies and computational analyses, suggest the initial step involves the reaction of BICAAC (I) with pinacolborane (HBpin), leading to the formation of boron&#8211;carbene complex (active catalyst II). This active species facilitates substrate activation. A subsequent hydride transfer from an additional equivalent of HBpin to the activated substrate completes the reduction process. This stepwise mechanism underscores the dual role of HBpin as both a catalyst activator and a hydride donor. The interaction between BICAAC and HBpin is pivotal, as it modulates the electronic environment of the boron center to promote efficient hydride delivery.

The interaction between BICAAC and HBpin is pivotal, as it modulates the electronic environment of the boron center to promote efficient hydride delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Platform Design Enabling Silver(III) Stabilization &#9472; The Uprise of AgIIICF3 Chemistry?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation state&#160;+III represents the highest known for silver compounds. This Concept Article critically analyzes the main strategies allowing for the authentication of silver(III) compounds, with special focus on AgIIICF3 species, that were discovered back in the 80&#8242;s and 90&#8242;s, but brought back to the scene very recently. They often display an inverted ligand field (ILF) electronic structure, which impacts their reactivity (i.e., inhibited axial nucleophilicity), and enables the expansion of the coordination number (up to 6) of SP&#8208;4 AgIII compounds.








Abstract
Unlike its coinage metal counterparts, copper and gold, silver chemistry remains poorly developed and mostly restricted to the oxidation state&#160;+I, which embraces a large variety of coordination environments and types of ligand. Higher oxidation states, that is, +II and&#160;+III, are significantly less represented and predominantly adopt a square planar (SP&#8208;4) geometry around the metal center. In particular, well&#8208;defined d8 AgIII compounds are scarce, and include only a handful of examples exhibiting out&#8208;of&#8208;plane silver coordination. This Concept Article summarizes the strategies known to stabilize AgIII, as well as the unusual electronic structures (inverted ligand field) often found in these compounds. The intriguing case study of the expansion in the coordination number in AgIIICF3 compounds will be highlighted.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic Performance of Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) through Grafting Methoxyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The methoxy&#8208;groups&#8208;grafted TMTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF has been demonstrated to show a narrower bandgap and better photoelectric performance, which can be used as an efficient photocatalyst for the conversion of phenyl boronic acids into phenols.








Abstract
Preparing imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with good stability and excellent photocatalytic performance is highly desirable. Herein, methoxy groups were successfully grafted on the skeleton of highly stable TTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF through monomer modification strategy. The as&#8208;prepared TMTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF has a narrower bandgap and better photoelectric performance, which can be used as an efficient photocatalyst for the conversion of phenyl boronic acids into phenols. Our studies showed that the conversion efficiency of phenyl boronic acids into phenols using TMTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF as a catalyst was 1.3 times higher than that with TTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF as a catalyst. In addition, TMTA&#8208;DTM&#8208;COF exhibits excellent recyclability and maintains high stability during cyclic tests. Our research demonstrates that grafting methoxyl groups could be a good strategy to stabilize COFs as efficient metal&#8208;free and heterogeneous catalysts for organic conversion.

         <title>On the Reaction of Pacman&#8208;Phosphanes with Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a Pacman phosphane (a macrocyclic, multidentate phosphane ligand) with Lewis acids such as BPh&#8323;, B(C&#8326;F&#8325;)&#8323;, and GaCl&#8323; were investigated, revealing distinct bonding motifs and coordination behaviors. While B(C&#8326;F&#8325;)&#8323; forms a stable di&#8208;adduct, GaCl&#8323; induces an unusual structural rearrangement with the formation of a [Pacman&#8208;GaCl&#8322;]&#8314;[GaCl&#8324;]&#8315; salt and a rare tetracoordinated phosphorus center in the&#160;+&#160;III oxidation state.








Abstract
The reactions of Pacman phosphanes (1a) with Lewis acids such as R3B (R&#160;=&#160;C6H5, C6F5) and GaCl3 were investigated. While equilibria between mono&#8208; and di&#8208;adducts were found in the reaction with BPh3, B(C6F5)3 preferentially formed the di&#8208;adduct (1a&#183;2B(C6F5)3), which could be isolated and fully characterized. density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the N&#8208;bonded adducts are thermodynamically more stable than the P&#8208;bonded adducts. In contrast to the reaction of the Pacman phosphane with boranes, GaCl3 reacted with 1a to give an unusual [Pacman&#8208;GaCl2]+[GaCl4]&#8722; salt, featuring a nearly planar GaN2C2 heterocycle as part of the Pacman macrocycle. In addition, the coordination geometry on one P atom changes from triple to an unusual quadruple coordination, although it is still a formal P atom in the&#160;+&#160;III oxidation state, as shown by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Cycloaddition of CO2 with Epoxides Catalyzed by Recyclable Mg2&#8314;/TiO2 Photocatalyst Operating at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recyclable Mg2&#8314;/TiO&#8322; photocatalyst enables the cycloaddition of CO&#8322; with epoxides under visible light at room temperature, providing a sustainable route to cyclic carbonates without the need for solvents or harsh conditions. The catalyst shows a broad substrate scope, excellent yields, and recyclability, including successful gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Furthermore, the system demonstrates real&#8208;world applicability through CO&#8322; capture from simulated exhaust gas. Mechanistic insights supported by DFT calculations revealed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical pathway via bromide activation.








Abstract
The utilization of CO2 as a C1 building block remains a key challenge in sustainable organic synthesis. We now report a recyclable metal ion modified titanium oxide (Mn+/TiO2, where Mn+ represents Mg2+, Rh3+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Al3+) photocatalytic system used with a tetrabutylammonium halide (TBAX, X&#160;=&#160;I, Br, Cl) as a co&#8208;catalyst, which enables the cycloaddition of CO2 with various epoxides under visible light irradiation at room temperature. This catalyst system exhibits a broad range of responsiveness to visible light and is compatible with simulated solar light, and operates solvent&#8208;free conditions without the need for high pressure. Excellent yields and selectivities were achieved by the Mg2+/TiO2 photocatalyst, and the method was successfully scaled to gram&#8208;scale synthesis without any loss of efficiency. Simulated post&#8208;combustion exhaust gas (CO2: 7.5%, N2: 92.5%, relative humidity: 90%) was concentrated to 97% and used for the reaction, yielding 88% styrene carbonate from styrene oxide by the catalysis of Mg2+/TiO2. Furthermore, the Mg2+/TiO2 catalyst could be readily recovered and reused over multiple cycles. Mechanistic investigations supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the bromine radical (Br&#8226;), generated via photooxidation of bromide ion from TBABr, initiates the epoxide ring&#8208;opening.

         <title>Acceptor&#8208;Adaptive Automated Glycosylation Optimization for Automated Glycan Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difficulty of finding the optimal glycosylation conditions for automated solid&#8208;phase glycan assembly leads to the use of large temperature ranges and excess reagents. This has negative atom and energy efficiency implications. We demonstrate that mirroring glycosylation temperature from solution to solid phase via an automated acceptor&#8208;adaptive optimization strategy empowers an efficient and sustainable automated glycan assembly (AGA) process.








Abstract
Optimization of glycosylation temperatures is essential for automated solid&#8208;phase glycan assembly. Constructing a reliable optimization system that mimics key reaction components is crucial for increasing the atom economy and the energy efficiency of the process. Although glycosyl acceptors play a pivotal role in glycosylation, evaluating their effect on glycosylation efficiency (GE) is nontrivial. While screening various glycosyl acceptors for optimization is impractical, compromising for simple alkyl acceptors produces results of dubious relevance. We demonstrate that optimization with a modified trans&#8208;4&#8208;aminocyclohexanol&#8208;based acceptor accurately reflects the optimal glycosylation temperature of several glycosyl acceptors, overcoming previous limitations. The contextual use of both n&#8208;alkyl and glycan&#8208;mimetic acceptors for automated optimization enabled translation of optimized glycosylation temperature to highly efficient solid&#8208;phase synthesis (SPS) of disaccharides.

         <title>Practical Electrochemical Hydroxynitration and Chloronitration Bifunctionalization of Alkenes with NaNO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed an electrochemical hydroxynitration or chloronitration bifunctionalization reaction of unsaturated carbon&#8208;carbon double bond by using sodium nitrite as a nitro source, and a series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was produced in good to excellent yields.








Abstract
We herein developed a novel method for generating nitryl free radicals using sodium nitrite for the first time under electrocatalytic conditions. A series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was generated in good yields. This methodology features a simple reaction setup, mild reaction conditions, and cheap electrodes and shows excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, enabling efficient gram&#8208;scale reactions with good to excellent yields. Besides, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) results provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.

Modular self&#8208;assembly of extendable porphyrin&#8208;based heterotrimetallic discrete architectures: a new efficient strategy toward the construction of stable multicomponent functional systems.








Abstract
An efficient strategy for the preparation of heterometallic discrete porphyrin assemblies, tuned both in dimensions and number of metal centers, is described. Five rod&#8208;shaped di&#8208;pyridyl FeII&#8208;metalloligands, with varied length (1.5 &#8211; 3.2&#160;nm), lateral substituents, and number of iron centers, were used to bridge two RuII&#8208;metallacycles, made of two coplanar ZnII&#8208;porphyrin each. The resulting architectures consist of four RuII complexes, four zinc&#8208;porphyrins, and either two or four FeII&#8208;clathrochelate units. Earlier, geometrically similar sandwich&#8208;like architectures were based on purely organic connectors. Among other novel characteristics, the use of metalloligands was found to be beneficial for the overall stability, thus allowing for a solution&#8208;based characterization of the assemblies. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures were determined for the complete collection, highlighting additional key features: the two facing ZnII&#8208;porphyrin platforms are set wide apart according to the span of the two connecting metalloligands, while the latter are parallelly aligned by the anchoring ZnII&#8208;porphyrin/RuII&#8208;metallacycles, at fixed inter Fe&#183;&#183;Fe distance(s). Mutual control over these geometrical parameters is very strict, as evidenced by self&#8208;sorting experiments. Useful implementation of these systems into functional systems may be envisaged by pairing the peripheral metalloporphyrin photosensitizers with photo/redox/catalytically active inner metal cores.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Methylene Blue From Aqueous Solution Using Hybrid Biomass&#8208;Derived Nanostructured Carbon&#8208;TiO2 Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid photocatalyst of biomass&#8208;derived carbon nanospheres and TiO&#8322; has been developed from waste coffee leaves, achieving 99% MB dye degradation. The carbon reduces the bandgap, boosting UV photocatalysis, and the material shows excellent stability and recyclability, offering a sustainable, scalable solution for wastewater treatment.








Abstract
Industrial dye usage results in substantial wastewater discharge, posing environmental and health hazards. Hence, developing efficient, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective treatment technologies is crucial. Photocatalysis using TiO&#8322; has emerged as a promising approach for dye degradation. This study explores the photocatalytic removal of methylene blue (MB), a model dye pollutant, using a composite of biomass&#8208;derived carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and nanosized TiO&#8322; under UV light. The CNPs were synthesized via one&#8208;step pyrolysis from waste coffee leaves, offering a sustainable carbon source. The resulting CNPs (CL&#8208;10) and the TiO&#8322;&#8208;CNP composite (PC@CL&#8208;10) were thoroughly characterized using advanced techniques. Incorporating carbon significantly reduces the band gap of TiO&#8322; from &#8764;3.2&#160;eV to 2.90&#160;eV, enhancing photocatalytic activity. Degradation studies under varying catalyst doses, dye concentrations, and pH levels demonstrate effective MB removal under UV irradiation. Photocatalytic experiments revealed up to 99% degradation of MB under UV light, while tests conducted in the dark showed negligible activity, confirming the light&#8208;dependent efficiency. Kinetic analysis indicated that intra&#8208;particle diffusion (IPD) governs the dye degradation process. Moreover, recyclability tests over seven cycles showed consistent performance with minimal decline, highlighting the catalyst's stability and reusability. These findings suggest that PC@CL&#8208;10 is a highly effective, low&#8208;cost photocatalyst with strong potential for large&#8208;scale wastewater treatment applications.

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;Mediated Hydroaminoalkylation of Conjugated Dienes Probed by a Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth computational mechanistic probe of the zirconium&#8208;mediated hydroaminoalkylation of conjugated dienes with N&#8208;aryl substituted amines complements previous stochiometric and catalytic studies, providing a deeper understanding of intricate mechanistic details.








Abstract
An in&#8208;depth computational probe of the hydroaminoalkylation of 1,3&#8208;dienes with N&#8208;aryl substituted amines by a tethered bis(ureate)&#8208;ligated zirconium compound is reported. The mechanistic proposal derived from smooth energy profiles acquired by employing a reliable computational protocol complies with previous experimental mechanistic studies, providing a more advanced understanding of intricate mechanistic aspects. The high degree of regioselectivity achieved for reversible diene insertion and butenyl tether protonolysis is instrumental for the generation of the main product, (E)&#8208;4,1 linear homoallylic amine. Product liberation and regeneration of the zirconaaziridine favours a two&#8208;step sequence comprising transamination with incoming amine, followed by &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the intervening zircona bis&#8208;amide. The irreversible transamination is likely the regioselectivity&#8208;determining event that dictates the product composition. The &#946;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction at the zircona bis&#8208;amide, which likely constitutes the catalyst resting state, is turnover limiting. Its DFT&#8208;assessed defining barrier conforms with reported catalyst performance data. The role of the smaller, more nucleophilic dimethylamide in the catalytic transformation has been revealed.

         <title>Productive Homogeneous Hydrogenation of Fatty Esters with Carboxylate SNS Ruthenium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxylate ruthenium complexes, prepared from easily accessible ruthenium precursors and bis(2&#8208;(ethylthio)ethyl)amine (SNS ligand), efficiently catalyze the hydrogenation (HY) of methyl decanoate (model for the FAME reduction) to 1&#8208;decanol with H2 under mild conditions and without solvents. The acetate trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)2(SNS)(PPh3)] derivative catalyzes the HY of a number of long&#8208;chain and aromatic methyl&#8208; and ethyl esters at extremely high S/C (up to 100,&#160;000).








Abstract
The carboxylate pincer complexes trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OCOR)2(SNS)(PPh3)] (R&#160;=&#160;CH3 1, tBu 2; SNS&#160;=&#160;bis(2&#8208;(ethylthio)ethylamine) are obtained from [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OCOR)2(PPh3)2] (R&#160;=&#160;CH3, tBu) and HN(CH2CH2SEt)2 in acetone by elimination of PPh3. Substitution of PPh3 in 1 with PPh2Me gives trans&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)2(SNS)(PPh2Me)] (3) in toluene at 105&#176;C. The cationic complexes cis&#8208;[Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(SNS)(dppb)]OAc (4) and [Ru(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(CO)(SNS)(PPh3)]OAc (5) are synthesized from [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)2(dppb)] and [Ru(&#951;2&#8208;OAc)2(CO)(PPh3)2], respectively, by treatment with the SNS ligand in toluene. Hydride trans&#8208;[RuH(&#951;1&#8208;OAc)(SNS)(PPh3)] (6) is obtained by reaction of 1 with NaOiPr in a mixture of iPrOH/toluene. The carboxylate complexes 1&#8211;6 catalyze the homogeneous hydrogenation of methyl decanoate to 1&#8208;decanol with NaOMe under mild reaction conditions (T&#160;=&#160;40&#176;C, H2 pressure 27.5&#160;bar) and extremely low catalyst loading (S/C 10,000&#8211;100,000). Complexes 1 and 2 display remarkably high catalytic activity for the reduction of fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters at S/C of 50,000&#8211;100,000, with high selectivity for the reduction of the carboxylate group in the presence of C&#160;&#9552;&#160;C functionalities. An easy scale&#8208;up of this process (100&#160;mmol of substrate) has been demonstrated. Mechanistic studies show that 1 reacts with H2 (5&#160;bar), affording the monohydride 6, that by further reaction with H2 and an alkoxide gives the dihydride cis&#8208;[RuH2(SNS)(PPh3)], which reduces methyl benzoate to benzyl alcohol.

         <title>Hybrid Tuning in NHC Ligands: Synergistic Effects of BIAN &#960;&#8208;Conjugation and Aryl &#963;&#8208;Modulation in Gold(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study investigates how combining &#960;&#8208;extended backbones with aryl substituent variation in Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHCX complexes affects their structure, photophysics, reactivity, and toxicity. It is evident that subtle changes in substituent type and position give rise to distinct trends, thus demonstrating how it is possible to harness &#960;&#8211;&#963; interactions in order to fine&#8208;tune properties for catalytic and biomedical applications.








Abstract
In this study, we explore extended design of metal&#8211;NHC complexes that relies on dual strategies for tuning ligand properties: (i) electronic modulation through &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks such as bis(imino)acenaphthene (BIAN), and (ii) systematic aryl substitution to influence &#963;&#8208;donor strength and steric environment. We report the first integrated exploration of these two strategies on a unified ligand platform. A series of Au(I)/BIAN&#8211;NHCX complexes were synthesized by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, CF&#8323;) at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;positions of the N&#8208;aryl groups. This hybrid tuning approach allowed us to probe the synergistic and antagonistic effects arising from &#960;&#8211;&#963; interplay across multiple dimensions. Each complex was thoroughly characterized with respect to synthetic yield, structural features (including X&#8208;ray structure and dynamics in solution), photophysical properties (UV&#8208;Vis and luminescence), catalytic performance in hydroamination of phenylacetylene, and cytotoxicity in HEK293T cells. Structure&#8211;property correlations revealed distinct cooperative and counteractive regimes depending on the substituent type and position. These findings demonstrate that combining orthogonal electronic control elements enables a more predictive and fine&#8208;grained design of NHC&#8208;based metal complexes, with future implications for catalysis, materials science, and biomedical applications.

In this research, we have successfully achieved the efficient synthesis of disubstituted &#947;&#8208;ketophosphine derivatives through the reaction between [TBA][P(SiCl3)2] and N&#8208;(aryl)acrylamides. This strategy utilizes the active low&#8208;valence [TBA][P(SiCl3)2] prepared from phosphoric acid as the phosphorus source, offering a novel, cost&#8208;effective, and highly efficient approach for the preparation of &#947;&#8208;ketophosphine derivatives with unique biological activities.

         <title>In Quest for Polyenic Macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 Identity: Stereoselective Synthesis of DP4+&#8208;Based Purported Structure and Biogenetically Inspired Positional Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total synthesis of polyenic macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 with all&#8208;trans geometries, hydroxyl substituents located at C8 and C10 and 8R,10R,19R absolute configuration, the most likely stereoisomer predicted by DP4+ calculations, was completed. The formal syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol was synthesized iteratively by enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective Krische&#8217;s allylation reactions. The construction of the conjugated triene units was based on a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the corresponding alkenylboronates and alkenyliodides, and Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) condensation reactions. Macrolactam formation promoted by HATU and DIPEA was best carried out by amine protecting group exchange and release of both reactive functional groups under basic conditions. Given the lack of correspondence of the 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR data for the synthetic and purported JBIR&#8208;150, the hydroxyl groups of JBIR&#8208;150 were alternatively proposed to be located at the odd&#8208;numbered positions (C9, C11) based on the general biogenesis of the family of polyenic macrolactams and the collinearity principle of their modular sequence. The C11&#8208;diastereoisomers of the biogenetically inspired 9,11&#8208;dihydroxy positional isomers (termed iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150) with formal syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;diol configurations was completed. Much to our dismay, the NMR data of the synthetic diastereomeric polyenic macrolactams with 9S,11S,19R or 9S,11R,19R absolute configuration did not match those of the natural product and the structural identity of JBIR&#8208;150 remains undetermined.</dc:description>

Given the lack of correspondence of the 1H- and 13C-NMR data for the synthetic and purported JBIR-150, the hydroxyl groups of JBIR-150 were alternatively proposed to be located at the odd-numbered positions (C9, C11) based on the general biogenesis of the family of polyenic macrolactams and the collinearity principle of their modular sequence. The C11-diastereoisomers of the biogenetically inspired 9,11-dihydroxy positional isomers (termed iso-JBIR-150) with formal syn- and anti-diol configurations was completed. Much to our dismay, the NMR data of the synthetic diastereomeric polyenic macrolactams with 9S,11S,19R or 9S,11R,19R absolute configuration did not match those of the natural product and the structural identity of JBIR-150 remains undetermined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discotic Liquid Crystalline Phenazine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenazines, otherwise known as dibenzo annulated pyrazines, are a unique class of tricyclic organic molecules. They are chemically stable and highly aromatic due to their extended conjugation. Along with their biomedicinal significance, phenazines often play a major role in manipulating the optical as well as electrical properties of organic semiconductors. The planar structure in the heterocyclic aromatic phenazines and their natural inclination to form stacked columns due to the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between two consecutive molecules has made them quite a suitable moiety for the formation as well as extension of the core part of discotic liquid crystals. Their charge&#8208;carrying ability in electrolytes makes them well&#8208;suited for organic electronic materials. Furthermore, their properties can be fine&#8208;tuned with simple chemical changes rendering them appropriate for many advanced applications. This review focuses on the chemistry of phenazine&#8208;based discotic liquid crystals and their significance in optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent&#160;N6&#160;Versus&#160;Cvinyl&#160;Arylation of 8&#8208;Vinyl Adenine Nucleosides, Sequential Diarylation, Fluorescence Properties, and Computational Evaluations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination and Heck arylation reactions are complementary tranformations, generally requiring a suitable catalyst combination and a base. With substrates containing both an amino group and a vinyl moiety, control of C&#8211;N versus C&#8211;C reactivity can lead to regiodivergent functionalizations. With this focus, reactions of silyl&#8208;protected 8&#8208;vinyl adenosine and 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine with aryl bromides and iodides have been studied. Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, and preformed dichloro[1,1&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;t&#8208;butylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium (II) (Pd&#8208;118) were evaluated as metal sources. Ligands tested were Xantphos, DPEphos, BIPHEP, and DPPF, with Cs2CO3 and K3PO4 as bases. In toluene as solvent, the Pd(OAc)2/Xantphos/Cs2CO3 combination was uniquely capable of predominant N6 arylation. Aryl bromides and iodides gave comparable product yields. Replacement of Cs2CO3 with K3PO4 redirected arylation from nitrogen atom to the vinyl carbon atom, and all other catalyst, ligand, and base combinations gave Cvinyl arylation as well. Simply switching from Pd(OAc)2 to Pd2(dba)3 resulted in loss of the N6&#8208;selectivity and Cvinyl arylation was favored. Based upon these results, using two structurally similar catalytic systems sequential Cvinyl and N6 arylations of the nucleosides were accomplished. Some of the products were converted to other novel nucleoside analogues. Because some compounds were fluorescent, their photophysical properties were assessed experimentally and computationally.</dc:description>

         <title>5d Orbital Covalency Controls the High&#8208;Pressure Polymorphism of BaO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of metal d orbitals on the high&#8208;pressure structures of CaO, SrO, and BaO are investigated with DFT calculations and chemical bonding analysis. CaO and SrO undergo the B1&#8208;B2 transition, from the rock salt structure to the caesium chloride structure, while BaO undergoes a sequence of transitions from B1&#8208;B8, the NiAs structure, and then B8&#8722; dB2, a distorted form of B2. DFT calculations of bond strengths show that the B8 and dB2 structures are stabilized relative to B1 and B2 by metal&#8208;oxygen covalency through the metal d orbitals. In BaO covalency outweighs electrostatics because of the large 5d orbitals of Ba, so the unique B8 and dB2 structures form. This marks an important expansion of the importance of d orbitals in group II chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole&#8208;2&#8208;Carboxylic Acid Ligand&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Stable Perovskite Nanocrystals for Fast Responsive Photodetector</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) show great potential for photoelectric properties. However, due to their poor stability and the insulating nature of passivating ligands, they suffer from practical applications. Herein, in an approach to passivate NCs surface by introducing a ligand, Indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (ICA), we synthesized a mixed CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 NCs by ligand&#8208;assisted re&#8208;precipitation approach. Incorporating ICA ligand in place of long chain insulating Oleic acid (OA) effectively reduced the loss of non&#8208;radiative recombination induced by surface trap states. Through all the performed compositional and structural characterization, the existence of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs was confirmed. The obtained CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs show green emission at 518 nm and superior stability under ambient conditions compared to CsPbBr3 NCs. The photoluminescence (PL) of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs increased approximately three times, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) increased from 75 &#177; 2% to 94 &#177; 2% as compared to CsPbBr3 NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Fine Tuning of the Redox&#8208;Active Diguanidine Ligand in Cationic Cobalt Complexes for Electronic Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we show that the redox chemistry of hexacoordinated cobalt complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands could be tuned by modifying the diguanidine and/or the co&#8208;ligands. In this way, one&#8208;electron oxidation could be directed to be either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with an oxidized, radical&#8208;monocationic diguanidine ligand (ligand&#8208;centered oxidation), or low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with a reduced, neutral diguanidine ligand. Further fine tuning of the redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligand leads to a harmonization of the energies of both redox isomers. Consequently, ligand&#8208; as well as metal&#8208;centered one&#8208;electron oxidation is observed, resulting in a mixture of both redox isomers. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations confirm the energetic proximity of the two redox isomers in this bistable system. The results of this work contribute to the development of a directed approach toward the design of bistable cobalt&#8208;guanidine complexes and their possible applications in spin switching devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc(II) Monomeric, Dimeric and Trimeric Photosensitizers with Microsecond&#8208;lived Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Excited States Investigated through Time&#8208;resolved Optical and X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnII photosensitizers relative to CuI complexes have received less attention due to their energetically&#8208;higher metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer states. Three ZnII complexes namely a Monomer, a bimetallic helicate and a trimetallic helicate, bearing phenanthroline ligands are hereby studied through time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption (tr&#8208;XAS) and femto&#8208;microsecond optical transient absorption spectroscopy (OTA). The formation of intraligand singlet charge transfer (IILCT) excited states is achieved within femtoseconds, followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) in nanoseconds to generate microsecond&#8208;lived triplet (3ILCT) states. Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs and 730 fs, respectively, while &#160;nano&#8208;microsecond OTA and tr&#8208;XAS show their 3ILCT states &#160;to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8 ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates less than 13 ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; non&#8208;covalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer vs the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing&#160;photoredox processes.</dc:description>

Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs and 730 fs, respectively, while &#160;nano-microsecond OTA and tr-XAS show their 3ILCT states &#160;to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8 ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates less than 13 ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;-&#960; and CH-&#960; non-covalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer vs the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing&#160;photoredox processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Conjugations in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs in response to tumor overexpressed enzymes offer a targeted approach for cancer therapy. However, this strategy faces several challenges, including poor water solubility, off&#8208;target effects, and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD&#8208;NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor&#8208;associated integrin &#945;v&#946;3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed NTR among hypoxic tumor microenvironment leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged payloads through "click&#8208;to&#8208;release" reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor&#8208;selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bistricyclic Aromatic Enes Containing Bifluorenylidene Units via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Suzuki Coupling/Heck Cyclization Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>A variety of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot. In the new scheme 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and similar derivatives were chosen as one of reaction substrates, which could undergo tandem Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization reaction with suitable arylboronic acid ester substrates to afford the expected BAEs and their derivatives. In the newly designed scheme, the raw materials are easier to obtain and can be applied to the synthesis of more BAEs and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0&#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100) mA cm&#8208;2) and the Tafel slope (44 mV dec&#8208;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100 h. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.</dc:description>
