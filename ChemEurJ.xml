         <title>Tuning Optical Properties of Organic Thin Films through Intermolecular Interactions &#8208; Fundamentals, Advances and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In applications ranging from photon&#8208;energy conversion into electrical or chemical forms (such as photovoltaics or photocatalysis) to numerous sensor technologies based on organic solids, the role of supramolecular structures and chromophore interactions is crucial. This review comprehensively examines the critical intermolecular interactions between organic dyes and their impact on optical properties. We explore the range of changes in absorption or emission properties observed in molecular aggregates compared to single molecules. Each effect is dissected to reveal its physicochemical foundations, relevance to different application domains, and documented examples from the literature that illustrate the potential modulation of absorption or emission properties by molecular and supramolecular structural adjustments. This work aims to serve as a concise guide for exploiting supramolecular phenomena in the innovation of novel optical and optoelectronic organic materials, with emphasis on strategic application and exploitation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Boosting Strategy of Photovoltaics by Stacking Monolayer InSe and &#946;&#8208;Sb into Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identifying two&#8208;dimensional (2D) high&#8208;efficiency solar photovoltaic devices remains an urgent challenge in addressing current energy demands. Considering the limits of isolated 2D systems in photovoltaics, one most effective solution is stacking them into van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs). However, the favorable factors for photovoltaics in vdWHs is still uncertain, nor the intrinsic principles is clear. Here, based on monolayer InSe and &#946;&#8208;Sb, we propose a boosting strategy on photovoltaics through stacking them into vdWH. After confirming its experimental feasibility, several superior photovoltaic characteristics of such vdWH are verified than its components. Including more moderately indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct band gap, higher electron mobilities, the hindrance of carrier recombination due to the staggered type&#8208;II band alignment, and the stronger and red&#8208;shifted optical harvesting abilities owing to the band redistribution. In addition, superior characteristics in the InSe/Sb vdWH based photovoltaic devices are further confirmed, including the red&#8208;shifted photocurrent into the infrared&#8208;light range, the superior photoelectric conversion efficiencies in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;region, and the higher photovoltaic quality factors (Rph ,&#964;eqe et.al.) than each component and many other typical vdWHs. Obviously, the design principles and promotion mechanisms of 2D vdWH on photovoltaics can provide powerful theoretical guidances for next design and applications of 2D high&#8208;efficiency solar photovoltaic cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Chlorination&#8208;Supported Shrinkage of C60 Fullerene to Non&#8208;classical C58 Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We provide important novel insights into skeletal transformations of fullerene by reporting new cases of cage shrinkage in the most abundant C60 fullerene via a C2 loss. High&#8208;temperature (400&#8211;500 oC) chlorination of IPR C60 with SbCl5 or SbCl5/SbCl3 mixtures predominantly gives non&#8208;IPR C60Cln compounds via Stone&#8208;Wales rearrangements, but the present study further reveals non&#8208;classical C58Cln chlorofullerenes as by&#8208;products. The new C58(NC1)Cl20 and C58(NC1)Cl24 chlorides have been isolated by air&#8208;free HPLC and structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Their non&#8208;classical carbon cages feature one heptagon, two pairs of fused pentagons, one triple&#8208;pentagon junction, and one quartet of sequentially fused pentagons. However, the chlorination patterns and molecular shapes of C58(NC1)Cl20 and C58(NC1)Cl24 are essentially different. We propose the likely multistep transformation pathways toward the new compounds and further report the chlorination&#8208;promoted formation of chlorofullerenes with still smaller fullerene cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Label&#8208;free 3D cell imaging using hydrogels functionalized with switchable iridium complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of fluorescent labels is the most common tool to visualize cells. However, the internalization of dye molecules often modifies the cell behavior. In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to transiently label cells using a 3D scaffold, a hydrogel, covalently functionalized with luminescent cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes. The unique feature of our design is that the complexes are emissive only when they interact with the cell membrane while their emission is quenched in water. We exploited this feature to perform real&#8208;time and staining&#8208;free cell visualization and imaging. The hydrogels immerged in culture media are non&#8208;luminescent, however, when cells are added to it, they interact with the iridium complexes, covalently linked to the gel, and their lipophilic membrane &#8220;switches on&#8221; the luminescence enabling a clear and dynamic, real&#8208;time 3D visualization of cell proliferation. A complete photophysical and biological study of the materials is presented which demonstrates the potential of our methodology for 3D&#8208;realtime cell tracking.</dc:description>

         <title>Interpenetration Control in Metal&#8211;Organic Polyrotaxanes via Solvent Composition and Ligand Steric&#8208;Modulation: Supramolecular Isomerism and Luminescence Detection toward Fe3+ Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three fluorescent Zn coordaintion polymers (CPs) have been synthesized from the reactions of Zn(NO3)2&#8729;6H2O, benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (1,4&#8208;H2bdc), and angular carbazole&#8208;derived bispyridyl ligands (Cz&#8208;3,6&#8208;bpy or Cz&#8208;Pr&#8208;3,6&#8208;bpy). CPs 1&#8211;3 all adopt similar two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ring&#8208;and&#8208;rod layer structures, described as topologically 4&#8208;connected 2&#8729;65 nets where the Zn(II) centers act as 4&#8208;connected nodes. CPs 1 and 2 are a pair of solvent&#8208;mediated supramolecular isomers where the former shows a two&#8208;fold interlocked 2D &#8594; 2D polyrotaxane&#8208;like entangled net and the latter reveals a four&#8208;fold interpenetrated 2D &#8594; 3D polyrotaxane entanglement. CP 3 is structure analgue of 1. The formation of 1&#8211;3 implies the realization of interpenetration control and supramolecular isomerism in polyrotaxanes by fine&#8208;tuning the solvent compositions and ligand steric&#8208;modulation. CPs 1&#8211;3 all show high thermal stability approaching 400 &#176;C and good chemical stability in various solvents at room temperature for 24 h. Further, CPs 1&#8211;3 all are excellent turn&#8208;off sensors to recognize Fe3+ in water with high selectivity and sensitivity, great anti&#8208;inference ability, and low limit of detection (LOD). The sensing mechanisms are found to be competitive absorption of excitation wavelength energy and the occurrence of framework&#8211;Fe3+ interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the Titanium(III) Tris(alkyl) Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 and its Conversion to a Dimeric Alkyl&#8208;bridged Titanium(IV) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of three equivalents of LiCH(SiMe3)2 with TiCl3(NMe3)2 afforded the rare homoleptic Ti(III) alkyl Ti{CH(SiMe3)2}3 (1) which crystallized as blue needles in 32 % yield. Single crystal X&#8208;Ray data for 1 showed a trigonal pyramidal coordination geometry around titanium, which could be ascribed to weak interactions between the C&#8211;H bonds and the Ti(III) atom based on computational results. X&#8208;band EPR spectroscopy give spectral parameters consistent with the proposed Ti(III) formulation. Solutions of 1 are unstable at room temperature owing to intramolecular C&#8211;H activation that gave a dimeric Ti(IV) complex [{(Me3Si)2HC}Ti{&#956;&#8208;CH HSiMe3}]2 (2).</dc:description>

Solutions of 1 are unstable at room temperature owing to intramolecular C&#8211;H activation that gave a dimeric Ti(IV) complex [{(Me3Si)2HC}Ti{&#956;-CH HSiMe3}]2 (2).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Bisphosphonate&#8208;Based Viologens as Negolytes for Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viologen derivatives feature two reversible one&#8208;electron redox processes and have been extensively utilized in aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs). However, the early variant, methyl viologen (MVi), exhibits low stability in aqueous electrolytes, restricting its practical implementation in AOFB technology. In this context, leveraging the tunability of organic molecules, various substituents have been incorporated into the viologen core to achieve better stability, lower redox potential, and improved solubility. In this work, we introduce bisphosphonate&#8208;substituted viologens as candidates for AOFBs. The bulkiness and negative charges of the bisphosphonate groups enhance the solubility and the electrostatic repulsion among viologen molecules, minimizing the bimolecular side reactions that lead to degradation. Additionally, the electron&#8208;donating effect of this new substituent significantly lowers the redox potential. As a result, the proposed viologen derivatives exhibit high solubility (1.66 &#8208; 1.81 M in water) and stability (capacity decay of 0.009%/cycle or 0.229%/day when tested at 0.5 M). These parameters are coupled with the lowest redox potentials exceeding all previously reported viologens utilized in AOFBs (&#8211;0.503 V and &#8211;0.550 V against SHE for mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;phosphonate viologen, respectively).</dc:description>

         <title>A Hybrid BN&#8208;doped nanographene with narrow emission bandwidths for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe synthesis of BN&#8208;doped nanographene containing five phenylene units, boron and nitrogen atoms with both alternating ortho&#8208;disposition as well as direct B&#8208;N connection. Resulting BN doped nanographene exhibits blue fluorescence at 441 nm with extraordinary narrow fluorescence peak with full width at half maximum (FWHM) = 10&#8208;11 nm. Crystallography reveals supramolecular organization of this compound in the crystal phase. Initial organic light emitting device (OLED) data suggest that the presence of a directly connected B&#8208;N isostere can lead to devices with sufficiently long lifetime as well as narrow emission electro&#8208;luminescence peaks for OLED applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Me2Se and Me2Te: their structures and synergistic effects of halogen/chalcogen bonding with C6F5Br and C6F5I</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work combines halogen and chalcogen bonding. Short, polarity directed C&#8211;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch (X = Br or I, Ch = Se or Te) contacts were prepared by in situ low&#8208;temperature cocrystallization of liquid mixtures of neutral pentafluorohalogenobenzenes C6F5X and dimethyl chalco&#173;genides Me2Ch. Solid&#8208;state structures of Me2Se and Me2Te were determined 150 and 125 years after their first description. Significant C&#8211;Ch&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts make Me2Se dimeric and Me2Te polymeric. The cocrystals comprise C6F5X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Me2Ch&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;XC6F5 aggregates, except the combination X/Ch = I/Te which shows polymeric C6F5I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Me2Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;TeMe2&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;IC6F5 aggregation. The observed C&#8211;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te interactions are the shortest of this type, and the C&#8211;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts are shorter than the corresponding C&#8211;Br&#183;&#183;&#183;Ch interactions. Heteromole&#173;cular C&#8211;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ch contacts are accompanied by F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H/F and X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H con&#173;tacts in the cocrystals. The analysis of packing and contacts in all (co)crystals was complemented by computational studies.

         <dc:description>Pressure is mounting to minimize the carbon footprint of chemical industry while increasing its sustainability. An argument is made that working from Green Chemistry principles during discovery&#8208;based catalysis results in effective chemistry and circumvents a need to &#8220;rediscover&#8221; chemical reactivity under sustainable conditions. Examples of comparative success in selected examples of hydrophosphination catalysis in various degrees of development are provided to support two main ideas: 1) Starting from more sustainable practices in chemical discovery is inertia in methodology that should be overcome, and 2) Substantial challenges remain in catalysis for which sustainable solution would positively impact other areas of chemistry. Examples of successes, even in the face of the challenges noted, are presented herein indications that as a starting point, sustainability can meet short&#8208; and long&#8208;term needs. These ideas indicate critical but simple strategies for fundamental research to be impactful in the sustainability of the chemical industry broadly.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of UCST&#8208;Responsive Claw&#8208;Like Polysulfobetaines for Efficient Capture of Cellulase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recyclable UCST&#8208;type claw shaped PSPA was used to significantly recycle cellulase from lignocellulosic hydrolyzate, and the process was sustainable.







Abstract
The high cost of enzymatic glycolysis has seriously restricted the industrialization of lignocellulose&#8208;based sugar platform technology. Recovering and recycling cellulase can reduce the cost. Here, a thermo&#8208;responsive claw&#8208;type polysulfobetaine (PSPA) was constructed for hydrophobic grasping and efficient recycling of cellulase. Compared with the linear sulfobetaine homopolymer (PSPE), PSPA had more sensitive temperature response and strong cellulase recovery ability. PSPE&#8208;3 (Mw=355.1&#8197;kDa) was added to the hydrolysis system of corncob residue (CCR) (50&#8201;&#176;C), at 0.4 mass ratio of PSPE&#8208;3 to cellulase, and after enzymatic hydrolysis, 50&#8201;% of the cellulase was saved when cooling to 25&#8201;&#176;C. But only 0.05 times PSPA&#8208;1 (Mw=30.0&#8197;kDa) was added to the CCR system, and 70&#8201;% of the cellulase was saved when cooling to 25&#8201;&#176;C. This work presents a claw shaped protein&#8208;capture agent, polysulfobetaine for capturing cellulase, which is of great significance to reduce the lignocellulosic hydrolysis cost, and efficiently separate enzyme proteins.

         <title>Nucleophilic Functionalization of Activated P4 in [CpFe(CO)2&#8208;(&#951;1&#8208;P4)][Al(ORF)4] with Alcohols R&#8208;OH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalization of P4 in [Fp&#8208;P4][Al(ORF)4] (1) (Fp = (CO)2CpFe) with nucleophiles R&#8208;OH (R = H, Me, Et, Ph) was investigated. Detailed NMR data on the formed P1 building blocks and DFT calculations provide insights to fragmentation mechanisms of the very rapid functionalization of P4 yielding free, coordinated or protonated phosphites [Fp&#8208;P(H)x(OR)3&#8208;x)][Al(ORF)4] (x=3&#8211;0) (2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;d), [Fp&#8208;PH2&#8208;Fp][Al(ORF)4] (2&#8201;e) and [HP(OR)3][Al(ORF)4] (2&#8201;f).







Abstract
The bonding situation in [Fp&#8722;P4][Al(ORF)4] (1) (Fp = (CO)2CpFe, RF = C(CF3)3) gives rise to an Umpolung of the P4 fragment, which should make it accessible for nucleophiles. To investigate this projected reactivity, the complex was combined with a series of hydroxy&#8208;nucleophiles &#8211; that all do not react with free P4 &#8211; leading to a variety of P1 building blocks. With excess of R&#8208;OH (R = Me, Et, Ph), the thermodynamically more stable complex salts [Fp&#8722;P(H)x(OR)3&#8208;x)][Al(ORF)4] (x=2,1,0) (2b&#8211;2d) are formed and show that the phosphonium type pathway is accessible. Quantum chemical calculations display a variety of reaction pathways that all lead very rapidly to the P1 building blocks. With stoichiometric amounts of R&#8208;OH, [Fp&#8208;PH3][Al(ORF)4] (2&#8201;a) as well as [HP(OR)3][Al(ORF)4] (2&#8201;f) were observed as products. Hence, activation of the P4&#8208;cage in complex 1 was confirmed.

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured Yb3+, Er3+ Codoped CeO2 with Upconverted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral mesostructured lanthanides codoped CeO2 materials have been synthesized via a one&#8208;step hydrothermal route. They exhibit both circular dichroism and upconverted circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Upconverted circularly polarized luminescence (UC&#8208;CPL) active organic and organic&#8208;inorganic composite materials have garnered increasing attention due to their vast potential applications in areas such as 3D displays, encryptions, spintronics and optoelectronic devices. However, effective methods for fabricating chiral inorganic materials exhibiting UC&#8208;CPL remain a challenge. Herein, we propose an approach for the synthesis of UC&#8208;CPL active chiral mesostructured CeO2 powders (CMCs) via a hydrothermal growth method, using L/D&#8208;aspartic acid as symmetry&#8208;breaking and structure&#8208;directing agents. Two levels of chirality exist in CMCs: primary nanoplates constructed from nanoparticles and the helical stacking of these nanoplates to form a twisting nanofusiform. Yb3+ and Er3+ ions can be codoped into the CMCs through a one&#8208;step synthesis to achieve UC&#8208;CPL. The 1&#8201;% Yb3+, 1&#8201;% Er3+ codoped CMCs exhibited absorption&#8208;based optical activities in the range of 350&#8211;500&#8197;nm, similar to undoped CMCs, and displayed circularly polarized luminescence in the range of 520&#8211;610&#8197;nm under the excitation by a 980&#8197;nm laser. This luminescence is attributable to the energy transfer process between Yb3+ and Er3+. This work may provide new insights into designing chiral photon upconversion inorganic materials.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic cocrystals have garnered significant research attention owing to their distinctive properties and promising applications. However, challenges in molecular structure design and control of intermolecular interactions continue to impede further advancements. In this study, two novel cocrystals were successfully formed from a series of synthesized benzotriazole derivatives.&#160;The resulting cocrystals exhibit bright green and yellow fluorescence under 365 nm light.&#160;To elucidate the microstructure of the obtained cocrystals, systematic characterization techniques such as solid&#8208;state fluorescence emission spectroscopy, Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), Power X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and density functional theory (DFT) were performed. These benzotriazole&#8208;based cocrystals demonstrate distinct fluorescent responses to alkaline and acidic environments, respectively. Additionally, preliminary tests for fingerprint recognition yielded satisfactory results. These findings suggest that the two cocrystals hold potential applications in acid&#8208;alkali sensing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels, and smart material development, while also providing valuable insights for the design and optimization of solid&#8208;state luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Divergent Synthesis of Naphthalene&#8208; and Phenanthrene&#8208;Fused Azahelicenes by Turning Rearrangement On or Off</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Scholl reaction has been used to synthesize&#160;a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, where 1,2&#8208;aryl shifts have sometimes occurred to yield unique rearrangement products. However, such 1,2&#8208;aryl shifts are often uncontrollable, and the selective and divergent synthesis with or without rearrangement is desired. Here, we achieved the&#160;control of the rearrangement&#160;in the Scholl reaction of carbazoles by the&#160;N&#8208;substituents.&#160;The Scholl reaction of&#160;3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(2&#8208;naphthyl)phenyl}carbazoles and 3,6&#8208;bis{2&#8208;(9&#8208;phenanthrenyl)phenyl}carbazoles&#160;with an&#160;N&#8208;benzyl group gave multiple azahelicenes via double rearrangement, while those with an&#160;N&#8208;benzoyl group gave aza[9]helicene and quadruple [4]helicene in the former and latter cases, respectively. The reaction mechanisms on the divergent reaction pathways were investigated by DFT calculations, which well supported the experimental results.</dc:description>

Polymerization is recognized as an effective method for generating stable and luminescent radical polymers with both main&#8208;chain and side&#8208;chain structures. The intra&#8208; and interchain through&#8208;space interactions within these polymers play a crucial role in enhancing stability and luminescent performance compared to small radical molecules.







Abstract
Organic radicals are gaining significant interest in luminescent materials due to their unique properties, which present unprecedented opportunities for innovation across various fields, from display technology to biomedical applications. However, addressing challenges related to stability and low fluorescence efficiency is crucial to unlocking their full potential for practical applications. Polymerization has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance intra&#8208; and interchain through&#8208;space interactions, enabling the creation of stable luminescent radicals with excellent processing and multifunctional properties. This concept emphasizes the strategic use of polymerization in designing and synthesizing stable main&#8208;chain and side&#8208;chain radical polymers. This approach not only broadens the scope of stable radicals but also improves their luminescence properties as photofunctional materials.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Titanate Perovskites in the Oxidation of Amines via Photocatalysis</title>

Titanate perovskites, SrTiO3 and CaTiO3, were synthesised via hydrothermal approaches, with temperature and pressure parameters adjusted to optimise material purity. The selective ability of these materials for the photocatalytic oxidative self&#8208;coupling of benzylamine to produce N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine was evaluated under mild conditions, with CTO emerging as the most efficient catalyst for this reaction.







Abstract
Considering that structural differences could affect the photocatalytic efficiency of titanate perovskites, cubic SrTiO3 (STO) and tetragonal CaTiO3 (CTO) were synthesised as models to elucidate the structure&#8208;activity relationship. STO and CTO materials were produced through hydrothermal approaches, adjusting parameters such as temperature and pressure to optimise material purity. Among the perovskite photocatalysts, two stand out for their exceptional photocatalytic capacity and crystalline purity: CaTiO3, prepared at 180&#8201;&#176;C for 36&#8197;h, and SrTiO3, synthesised at 200&#8201;&#176;C for 24&#8197;h. Notably, we explore the selective ability of these materials for the photocatalytic oxidative self&#8208;coupling of benzylamine (BZA) to produce N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine (BZI), with CaTiO3 emerging as the most efficient catalyst for this reaction. The CTO material prepared at 180&#8201;&#176;C for 36&#8197;h (CTO180T&#8208;36) achieved a peak BZI production of 0.5&#8197;mM, with a total conversion of BZA after 7&#8197;h of irradiation. This study also emphasises the crucial role of reaction conditions and perovskite morphologies in fine&#8208;tuning photocatalytic performance. These findings highlight opportunities for developing efficient and selective photocatalytic processes, holding the compromise for applications in organic synthesis and sustainable green chemistry.

         <title>The Roles of Molecular Concavities in the Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Giant Tetrahedra for CO2 Uptake</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant tetrahedral molecules possess both trigonal and tetragonal concavities. Analysis of the close&#8208;packed structures of tetrahedral molecules indicates that occupation of the trigonal concavity of the tetrahedral molecules generates 1D supramolecular columns, while the tetragonal concavities become occupied during the formation of neighboring supramolecular columns.







Abstract
Giant tetrahedral molecules have sparked significant interest in the past decade due to their unique and diverse supramolecular nanostructures. The longer and bulkier peripheral substituents create deep molecular concavities and thus contribute to the different self&#8208;assembly behaviors compared to the conventional small tetrahedral molecules. In this study, a molecular giant tetrahedra, TetraNDI, was synthesized to investigate the important roles of the molecular concavities in the self&#8208;assembly mechanism. Single&#8208;crystal structural characterizations indicate that the TetraNDI takes its trigonal concavities to form 1D supramolecular columns, and its tetragonal concavities to reach close inter&#8208;columnar packing. The difficulty in occupying the concavities leads to the path&#8208;dependent phase behaviors of the giant tetrahedra. It is also found that the remaining molecular concavities in the supramolecular scaffolds affect the CO2 affinity of TetraNDI. With an understanding of the packing principles of molecular giant tetrahedra, the structure&#8208;property relationships could be better evaluated in the future and might broaden the horizon of porous materials.

         <title>NIR Diradical&#8208;Featured Croconaine Nanoagent for Cancer Photoacoustic Imaging and Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>

A stable diradical&#8208;featured croconaine CR845 showed a NIR absorption at 845&#8197;nm (&#1013;=3.37&#215;105&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and a relatively high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 58.8&#8201;%. CR845 nanoparticles showed good photostability, good biocompatibility, favorable NIR photoacoustic potential, effective cancer cell killing and complete tumor elimination upon 850&#8197;nm laser irradiation.







Abstract
Radical&#8208;featured organic materials usually demonstrate significantly narrower bandgap than that of regular organic materials, which is beneficial for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and non&#8208;radiative decay process, making them good candidates for photothermal agents (PTAs) of photothermal therapy (PTT). However, most organic radicals are too short&#8208;lived to be separated and stable. Herein, a stable pyrylium&#8208;croconaine (CR) dye CR845 with high diradical character was synthesized and assembled into CR845 nanoparticles (NPs) to explore the photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapeutic performance under NIR irradiation in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. CR845 exhibited a stable NIR absorption at 845&#8197;nm (&#1013;=3.37&#215;105&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and a relatively high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 58.8&#8201;%. When assembled into nanoparticles, CR845 NPs showed good photostability, good biocompatibility, favorable NIR photoacoustic potential, effective cancer cell killing and complete tumor elimination upon 850&#8197;nm laser irradiation. The work demonstrates a diradical&#8208;featured CR PTA with favorable PAI/PTT effects, which can help to provide new ideas for the development of NIR PTAs, and further promote the application of organic radical materials in the field of biomedicine.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Air&#8208;stable N&#8208;type Organic Field&#8208;effect Transistor (OFET) Properties of Functionalized&#8208;phenanthrene Conjugated Asymmetric N&#8208;heteroacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of functionalized&#8208;phenanthrene conjugated asymmetric N&#8208;heteroacenes are prepared, and their applications in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are explored, achieving air&#8208;stable electron&#8208;transporting mobilities up to 4.27 x 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. In particular, Br modification at certain positions of phenanthrene is proven to be beneficial in adjusting the thin&#8208;film properties for the improvement of OFET performances.







Abstract
The development of stable high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors for applications in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) under ambient conditions is desirable but challenging. To address this issue, we here synthesized a series of functionalized&#8208;phenanthrene conjugated asymmetric N&#8208;heteroacenes, where the phenanthrene moiety was modified by N substitution or Br functionalization at different positions to induce various degrees of asymmetry in their structures. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these molecules were studied, and their packing patterns were analysed. The OFETs based on these materials were fabricated through simple spin&#8208;coating method, and the as&#8208;resulted thin films were treated with different conditions. The devices exhibit typical n&#8208;type performances under ambient conditions with charge carrier mobilities up to 4.27&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The crystallinities and morphologies of these thin films were studied to investigate the correlations between the device performances and thin&#8208;film characteristics. Our study suggests that phenanthrene conjugated N&#8208;heteroacenes can be developed as promising air&#8208;stable solution&#8208;processable n&#8208;type semiconducting materials, and Br modification at certain positions of phenanthrene is beneficial in adjusting the thin&#8208;film properties for the improvement of OFET performances.

&lt;p&gt;A series of functionalized-phenanthrene conjugated asymmetric N-heteroacenes are prepared, and their applications in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are explored, achieving air-stable electron-transporting mobilities up to 4.27 x 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In particular, Br modification at certain positions of phenanthrene is proven to be beneficial in adjusting the thin-film properties for the improvement of OFET performances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of stable high-performance n-type organic semiconductors for applications in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) under ambient conditions is desirable but challenging. To address this issue, we here synthesized a series of functionalized-phenanthrene conjugated asymmetric N-heteroacenes, where the phenanthrene moiety was modified by N substitution or Br functionalization at different positions to induce various degrees of asymmetry in their structures. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these molecules were studied, and their packing patterns were analysed. The OFETs based on these materials were fabricated through simple spin-coating method, and the as-resulted thin films were treated with different conditions. The devices exhibit typical n-type performances under ambient conditions with charge carrier mobilities up to 4.27&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The crystallinities and morphologies of these thin films were studied to investigate the correlations between the device performances and thin-film characteristics. Our study suggests that phenanthrene conjugated N-heteroacenes can be developed as promising air-stable solution-processable n-type semiconducting materials, and Br modification at certain positions of phenanthrene is beneficial in adjusting the thin-film properties for the improvement of OFET performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient and Selective Synthesis of Renewable Isoprene Over Mo&#8208;Fe&#8208;O and MgO/Mg(OH)2 Composite Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct synthesis of renewable isoprene from bio&#8208;sourced methanol and isobutene was achieved via a novel Prins tandem route on Mo&#8722;Fe oxide and MgO/Mg(OH)2 composite catalysts. Spectroscopic characterization experiments together with DFT calculations reveal that the excellent catalytic performance is closely related to the appropriate proportion of basic and acidic OH groups after MgO hydration.







Abstract
Synthesis of renewable isoprene continues to attract significant interest, yet catalysts still need improvement for industrial applications. We report herein an efficient and novel Prins tandem approach for highly selective production of isoprene from bio&#8208;based methanol and isobutene over Mo&#8208;Fe&#8722;O and MgO/Mg(OH)2 acid&#8208;base bifunctional catalysts. Hydration decreases the number of strong basic sites O2&#8722; ions and increases OH groups over MgO, thus improving the isoprene selectivity. Basic OH on Mg(OH)2 promotes the Prins condensation of formaldehyde and isobutene, while acidic OH promotes dehydration of isoprenol to isoprene. Suitable contents and proportions of basic and acidic OH groups over Mg(OH)2 increase isoprene selectivity and methanol conversion to 90 and 92&#8201;% on the Mo&#8208;Fe&#8722;O+Mg(OH)2 composite catalysts, respectively. It exhibits good recycling stability, with isoprene selectivity remaining 90&#8201;% after five successive regenerations. DFT calculations reveal OH groups formed after hydration reduce the energy barrier of the H transfer step, thereby promoting the overall reaction.

Natural coconut silk is employed to synthesize a CSC with hierarchical pore structure and rich oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, which is used to compound with Si to obtain CSC/Si composite, and delivers decent electrochemical performances.







Abstract
Silicon (Si) is considered to be one of the most promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries because of its abundant reserves, low discharge potential, and most importantly, its high theoretical specific capacity. However, the practical application of Si&#8208;based anodes is mainly hindered by the low intrinsic conductivity of Si and the large volume change upon lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation. In order to improve the electrochemical performance of Si&#8208;based anodes, we prepared a composite material consisting of Si nanoparticles (NPs) and coconut silk bio&#8208;carbon (CSC) skeleton. The porous carbon skeleton derived from coconut silk with natural through&#8208;holes and ample micropores on the wall, which was used as the carrier of Si NPs. The continuous through&#8208;holes and well&#8208;distributed oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups of the CSC provided sufficient space and abundant adsorption active sites for Si NPs, what&#8216;s more, the good dispersion of Si NPs in the through&#8208;holes increased their contact with the surrounding carbon materials, which was conducive to electron transport. Meanwhile, the pore structure also provided buffer space for the volume expansion of Si. The rich oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups can form a certain chemical force with silicon particles, and further stabilize the nano silicon particles. Hence, the CSC/Si electrode revealed an excellent capacity retention of 82.8&#8201;% at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. This study provides a simple universal high&#8208;throughput method to obtain anode materials with outstanding electrochemical properties and promotes the further development of Si/C composites.

The pH&#8208;dependent photophysics of three push&#8208;pull pyridines is addressed through steady&#8208;state and ultrafast spectroscopies. Aggregation is the key to multi&#8208;responsive fluorophores: appealing pKa values for cancer cell recognition; enhanced fluorescence efficiencies (&#966;F) for both neutral (Py&#8208;1) and protonated (Py&#8208;1(H+)) species, leading to acido(fluoro)chromism; longer singlet lifetimes (&#966;F) allowing the Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT) crucial for applications as photobases.







Abstract
The pH effect on the photophysics of three push&#8208;pull compounds bearing dimethoxytriphenylamine (TPA&#8208;OMe) as electron donor and pyridine as electron acceptor, with different ortho&#8208;functionalization (&#8722;H, &#8722;Br, and &#8722;TPA&#8208;OMe), is assessed through steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques in DMSO/water mixed solutions and in water dispersions over a wide pH range. The enhanced intramolecular charge transfer upon protonation of the pyridinic ring leads to the acidochromic (from colorless to yellow) and acido(fluoro)chromic (from cyan to pink) behaviours of the investigated compounds. In dilute DMSO/buffer mixtures these molecules exhibited low pKa values (&#8804;3.5) and extremely short singlet lifetimes. Nevertheless, it is by exploiting the aggregation phenomenon in aqueous environment that the practical use of these compounds largely expands: i) the basicity increases (pKa&#8776;4.5) approaching the optimum values for pH&#8208;sensing in cancer cell recognition; ii) the fluorescence efficiencies are boosted due to Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE), making these compounds appealing as fluorescent probes; iii) longer singlet lifetimes enable Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer, paving the way for the application of these molecules as photobases (pKa*=9.1). The synergy of charge and proton transfers combined to the AIE behaviour in these pyridines allows tunable multi&#8208;responsive optical properties providing valuable information for the design of new light&#8208;emitting photobases.

         <title>Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry Unveils Nsp10 Inhibitors with Antiviral Potential Against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates antiviral strategies targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 by disrupting the protein&#8208;protein interactions of Nsp10 with Nsp14 and Nsp16, which are essential for viral survival. It employs target&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry for the identification and synthesis of inhibitors. Evaluation of these inhibitors for their binding affinity, enzymatic&#8208;activity inhibition, and antiviral effects, offers novel insights for developing therapeutics against coronaviruses.







Abstract
The development of antiviral drugs against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) responsible for the recent Covid&#8208;19 pandemic is crucial, as treatment options remain limited and vaccination does not prevent (re)infection. Two relatively underexplored targets of this virus are the 3&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; exoribonuclease (ExoN) and the 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methyltransferase (2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;MTase), both essential for viral viability. The non&#8208;structural proteins Nsp14 and Nsp16 exhibit enzymatic activities for ExoN and 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;MTase, respectively, especially when in complex with their co&#8208;factor protein Nsp10. The study focuses on the use of target&#8208;directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (tdDCC) to identify binders of Nsp10, aiming to disturb the protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPI) involving Nsp10&#8208;Nsp14, as well as Nsp10&#8208;Nsp16. We synthesised the hits and evaluated them to assess Nsp10 affinity, ExoN and 2&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;MTase activities inhibition, and antiviral activity in hCoV&#8208;229E and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;infected whole&#8208;cell settings.

     alt="Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry Unveils Nsp10 Inhibitors with Antiviral Potential Against SARS-CoV-2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study investigates antiviral strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 by disrupting the protein-protein interactions of Nsp10 with Nsp14 and Nsp16, which are essential for viral survival. It employs target-directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry for the identification and synthesis of inhibitors. Evaluation of these inhibitors for their binding affinity, enzymatic-activity inhibition, and antiviral effects, offers novel insights for developing therapeutics against coronaviruses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of antiviral drugs against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the recent Covid-19 pandemic is crucial, as treatment options remain limited and vaccination does not prevent (re)infection. Two relatively underexplored targets of this virus are the 3&#8242;-5&#8242; exoribonuclease (ExoN) and the 2&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase (2&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-MTase), both essential for viral viability. The non-structural proteins Nsp14 and Nsp16 exhibit enzymatic activities for ExoN and 2&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-MTase, respectively, especially when in complex with their co-factor protein Nsp10. The study focuses on the use of target-directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry (tdDCC) to identify binders of Nsp10, aiming to disturb the protein-protein interactions (PPI) involving Nsp10-Nsp14, as well as Nsp10-Nsp16. We synthesised the hits and evaluated them to assess Nsp10 affinity, ExoN and 2&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-MTase activities inhibition, and antiviral activity in hCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2-infected whole-cell settings. This study reports a novel class of ExoN and/or 2&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-MTase inhibitors exhibiting antiviral activity against coronaviruses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Correlation Between NMR Coupling Constants and &#963;&#8208;Donating Properties of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed comparison of &#963;&#8208;donation indicators, including the calculated 1JC&#8722;H coupling constant, across a broad spectrum of diverse carbenes provides new insights into their strengths and limitations. This study highlights the utility of 1JC&#8722;H for assessing &#963;&#8208;donation in structurally similar carbenes, while revealing its constraints for carbenes with significantly different frameworks, offering guidance for evaluating electronic properties.







Abstract
Is the 1JC&#8722;H coupling constant for protonated carbene a relevant measure of its &#963;&#8208;donation ability? This paper addresses this question by comparing calculated 1JC&#8722;H values with various experimental and theoretical approaches across a broad spectrum of carbene compounds. We examined Arduengo&#8208;type NHCs based on the 2&#8208;imidazolylidene scaffold and many other derivatives with modified frameworks, including carbenes with extended, saturated, or conjugated rings, reduced heteroatom stabilization, alternative heteroatoms, permanently charged carbenes, acyclic carbenes, amidocarbenes, and cyclic amino(alkyl/aryl) carbenes, carbodicarbenes and carbodiphosphoranes. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between different parameters associated with &#963;&#8208;interaction, such as 1JC&#8722;H, Huynh electronic parameter (HEP), &#963;&#8208;donation from ETS&#8208;NOCV, and lone pair energy. Notably, the best correlation was observed between 1JC&#8722;H and the ETS&#8208;NOCV method, particularly for mono&#8208; and diaminocarbenes, highlighting the utility of 1JC&#8722;H in comparing &#963;&#8208;donation among structurally similar carbene types. However, the use of 1JC&#8722;H as a universal measure across all carbene classes appears limited, especially when considering carbenes with significantly different structural frameworks. While HEP is less effective for carbenes with diverse structural backbones, our study suggests that 1JC&#8722;H has potential across a broader range of systems. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates that lone pair energy reflects basicity rather than &#963;&#8208;donor ability.

         <title>Tuning of a Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework by Liquid&#8208;Assisted Mechanosynthesis between Trans&#8208;Aconitic Acid and Isonicotinamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) system was developed using trans&#8208;aconitic acid and isonicotinamide via mechanochemical milling. The crystal structures were determined by SCXRD, microcrystal electron diffraction and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction. PXRD verified the isostructurality, thermogravimetric analysis confirmed their stability and this study also showcase tunable HOF properties.







Abstract
Cocrystallization of trans&#8208;aconitic acid (TACA) and isonicotinamide (INA) using liquid assisted mechanochemical grinding results in a unique supramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) system encapsulating various organic solvents (liquid guest) with the formation of channel inclusion compounds. Dimension and shape of the framework is dependent on the solvent used during liquid assisted grinding (LAG). Although crystal structure of the cocrystal (TACA)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(INA)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(H2O)@(INA)0.5 has been determined by Single Crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), crystal structures of 3 cocrystal HOFs were determined by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction due to lack of suitable single crystal. PXRD analysis confirms isostructurality of various host&#8208;guest systems; whereas guest incorporation as well as stability of the HOFs were further confirmed using thermogravimetric analysis. This study demonstrates that the framework of HOFs can be tuned by varying solvent molecules used during LAG.

By liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (LCDSA) of copolymers consisting of star&#8208;like PAMAM and chain termini of liquid crystalline Azo units (PAMAM&#8208;Azo6), uniform multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like micelles containing an inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like core and platelet&#8208;like structure protruded for the core can be generated. It is found that the aggregation rate of PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 is one of the most important factors determining LCDSA behavior and morphology of formed micelles.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (LCDSA) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy to create uniform one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D), 2&#8208;D and 3&#8208;D nanostructures in a controlled manner. However, the examples of generation of uniform multi&#8208;morphology nanostructures from solution self&#8208;assembly of one single polymer sample are rare. Herein, we report the first example of preparation of multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like nanostructures consisting of an inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like core of uniform size and platelets protruded from the core by LCDSA of PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 (PAMAM=polyamidoamine, Azo=azobenzene) in methanol. It is disclosed that the different aggregation rates for PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 with varying contents of Azo units spontaneously separated nucleation and growth stages, which led to the formation of inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like cores (&#8220;seeds&#8221;) firstly, followed by the formation of platelets protruded from the edges of inner core to give &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like nanostructures. Additional annealing of initially formed &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like micelles will promote the rearrangement of Azo units to give thermodynamically&#8208;favored &#8220;perfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;shaped micelles with a uniform dimension both in the core and whole structure. This work not only provides an efficient strategy to create uniform multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;shaped nanostructures, but also reveals the essential impact of aggregation kinetics of liquid&#8208;crystalline&#8208;coil BCPs in the formation of multi&#8208;morphology nanostructures.

         <title>A Strongly Coupled 1T&#8217;&#8208;ReSe2@2H&#8208;MoSe2 van der Waals Heterostructure for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution at High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals heterostructure composed of 1T&#8217;&#8208;ReSe2 and 2H&#8208;MoSe2 exhibits exceptional catalytic capabilities in promoting the hydrogen evolution reaction, primarily attributed to the strong electronic interaction between 1T&#8217;&#8208;ReSe2 and 2H&#8208;MoSe2. Theoretical calculations indicate that hydrogen adsorption at the heterostructure exhibits an appropriate Gibbs free energy alteration conducive to the hydrogen evolution process.







Abstract
Developing efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for high current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is a pressing requirement for commercial industrial electrolyzers. In this study, a vertical 1T&#8217;&#8208;ReSe2@2H&#8208;MoSe2 van der Waals heterostructure was developed through interface engineering to enhance the advantages of each component and expose numerous active sites. Experimental investigations and density functional theory calculations demonstrate significant electronic coupling at the interface between 1T&#8217;&#8208;ReSe2 and 2H&#8208;MoSe2, with suitable Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption. The 1T&#8217;&#8208;ReSe2@2H&#8208;MoSe2 heterostructure catalyst achieves high current density HER with low overpotentials of 191&#8197;mV to generate up to 800&#8197;mA/cm2 in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4, outperforming commercial 5&#8201;% Pt/C catalysts. Moreover, this catalyst exhibits rapid reaction kinetics and long&#8208;term durability, illustrating a successful approach to designing efficient heterostructure electrocatalysts for hydrogen production through interface engineering.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Hydrothermal Synthesis of Glucose&#8208;Induced Low Crystallinity NiCo&#8208;Based Layered Double Hydroxides for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>

Supercapacitor electrodes: Glucose induced NiCo&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (NiCoLDH) to produce excellent electrode structure, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor.







Abstract
In order to improve the electrochemical performance of NiCo&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (NiCoLDH), the synthesis of low&#8208;crystallinity NiCoLDH was induced by the adsorption of glucose and NiCoLDH. The results showed that glucose could not only effectively regulate the pore structure and morphology of NiCoLDH, but also had a regular effect on crystallinity. Pure phase NiCoLDH had higher crystallinity. When the mass of glucose is 0.05&#8197;g, the prepared NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 is a short&#8208;range ordered structure embedded in the amorphous matrix. The crystallinity of the product decreases further with the further increase of glucose mass. Since the ordered structures have higher electrical conductivity, and amorphous structures have more defects and active sites, the structure of NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 is conducive to achieving the best electrochemical performance. Electrochemical test results show that NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 has a high specific capacitance, about 12 times that of the pure phase NiCoLDH, the mass of glucose is higher than or below 0.05&#8197;g, the specific capacitance will be further reduced. NiCoLDH&#8208;0.05 and activated carbon assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor have a power density of 400&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 32.7&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This study provides a new idea for obtaining excellent electrochemical properties by adjusting LDH crystallinity.

         <title>Tuning Tetramethoxy&#8208;acridiniums for Fluorophores and Organic Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fluorescent tetramethoxy&#8208;acridinium (TMAcr+) become fluorescent when substituted with electron withdrawing groups, due to inhibition of intramolecular PET quenching. Fluorescence quantum yield up to &#966;f=20&#8201;% and a long fluorescence lifetime of &#964;f=9&#8197;ns in CH2Cl2 are obtained. The TMAcr+ can be used as photooxidants due to their excited state reduction potentials (E*red=1.6&#8197;V vs. SCE).







Abstract
Tetramethoxy substituted alkyl&#8208;acridiniums (TMAcr+) are readily available by facile nucleophilic aromatic substitution on tris(2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)carbenium, but are non&#8208;fluorescent, presumably due to intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer quenching. In this work we introduce electron withdrawing groups by electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, leading to fluorescence turn&#8208;on. The acridiniums are moderately fluorescent (&#966;f=20&#8201;%) with long fluorescene lifetimes (&#964;f=9&#8197;ns). The positive excited state reduction potentials (E*red=+1.6&#8197;V) make the TMAcr+ excellent electron acceptors in the excited state, and efficient reductive photoredox catalysts able to oxidize a broad range of substrates.

A high&#8208;nuclearity {Ni18} nanosized complex with an unprecedented &#8216;flying saucer&#8217; motif has been prepared from the organic chelate &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;methanol (mpmH) in conjunction with bridging azido and peroxido groups.

Abstract
A high&#8208;nuclearity {Ni18} complex (1) with a unique &#8216;flying saucer&#8217; motif has been prepared from the organic chelate, &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine&#8208;methanol (mpmH), in conjunction with bridging azido (N3&#8722;) and peroxido (O22&#8722;) ligands. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed the presence of both ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the metal centres in 1, and the stabilization of spin states with appreciable S values at two different temperature regimes. The end&#8208;on bridging azido and alkoxido groups are in all likelihood the ferromagnetic mediators, while the &#951;3:&#951;3:&#956;6&#8208;bridging peroxides most likely promote the antiparallel alignment of the metals&#8217; spin vectors, yielding an overall non&#8208;zero spin ground state for the centrosymmetric compound 1. Furthermore, the {Ni18} nanosized cluster behaves as a single&#8208;molecule magnet, exhibiting magnetic hysteresis at low temperatures and two relaxation processes at 15&#8197;K and 1.3&#8197;K, a very rare phenomenon in polynuclear magnetic 3d&#8208;metal clusters.

         <title>Translating Solid&#8208;Phase Conformational Memory in the Prophecy of Multi&#8208;stimuli Responsive Low Molecular Weight Gels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing flexible non&#8208;polar functional groups, a bis&#8208;urea based low molecular weight organogelator is synthesized. Three distinct polymorphic crystalline phases of the gelator were isolated with noticeable solubility differences. Different stimuli like heat&#8208;cool, sonication, shaking, grinding showed varied gelling performances among the polymorphic phases further corroborated with their solubility parameter in the respective gelling solvents.







Abstract
Polymorphism and its screening to select the best&#8208;performing form is in high demand. In low molecular weight organogels (LMWG), gelators are designed as they contain flexible groups, functionalities capable of varied H&#8208;bonding, and increased the potential to show polymorphism. We synthesized a bis&#8208;urea based LMWG G1 and isolated three distinct polymorphic phases (Form I, II, and III). G1 polymorphs showed noticeable differences in solubility; precisely, Form I is highly soluble compared to the other two. Gel screening was carried out for all three polymorphs using different stimuli like heat&#8208;cool, sonication, shaking, and grinding. Among the polymorphs, Form I was found to have better gelling ability which was reflected by the solvent scope, thermal stability (gel&#8208;sol transition temperature Tgel), minimum gelator concentration (M.G.C.), stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, morphology, and rheological properties. The differences in their gelation performance among the three polymorphs are associated with their solubility parameter. Stimuli like sonication, shaking, and grinding triggered Form I to form a gel. Form II and III responded to heat&#8208;cool stimuli only due to poor solubility. Therefore, it is noted crucial to add polymorph screening as an integral part of the gel synthesis to avoid problems associated with reproducibility in the gel prophecy of LMWG systems.

         <title>Triarylmethanol Derivatives with Ultralong Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>

Triphenylmethanol derivatives have been shown to display ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence and afterglow in both crystal and powder states in air at room temperature with afterglows of about 7&#8197;seconds, this material holds promise for static and dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Triphenylmethyl&#8208;based compounds such as rhodamines and fluoresceine representing an old and well&#8208;known class of triphenylmethane dyes, are widely used in fluorescent labeling of bioimaging. Inspired by ultralong room temperature phosphorescence of triphenylphosphine derivatives, herein we report a methoxy substituted triarylmethanol ((4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)diphenylmethanol, LJW&#8208;1) exhibits ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) under ambient condition with afterglows of about 7&#8197;seconds. Its multiple C&#8722;H&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; intermolecular interactions, C&#8722;H&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O intermolecular interactions, hydrogen bond and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions are beneficial for forming rigid environment in the aggregated state which is evidently an important factor in the appearance of excellent RTP. Different substituents on triarylmethanol result in compounds with different lifetimes varying from 7&#8197;&#956;s to 818&#8197;ms. The substituent effects on the phosphorescence of triarylmethanol derivatives provide an efficient method for the design of organic RTP materials and may be enlightening the phosphorescence research of triarylmethanol derivatives.

         <title>Isoreticular Contraction in Dicopper Paddle&#8208;Wheel&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Enhance C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isoreticualr MOFs of Cu&#8208;TPTC and Cu&#8208;ABTC were meticulously prepared. By strategically incorporating an azo group in place of a phenyl ring in the tetracarboxylate linker, Cu&#8208;ABTC demonstrated a modest decrease in pore size while retaining high porosity relative to Cu&#8208;TPTC. This modification led to a marked improvement in C2H2 adsorption capacity and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity of Cu&#8208;ABTC, along with an extended breakthrough time.







Abstract
Achieving a balance between high selectivity and uptake is a formidable challenge for the purification of acetylene from mixtures with carbon dioxide, particularly when seeking to maximize both C2H2 adsorption capacity and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity in crystalline porous materials. In this study, leveraging the principles of reticular chemistry, we selected two tetracarboxylate&#8208;based linkers and combined them with Cu2+ ions to synthesize two isoreticular dicopper paddle&#8208;wheel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs): Cu&#8208;TPTC (terphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid, H4TPTC) and Cu&#8208;ABTC (3,3,5,5&#8208;azobenzenetetracarboxylic acid, H4ABTC). The structural and sorption analyses revealed that Cu&#8208;ABTC, despite having slightly smaller pores due to the strategic replacement of a phenyl ring with an azo group between two tetratopic ligands, maintains high porosity compared to Cu&#8208;TPTC. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;ABTC outperforms Cu&#8208;TPTC in terms of C2H2 adsorption capacity (196&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar) and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity (16.5~5.6). These findings were corroborated by dynamic breakthrough experiments and computational modeling. This research highlights the potential of the isoreticular contraction strategy in enhancing MOFs for sophisticated gas adsorption and separation processes.

         <title>Guest Diffusion Versus Recrystallization in A Single Crystal: Two Growing Mechanisms for Griseofulvin Clathrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exposure of non&#8208;porous griseofulvin (GSF) polymorphs to vapor results in solvated forms via different mechanisms: guest diffusion (Form VI &#8211; acetonitrile (ACN) and dichloromethane (DCM)), or dissolution and recrystallization (Form I&#8211;DCM), depending on the nature and concentration of the guest.







Abstract
Griseofulvin represents a rare case of a close&#8208;packed organic apohost that can clathrate selected volatile guests in a solid&#8208;gas fashion. Inclusion mechanisms and solvent exchange were investigated by a combination of single crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, coupled to optical microscopy and thermal analyses. In particular, gas diffusion and dissolution/recrystallization are alternatively observed, depending on the host polymorph, as well as the chemical nature of the guest and its physical state.

         <title>Oxydiazomethylation of Alkenes via Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and modular approach for the direct 1,2&#8208;formyloxyl&#8208;diazomethylation of alkenes through visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis has been developed to assemble &#947;&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoesters.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Diazoesters belong to significantly important carbenoid precursors in synthetic chemistry. Diazomethylation&#8208;based difunctionalization of alkenes is highly valuable but remain nontrivial. Herein, we reported a general and modular approach for the direct 1,2&#8208;oxydiazomethylation of alkenes through visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis. This process exploits photocatalyzed strategy to convert alkenes to &#947;&#8208;formyloxyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diazoesters using &#945;&#8208;diazo iodonium salts as carbyne precursors, featuring wide substrate tolerance and broad late&#8208;stage diversifications. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of &#947;&#8208;carbocation&#8208;tethered &#945;&#8208;diazoesters plays a crucial role in trapping DMF and H2O to allow for this transformation.

         <title>S/Se&#8208;Annulated Star&#8208;Shaped Perylene Diimides (PDIs) with Large Two&#8208;Photon Absorption (TPA) Cross&#8208;Section in NIR&#8208;I Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel star&#8208;shaped fluorophores named PDI&#8722;S and PDI&#8722;Se are constructed by S/Se&#8208;fused perylene diimides (PDIs) connected with bicarbazole core. Particularly, PDI&#8722;S presents excellent two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;action (&#948;TPA) of 3775&#8197;GM excited with 800&#8197;nm light, which is the highest value based on PDIs motif in the NIR&#8722;I region (700&#8211;900&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) has attracted growing attention over recent years owing to the wide range of applications in organic nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. The quantitative sensitivity of a two&#8208;photon molecular entity is determined by its TPA cross&#8208;section (&#948;TPA). Perylene diimides (PDIs) are excellent n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials demonstrating distinguished thermal, optical, and chemical stability. Nonetheless, PDIs&#8208;based scaffolds exhibit poor &#948;TPA in the NIR&#8722;I region (700&#8211;900&#8197;nm) due to the lack of suitable molecular design. Here, two novel star&#8208;shaped PDIs fluorophores, namely PDI&#8722;S and PDI&#8722;Se, were constructed by four periphery S/Se&#8208;fused PDIs connected with bicarbazole core. PDI&#8722;S manifested excellent &#948;TPA of 3775&#8197;GM, which are among the highest values reported for PDIs excited in the NIR&#8722;I region.

         <title>Cyclometalated IrIII Complex Possessing Chiral MIC ligand: Regiospecific sp3 C&#8722;H Activation and Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation of Ketone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium(III) complex with a chiral&#8208;MIC ligand where the IrIII undergone an additional Ir&#8722;Calkyl bond formation via regiospecific sp3 C&#8722;H bond activation, was synthesized. The chiral&#8208;MIC complex was employed in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketone, and up to 92&#8201;% ee was achieved.







Abstract
Cyclometalation offers a wide number of organometallic metallacycles showing diverse applications. However, such NHC complexes synthesized via an sp3 C&#8722;H bond activation are rare. An iridium(III) complex with a chiral mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (MIC) ligand, where the IrIII forms an additional Ir&#8722;C bond via a regiospecific sp3 C&#8722;H bond activation at the N&#8208;methylbenzyl wingtip, was synthesized and characterized. To our best knowledge, this represents the first example of cyclometalated iridium(III) complex possessing a chiral MIC donor ligand. The formation of the complex was followed by 2D correlation NMR spectroscopy and the molecular formula mass was evidenced by ESI&#8208;HRMS mass spectrometry. The molecular structure of the IrIII&#8208;MIC complex was unambiguously established by the single crystal XRD data. This cyclometalated IrIII complex was employed in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of 4&#8208;bromoacetophenone, and the complex was successful to transfer chirality to the final alcohol molecules (up to 92&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Modulating the Supramolecular Assembly of &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin and Anderson&#8208;type Polyoxometalate through Covalent Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here the supramolecular complexion of &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;CDs) and the covalently modified Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs). It is demonstrated that the covalent modification mode of the Anderson POMs has a profound influence on the resulting supramolecular complexes, which feature novel organic&#8208;inorganic pseudo&#8208;rotaxane structures and stable chirality transfer in aqueous solutions due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A series of unprecedented supramolecular complexes of covalently modified Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;CDs) have been obtained and characterized in solid state by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and in aqueous solution using various techniques including 1H DOSY NMR, 2D NOESY 1H NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and electrospray ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectroscopy (ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS). It has been demonstrated that the supramolecular assembly process could be modulated by different covalent modification modes of the Anderson POMs, giving rise to a new type of POM/&#945;&#8208;CD complexes featuring organic&#8208;inorganic pseudo&#8208;rotaxane structures, which are in good contrast to those of POM/&#947;&#8208;CD complexes of poly&#8208;rotaxane structures.

     alt="Modulating the Supramolecular Assembly of &#945;-Cyclodextrin and Anderson-type Polyoxometalate through Covalent Modifications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report here the supramolecular complexion of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-cyclodextrins (&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-CDs) and the covalently modified Anderson-type polyoxometalates (POMs). It is demonstrated that the covalent modification mode of the Anderson POMs has a profound influence on the resulting supramolecular complexes, which feature novel organic-inorganic pseudo-rotaxane structures and stable chirality transfer in aqueous solutions due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of unprecedented supramolecular complexes of covalently modified Anderson-type polyoxometalates (POMs) and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-cyclodextrins (&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-CDs) have been obtained and characterized in solid state by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and in aqueous solution using various techniques including &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H DOSY NMR, 2D NOESY &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (ESI-TOF-MS). It has been demonstrated that the supramolecular assembly process could be modulated by different covalent modification modes of the Anderson POMs, giving rise to a new type of POM/&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-CD complexes featuring organic-inorganic &lt;i&gt;pseudo&lt;/i&gt;-rotaxane structures, which are in good contrast to those of POM/&lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-CD complexes of poly-rotaxane structures. Moreover, it is delighted to find that these &lt;i&gt;pseudo&lt;/i&gt;-rotaxanes of POM/&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-CD complexes exhibit stable chirality in aqueous solution, which has not been accomplished in previously reported POM/CD assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nutation Spectroscopy of a Weakly Interacting Heterobimetallic Spin System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An heterobimetallic VIV&#8722;CuII complex is synthesized by a modular process involving external coordination sites of a porphyrinato ligand and a PdII linker. Pulsed Electron Paramagnetic Resonance experiments, in particular spin nutation spectroscopy at variable microwave powers or magnetic fields, reveals weak but non&#8208;negligible magnetic interactions and the presence of two transitions of different tipping angles.







Abstract
The use of VIV and CuII spins to design weakly coupled and dissymmetric spin systems has been examined. Such systems were synthesized using porphyrin&#8208;based complexes, with external coordination sites allowing for the formation of dimers via a PdII linker ion. Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy allowed the unequivocal magnetic characterization of the mononuclear precursors VO and Cu. The porphyrin dimer (VO)PdCu presented a broad and overlapped spectrum that was more pronounced than for the previously reported (VO)Pd(VO), hinting at the effect of weak interspin interactions between dissimilar spins. Pulsed EPR experiments on VO, (VO)Pd(VO) and (VO)PdCu samples diluted in a diamagnetic matrix confirmed that this complication is also present in the Field&#8208;Swept Echo&#8208;Detected (FSED) spectra of the heterometallic (VO)PdCu system. Despite the strongly overlapped field&#8208;swept spectra, spin nutation experiments revealed two distinct oscillations in the case of (VO)PdCu, which are assigned to transitions with different spin characters. Remarkably, coherence is retained above liquid nitrogen temperatures for all complexes, in particular up to 295&#8197;K for VO and (VO)Pd(VO) and 150&#8197;K for (VO)PdCu.

         <title>Enhanced Efficiency and Intrinsic Stability of Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells Through Dimethylamine&#8208;Based Cation Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the DMA cation into triple cation perovskites significantly altered the crystal structure and grain growth of the perovskite films. This modification inhibited halide segregation and enhanced carrier mobility. As a result, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.9&#8201;% was achieved for wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs with a bandgap of 1.68&#8197;eV. Furthermore, the stability of PSCs based on DMA&#8208;doped perovskite was substantially improved. After exposure to ambient air for 1500&#8197;hours, the unencapsulated device retained an impressive 80.6&#8201;% of its initial efficiency. This demonstrates the great potential of DMA doping for developing stable and efficient wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs.







Abstract
High efficiency and stable wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are crucial for the development of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells. However, the efficiency and stability of WBG PSCs are compromised by significant phase segregation and surface defects. In this study, we introduce a cation engineering strategy for WBG perovskite, employing a two&#8208;step sequential method that incorporates dimethylamine hydroiodide (DMAI) into the lead halide complex during the initial step. The addition of DMAI modifies the crystal structure and grain growth of the perovskite film, leading to improved crystal quality, reduced photo&#8208;induced halide segregation, decreased defect density, and enhanced charge carrier mobility. Consequently, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.9&#8201;% for 1.68&#8197;eV WBG PSCs. Furthermore, the stability of PSCs based on DMA&#8208;doped perovskite was significantly improved. After 1500&#8197;hours of exposure to ambient air, the unencapsulated device retained an impressive 80.6&#8201;% of its initial efficiency. This result highlights the substantial potential for stable and efficient WBG PSCs.

         <title>Unlocking the Chemical and Structural Complexity of Aluminum Hydroxy Acetates: from Commodity Chemicals to Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput investigation involving more than 330 reactions in the system Al3+/CH3COOH/NaOH/H2O permitted the elucidation of the synthesis&#8208;structure relationship and allowed us to shed light on the structural chemistry and porosity of aluminum acetates for the first time. The robust synthesis procedures permitted scale&#8208;up under mild reaction conditions in high yields.







Abstract
Aluminum acetates have been in use for more than a century, but despite their widespread commercial applications, essential scientific knowledge of their synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships is lacking. High&#8208;throughput screening, followed by fine tuning and extensive optimization of reaction conditions using Al3+, OH&#8722; and CH3COO&#8722; ions, has unraveled their complex synthetic chemistry, yielding for the first time the four phase pure products Al(OH)(O2CCH3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x H2O (x=0, 2) (1A and CAU&#8208;65, 1B), Al3O(HO2CCH3)(O2CCH3)7 (2), and the porous aluminum salt [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12](OH)4 (CAU&#8208;55&#8208;OH, 3). Structure determination by electron and X&#8208;ray diffraction was carried out and the data suggested porosity for 1B and 3, which was confirmed by physisorption experiments. Even the scale&#8208;up to the 10&#8197;L scale was accomplished for 1A, 1B and 3 with yields of up to 1.1&#8197;kg (99&#8201;%). This study of a seemingly simple chemical system provides important information on both fundamental inorganic chemistry and porous materials.

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalysed Synthesis of (R)&#8208;Mandelic Acid Esters and &#945;&#8208;Alkoxy Derivatives from Commercial Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first catalytic one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of optically active (R)&#8208;mandelic acids, esters and &#945;&#8208;alkoxy ester derivatives has been developed. The value&#8208;added final compounds have been obtained in high overall yield (26&#8211;94&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 97&#8201;% ee), through a straightforward route from commercially and widely available reagents, including aldehydes, water, alcohols and the organocatalyst.







Abstract
Optically active mandelic acid esters represent a highly valuable class of building blocks in organic synthesis and recurrent motifs embedded in bioactive compounds and drugs. Herein, we provide an enantioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis based on Knoevenagel condensation/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring&#8208;opening hydrolysis (DROH) sequence to the crude mandelic acids, which underwent a final esterification step to (R)&#8208;methyl mandelates. These products have been obtained in good to high overall yield and enantioselectivity, using commercially and widely available reagents and catalyst including aldehydes, phenylsulfonyl acetonitrile, cumyl hydroperoxide, water and an epi&#8208;quinine&#8208;derived urea as the organocatalyst. Moreover, the versatility of the process has been demonstrated to prepare the corresponding &#945;&#8208;alkoxy esters in highly enantioselective manner, when using primary alcohols in a domino ring&#8208;opening esterification (DROE) step. This system is a first example of non&#8208;enzymatic catalytic one&#8208;pot protocol which allows a straightforward asymmetric synthesis of highly valuable mandelic acid derivatives from aldehyde feedstocks.

&lt;p&gt;A first catalytic one-pot chemical synthesis of optically active (R)-mandelic acids, esters and &#945;-alkoxy ester derivatives has been developed. The value-added final compounds have been obtained in high overall yield (26&#8211;94&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 97&#8201;% ee), through a straightforward route from commercially and widely available reagents, including aldehydes, water, alcohols and the organocatalyst.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Amphiphiles based on Azadipyrromethenes: Consecutive Pathways to Nanodiscs and Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Consecutive self&#8208;assembly pathways were revealed for a metallo&#8208;supramolecular amphiphilic dye based on azadipyrromethenes, which led to the first formation of kinetic&#8208;controlled, nanodisc&#8208;shaped Agg. I and the further spontaneous transformation from Agg. I to the thermodynamically more stable Agg. II with a morphology of nanosheet.







Abstract
A new class of metallo&#8208;supramolecular amphiphilic dyes 1&#8201;a, b was constructed by using two azadipyrromethene units which were respectively modified with two hydrophobic alkyl and two hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) chains. The spectroscopic and morphological studies revealed the consecutive self&#8208;assembly pathways of 1&#8201;a in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent. The monomers of 1&#8201;a firstly aggregated into the kinetic&#8208;controlled, nanodisc&#8208;shaped Agg. I upon cooling and the latter spontaneously transformed into the thermodynamically more stable Agg. II with a nanosheet morphology. While the non&#8208;fluorescent Agg. I displayed a broad absorption band (&#955;max=615&#8197;nm), the Agg. II displayed a more intensive and narrowed J&#8208;band (&#955;max=693&#8197;nm) and a fluorescence band with a maximum at 760&#8197;nm (&#934;fl=0.1), which could be ascribed to the J&#8208;aggregation induced emission enhancement. The kinetics of Agg. I to Agg. II transformation was further modulated by seed&#8208;initiated supramolecular polymerization with various ratios of Seedagg.II, in which the transformation rate was significantly increased by ca. 2 orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous process. The supramolecular amphiphile 1&#8201;b bearing longer hydrophilic chains formed only one type aggregate, which exhibited spectroscopic and morphological properties that were highly comparable with that of Agg. I.

Photocatalysis offers a sustainable approach to chemical synthesis by using light energy to drive selective reactions. This study introduces titanate perovskites as promising photocatalysts that demonstrate selective efficiency in converting benzylamine to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine under mild conditions. Among the tested materials, CaTiO3 stands out with superior performance, underscoring its potential as an effective catalyst for light&#8208;driven chemical transformations.

         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature depicts an asymmetric one&#8208;pot synthesis of mandelic acid derivatives. A bifunctional organocatalyst selectively promotes two reactions leading to enantioenriched 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl epoxides, which undergo water&#8208;mediated ring&#8208;opening and then hydrolysis in a cascade process, yielding the products with high efficiency and enantioselectivity. The cover art shows the synthetic sequence with intermediates formed from atop a waterfall, highlighting the role of water in crucial steps.

A metallo&#8208;supramolecular amphiphilic dye has been constructed by using two azadipyrromethene units, one bearing two hydrophobic alkyl chains, the other two hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) chains. In EtOH/H2O (4:1, v/v), consecutive self&#8208;assembly pathways were observed for this dye that lead to the formation of kinetically controlled, non&#8208;emissive nanodisc&#8208;shaped aggregates (Agg. I) and thermodynamic J&#8208;type aggregates (Agg. II) with NIR emission and the morphology of a 2D nanosheet. More information can be found in the Research Article by Z.

         <title>Cover Feature: Unlocking the Chemical and Structural Complexity of Aluminum Hydroxy Acetates: from Commodity Chemicals to Porous Materials (Chem. Eur. J. 4/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The commercial importance and industrial&#8208;scale production of aluminum acetates for more than a century contrasts with our limited understanding of their synthesis, composition, and crystal structures. High&#8208;throughput (HT) screening of a seemingly simple chemical system, followed by fine tuning and extensive optimization of reaction conditions using AlCl3, NaOH, and CH3COOH in water, has unraveled the complex synthetic chemistry of aluminum acetates, yielding the four&#8208;phase pure products for the first time. Further HT optimization allowed the syntheses to be scaled up to the 10&#8197;L scale, and structure determination suggested porosity for two of the compounds; this was confirmed by physisorption experiments. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Ken&#8197;Inge, N. Stock and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403634).

         <title>Basics and Advances of Manganese&#8208;Based Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent achievements in manganese oxides with different polymorphs and nanostructures as potential cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). In particular, various strategies, including phase/defect engineering, element doping, and coupling with carbon materials or conducting polymers, are summarized and discussed in detail. The challenges and suggestions for the development of manganese oxides for ZIBs are put forward.







Abstract
It is greatly crucial to develop low&#8208;cost energy storage candidates with high safety and stability to replace alkali metal systems for a sustainable future. Recently, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have received tremendous interest owing to their low cost, high safety, wide oxidation states, and sophisticated fabrication process. Nanostructured manganese (Mn)&#8208;based oxides in different polymorphs are the potential cathode materials for the widespread application of ZIBs. However, Mn&#8208;based oxide materials suffer from several drawbacks, such as low electronic/ionic conductivity and poor cycling performance. To overcome these issues, various structural modification strategies have been adopted to enhance their electrochemical activity, including phase/defect engineering, doping with foreign atoms (e.&#8201;g., metal and/or nonmetal atoms), and coupling with carbon materials or conducting polymers. Herein, this review targets to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the above&#8208;mentioned strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of the cathodic part of ZIBs. The challenges and suggestions for the development of manganese oxides for ZIBs are put forward.

         <title>Supramolecular Chiral Assembly of Dendritic Amphiphiles in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 4, January 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances of supramolecular chiral assembly from dendritic amphiphiles in aqueous media are reviewed, from the points of dendritic topologic effects on confinement of the assembled morphologies and bio&#8208;related properties. Through cooperative and crowding effects, dendritic amphiphiles conduct intriguing assembles to form versatile morphologies and exhibit promising biofunctions.







Abstract
Dendritic amphiphiles are a promising class of topological blocks for self&#8208;assembly to construct chiral supramolecular aggregates in aqueous media. Their unique dendritic geometry, structure variability and multivalence can mediate the assemblies with versatile morphologies and functions. The bulky dendritic moieties also enable the appropriate association&#8208;repulsion balance to control supramolecular growth, and simultaneously shield the assemblies with enhanced stabilities. Moreover, the crowded packing of dendritic segments facilitates the efficient chirality transfer from molecular level to supramolecular level, to achieve chirality amplification or enhancement. Dendritic moieties also provide chances to stabilize the assemblies in aqueous media through shielding and cooperative effects. The dendritic assemblies can be intriguingly made responsive to external stimuli including temperature, light, solvents or guests to switch their nanostructures or supramolecular chirality. Various dendritic amphiphiles bearing peptide or aromatic motifs have been reported in supramolecular chiral assembly, and their functional applications investigated. This review summarizes the significant progresses with a particular focus on the dendritic structural effects on supramolecular chiral assembly and the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness in aqueous media.

Here, we overview the existing methods to functionalize their interfaces, which we categorize into coating strategies and methods based on emulsifiers as function carriers. We emphasize the importance of their liquid nature, from current challenges to perspectives for future studies and applications.







Abstract
Disperse systems, and emulsions in particular, are currently massively used in fields as varied as food industry, cosmetics, health care and environmentally&#8208;friendly materials. To meet increasingly precise needs or targeted applications, these systems need to be endowed with new functionalities at their interfaces, in addition to their composition and structural properties. However, due to the fragility of drops and the low reactivity of their surface, conventional solid surface chemistry cannot be used for such a purpose. Several specific emulsion interface functionalization techniques have thus been developed for targeted systems and applications, but a general framework has yet to be drawn. In this review, we attempt to present these methods in a unified way through the prism of what we may call &#8220;liquid surface chemistry&#8221;. We propose to categorize existing methods into drop&#8208;coating strategies, including layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer techniques and polymer coating, with a particular focus on polydopamine, and emulsifier&#8208;carrier approaches involving particles and/or amphiphilic molecules. They are discussed in a transversal way, highlighting the underlying physico&#8208;chemical principles and providing a comparative analysis of their advantages, current limitations and potential for improvement. We also propose future directions and opportunities, involving for instance DNA&#8208;based programmability or artificial intelligence, which could make liquid surface chemistry more versatile and controlled.

         <title>Binding&#8208;Site Directed Selection and Large&#8208;Scale Click&#8208;Synthesis of a Coagulation Factor XIa&#8208;Inhibiting Circular DNA Aptamer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Factor XIa (FXIa) is a plasma protease that&#160;plays a crucial role in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, making it a promising target for antithrombotic therapy.&#160;Circular DNA aptamers, with their dramatically enhanced biological and structural stability, hold great potential as new&#8208;generation DNA&#8208;based anticoagulants. However, the functional selection and large&#8208;scale synthesis of them remains a substantial challenge. Here, we explored a selection strategy to enrich circular DNA aptamers that can target the catalytic domain of FXIa and inhibit its function. An asymmetrical dumbbell structured DNA library featuring a hairpin&#8208;like primer&#8208;binding site was utilized for selection. This approach has resulted in the identification of a circular DNA aptamer, named FICAPT1, which exhibits high binding affinity (Kd&#160;= 20 nM), notable stability (half&#8208;life of 16 hours&#160;in human plasma) and outstanding anticoagulation&#160;activity (significantly prolonged aPTT), showing great promise as a novel anticoagulant. The hairpin&#8208;like constant region further served as a scaffold for the large&#8208;scale click&#8208;synthesis (&#160;~ 2 mg/mL) of the refined circular aptamer. The approach presented in this study enables the efficient generation of functional circular DNA aptamers and their synthesis at a satisfactory scale, making it adaptable for the production of various circular aptamers for therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydride Rebound: A Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP)&#8208;Type Cooperative Mechanism for H2&#160;Activation by a Potassium Aluminyl Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining experiment and theory, the mechanisms of H2 activation by the potassium&#8208;bridged aluminyl dimer K2[Al(NON)]2 (NON = 4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) and its monomeric K+&#8208;sequestered counterpart have been investigated. These systems show diverging reactivity towards the activation of dihydrogen, with the dimeric species undergoing formal oxidative addition of H2 at each Al centre under ambient conditions, and the monomer proving to be inert to dihydrogen addition. Noting that this K+ dependence is inconsistent with classical models of single&#8208;centre reactivity for carbene&#8208;like Al(I) species, we rationalize these observations instead by a cooperative frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;type mechanism (for the dimer) in which the aluminium centre acts as the Lewis base and the K+ centres as Lewis acids. In contrast to previous theoretical work on this precise system by Schaefer and co&#8208;workers, the potassium ions are shown to play explicit roles in stabilizing a nascent &#120583;2&#8208;bridging hydride, formed by heterolytic H&#8211;H bond cleavage (with accompanying protonation of the aluminium&#8208;centred lone pair). K&#8208;to&#8208;Al hydride &#8220;rebound&#8221; into the vacant aluminium&#8208;centred p&#8208;orbital then completes the net addition of H2 via sequential H+/H&#8208; transfer. The experimentally determined kinetic isotope effect (kH/kD = 2.6) reflects a high degree of bond activation in the transition state (as predicted quantum chemically).</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Buffering Mechanism Enhances Stability and Water Oxidation Efficiency of CeO2@NiFe&#8208;LDH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a hierarchically structured heterostructure catalyst, CeO2@NiFe LDH, was achieved through a straightforward two&#8208;step hydrothermal process. The electronic buffering mechanism provided by CeO2 enhanced the oxygen affinity at the surface of the heterojunction material, accelerated electron transfer for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In overall water splitting, the CeO2@NiFe LDH demonstrated excellent activity and stability.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide shows significant promise as an electrocatalyst in facilitating oxygen evolution reactions. But its development is hindered by low conductivity and insufficient cycling stability. Herein, the synthesis of a hierarchically structured heterostructure catalyst, CeO2@NiFe LDH, is reported through a straightforward two&#8208;step process involving hydrothermal treatment. The catalyst realizes a significant breakthrough in OER catalytic performance and stability. At a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the overpotentials amount to 255&#8197;mV in 1&#8197;M KOH, 263&#8197;mV in simulated seawater with alkaline conditions, and 346&#8197;mV in actual alkaline seawater. After 200&#8197;hours of continuous operation under high current density in simulated alkaline seawater, the morphology with no significant alterations observed, highlighting its high stability in complex seawater environments. Introducing CeO2 optimizes the binding energy of the OH intermediate, which facilitates the formation and dissociation of the OOH intermediate. In situ Raman analysis demonstrates the positive impact of CeO2 on the generation of active species. This research emphasizes the efficacy of CeO2 in improving the performance and durability of NiFe LDH for oxygen evolution reactions.

         <title>PDA/PMMA Blend Membrane Utilized for the Selective Adsorption and Separation of Heavy Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy metal ion pollution in water has severely threatened human health. Membrane separation technology is often used to adsorb and remove heavy metal ions from water. However, efficiently separating and removing heavy metal ions in water is still a challenging task. We fabricated a PDA/PMMA blend membrane drawing inspiration from mussel silk protein. Relying on the dopa group within the blend membrane, the selective adsorption and removal of heavy metal ions in water can be accomplished.







Abstract
The detrimental effects of heavy metal aqueous pollution are attracting people's attention increasingly. Membrane separation technology plays a pivotal role in the treatment of aqueous pollution due to its low energy consumption and excellent separation effect. Inspired by the strong adhesion of heavy metal ions by the dopamine in mussel protein, we have fabricated the 5&#8201;%, 10&#8201;%, 20&#8201;% and 30&#8201;% proportion of polydopamine (PDA)/Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blend membranes with dopamine structure by solvent&#8208;induced phase conversion. I&#8722;V current, UV titration and transmission tests examined the membrane's selective adsorption and retention capabilities for Fe3+, Cu2+ and Cr3+. These experiments indicated the different selectivity for Fe3+ of four blend membranes with varying PDA/PMMA fractions. Based on Langmuir's adsorption theory, the 10&#8201;% blend membranes exhibited the most outstanding selective adsorption for Fe3+ with an LOD of 4.724&#215;10&#8211;9 M. Moreover, the ability to retain Fe3+ is still close to 100&#8201;% after 48&#8197;h of transmission. This study manifested that the PDA/PMMA blend membrane is capable of adsorbing trace amounts of Fe3+ from water, thereby contributing to aqueous purification.

Inspired by the strong adhesion of heavy metal ions by the dopamine in mussel protein, we have fabricated the 5&#8201;%, 10&#8201;%, 20&#8201;% and 30&#8201;% proportion of polydopamine (PDA)/Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blend membranes with dopamine structure by solvent-induced phase conversion. I&#8722;V current, UV titration and transmission tests examined the membrane's selective adsorption and retention capabilities for Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. These experiments indicated the different selectivity for Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; of four blend membranes with varying PDA/PMMA fractions. Based on Langmuir's adsorption theory, the 10&#8201;% blend membranes exhibited the most outstanding selective adsorption for Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; with an LOD of 4.724&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;9&lt;/sup&gt; M. Moreover, the ability to retain Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is still close to 100&#8201;% after 48&#8197;h of transmission. This study manifested that the PDA/PMMA blend membrane is capable of adsorbing trace amounts of Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; from water, thereby contributing to aqueous purification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Prebiotic Route to Lactate from Acetaldehyde, Cyanide and Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dioxide (CO2) in prebiotic chemistry: CO2 facilitates the synthesis of crucial C3&#8208;building block, particularly lactate through redox&#8208;economic cycles involving cyanide (C1) and acetaldehyde (C2) under ambient conditions. Our findings lend support to theories regarding the emergence of life in CO2&#8208;rich environments, highlighting CO2&#8242;s significance in forming biologically relevant molecules, supporting both warm pond and hydrothermal vent theories.







Abstract
The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has fluctuated throughout Earth's history. However, the role of CO2 in prebiotic chemistry has been predominantly and limitedly postulated as a C1 precursor, which can be reduced to carbon monoxide or methane mimicking the Wood&#8208;Ljungdahl pathway. Herein we present neglected roles of CO2 as an active promoter in accessing biologically important C3&#8208;builidng blocks such as lactate, via redox&#8208;economic reaction cycles starting from cyanide (C1) and acetaldehyde (C2). We verified that Lewis acidic CO2 facilitates the formation of cyanohydrin of acetaldehyde under ambient conditions. Furthermore, selective protection of cyanohydrin to carbonate by atmospheric CO2 led to anchimeric assisted hydrolysis of the nitrile group to generate lactate. This work supports both warm pond and hydrothermal vent hypotheses, postulating that a CO2&#8208;rich primordial atmosphere and the acidic aqueous solution could have fostered the emergence of biologically relevant molecules and life itself.

         <title>Methane to Methanol Transformation on Cu2+/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite. Characterization of Copper State and Mechanism of the Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane to methanol transformation on Cu&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite has been studied by UV&#8208;vis, EPR, EXAFS, FTIR, MAS NMR methods. Methane activation is found to occur on paired Cu2+ sites with the surface methoxy species being formed. DFT calculations suggest methane activation occurs through the &#8220;alkyl&#8221; pathway and the formed copper&#8208;methyl species are further transformed to methoxy ones.







Abstract
Cu&#8208;modified zeolites provide methane conversion to methanol with high selectivity under mild conditions. The activity of different Cu&#8208;sites for methane transformation is still under discussion. Herein, ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite has been loaded with Cu2+ cations (1.4&#8197;wt&#8201;% Cu) as characterized by UV&#8208;vis DRS, EPR, EXAFS, and 1H MAS NMR. It is inferred that Cu2+ cations, attached to the cation&#8208;exchange Al&#8722;O&#8722;&#8722;Si sites of the zeolite framework, can exist in the form of either isolated or paired Cu2+ sites. The transformation of methane to methanol on Cu2+/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 has been verified by the observation of the methoxy species formation with 13C MAS NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. The related mechanisms have been analyzed by DFT calculations. The calculations show that the paired Cu2+ sites enable heterolytic C&#8722;H bond dissociation via the &#8220;alkyl&#8221; pathway resulting in methylcopper species, which however are not detected experimentally due to further rapid transformation to surface methoxy species through methyl radical formation and recombination with Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al site. Based on the obtained data, it has been concluded that methane transformation to methanol on paired Cu2+ sites, having no extra&#8208;framework oxygen ligand, is possible in Cu&#8208;modified zeolites. The pathways of Cu2+ cations regeneration with O2 and H2O have been experimentally explored.

         <title>Systematic Investigations of the Solid Solution Zr(V1&#8211;xAlx)2 Adopting the Laves Phase Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigations of the ternary system Zr&#8211;V&#8211;Al show that no superstructures can be observed within the solid solution Zr(V1&#8211;xAlx)2. For high values of x the hexagonal MgZn2 type structure is found while low values lead to the cubic MgCu2 type. 27Al MAS NMR investigations confirm the absence of ordered superstructures.







Abstract
Laves phases are an interesting field of research when it comes to structural chemistry and physical properties. Investigations of the ternary system Zr&#8211;V&#8722;Al showed, in contrast to the system Hf&#8211;V&#8722;Al, that no superstructures can be observed within the solid solution Zr(V1&#8211;xAlx)2. High values of x form aluminum rich phases that adopt the hexagonal MgZn2 type structure while low values of x lead to vanadium rich phases that adopt the cubic MgCu2 type. All samples were investigated by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. Single crystal studies indicated that no superstructure formation is present in the investigated samples. 27Al MAS NMR investigations confirmed these findings. For ZrAl2, quantum&#8208;chemical calculations helped with the analysis of the 27Al NMR spectrum of the binary endmember of the solid solution. Some of the prepared samples were investigated with respect to their magnetic properties. The investigated compounds show Pauli&#8208;paramagnetism, in Zr(V0.875Al0.125)2 in addition superconductivity with a critical temperature of TC=4.17(1)&#8197;K was observed. Investigations of compositions that do not belong to the Laves phase regime clearly indicate that the MgZn2 type structure is still the dominant phase. Regardless of the starting composition chosen, the hexagonal Laves phase was mostly present.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Volatile Pro&#8208;Dicamba Herbicide Inspired by Meclofenoxate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dicamba is a long&#8208;successful herbicide with an Achille's heel, namely its propensity to volatilize, drift and burn neighboring plants. Here we develop a non&#8208;volatile and efficacious pro&#8208;herbicide for dicamba by an ester coupling of 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol that is stable but becomes hydrolyzed once inside plants.







Abstract
Dicamba is a popular herbicide with rising use but is also notorious for volatility drift. Inspired by meclofenoxate, which we show to be highly herbicidal, we developed a derivative of dicamba with an ester&#8208;bond to 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol. It remained herbicidal but is non&#8208;volatile, entering plants intact and hydrolyzing inside leaves to dicamba and 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol. This pro&#8208;dicamba is compatible with the relatively novel dicamba monooxygenase tolerance technology, suggesting pro&#8208;dicamba might be a suitable, non&#8208;volatile replacement for dicamba.

         <title>Photoresponsive Helical Foldamers: Conformational Control Through Double Helix Formation and Light&#8208;Induced Protonation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mastering the shape adopted by helical foldamers is critical for future applications in pharmaceutics and materials sciences. Herein, we report a dual control on tetraphenylethylene&#8208;containing foldamers, since the helix shape could be tuned by means of simple concentration variations or through light irradiation.







Abstract
Helical foldamers constitute particularly relevant targets in the field of host&#8208;guest chemistry, be that as hosts or substrates. In this context, the strategies reported so far to control the dimensions and shape of foldamers mainly involve modifications of the skeleton through covalent synthesis. Herein, we prepared an oligopyridine dicarboxamide foldamer substituted by photo&#8208;active tetraphenylethylene units (TPE). We demonstrate that it is possible to toggle the length of a helical foldamer by two means. First, the elongation of foldamers can be tuned by adjusting the concentration, as demonstrated by DOSY NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses on both the single and the double helix structures. Secondly, and in a more original manner, a photo&#8208;induced protonation process triggered by TPE units promotes a novel pathway to unfold helical foldamers, leading to dramatic conformational and spectroscopic changes.

&#945;&#8208;D 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine forms a transparent self&#8208;healing hydrogel. Fluorescent gels are obtained from &#945;&#8208;D 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine and &#945;&#8208;D 8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine. A toolbox of &#945;&#8208;D nucleoside hydrogels is now available, providing gels with long&#8208;term stability and thixotropic properties in combination with intrinsic fluorescence for potential applications in biomedicine, diagnostics or therapeutics, and in nanotechnology.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of &#945;&#8208;D nucleosides to supramolecular hydrogels is described in detail. Hydrogel formation is studied on &#945;&#8208;D 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine (&#945;&#8208;dG), and the fluorescent 8&#8208;azapurine &#945;&#8208;D nucleosides 2&#8208;amino&#8208;8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (&#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad) and 8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyisoguanosine (&#945;&#8208;z8iGd). These compounds were prepared from &#945;&#8208;D 8&#8208;aza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine by an activation/amination protocol followed by deamination. Protonation and deprotonation pKa values of monomeric nucleosides were determined. Fluorescence measurements displayed the pH&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity of &#945;&#8208;D 8&#8208;azapurine nucleosides. &#945;&#8208;dG and &#945;&#8208;z8iGd self&#8208;assemble to gels that are selective for K+&#8208;ions. The &#945;&#8208;dG gel is transparent and the &#945;&#8208;z8iGd gel shows fluorescence. &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad forms fluorescent gels in the presence of alkali metal ions of different size. SEM images expose a large condensed and flat structure for the &#945;&#8208;dG gel, whereas the &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad gel consists of flakes that are connected to bundles. A porous structure generated by helical cylindric fibers was found for the &#945;&#8208;z8iGd gel. All &#945;&#8208;D hydrogels show long&#8208;term lifetime stability. The &#945;&#8208;z8iGd hydrogel in KCl solution has the highest Tgel value. The minimum gelation concentration of the hydrogels is 0.3&#8208;0.5&#8197;mg nucleoside/100&#8197;&#956;L alkali ion solution. In periodical step&#8208;strain experiments, the hydrogels of &#945;&#8208;dG, &#945;&#8208;2&#8208;NH2&#8208;z8Ad and &#945;&#8208;z8iGd displayed thixotropy. Based on their self&#8208;healing and shear&#8208;thinning properties the hydrogels are injectable.

A straightforward synthesis of homotrimetallic Co polypnictogen cage complexes of the type [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)3(&#956;3,&#951;2:&#951;2:&#951;2&#8208;E3)(&#956;3&#8208;E)] (E=P (3), As (4)) is presented. These clusters were elucidated in terms of their redox chemistry by cyclic voltammetry. Stepwise reduction and oxidation over four stages give access to the corresponding salts containing monoanions, monocations and dications, which were comprehensively characterized in solution and in the solid state, respectively.

Abstract
The systematic nucleophilic functionalization of the cationic pentaphosphole ligand complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5Me)][OTf] (A) with group 16/17 nucleophiles is reported.

         <title>Microbial&#8208;induced Synthesis of nano NiFe LDH for High&#8208;efficiency Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts were synthesized using the microbial&#8208;induced mineralization method, which results in formation of a relatively homogeneous rod shell structure on the nickel foam surface, acceleration of the formation of nanosheets, and modulation of the electronic structure of nanosheets. This study provides new insights into microbial in&#8197;situ mineralization&#8208;induced microstructural changes in catalysts for the OER.







Abstract
NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) currently are the most efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline environments. However, the development of high&#8208;performance low cost OER electrocatalysts using straightforward strategies remains a significant challenge. In this study, we describe an innovative microbial mineralization&#8208;based method for in&#8197;situ&#8208;induced preparation of NiFe LDH nanosheets loaded on nickel foam and demonstrate that this material serves as an efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. In the microbial mineralization process, bacteria adhere to electrode materials and promote the surface nucleation of nanomaterials when metal ions are present. Specifically, our findings indicate that biomineralization accelerates the formation and regulation of NiFe LDH. The new electrocatalyst displays excellent OER performance, with a small overpotential of 220&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope down to 38.6&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in alkaline solution. The remarkable OER performance of the microbial mineralization&#8208;derived electrocatalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect of NiFe LDH and a bacterial&#8208;specific surface area that contains multiple active sites. This study has uncovered a new approach for the assembly of NiFe LDH that relies on biomineralization to bring about morphological and structural modification of LDH nanosheets.

         <title>Supramolecular Preorganization of Amine&#8208;functionalized Diacetylene Monomers in their Crystals Allows their Topochemical Polymerization to Polydiacetylenenes Capable of CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed and synthesized three diacetylene monomers M1&#8208;M3 having two NH2 groups. As anticipated, the NH2 groups aided the preorganization of these monomers by N&#8208;H&#8230;N hydrogen bonding. In the crystals of monomer M1 and M2, the intermolecular N&#8211;H&#8230;N hydrogen bonding preorganized the diyne units in an orientation suitable for their topochemical polymerization, but in the case of monomer M3, the distance was slightly larger than that recommended for the topochemical reaction. However, upon heating, all the three monomers underwent topochemical polymerization to yield polydiacetylenes P1&#8208;P3 respectively. All three polymers have been characterized using PXRD, Raman, MALDI&#8208;TOF and solid&#8208;state UV spectroscopy. Furthermore, we investigated the abilities of these amine&#8208;functionalized polymers to capture CO2 gas. Polymer P1, which had a larger surface area, demonstrated the highest CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.28 mmol g&#8722;1 at 273 K and 1 bar, compared to the other two polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Balances as Physical Organic Chemistry Tools to Quantify Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noncovalent interactions are present in numerous synthetic and biological systems, playing an essential role in vital processes for life such as stabilization of proteins&#8217; structures or reversible binding in substrate&#8208;receptor complexes. Their study is relevant, but it presents challenges due to its inherent weak nature. In this context, molecular balances (MBs) are one of the most efficient physical organic chemistry tools to quantify noncovalent interactions, bringing beneficial knowledge regarding their nature and strength. Herein, we report an overview and critical discussion of recent studies related to various MBs in the quantification of a collection of noncovalent interactions: from the well&#8208;known aryl&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;aryl and CH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;aryl interaction to the newest fullerene&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;aryl and chalcogen&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;chalcogen interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles Derived from Chelating N&#8208;Donor Ligands: Historical Advances, Recent Highlights, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen heterocycles derived from chelating N&#8208;donor ligands is an area of research that has lagged behind the development of similar heterocycles based on other main group elements, most notably boron. The fact that phosphorus and nitrogen are both group 15 elements and that their compounds are most commonly viewed as Lewis bases likely contributes to this observation. However, through judicious ligand design and creative use of phosphorus sources that render phosphorus as Lewis acidic and/or electron poor, a variety of heterocyclic architectures are possible. In this article, we highlight selected examples of phosphorus adducts of bidentate, tridentate, and tetradentate N&#8208;donor ligands that have shown utility as functional molecular materials, in small molecule activation and catalysis, and as therapeutics and diagnostics in chemical biology. Finally, we look forward to the future of this emerging area and provide commentary on the unique opportunities available to researchers working within the field of phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen heterocycle chemistry.</dc:description>

However, through judicious ligand design and creative use of phosphorus sources that render phosphorus as Lewis acidic and/or electron poor, a variety of heterocyclic architectures are possible. In this article, we highlight selected examples of phosphorus adducts of bidentate, tridentate, and tetradentate N-donor ligands that have shown utility as functional molecular materials, in small molecule activation and catalysis, and as therapeutics and diagnostics in chemical biology. Finally, we look forward to the future of this emerging area and provide commentary on the unique opportunities available to researchers working within the field of phosphorus-nitrogen heterocycle chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oligoethylene Phosphoramidate&#8208;based Kinase Inhibitor Prodrugs &#8211; Solubility, Enzyme Inhibition, and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficiency of kinase inhibiting cancer therapeutics is often limited by their poor solubility in water. PEGylation is one possible strategy to improve the solubility of the drug, however, means to cleave these after reaching the target is important to make use of the therapeutic effects of the native drug. Moreover, the length of the PEG chains will have an effect on the solubility and binding. In this study we want to extend our understanding of solubilizing oligo ethylene glycol (OEG) chains connected to kinase inhibitors using a pH labile phosphoramidate linker. &#160;We synthesize a library of drug&#8208;OEG conjugates for Ceritinib, Crizotinib, Palbociclib, and Ribocilib kinase inhibitors with n = 2, 3, 4 and 8 OEG repeat units. We study the influence on water solubility, enzyme inhibition, and pH induced hydrolysis. A maximum in solubility is obtained for n = 3 or 4.&#160;We show that small differences in chain length can strongly influence the water solubility while all other properties remain relatively comparable.</dc:description>

         <title>Upgrade of Weak &#963;&#8208;hole Bond Donors via Cr(CO)3 Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular recognition mediated by s&#8208;hole interactions is enhanced as the electrostatic potential at the &#963;&#8208;hole becomes increasingly positive. Traditional methods to strengthen &#963;&#8208;hole donor ability of atoms such as halogens often involve covalent modifications, such as, introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (neutral or positively charged) or electrochemical oxidation. Metal coordination, a relatively underexplored approach, offers a promising alternative. In this study, &#951;6&#8208;coordination of Cr(CO)3 to haloarenes, a neutral system, is demonstrated to significantly increase the electrophilic character of halogen bond donors, enabling weak donors such as chloroanisole to form short and directional Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;O halogen bonds. Structural characterization using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational analysis of a series of &#951;6&#8208;Cr(CO)3&#8208;coordinated haloarenes provides evidence for this enhancement. Furthermore, the effect is shown to extend to other heteroatomic substituents on the coordinated arene, e.g., other halogen atoms as well as elements of groups 16, 15, and 14 of the periodic table, broadening the scope of this approach.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple and Efficient Stereoselective Synthesis of a 2,3&#8208;Difluorosialic acid&#8208;based influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>3&#8208;Fluoroneuraminosyl fluorides are invaluable probes for studying the catalytic mechanism of sialidases (neuraminidases), and as sialidase inhibitors. Significantly, when a C&#8208;3 equatorial fluorine is installed on a C&#8208;4 functionalised N&#8208;acylneuraminic acid (Neu)&#8211;based template, the compounds are potent and selective inhibitors of both influenza and parainfluenza sialidases, and of virus replication. Typically, the reported syntheses of 3&#8208;fluoroneuraminosyl fluorides involve either an enzymatic or a chemical synthesis that have uncontrolled stereoselectivity in the introduction of fluorine at C&#8208;3 of Neu and consequently yield a mixture of C&#8208;3 ax and C&#8208;3 eq fluoro derivatives. We now report a simple approach for the exquisitely stereo&#8208;controlled introduction of the C&#8208;3 equatorial fluorine on Neu by incorporation of steric bulk at C&#8208;4. Through this method, we have elaborated a novel synthetic route that exclusively produces the potent anti&#8208;influenza drug candidate; 2,3&#8208;difluoro&#8208;zanamivir analogue with C&#8208;3 eq fluoride.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereospecific Radical Bromination of &#946;&#8208;Aryl Alcohols with Thiourea Additives Through A Serendipitous Discovery of A 1,2&#8208;Aryl Migration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the bromination of diastereomeric &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols using the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;succinimide (NBS) and thiourea protocol provides a novel pathway to a direct fully stereoretentive bromination of &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols under very mild conditions.







Abstract
The development of new protocols for stereospecific and stereoselective halogenation transformations by mild reaction conditions is a highly desirable research target for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Following the straightforward methodology for directly transforming a wide scope of alcohols to alkyl bromides and chlorides using substoichiometric amounts of thioureas and N&#8208;halo succinimides (NXS) as a halogen source in a single step, we noticed that in apolar solvents bromination of chiral secondary alcohols did not produce the expected racemates. In this study, the stereochemical aspects of the bromination reaction were examined. Surprisingly, bromination of (&#177;)&#8208;threo&#8208; or (&#177;)&#8208;erythro&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanols revealed a single diastereomeric brominated product with retention of configuration. The scope of these reactions was expanded on several &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols. During these studies, an unexpected stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration of the phenyl group was shown to take place. The proposed mechanism of the 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration involves the formation of a spiro[2,5]octadienyl radical, which is then attacked by a bromide radical at any of the two cyclopropyl positions anti to the phenyl position, leading to products that retain the stereoisomeric configuration of the starting material.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Continuous Flow Synthesis of Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride (SF5Cl) Using a Custom&#8208;Made Stirring Packed&#8208;Bed Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein is reported the first continuous flow synthesis of pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF5Cl), the most widely used reagent for introducing the SF5 group onto aliphatic molecules. For this purpose, a custom&#8208;made stirring reactor was designed and allowed rapid, safe and highly efficient synthesis of SF5Cl. Moreover, the following radical addition of SF5Cl on alkynes in a telescoped manner was realized.







Abstract
The pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5&#8722;) group has been the subject of a surge of interest in the past decade, but there is still little practicality associated with its synthesis and installation. Herein is reported the first continuous flow synthesis of pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF5Cl), the most common reagent for the synthesis of SF5&#8208;substituted compounds. The synthesis is based on inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagents: sulfur powder (S8), trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) and potassium fluoride (KF). To this end, a custom&#8208;made stirring reactor was designed to allow for fast, safe, and highly efficient on&#8208;demand synthesis of SF5Cl. The resulting SF5Cl solution is showcased in the radical addition on alkynes in a telescoped fashion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pentafluorosulfanyl (SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;) group has been the subject of a surge of interest in the past decade, but there is still little practicality associated with its synthesis and installation. Herein is reported the first continuous flow synthesis of pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl), the most common reagent for the synthesis of SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-substituted compounds. The synthesis is based on inexpensive and easy-to-handle reagents: sulfur powder (S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) and potassium fluoride (KF). To this end, a custom-made stirring reactor was designed to allow for fast, safe, and highly efficient on-demand synthesis of SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl. The resulting SF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl solution is showcased in the radical addition on alkynes in a telescoped fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substrate Specificity of Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 Nanozyme: Ascorbic Acid Oxidation and Selective Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 nanozyme, synthesized with Cu2+ as an active site and adenine as a linker in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline, specifically catalyzes ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), and concurrently produced ROS could efficiently triggers intratumor oxidative stress to induce tumor cell death.







Abstract
Though nanozymes are becoming promising alternatives to natural enzymes due to their superior properties, constructing nanozyme with high specificity is still a great challenge. Herein, with Cu2+ as an active site and adenine as a ligand, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 is synthesized in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. As an oxidase mimic, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 could selectively catalyze oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA) to dehydroascorbic acid, but not universal substrates (3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis (3&#8208;ethylbenzthiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol (2,4&#8208;DP)), small biomolecules (dopamine, glutathione, glucose, galactose), other vitamins (vitamin A acid, vitamin B1, vitamin K1) and even dithiothreitol (a common interference of AA). Such the specific AA catalytic oxidation is revealed that Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 selectively binds with AA through hydrogen bonds, accompanied with catalyzing AA oxidation, and concurrently O2 transferring to H2O2 via O2&#8901;&#8722;, further to H2O via &#8901;OH. Based on the produced reactive oxygen species, with AA as a pro&#8208;oxidant, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 nanozyme efficiently triggers severe intratumor oxidative stress to induce tumor cell death. This work opens a new avenue to design intrinsic nanozymes with high specificity, and also presents a promising application in the field of AA oxidation induced cancer therapy.

         <title>Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Long Chain Esters via Formate Hydroesterification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic olefin carbonyl methods commonly rely on fossil fuel sourced carbon monoxide feedstocks. Extension of carbon dioxide hydrogenation catalysis has produced a new, selective route to long chain esters from olefins using a tandem catalytic process. In either single or dual stage reactions, cooperative ruthenium and palladium catalysts reduce CO2 to formate esters then hydroesterify olefins to generate value added esters.







Abstract
CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification is an attractive route to produce value added ester compounds, which could replace widely used CO&#8208;based hydroesterification processes if sufficient catalytic technologies are developed. One path to CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification could proceed through an organoformate intermediate, which is then used in olefin hydroesterification to generate the desirable esters. This route opens the possibility of creating a net CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification process using tandem catalytic systems for CO2 hydrogenation to organoformate paired with formate&#8208;olefin hydroesterification. The tandem use of tripodal phosphine ruthenium(II) and 1,2&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphinomethyl)benzene palladium catalysts were found to successfully produce methyl nonanoate from CO2, H2, methanol and 1&#8208;octene in a single&#8208;stage batch process. The CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification catalysis efficiency was found to be largely limited by the productivity of organoformate generation and competitive 1&#8208;octene reduction. Catalytic yields of methyl nonanoate can be enhanced by adjustments in reaction procedures, including the use of a two&#8208;stage batch reaction process or delayed introduction of 1&#8208;octene, achieving a yield of up to 32&#8201;%. Under select conditions, control experiments indicate yields of methyl nonanoate can be improved to ca 75&#8201;%. Preliminary studies indicate significant interplay between the two ligands employed in the molecular tandem catalytic systems and establish the first catalytic protocol for the selective CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification of olefins via organoformates.

         <title>Panchromatic Absorption of Unsymmetrical Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyes Based on a Meta&#8208;conjugated 1,3,5&#8208;Heteroaryltriazine Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Attachment of three different heterocycles with electron donor or acceptor character to a central 1,3,5&#8208;triazine core generates readily soluble side&#8208;chain free dyes with two displaying soft crystalline mesomorphism and one displaying a nematic liquid crystal phase as confirmed by polarized optical microscopy, calorimetry, gravimetric analysis, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. Equally intriguing is the dyes&#8217; relatively strong electronic communication between donor and acceptor subchromophores that are meta&#8208;conjugated to one another, which is experimentally observed as a broad intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer absorption that can extend over 100 nm past the most intense absorption event and is computationally confirmed through density functional theory (DFT) evaluations of the molecular ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state properties. This molecular design permits the preparation of dyes with panchromatic absorption not just based on the additive absorption of individual subchromophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Three dimensional CNTs interweaved layered MnTe nanoparticles as a new cathode for aqueous zinc ion battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the development of suitable transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) for aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) is plagued by the terrible conductivity and electrochemical properties. Herein, a one&#8208;step ball milling method is applied to enhance the conductivity of commercial MnTe cathode by constructing three dimensional (3D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) interweaved MnTe nanoparticles (abbreviated as MnTe@CNTs), which can achieve ultrafast ion conduction. The stable electrochemistry properties benefit from the synergistic effects between layered MnTe and 3D CNTs, which can improve the electrons/ions diffusion kinetics as cycling. So MnTe@CNTs achieves a ultra&#8208;high capacity of 427.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and superior capacity retention of 97.6% at 1 A g&#8208;1 over 200 cycles. Zinc&#8208;storage mechanisms can be revealed with the aid of operando XRD and ex situ XPS spectra. MnTe as a new cathode presents superior Zn&#8208;storage ability for high&#8208;performance AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Polyferrocenylmethylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polyferrocenylmethylenes was prepared via ring&#8208;opening transmetalation polymerization (ROTP), starting from the corresponding carba[1]magnesocenophanes. Different substitution patterns have been investigated with regards to the polymers&#8217; properties and gave some insights into the underlying reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the polyferrocenylmethylenes were investigated as preceramic polymers.







Abstract
The synthesis of differently substituted polyferrocenylmethylenes (PFM) via ring&#8208;opening transmetalation polymerization (ROTP) is reported. A number of novel, symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted carba[1]magnesocenophanes have been prepared, which were used as precursors and allowed investigations of the influence of different substitution patterns on the PFM polymer properties. The novel carba[1]magnesocenophanes have been fully characterized by 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, and structurally authenticated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD). The corresponding PFMs were obtained with molecular weights in a range of Mw=1900&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 up to 15100&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and corresponding dispersities of &#272;=1.48 to 1.81. All PFMs have been fully characterized by 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, as well as by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (MALDI&#8208;ToF) mass spectrometry. Pyrolysis of spyrocyclic substituted PFM resulted in a ceramic yield above 50&#8201;%, while the obtained residue was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD).

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds via Cu/TEMPO/O2 Aerobic Catalytic System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu/TEMPO/O2 system that is suitable for converting alcohols, ketones, lactones, and lactams to their &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is reported. The Cu&#8208;catalyzed system performs high activity and selectivity, and H2O is the byproduct produced.







Abstract
An N,N,N&#8208;type Cu(II) complex&#8208;catalyzed desaturation method for converting alcohols, ketones, lactones, and lactams to their &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is reported. The dehydrogenation reaction can be conducted with a green terminal oxidant O2 without requiring strong acid/base or stoichiometric oxidants. The Cu(II) complex/TEMPO/O2 system uses a non&#8208;noble catalyst, and a green terminal oxidant as well as demonstrates high activity and functional group tolerance. Notably, H2O is the byproduct produced and overoxidation is not observed during the reaction process. The proposed mechanism was investigated via high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), in&#8197;situ FT&#8208;IR spectrometry, and GC analysis, and the formation of intermediates of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds from the aerobic dehydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;saturated counterparts was observed.

         <title>[1+5] Cyclization of Indoline&#8208;Derived Azadienes with 1,3,5&#8208;Triazinanes: An Efficient Protocol for the Synthesis of Indoline&#8208;Spiro&#8208;Hexahydropyrimidines</title>

         <dc:description>
This work firstly disclosed that indoline&#8208;derived azadienes could serve as 1&#8208;atom synthons, providing a straightforward protocol for indoline&#8208;spiro&#8208;hexahydropyrimidines via an innovative formal [1+5] cyclization between indoline&#8208;derived azadienes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes.







Abstract
An unprecedented formal [1+5] cyclization of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes with 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes has been realized, providing a facile access to biologically important indoline&#8208;spiro&#8208;hexahydropyrimidines with good to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield). Different from previous reports, this is the first study that indoline&#8208;derived azadienes could participate in cyclizations as one&#8208;atom synthons. This methodology is also distinguished by not involving any additive or catalyst, readily available starting materials, wide range of substrate applicability, operational simplicity and simultaneously reassembling two C&#8722;N and two C&#8722;C bonds in one&#8208;step reaction.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Polar Pore Surface Designed for Purification of Both Natural Gas and Ethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZJNU&#8208;402 achieves a remarkable C3H8 adsorption capacity and selectivity values of 375 for C3H8/CH4 and 31 for C2H6/CH4. This innovation enables efficient one&#8208;step purification, particularly in separating C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixtures, yielding high&#8208;purity methane.







Abstract
The advancement of high&#8208;value CH4 purification technology within the natural gas industry is paramount for industrial processes. Herein, we constructed ZJNU&#8208;402, a new porous material characterized by permanent porosity, as an effective adsorbent for separating C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 mixtures. The findings reveal an outstanding C3H8 adsorption capacity of 68&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a moderate C2H6 adsorption rate of 42&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a notably lower CH4 adsorption rate of 11&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. Noteworthy is the exceptional selectivity of ZJNU&#8208;402 for C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4, standing at 375 and 31, respectively, surpassing many previously documented high&#8208;performance adsorbents and breaking the traditional trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation selectivity. Adsorption heat calculations show that compared with CH4 molecules, C3H8 and C2H6 molecules form stronger bonds with the skeleton, resulting in excellent separation performance. In addition, the breakthrough experiment of ZJNU&#8208;402 can also completely separate the ternary component C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixture to obtain 99.95&#8201;% high&#8208;purity methane. At the same time, ZJNU&#8208;402 also has excellent structural stability, excellent recyclability, and low isosteric adsorption heat. Consequently, ZJNU&#8208;402 exhibits substantial potential for augmenting the efficacy of natural gas enrichment processes.

         <title>Construction of MOF&#8208;Derived Vanadium Nitride Decorated Micro/Mesoporous Carbon Nanofibers for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
V&#8211;MOF was incorporated into the electrostatic spinning technique to prepare VN decorated N&#8208;doped micro/mesoporous carbon nanofibers (VN/N&#8208;MCNF) with abundant porous structure and high electronic conductivity as a stabilizing host structure for ZIBs. The capacity retention rate of the VN/N&#8208;MCNF electrode can reach more than 90&#8201;% after 200 cycles at a low current density of 0.3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Design and manufacture of cathode materials, with suitable pore structure and high electrical conductivity to matching zinc anode, solving the problem of dissolution and structural degradation of cathode materials for zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), is great significance to the development of ZIBs. Herein, Vanadium Nitride (VN) uniformly decorated N&#8208;doped micro/mesoporous carbon nanofibers (VN/N&#8208;MCNF) with appropriate porous and reactive sites for Zn2+ is prepared by using V&#8211;MOF, as important precursor via electrostatic spinning and pyrolysis technique. As a cathode electrode for ZIBs, the VN/N&#8208;MCNF is suitable for diffusion and adsorption of large&#8208;sized solvated structured [Zn(H2O)6]2+, for its abundant micro/mesoporous structure and good electrical conductivity. The VN/N&#8208;MCNF electrode has high specific capacity of 242&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and rate performance. Moreover, the VN/N&#8208;MCNF&#8208;based ZIBs can reach 92.5&#8201;% capacity retention after 200 cycles at a low current density of 0.3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and can reach 86.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. These findings highlight the importance of a rational design of cathode materials for high&#8208;performance metal batteries, which can also be extended to the design of other materials.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Non&#8208;Heme &#956;&#8208;Oxodicobalt(IV) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mononuclear CoIII complex (1) of a bisamide&#8208;bisalkoxide donor ligand was synthesized and thoroughly characterized. The reaction of 1 with 0.5 equiv. of m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) in acetonitrile at &#8722;40 &#176;C resulted in the formation of a &#956;&#8208;oxodicobalt(IV) complex (2), which was characterized by an array of spectroscopic techniques, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy which revealed a short Co&#8722;Ooxo distance of 1.67 &#197;. Reactivity studies of 2 towards oxidation/oxygenation of hydrocarbon C&#8722;H bond and triphenylphosphine or thioanisole derivatives have been examined. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy studies showed the appearance of clear isosbestic points during the oxidation of substrates together with a neat transformation of 2 to 1. Detailed kinetic investigations established that 2 follows a Concerted Proton&#8208;Electron Transfer (CPET) mechanism for hydrocarbon oxidation and has a weak electrophilic character. Catalytic behavior of 1 was noted towards the oxygen atom transfer reactions. This study showcases the spectroscopic investigation and reactivity studies of a CoIV(&#956;&#8208;O)CoIV moiety. Although the FeIV analog of such a core has been described before, the study describes the first example with a CoIV center.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidation of Methane to Methanol on a Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane oxidation to methanol was efficiently catalyzed a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on cobalt vanadotungstate at a low temperature without co&#8208;reductants. The hydroxyl&#8208;based active species generated in the V and Co sites in the micropore of the catalyst, which selectively oxidized methane to form methanol.







Abstract
Direct oxidation of methane to methanol utilizing molecular oxygen under mild conditions is an important yet challenging process due to the difficulty in activating of methane under such conditions. In this research, we report on zeolitic octahedral metal oxides based on cobalt vanadotungstates, which act as the catalysts for the oxidation of methane using molecular oxygen as the oxidant without co&#8208;reductants at a low temperature of 90&#8201;&#176;C even as low as 60&#8201;&#176;C. This catalytic process results in the high&#8208;yield production of methanol as the primary product. The micropores within the catalyst are critical for achieving high activity in the reaction, in which molecular oxygen is activated. The active species in the reaction are found to be hydroxyl&#8208;based. Both VO5 with reduced V4+ and Co2+ are crucial for generating the active species for the reaction.

         <title>Impact of Structural Subtleties on Chirality Induction and Amplification in Trizinc(II)Porphyrin Trimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subtle modification in a &#8216;nano&#8208;size&#8217; trizinc(II) porphyrin trimer profoundly affects its complexation and chirogenic responses with chiral diamine substrates: while &#8216;open&#8217; form generates &#8216;monomeric&#8217; complex with low CD amplitude, &#8216;closed&#8217; form produces exclusive &#8216;polymer&#8217; with large, amplified CD signal with opposite sign.







Abstract
Herein, we report the precise control of molecular to supramolecular chirality induction at the single&#8208;molecule level just upon subtle modification in an achiral &#8216;nano&#8208;size&#8217; trizinc(II) porphyrin trimer. A slight variation in the projection of the substituent at the periphery of the central porphyrin unit in a porphyrin trimer (host) resulted in pronounced changes in the interchromophoric arrangement, leading to distinct &#8216;open&#8217; and &#8216;closed&#8217; conformations. While &#8216;open&#8217; form generates &#8216;monomeric&#8217; complex with low CD amplitude, &#8216;closed&#8217; form produces exclusive &#8216;polymer&#8217; with large, amplified CD signal with opposite sign due to stronger intermolecular excitonic coupling. Also, the sign of the CD couplets is just opposite between R and S substrates for both polymer and monomer which suggest that the chirality is predominantly governed by the stereogenic projection of the chiral center. X&#8208;ray structures of the host and polymer have been reported here. Crystallographic characterization offers a detailed perspective on the structural and geometrical transformations in the polymer, enabling a systematic understanding of its optical properties. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations strongly corroborate with the experimental findings.

         <title>Piezochromic Luminescence of Pyrene Derivatives Polymorphism Around Excimer Forming Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent behavior and structural evolution of a polymorphous system comprising a blue&#8208;emitting phase (IMPY&#8208;B) and a green&#8208;emitting phase (IMPY&#8208;G), both featuring dimeric pyrene stacking, were investigated under high&#8208;pressure conditions. IMPY&#8208;B, characterized by weaker intermolecular interactions within a dimer, exhibits a larger red&#8208;shift in its PL spectra and requires higher pressure to form excimers.







Abstract
Pyrene aggregates, as classic luminescent materials, are of great interest from a scientific viewpoint owing to the development of optoelectronic materials. In this study, we designed a compound 1,4,5&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole (IM&#8208;PY) which was achieved with two crystalline polymorphs (IMPY&#8208;G and IMPY&#8208;B). They exhibit the green emission and the blue emission, respectively, both with pyrene serving as the luminescent core. At ambient conditions, both phases exhibit &#960;&#8211;&#960; pyrene dimer stacking, but IMPY&#8208;B has the obviously smaller overlapping area and slightly shorter distance of pyrene planes than IMPY&#8208;G. During compression, the experiment results of photoluminescence, in&#8197;situ UV&#8208;vis absorption, time&#8208;resolved emission, and synchrotron angular dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations indicate that IMPY&#8208;B shows a more pronounced red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence spectra and forms excimers at higher pressure than IMPY&#8208;G. This fully reflects the influence of different stacking structures on the piezochromic phenomenon of aggregates, which is beneficial for expanding the application of pyrene aggregated state.

&lt;p&gt;Pyrene aggregates, as classic luminescent materials, are of great interest from a scientific viewpoint owing to the development of optoelectronic materials. In this study, we designed a compound 1,4,5-triphenyl-2-(pyren-1-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazole (IM-PY) which was achieved with two crystalline polymorphs (IMPY-G and IMPY-B). They exhibit the green emission and the blue emission, respectively, both with pyrene serving as the luminescent core. At ambient conditions, both phases exhibit &#960;&#8211;&#960; pyrene dimer stacking, but IMPY-B has the obviously smaller overlapping area and slightly shorter distance of pyrene planes than IMPY-G. During compression, the experiment results of photoluminescence, in&#8197;situ UV-vis absorption, time-resolved emission, and synchrotron angular dispersive X-ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations indicate that IMPY-B shows a more pronounced red-shifted photoluminescence spectra and forms excimers at higher pressure than IMPY-G. This fully reflects the influence of different stacking structures on the piezochromic phenomenon of aggregates, which is beneficial for expanding the application of pyrene aggregated state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controllable Self&#8208;Assembly Morphologies of PPV&#8208;Based Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene) (PPV) is a classic semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers with outstanding optical and electronic properties, which shows important applications in the fields of optoelectronic, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells (OSCs), and organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). In the working process of the device, the microstate of PPV decides its property. Therefore, it is significant to achieve ordered morphologies based on PPV at micro scale. Due to the long rigid backbone and large area of delocalized electron, PPV has a strong tendency towards ordered aggregation through intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, and &#8220;rod&#8208;coil&#8221; type block copolymer (BCP) based on PPV with a corona chain to improve the solubility is always built for self&#8208;assembly in situ solution. However, obtaining regular PPV based micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;structures in a controllable and uniform form remains challenging. In this review, we summarize the progresses in constructing multi&#8208;dimensional regular self&#8208;assembly morphologies based on PPV BCPs and exploring the application potential of these delicate functional nanomaterials. The molecular design strategy and growth mechanism can be extended to regulate the aggregation state of functional semiconducting conjugated polymers, which is beneficial to improving their performance in application of microelectronics, optoelectronics, biology and so on.</dc:description>

Upon re&#173;duction of compounds 3&#8208;E, a hitherto unprecedented Ru(I) &#951;2&#8208;alkyne complex, [PCCP]RuCl (9), was obtained for E = P. The former square planar Ru(I) complex (9) was characterized com&#173;prehensively and examined in detail by means of DFT and CASSCF calculation. Upon treatment of 9 with TlPF6, a diamagnetic &#181;&#8208;Tl&#8208;bridged compound (10) with a nearly linear Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru array was formed and isolated in high yields. Careful analysis of the bonding situation suggested that the Ru&#8722;Tl&#8722;Ru moiety in 10 is best interpreted in terms of a 3c&#8208;4e&#8722; bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Broken Symmetry and Elastic Frustration in Isostructural Spin Crossover Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Symmetry&#8208;breaking spin&#8208;state transitions in two of three isostructural salts of MnIII spin&#8208;crossover cations, [MnIII(3&#8208;OMe&#8208;5&#8208;NO2&#8208;sal2323)]+, with heavy anions are reported. The ReO4&#8722; &#160;salt undergoes two&#8208;step spin crossover which is coupled with a re&#8208;entrant symmetry&#8208;breaking structural phase transition between a high temperature phase (S = 2, C2/c), an intermediate ordered phase (S = 1/S = 2, P21/c), and a low temperature phase (S = 1, C2/c). The AsF6&#8722; &#160;complex undergoes an abrupt transition between a high temperature phase (S = 2, C2/c) and a low temperature ordered phase (S = 1/S = 2, P&#8208;1). The SbF6&#8722; &#160;complex undergoes a gradual transition between a high temperature phase (S = 2, P&#8208;1) and a low temperature spin&#8208;state ordered phase (S = 1/S = 2, P&#8208;1). Correlation of the volume of the anion and&#160;&#160;T1/2&#160;in these complexes and three analogous complexes with similar anions, BF4&#8722;, ClO4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;, reveals an increase in T1/2 upon increasing the anion volume. We rationalise that the volume of the anions&#160;modulates the elastic interactions between the MnIII sites, with increasing elastic frustration with the larger anions resulting in a two&#8208;stepped transition for [MnIII(3&#8208;OMe&#8208;5&#8208;NO2&#8208;sal2323)]ReO4&#160;and the stabilisation of the mixed (HS:LS) state to low temperature for [MnIII(3&#8208;OMe&#8208;5&#8208;NO2&#8208;sal2323)]AsF6 and [MnIII(3&#8208;OMe&#8208;5&#8208;NO2&#8208;sal2323)]SbF6.</dc:description>

         <title>Programing Green Light&#8208;Responsive Hydrogels: from Photo&#8208;Weakening to Photo&#8208;unresponsiveness and Photo&#8208;Strengthening</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;responsive hydrogels are highly valued for their dynamic mechanical properties and biocompatibility. In this study, we present a hydrogel system that can either soften or strengthen on green light exposure, or remain unresponsive to light, depending on the addition of adenosyl cobalamin (AdoCbl) and Co2+. These protein&#8208;based hydrogels were formed using genetically encoded SpyTag&#8208;SpyCatcher chemistry and included green light&#8208;sensitive CarHc protein domains. As previously reported, these hydrogels formed in the dark with the addition of AdoCbl, due to the tetramerization of the CarHc domains. Under green light exposure, the CarHc tetramers disassembled, leading to a rapid transition from gel to sol. Interestingly, we discovered that an excess of AdoCbl leads to photo&#8208;strengthening rather than photo&#8208;weakening. This occurred because light exposure induces interchain crosslinks between AdoCbl and poly&#8208;histidine tags (His6&#8208;tags) of the proteins. Furthermore, incorporating Co2+ ions enhanced hydrogel stiffness by coordinating to His6&#8208;tags. This not only suppressed photo&#8208;weakening but also promoted photo&#8208;strengthening behaviour. These findings highlight the role of His6&#8208;tags in photochemical crosslinking with excess AdoCbl and in coordination to Co2+ ions, providing a novel strategy for designing tuneable, light responsiveness in materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a fascinating class of structured materials with diverse functionality originating from the distinctive physicochemical properties. This review focuses on the specific chemical design of geometrically frustrated MOFs along with the origin of the intriguing magnetic properties. We have discussed the arrangement of spin centres (metal and ligand) which are responsible for the unusual magnetic phenomena in MOFs. Both two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOFs with frustrated magnetism, their synthetic routes, and evaluation of magnetic properties are highlighted. Such spin&#8208;frustrated MOFs may find applications in the field of memory devices, transistors, sensors, and development of unconventional superconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Adaptive Molecular Crystals Activated by [2+2] and [4+4] Cycloadditions</title>

Photomechanical crystals of [2+2] or [4+4] cycloaddition: This article presents a summary of the recent research progress on photomechanical properties of organic and metal&#8208;organic crystals where the mechanical effects are based on [2+2] and [4+4] cycloaddition reactions.







Abstract
Photomechanical crystals act as light&#8208;driven material&#8208;machines that can convert the energy carried by photons into kinetic energy via shape deformation or displacement, and this capability holds a paramount significance for the development of photoactuated devices. This transformation is usually attributed to anisotropic expansion or contraction of the unit cell engendered by light&#8208;induced structural modifications that lead to accumulation and release of stress that generates a momentum, resulting in readily observable mechanical effects. Among the available photochemical processes, the photoinduced [2+2] and [4+4] reactions are known for their robustness, predictability, amenability to control with molecular and supramolecular engineering approaches, and efficiency that has already been elevated to a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept smart devices based on organic crystals. This review article presents a summary of the recent research progress on photomechanical properties of organic and metal&#8208;organic crystals where the mechanical effects are based on [2+2] and [4+4] cycloaddition reactions. It consolidates the current understating of the chemical strategies and structure&#8211;property correlations, and highlights the advantages and drawbacks of this class of adaptive crystals within the broader field of crystal adaptronics.

         <title>DNA Origami Adsorption and Lattice Formation on Different SiOx Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface&#8208;assisted assembly of DNA origami lattices on silicon oxide surfaces is of great importance for molecular lithography. Here, it is shown that the type of the silicon oxide employed has a tremendous impact on DNA origami adsorption and lattice assembly, with efficient lattice formation requiring low surface roughness and high oxide density.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled DNA origami lattices on silicon oxide surfaces have great potential to serve as masks in molecular lithography. However, silicon oxide surfaces come in many different forms and the type and history of the silicon oxide has a large effect on its physicochemical surface properties. Therefore, we here investigate DNA origami lattice formation on differently fabricated SiOx films on silicon wafers after wet&#8208;chemical oxidation by RCA1. Despite having similar oxide compositions and hydroxylation states, of all surfaces tested, only thermally grown SiOx performs similarly well as native oxide. For the other SiOx films deposited by plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition and magnetron sputtering, DNA origami adsorption is strongly suppressed. This is attributed to an increased surface roughness and a lower oxide density, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the employed SiOx surface may decide over the outcome of an experiment and should be considered as an additional parameter that may require optimization and fine&#8208;tuning before high&#8208;quality lattices can be assembled. In particular, our observations suggest that efficient DNA origami lattice assembly on SiOx surfaces requires a low surface roughness and a high oxide density.

         <title>Under&#8208;strain Synergistic Oscillatory Twisting Manipulates the Bifunction in Rubrene Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a statistic strategy over sufficient ab initio molecular dynamics samplings and for the first time uncovers that synergistic oscillatory twisting of neighboring under&#8208;strain monomers manipulates the experimentally observed bifunction of rubrene crystal. A general rule for how synergistic oscillatory twisting modulates the conversion between singlet fission and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation and its temperature dependence are discussed.







Abstract
Photophysical properties of condensed systems generally originate from collective contributions of all components in their stochastically fluctuated structures and are strongly influenced under strain of chromophores. To precisely identify how the stochastically fluctuated monomers synergistically manipulate the properties, we propose a statistic strategy over sufficient ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) samplings and for the first time uncover that synergistic oscillatory twisting (SOT) of neighboring under&#8208;strain monomers manipulates the bifunction of rubrene crystal. The under&#8208;strain trunk SOT can regulate both singlet fission (SF) and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), enabling their coexistence and dominance switching by dynamically modulating the matching of excitation energies. A general rule is that small amplitude of SOT maintains the crystal TTA, while the large one boosts SF and the SF function occurs only when two neighboring monomers simultaneously have the twisting angles larger than the critical one. Temperature can govern the twisting amplitudes, thus manipulating the bifunction. These findings rationalize the experimentally observed temperature&#8208;modulated bifunction of rubrene crystal from statistical insights and proposes a combined strain&#8208;fluctuation strategy for engineering the bifunctionality of materials.

         <title>Convergent Total Synthesis of Ixabepilone and Its Analogues Enabled by Highly Efficient Asymmetric Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we developed a highly efficient and convergent total synthesis of ixabepilone and its analogues in a 13&#8208;step longest linear sequence by the assembly of three key synthons which are synthezied through practical asymmetric hydrogenation.







Abstract
The convergent total synthesis of ixabepilone and its analogues in a 13&#8208;step longest linear sequence is reported. The crucial chiral centers at challenging C3&#8208;O, C8&#8208;C and C15&#8208;N positions on the scaffold of the ixabepilone were installed via highly efficient asymmetric hydrogenations (up to 95&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% e.e.) and all three fragments could be prepared on gram scale. The key aldol reaction bridges the aldehyde and keto fragments with high yield and exquisite diastereo control (8&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;d.r.). Finally, a novel RCM reaction conformationally controlled by a bulky silyl group was reported, which allows the facile synthesis of ixabepilone and its analogues.

         <title>Rapid and Sustainable Electrochemical Pd Catalyst Generation from Bulk Metal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium catalysts form a cornerstone of modern chemistry with upmost scientific and industrial impact. Bulk palladium metal itself is chemically inert, and a sequence of chemical transformations has to be utilized to convert the metal into Pd pre&#8208;catalyst covered by ligands. However, the &#8220;cocktail&#8221; of catalysis concept discovered recently has shown that Pd systems can efficiently operate in catalysis without the necessity of a complicated and expensive pre&#8208;installed ligand environment. Here, we point out on a green and sustainable process for Pd active species generation without the need of waste&#8208;abundant pre&#8208;catalyst&#8208;related chemistry. In this work, an electric current was used to generate an active Pd catalyst from a bulk metal in an ionic liquid medium for the efficient cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides/bromides and boronic acids. Synthetically important Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling was utilized as a representative test reaction to confirm the idea. It should be emphasized that electric current is used only at the Pd dissolution stage. Afterwards, the electrodes are removed from the reaction mixture and a standard reaction procedure can be followed. The reported catalyst preparation process via electrochemical dissolution is potentially compatible with a number of already existing catalytic methods.</dc:description>

         <title>What Factors Determine the Brevione B Desaturation Mechanism in the Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase BrvJ?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The natural product synthesis of brevione J undergoes a cascade of reactions including an oxidative desaturation and a ring&#8208;expansion. The C1&#8722;C2 desaturation of brevione B is catalyzed by the nonheme iron dioxygenase BrvJ using one molecule of O2 and a&#8208;ketoglutarate (aKG). However, whether the subsequent oxidative ring expansion reaction is also catalyzed by the same enzyme is unknown and remains controversial. To gain insight into the mechanism of brevione J biosynthesis a computational study is reported here using molecular dynamics and density functional theory approaches. The work predicts that both cycles can proceed in the same protein structure on an iron center with O2 and aKG for each cycle. The rate&#8208;determining step is a hydrogen atom abstraction step in both reaction cycles. Interestingly, the OH rebound barriers are high in energy in cycle 1 due to stereochemical interactions and substrate positioning that enable an efficient desaturation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative Study of Iminodibenzyl and Diphenylamine Derivatives as Hole Transport Materials in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently achieved over 26% power conversion efficiency, challenging the dominance of silicon&#8208;based alternatives. This progress is significantly driven by innovations in hole transport materials (HTMs), which notably influence the efficiency and stability of PSCs. However, conventional organic HTMs like PTAA, although highly efficient, suffer from thermal degradation, moisture ingress, and high cost. This study explores the potential of iminodibenzyl, a moiety known for its strong electron&#8208;donating capabilities in pharmaceutical applications, as a novel HTM. A series of fluorene&#8208;based derivatives incorporating iminodibenzyl (TMF&#8208;2 and TDF&#8208;2) and diphenylamine (TMF&#8208;1 and TDF&#8208;1) units were synthesized and characterized. The new HTMs demonstrated commendable optical, electrochemical, and thermal properties, as well as enhanced photostability. Among them, TDF&#8208;2 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38%, the highest of the new materials. Although these efficiencies are slightly lower than the benchmark PTAA (20.20%), the study underscores the potential of iminodibenzyl to enhance photostability and increase HOMO levels, making it a promising candidate for future HTM development in PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Crown&#8208;ether Receptor Orientation in C&#8208;H Oxidation Catalyzed by Supramolecular Nonheme FeIV(O) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding how modification of receptor position and orientation in a supramolecular catalyst affects its efficiency is key for rational catalyst design but still underexplored. Herein, we quantified the impact of different receptor orientations on the C&#8722;H oxidation efficiency by supramolecular Fe(IV)=O complexes. Overall, their efficiency is similar but some changes in the selectivity profile are observed.







Abstract
The outstanding efficiency and selectivity of enzymatic reactions, such as C&#8722;H oxidation by nonheme iron oxygenases, stems from a precise control of substrate positioning inside the active site. The resulting proximity between a specific moiety (a certain C&#8722;H bond) and the reactant (a FeIV(O) active species) translates into higher rates and selectivity, that can be in part replicated also with artificial supramolecular catalysts. However, structural modification of the position and orientation of the binding site both in enzymes and in artificial catalysts often leads to significant variations in reactivity that can be difficult to rationalize due to the system&#8216;s complexity. Herein, we quantitatively analyzed the impact of such a structural modification (namely receptor orientation) on the C&#8722;H oxidation reactivity (kinetics, Effective Molarity) and selectivity by comparing simple supramolecular FeIV(O) models. Overall, we did not observe significant differences in reaction rates, but we noticed slight changes in the selectivity profile. These results indicate that, when a crown&#8208;ether is employed as a recognition site, the key ingredient for enhanced reactivity is the presence of the supramolecular receptor itself rather than its exact orientation, providing a guide for the rational design of supramolecular catalysts.

         <title>A Fluorescent Probe Differentiates Apoptosis from Cysteine&#8208;Deprivation Ferroptosis through Imaging of Viscosity and Lipid Droplets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a unique fluorescent probe PS&#8208;NAP, a MMP independent molecule that can potentially target mitochondria and map elevated mitochondrial viscosity during different cellular stress. However, during ferroptosis induced by cysteine deprivation, PS&#8208;NAP exclusively colocalizes in newly generated lipid droplets (LDs), thus demarcating cysteine deprivation&#8208;induced ferroptosis from other cellular stresses such as apoptosis.







Abstract
Since death is an inevitable phenomenon, exploring cell deaths holds importance. During this process, the cellular microenvironment within cells such as pH, polarity, viscosity etc alter. One such microenvironment, viscosity elevates during different cell deaths. However, demarcating cell death processes solely based on viscosity sensing is challenging. Herein, we develop a unique fluorescent probe PS&#8208;NAP after careful investigation among three analogues for efficient viscosity imaging in HeLa cells. Cationic PS&#8208;NAP, a MMP independent molecular probe, can potentially target mitochondria and map elevated mitochondrial viscosity during apoptosis, starvation and drug induced ferroptosis processes. Notably, during ferroptosis induced by cysteine deprivation, PS&#8208;NAP exclusively colocalizes in newly generated lipid droplets (LDs) instead of mitochondria. Thus, the probe has a potential for demarcating cysteine deprivation&#8208;induced ferroptosis from other cellular stresses such as apoptosis.

         <title>Heterogeneous Catalytic Oxidations with In Situ&#8208;Generated Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic polymers (IA&#8208;POPs) with in&#8208;built o&#8208;iodobenzoic acid (IA) moieties, accessed by Friedel&#8208;Crafts polyalkylation, are demonstrated as exceptional heterogeneous precatalysts for i) oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds and diols to lactones, and ii) cleavage of olefins, vicinal diols, and acyloins in the presence of Oxone&#174;, producing hypervalent iodine(V) IBX.







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) are novel emergent materials for heterogeneous organocatalysis owing to their remarkable physicochemical stabilities. Through a bottom&#8208;up approach entailing diligent design of twisted biaryl building blocks with in&#8208;built o&#8208;iodobenzoic acid (IA) moieties, a series of POP precatalysts, p&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP, DiMeIA&#8208;POP, and m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP, were synthesized by employing Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. These IA&#8208;POP precatalysts can undergo in&#8197;situ oxidation in the presence of Oxone&#174; to generate hypervalent iodine(V) species (&#955;5&#8208;iodanes), in particular, modified o&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid, popularly termed IBX, which mediates diverse oxidative transformations. The applications of m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP as a heterogeneous precatalyst in the presence of Oxone&#174; are demonstrated for facile oxidation of i) primary and secondary alcohols to carbonyl compounds, ii) cleavage of olefins, vicinal diols, and acyloins into carboxylic acids and iii) oxidation of diols to lactones; the in&#8197;situ formation of the &#955;5&#8208;iodane species in catalytic amounts precludes potential explosive attributes of IBX. It is shown that the IA&#8208;precatalyst (m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP) can be easily recycled without any loss of catalytic activity. The results constitute the first demonstration of the development of IA&#8208;bearing POP precatalysts for in&#8197;situ generation of hypervalent iodine(V) species and various heterogeneous oxidations mediated therefrom.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Dichloromethyldimerization of Alkenes with Chloroform: Access to Polychlorinated Vicinal Diaryl Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated strategy for directly synthesizing polychlorinated vicinal diaryl alkanes from aryl alkenes and chloroform is reported. Besides chloroform, this method also works with carbon tetrachloride, bromotrichloromethane, and &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylic esters, yielding 1,4&#8208;disubstituted vicinal diaryl alkanes. The approach uses simple, accessible materials, offering high selectivity, broad substrate scope, and mild conditions.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated strategy is reported for the direct synthesis of polychlorinated vicinal diaryl alkanes from aryl alkenes and chloroform. In this approach, two haloalkyl radicals generated from chloroform via halogen atom transfer (XAT) and direct single electron transfer (SET) within the same photoredox catalysis cycle enable the 1,4&#8208;dichloromethyldimerization of alkenes. Besides chloroform, this strategy is applicable to carbon tetrachloride, bromotrichloromethane, and &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylic esters, yielding corresponding 1,4&#8208;disubstituted vicinal diaryl alkanes. Diverse polychlorinated structures containing highly congested vicinal quaternary carbon centers are effectively synthesized by this method. The potential of this reaction in late&#8208;stage drug modification is highlighted by the successful transformation of olefins with pharmaceutical structures.

         <title>The Doping of Al3+ at the Tetrahedral Site of Spinel Mn3O4 for Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn3O4 spinel structure is unique in having both tetrahedral and octahedral metal sites to bring about interesting electrocatalytic behaviors. The phase transition from MnAl&#8208;LDH to Al&#8208;Mn3O4 is realized by a one&#8208;step annealing strategy, Al3+ preferentially occupies the center of Mn(II)O4, leaving Mn(III) with redox activity located in the key octahedral position. The OER performance of Al&#8208;doped Mn3O4 is effectively enhanced.







Abstract
Spinel oxides have attracted much attention for electrocatalytic water oxidation. Specially, the Mn&#8208;based spinel structures merits fundamental investigation, as Mn is involved in water oxidation in natural photosynthesis. Herein, Al&#8208;doped Mn3O4 spinel electrocatalyst was prepared for water oxidation. The Al cations selectively occupy the tetrahedral sites of Mn3O4 spinel structure, leaving Mn(III) at the catalytically critical octahedral sites. The substitution of Al3+ regulated the electronic structure of Mn3O4, induced lattice distortion and produced higher concentration of oxygen vacancy to promote the water oxidation performance.

         <title>Towards White Light Emission Through Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer (MMCT) Effect in Bi3+ Activated Ca2YTi2&#8208;mZrmGa3O12 (0&#8804;m&#8804;2) Garnets</title>

The garnet, Ca2YTi2Ga3O12, was explored as a host for Bi3+ ions (CYT:Bi) and its associated emission behaviour. A broad emission in the yellow&#8208;orange region with a maxima at 552&#8197;nm attributed to the MMCT transitions (Bi3+&#8722;Ti4+ pair). The compound, Ca2YZr2Ga3O12: Bi3+ (CYTZ:Bi), exhibits emission the violet region with a maxima at 395&#8197;nm was due to the 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 transition (A&#8208;band emission). Both the compounds, CYT:Bi, and CYTZ:Bi, were shown to exhibit white light emission by suitable co&#8208;doping of Tm3+ and Sm3+ ions.







Abstract
Herein, we report the high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state synthesis and intriguing optical features of Bi3+/Ln3+ doped Ca2YTi2Ga3O12 (CYT). The optical properties of CYT were fine&#8208;tuned by judiciously substituting Zr4+ ions at Ti4+ sites and Bi3+, Ln3+ ions at Y3+ sites. All these compounds are crystallized in a cubic crystal system with an Ia&#8208;3d (no. 230) space group. The Bi3+ doped systems showed a broad photoluminescence (PL) band in the yellow&#8208;orange region centered at ~552&#8197;nm from the metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer state (MMCT). The yellow&#8208;orange emissive CYT:Bix was co&#8208;doped with blue emissive Tm3+ to obtain an excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent color tuneable white light phosphor CYT:Tm0.02Bi0.012. Substituting Zr4+ ions in place of Ti4+ ions in CYT gave rise to CYTZ (Ca2YTi2&#8208;mZrmGa3O12), which upon doping with Bi gave Ca2YZr2Ga3O12:Bix (CYZ:Bix) and they exhibit the 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 emission in the violet&#8208;indigo region ( &#955;em=395&#8197;nm; &#955;ex=315&#8197;nm). On co&#8208;doping CYTZ:Bix with Sm3+ ions produced white light emissive Ca2YTi0.1Zr1.9Ga3O12:Bi3+; Sm3+, (CYTZ:Bi3+; Sm3+). CYT:Bix showed slower (microsecond) PL decay than the CYZ:Bix (nanosecond). The crystal structure, steady state, and time&#8208;resolved optical studies, and semiempirical calculations were employed to rationalize the observed optical features of these compounds. The optical features of CYT:Bi0.1, were explored for potential applications in secret writing.

         <title>Electrochemically Mediated Synthesis of Cyanated Heterocycles from &#945;&#8208;amino Esters, Pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes and NH4SCN as Cyano Group Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work reveals a mechanistically and conceptually rich electrochemical approach to the construction of CN&#8208;functionalized heterocycles from easily available substrates using the symbiosis of anodic oxidation of SCN anion to cyanide and cascade cyclization with Shono&#8208;type oxidation of saturated C&#8722;N bonds to C=N bonds.







Abstract
The electrochemically mediated cyanation/annulation process with in&#8197;situ cyanide ion generation from NH4SCN and multi&#8208;step oxidative construction of CN&#8208;functionalized heterocycles from easily available &#945;&#8208;amino esters and pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes has been discovered. Depending on the nature of the &#945;&#8208;amino ester, 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates, 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles, and the first reported 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles were obtained. The electrosynthesis is carried out in an undivided electrochemical cell under constant current conditions. The success of the discovered electrochemical synthesis is based on the combination of two anodic processes: oxidation of SCN anion to CN anion and oxidation of C&#8722;N bonds to C=N bonds during heterocycle construction. Mechanistic studies based on CV measurements, and control experiments confirm the generation of [CN] species from NH4SCN with subsequent addition to an imine formed from &#945;&#8208;amino esters and pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde. Computational analysis suggests that for reactive intermediates from glycine esters, the subsequent 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization leading to 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates is more favourable and the 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization leading to 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles is less favourable. For &#945;&#8208;amino esters with alkyl or aryl substituents, both cyclization pathways are relatively thermodynamically possible. The leading 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitrile showed high fungicidal activity against phytopathogenic fungi.

&lt;p&gt;The present work reveals a mechanistically and conceptually rich electrochemical approach to the construction of CN-functionalized heterocycles from easily available substrates using the symbiosis of anodic oxidation of SCN anion to cyanide and cascade cyclization with Shono-type oxidation of saturated C&#8722;N bonds to C=N bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemically mediated cyanation/annulation process with &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; cyanide ion generation from NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SCN and multi-step oxidative construction of CN-functionalized heterocycles from easily available &#945;-amino esters and pyridine-2-carbaldehydes has been discovered. Depending on the nature of the &#945;-amino ester, 1-cyano-imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxylates, 3-alkyl- and 3-aryl-imidazo[1,5-a]pyridines-1-carbonitriles, and the first reported 4-oxo-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine-1-carbonitriles were obtained. The electrosynthesis is carried out in an undivided electrochemical cell under constant current conditions. The success of the discovered electrochemical synthesis is based on the combination of two anodic processes: oxidation of SCN anion to CN anion and oxidation of C&#8722;N bonds to C=N bonds during heterocycle construction. Mechanistic studies based on CV measurements, and control experiments confirm the generation of [CN] species from NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SCN with subsequent addition to an imine formed from &#945;-amino esters and pyridine-2-carbaldehyde. Computational analysis suggests that for reactive intermediates from glycine esters, the subsequent 5-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-trig cyclization leading to 1-cyano-imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxylates is more favourable and the 6-&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-trig cyclization leading to 4-oxo-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine-1-carbonitriles is less favourable. For &#945;-amino esters with alkyl or aryl substituents, both cyclization pathways are relatively thermodynamically possible. The leading 4-oxo-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine-1-carbonitrile showed high fungicidal activity against phytopathogenic fungi.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Elastomers and Coatings via Metal Coordination Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarized the self&#8208;healing performance and mechanical properties of elastomers and coatings based on coordination bonds. Metal&#8208;ligand coordination structures can form metal ion clusters or induce microphase separation in polymer matrix, which can effectively dissipate mechanical energy and endowing the material with self&#8208;healing capabilities.







Abstract
Self&#8208;healing materials can recover the materials from physical damage, and extend the life of equipment. Metal coordination bonds are supramolecular interactions with tunable stability and sensitivity to external stimuli, which are crucial for developing self&#8208;healing materials. Incorporating metal coordination bonds into elastomers and coatings can enable materials to repair damage and enhance material performance. This review details the advance in self&#8208;healing elastomers and coatings. The structural characteristics, mechanical properties, and self&#8208;healing efficacy of these materials are discussed, and a perspective on the challenges and development directions is given.

         <title>pH&#8208; and Saccharide&#8208;Responsive Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes with Boronic Acid Moieties Displaying a Wide Range of Phosphorescence Colors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single compounds that display a wide range of luminescent colors are attractive as sensing materials. Novel cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes bearing two boronic acid moieties, which emit phosphorescent colors ranging from orange to greenish&#8208;blue depending on the solution pH and saccharide concentration, were developed.







Abstract
Single compounds displaying a wide range of luminescent colors are attractive optical materials for sensor applications. In this study, we present the beneficial combination of a cyclometalated iridium(III) complex scaffold and boronic acid units for designing stimulus&#8208;responsive luminescent materials with various emission colors. Five iridium(III) complexes bearing a diboronic acid ligand (bpyB2) were synthesized: Ir(C^N)bpyB2 (C^N=2&#8208;phenylpyridine (1), 2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)pyridine (2), 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)pyridine (3), benzo[h]quinoline (4), 1&#8208;phenylisoquinoline (5)). The luminescence color of Complexes 1&#8211;4 changed in response to the solution pH or saccharide concentration. Complex 1 exhibited a color change from orange to green&#8208;blue due to structural alteration of the boronic acid moiety from trigonal to tetrahedral. Furthermore, the luminescence color of Complex 1 changed reversibly due to repetitive changes in the solution pH between 5 and 10, enabling tuning of the luminescence color and pH tracking. Furthermore, the color range was tuned by selecting an appropriate C^N ligand. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory investigations revealed that the dramatic and reversible color changes could be ascribed to a switch in the electronic distribution in the lowest excited state from bpyB2 to C^N. The stimulus&#8208;responsive iridium(III) complexes provide a prospective scaffold for future applications in color&#8208;tunable optical devices and chemosensing systems.

         <title>Transition Metal Based Spin&#8208;Tuned Charge Transfer in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article presents an investigation into the conductivity of single&#8208;molecule wires featuring a ligand backbone with two different metal centers&#8208;Co2+ and Zn2+. This study emphasizes a significant method for examining metal&#8208;ligand interactions at the single&#8208;molecule scale, for both spin and non&#8208;spin systems. The findings could have implications for our understanding of electron transport in systems with metal atoms.







Abstract
Investigating the correlation between metal coordination and molecular conductivity in single&#8208;molecule systems is essential for advancing our knowledge of molecular electronics, particularly in the realm of spintronics. In the present study, we developed two complex wires utilizing the bipyridine ligand and two transition metal ions, Co2+ and Zn2+, aiming to study the impact of different spin characters on single&#8208;molecule charge transport properties. Single&#8208;molecule conductance was investigated using scanning tunnelling microscope breaking junctions (STM&#8208;BJ) technique and the underlying mechanism was analysed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We demonstrated that the conductance predominantly increases after inserting Zn2+, indicating a conducting channel has been constructed. In contrast, the conductance of the analogue coordinated with Co2+ does not change significantly, this can be explained by distinct disparities between spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down channels, in which destructive quantum interference in spin&#8208;down state counteracts the enhancement of molecular conductance. Our study establishes the groundwork for a systematic approach to the design, fabrication, and implementation of single&#8208;complex conductance explorations.

         <dc:description>
A photosensitizer&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free C&#8722;N coupling of aldehydes with azoles was described. The coupling reagent was directly excited by light to obtain the product in high yield, and this strategy was successfully applied to gram&#8208;scale reactions and late&#8208;modification of various drug molecules and natural products.







Abstract
A catalyst&#8208;free photochemical N&#8208;acylation of azoles with aldehydes has been developed using inexpensive BrCCl3 as the oxidant. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free amidation proceeded efficiently with a wide variety of substrates to give the corresponding N&#8208;acylazoles, including for the late modification of pharmaceutically active molecules, and on a gram&#8208;scale.

         <title>Anodic Activation of Prussian Blue Analog Leads to Highly Active Cobalt&#8208;Doped Nickel (Oxy)Hydroxide for Organic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anodic activation of NiCo Prussian blue analog yields a highly active Co&#8208;doped Ni(O)OH catalyst with nanosheet architecture, enabling efficient and selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. This catalyst achieves up to 97&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for the production of benzoic acid and industrial&#8208;level current densities at low applied potential, outperforming conventional pristine Ni and Co&#8208;based analogs.







Abstract
Water&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols into valuable chemicals is a promising strategy to circumvent the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation, while also reducing cell voltage and improving energy efficiency. Recently, transition metal (TM)&#8208;based catalysts have been investigated for anodic alcohol oxidation, but success has been limited due to competition from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within the working regime. In this study, NiCo&#8208;based Prussian blue analog (PBA) was electrochemically activated at the anodic potential to produce a Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH active catalyst with a nanosheet&#8208;like architecture. This catalyst was further employed for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (PhCH2OH) to benzoic acid (PhCOOH), achieving a 97&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE). The electrochemical activity of Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH was also compared with hydrothermally prepared CoNi&#8208;LDH, demonstrating that the PBA&#8208;derived Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH was more effective.

     alt="Anodic Activation of Prussian Blue Analog Leads to Highly Active Cobalt-Doped Nickel (Oxy)Hydroxide for Organic Oxidation Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anodic activation of NiCo Prussian blue analog yields a highly active Co-doped Ni(O)OH catalyst with nanosheet architecture, enabling efficient and selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. This catalyst achieves up to 97&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for the production of benzoic acid and industrial-level current densities at low applied potential, outperforming conventional pristine Ni and Co-based analogs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water-assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols into valuable chemicals is a promising strategy to circumvent the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation, while also reducing cell voltage and improving energy efficiency. Recently, transition metal (TM)-based catalysts have been investigated for anodic alcohol oxidation, but success has been limited due to competition from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within the working regime. In this study, NiCo-based Prussian blue analog (PBA) was electrochemically activated at the anodic potential to produce a Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH active catalyst with a nanosheet-like architecture. This catalyst was further employed for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (PhCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) to benzoic acid (PhCOOH), achieving a 97&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE). The electrochemical activity of Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH was also compared with hydrothermally prepared CoNi-LDH, demonstrating that the PBA-derived Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH was more effective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>De Novo Design of Lipopeptide&#8208;Based &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Like Self&#8208;Assemblies: A Strategy to Develop Fusion Inhibitors as Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antivirals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Membrane&#8208;assisted supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like organization of a lipopeptide inhibit fusion and combat infections from enveloped viruses.







Abstract
The recent surge in emerging viral infections warrants the design of broad&#8208;spectrum antivirals. We aim to develop a lead molecule that targets a common biochemical feature of many enveloped viruses, membrane fusion. To achieve the broad&#8208;spectrum ability, instead of targeting the fusion machinery, we plan to modulate the physicochemical properties of the host and viral membranes to block fusion. The approach is based on the Coronin&#8208;1 protein of Mycobacterium, which presumably inhibits the phagosome&#8208;lysosome fusion, and a unique Trp&#8211;Asp (WD) sequence is placed at the distorted &#946;&#8208;meander motif. We designed a WD&#8208;based branched lipopeptide (Myr&#8208;D(WD)2) that supported the intermolecular interactions to create a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like supramolecular assembly at the membrane surface. TEM and confocal fluorescence experiments also suggest that the lipopeptide self&#8208;assembled at the bilayer interface and modulated the interfacial order and the water penetration. We demonstrated that the supramolecular organization of Myr&#8208;D(WD)2 could block artificial membrane fusion completely and restrict pH&#8208;dependent influenza virus (H1N1, H9N2), and pH&#8208;independent mouse hepatitis virus, human coronavirus (HCoV&#8208;OC43) infections. The present study provided an evidence&#8208;based broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral potential of a designed self&#8208;assembled lipopeptide.

         <title>Reversed Allylation of 3&#8208;Alkenyl Indoles Using Allyl Boronic Acids: Access to Tryptamine Based Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique indole&#8208;C2&#8208;reverse allylation is reported employing allyl boronic acid in the absence of any catalyst and additive. The electrophilic vinylogous&#8208;imine&#8208;like structure generated by dearomatization of 3&#8208;alkenyl indole first undergoes N&#8594;B chelation which eventually drives the selective 1,2&#8208;allylation and aromaticity of indole nucleus is regained by alkene isomerization, rendering the process redox&#8208;neutral. This method enabled the first total syntheses of brocaeloid C, penindolene C, fluevirine E and mucronatin B.







Abstract
All&#8208;carbon quaternary and tertiary stereocenters connected at the C2&#8208;position of functionalizable C3&#8208;alkylated indole nucleus are commonly occurring frameworks found in many indole alkaloids of medicinal importance. Their direct access is scarcely reported, a long&#8208;standing problem, and developing a unique yet simple method can pave the pathway to an entirely different retrosynthetic route for the total synthesis of these alkaloids. Herein, this problem is addressed by developing an unprecedented branch&#8208;selective allylation strategy employing a broad range of structurally and electronically different 3&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;indoles and allylboronic acids. The use of readily accessible starting precursors renders this method attractive for the total synthesis of indole alkaloids. The present strategy shows excellent functional group tolerance, atom economic, redox&#8208;neutral, scalable and easy to operate. The DFT calculation on the possible transition states indicated that allylboronic acid acts as a nucleophile rather than a more reactive boroxine. Mechanistically, this strategy is designed by exploiting the loss as well as regaining the indole's aromaticity. The utility of this method is demonstrated in the total syntheses of seven prenylated tryptamine alkaloids and the first total syntheses of dimeric indole alkaloids, fluevirine E and mucronatin B.

         <title>Recent Progress in Atomically Precise Cu&#8722;M Alloy Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review encapsulates recent progress in efficient synthetic methodologies and structural elucidation techniques tailored for Cu&#8722;M alloy nanoclusters. It underscores the intrinsic physical and chemical properties that enable precise control over their sizes and surface characteristics. Illustrative instances of Cu&#8722;M alloy nanoclusters are leveraged to showcase their photoluminescent and catalytic traits, shedding light on their multifaceted functionalities and prospective applications.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (NCs) with dimensions of approximately 3&#8197;nm serve as a crucial link between metal&#8208;organic complexes and metal nanoparticles, garnering significant interest due to their distinctive molecule&#8208;like characteristics. These include well&#8208;defined molecular structures, clear HOMO&#8211;LUMO transitions, quantized charge, and robust luminescence emission. Atomically precise alloy NCs, in contrast to homometallic NCs, exhibit a wealth of structures and intriguing properties, with their novel attributes often intricately tied to the positions of alloyed elements within the structure, facilitating the exploration of structure&#8208;property relationships. A notable subgroup within this category comprises Cu&#8722;M (where M represents metals such as Au, Ag, Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt, Zn, Al etc.) alloy NCs. In this review, we initially outline recent advancements in the development of efficient synthetic techniques for Cu&#8722;M alloy NCs, emphasizing the underlying physical and chemical properties that enable precise control over their sizes and surface characteristics. Subsequently, we delve into recent progress in structural elucidation techniques for Cu&#8722;M alloy NCs. This structural insight is instrumental in comprehensively understanding the structure&#8208;property correlations at the molecular level. Finally, we showcase various examples of Cu&#8722;M alloy NCs to illustrate their photoluminescent and catalytic properties, shedding light on their diverse functionalities and potential applications.

A supramolecular fluorescent material is constructed by using double&#8208;cavity twisted cucurbit[14]uril (tQ[14]) and positively charged Astrazon Pink FG (APFG) based on the non&#8208;covalent host&#8208;guest interaction. The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect induces the APFG@tQ[14] probe to emit a strong orange&#8208;red fluorescence.

In this study, a supramolecular fluorescent material was constructed by using double&#8208;cavity twisted cucurbit[14]uril (tQ[14]) and positively charged Astrazon Pink FG (APFG) based on the non&#8208;covalent host&#8208;guest interaction for the first time. The thermodynamic parameters of the APFG@tQ[14] in aqueous solution were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the results indicated that the spontaneous assembly of APFG@tQ[14] is mainly driven by enthalpy. The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect induced the APFG@tQ[14] probe to emit a strong orange&#8208;red fluorescence. Due to its good optical properties and low toxicity, APFG@tQ[14] was successfully applied to multi&#8208;channel imaging of HK2 cells. This demonstrates the great potential of APFG@tQ[14] in labeling and tracking living cells.

         <title>In situ Selenization Induced Electron&#8208;Rich Pd with Weakened O2 Adsorption for Boosted Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd cocatalysts show great potential for the photocatalytic production of H2O2. However, the catalytic efficiency of Pd cocatalyst is limited due to the strong adsorption of O2, which promotes O&#8208;O bond cleavage and thus reduces selectivity for the two&#8208;electron O2 reduction reaction. Considering that adjusting the electron density of Pd can predominately optimize Pd&#8208;Oads bond strength, in this work, electron&#8208;rich Pd sites are constructed by introducing Bi2Se3 middle layer between Pd cocatalysts and (010) facet of BiVO4 using an in&#8208;situ selenization strategy. The photocatalytic results indicate that the designed BiVO4/Bi2Se3&#8208;Pd(0.3%) photocatalyst achieves a high H2O2 yield of 2166 &#956;mol L&#8208;&#185; in 2 h, which is 36 times and 3.75 times higher than BiVO4/Bi2Se3 and BiVO4/Pd photocatalyst, respectively. Additionally, the corresponding AQE value of BiVO4/Bi2Se3&#8208;Pd is 6.71%. The subsequent Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and XPS spectra confirm that the introduction of Bi2Se3 via in&#8208;situ selenization increases the electron density of Pd. This enhances the formation of electron&#8208;rich Pd sites, reduces O2 adsorption, and ultimately improves the photocatalytic H2O2 yield. This strategy provides insights into designing efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production through electronic structure modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures and Properties of Axially Chiral (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;Nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;Tetraenoate Derivatives Highly Substituted by Aryl groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprecedented (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetraenoate derivatives highly substituted by aryl groups have been synthesized by the reaction of rhodium complexes having aryl&#8208;substituted hexa&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trienyl ligands with acrylates. These compounds have potential axial chirality, and their enantiomers are isolable by the chiral HPLC technique. Although the racemization barrier of isolated enantiomers was not high, it was found that a cyclic dimer synthesized by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail transesterification of a modified analog has quite a stable axial chirality even at a high temperature. From a structural analogy with tetraphenylethene, those compounds are emissive in the solid state, and the chiral cyclic dimer exhibits solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Monosubstituted [n]Paracyclophane using a Desymmetrization/Kinetic Resolution Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically pure monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes are promising candidates for material synthesis, asymmetric catalysis, and drug discovery. Thus far, only a few catalytic asymmetric synthesis processes have been reported for assessing these stained atropisomers. In this study, we describe a highly enantioselective synthesis of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes by combining desymmetrization and kinetic resolution. The proposed protocol involves Pd&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8211;H bond olefination enabled by a monoprotected amino acid ligand, which affords a variety of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes with excellent enantioselectivity (&#8805;99% ee). Thermodynamic experiments are conducted to investigate the racemization barrier. The synthesized monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes exhibit vivid fluorescence and impressive circularly polarized luminescence. Further, the emission color and dissymmetry factor can be tuned and controlled by switching the substituent on the benzene ring of the cyclophanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Propargylations of Azinium Ions&#160;via&#160;Hydroxydihydroazine Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nucleophilic propargylation of azinium ions with a propargylboronate proceeds efficiently under gold(I) catalysis. A range of N&#8208;alkylated pyridinium, quinolinium, and pyrazinium ions undergo propargylation with good yields and high regioselectivities to give various functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines, 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines, and 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrazines. No allenylation side&#8208;products are observed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the mechanisms of these reactions. Hydroxydihydroazine &#160;intermediates formed by the addition of LiOH to the azinium ions were found to be the reactive electrophiles in these reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemically induced dimerization/proximity (CID/CIP) systems controlled by chemical dimerizers (also known as molecular glues) provide valuable means for understanding and manipulating complex, dynamic biological systems. In this study, we present the development of versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic systems utilizing azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) for reversible protein dimerization controlled by visible light. These systems allow multiple cycles of light&#8208;induced dimerization, overcoming the limitations of irreversible photolysis in previous systems. Through optimizing photoswitch properties and linker strategies, we achieved efficient and reversible control using blue, green, and red light. We demonstrate that these systems enable rapid and reversible control of protein function in vitro and in cells. The findings represent a significant advancement in chemo&#8208;optogenetics, offering opportunities to expand applications requiring precise spatiotemporal regulation of dynamic biological processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8211;Bismuth Tricycles: Maximizing Stability by Constraint</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constrained peptides possess excellent properties for identifying lead compounds in drug discovery. While it has become increasingly straightforward to discover selective high&#8208;affinity peptide ligands, especially through genetically encoded libraries, their stability and bioavailability remain significant challenges. By integrating macrocyclization chemistry with bismuth binding, we generated series of linear, cyclic, bicyclic, and tricyclic peptides with identical sequences. Utilizing bismuth to rigidify the peptide structure allows for a better comparison of different constraint levels, reducing confounding effects of interactions often seen with hydrophobic stapling reagents. Our study facilitated the identification of a peptide&#8211;bismuth tricycle that fully withstands cellular levels of glutathione, acts as a nanomolar protease inhibitor without being proteolytically digested by its target, and is fully stable in human plasma. Importantly, this multicyclic peptide does not possess any non&#8208;canonical amino acid modifications. Using oxime ligation, we conjugated an analogue of this tricycle to the N&#8208;terminus of two nanobodies to demonstrate potential applications in targeted therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic reduction of imines with silylformates: Formation of silyl carbamates through CO2 insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silylformates are emerging surrogates of hydrosilanes, able to reduce carbonyl groups in transfer hydrosilylation reactions, with the concomitant release of CO2. In this work, a new reactivity is revealed for silylformates, in the presence of imines. Using ruthenium catalysts, and lithium iodide as a co&#8208;catalyst, imines are shown to undergo hydrocarboxysilylation by formal insertion of CO2 to the N&#8208;Si bond of silyl amine to yield silyl carbamates in excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Dependent Chemoselective Amide or Thioamide Ligation of Acylsilanes with Amines using Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the diverse chemical and physical properties of functional groups, mild and controllable ligation methods are often required to construct complex drugs and functional materials. To make diverse sets of products with tunable physicochemical properties, it is also useful to employ complimentary ligation methods that adopt the same starting materials. Here, we disclose the efficient and modular synthesis of amides or thioamides through the chemical ligation of acyl silanes with amines, simply by turning a light on or off. This method is fast, mild, high&#8208;yielding and displays excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. The versatility of these reactions is highlighted by their ability to perform post&#8208;synthetic modifications on a variety of marketed medications, peptides, natural substances, and compounds with biological activity. In&#8208;depth computational and experimental studies clarified the photo&#8208;dependent umpolung of reactivity of acyl silanes, namely: photoexcitation leads to nucleophilic O&#8208;silyl carbenes that react with S8 to form O&#8208;silyl thionoesters and eventually amides. In contrast, acyl silanes react as electrophiles with amines thermally in the dark, with C&#8594;O silyl transfer, prior to reacting with S8 to form thioamides. These mechanistic details are expected to guide the development of similar coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>pH Controlled Transient Cyclization of Peptides for Increased Stability towards Oral Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral delivery of peptides is challenged by low bioavailability. Here, pH responsive linearization of cyclic peptides is described as a strategy for transient protection of peptides to extend their half&#8208;life in model systems. Peptides were cyclized to increase their stability at the low pH in the stomach, while they linearize at neutral pH. This led to PYY3&#8208;36 analogues with pH responsive linearization for increased stability.







Abstract
Peptides are highly efficient for treatment of many diseases, especially in oncology and diabetes. Oral delivery of peptides is desirable, but is challenged by low bioavailability and new chemical methods to enable oral delivery are needed. Here, we developed pH responsive linearization as a strategy for transient protection of peptides to extend their half&#8208;life in model systems. Peptides were cyclized to increase their stability at the low pH in the stomach, while they linearize at neutral pH to form the active peptide. We developed ester based responsive linkers with a protonable amine for O&#8208;to&#8208;N acyl shift, which allowed linearization strategies based on pyroglutamoyl (pGlu) or diketopiperazine (DKP) formation. After coupling of the linker, peptides were cyclized by CuAAC. We studied the stability against simulated gastric fluid (SGF) at different pH and the ability of cyclic peptides to linearize. This led to PYY3&#8211;36 analogues with pH responsive linearization for increased stability.

         <title>Facile and Regioselective Deuteration of C2&#8208;Alkylated Imidazolium Salts in the Presence of Cesium Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C2&#8208;alkylated imidazolium salts are readily and regioselectively deuterated on their C2&#945; exocyclic position and/or C4=C5 heterocyclic backbone using D2O, a cheap, non&#8208;toxic deuterium source, and Cs2CO3, a weak, innocuous, inorganic base. This simple and efficient procedure eases the access to valuable isotopomers of compounds that are widely employed as bioactive molecules, ionic liquids, organocatalysts, and carbene ligand precursors.







Abstract
Thirteen imidazolium iodides bearing benzyl, mesityl, or 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl substituents on their nitrogen atoms, and C1&#8211;C4 alkyl chains on their C2 carbon atom were readily deuterated with D2O as a cheap and non&#8208;toxic deuterium source in the presence of Cs2CO3, a weak, innocuous, inorganic base. The isotopic exchange proceeded quickly and efficiently under mild, aerobic conditions to afford a range of aNHC and NHO precursors regioselectively labeled on their C2&#945; exocyclic position and/or C4=C5 heterocyclic backbone. A &#8220;carbene&#8208;free&#8221; mechanism was postulated, in which the carbonate anion acts as a catalyst to activate an exocyclic, acidic C&#8722;H bond and ease a deuterium transfer from D2O to the imidazolium salt in a concerted fashion.

         <title>Optoelectronic Properties and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Application of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Derived From 2,6&#8208;DicarboxyBODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized BODIPY dyes with benzyl ester and carboxylic acid groups, showing charge transfer, polarity&#8208;dependent triplet state formation, and pH&#8208;dependent emission. Fluorescence lifetime microscopy revealed distinct lifetime gradients in colon cancer cells and pig enteroids. These results highlight the potential of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPYs as fluorescent probes for cancer and stem cell imaging.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor BODIPY dyads, functionalized at the 2 and 6 positions with benzyl ester (BDP&#8208;DE) or carboxylic acid (BDP&#8208;DA) groups, were synthesized, and their optoelectronic properties were investigated. Carbonyl groups were found to increase the reduction potential of the BODIPY core by 0.15&#8211;0.4&#8197;eV compared to regular alkyl&#8208;substituted BODIPYs. These compounds exhibited efficient intramolecular charge separation and triplet state formation through the spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process, achieving singlet oxygen quantum yields of up to 92&#8201;%, depending on the solvent polarity. Notably, the fluorescence and singlet oxygen generation of BDP&#8208;DAs were found to depend on the ionization state of the carboxylic groups. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements revealed that complexation of BDP&#8208;DAs with bovine serum albumine (BSA) significantly extended their excited state lifetimes. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) studies of human colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) cells and pig small intestinal organoids (enteroids) provided insights into subcellular localization. The diacid with 2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl group at the meso&#8208;position (DA1) displayed longer lifetimes in lipid&#8208;droplet&#8208;like structures and shorter lifetimes in cytoplasmic regions. The diacid containing a meso&#8208;anthracenyl group (DA2) formed &#8242;islands&#8217; in cell monolayers, exhibiting a distinct lifetime gradient from the periphery to the center. These results highlight the potential of donor&#8208;acceptor BODIPYs as fluorescent probes for biological imaging, particularly in revealing subtle differences in cellular environments.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay of cTnI with Ruthenium&#8208;Based Metal Covalent Organic Framework and Dual DNAzymes Cascade Amplification Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous structural Ru&#8208;MCOF acts as a microreactor with a nanoconfinement effect, accelerating co&#8208;reactant diffusion and promoting ECL emitter excitation. Combined with dual DNAzymes&#8208;driven catalytic hairpin amplification, an ECL immunosensor was constructed for sensitive cTnI detection with high sensitivity and accuracy. The high&#8208;stable Ru&#8208;MCOF opens a new approach for the exploitation of MCOF&#8208;based luminophores for early clinical diagnosis.







Abstract
Currently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunability and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high stability are promising nanomaterials for electrochemiluminescence (ECL), while Ru&#8208;based metal covalent organic frameworks (Ru&#8208;MCOFs) have rarely been reported. Herein, an ECL immunosensor based on a strong ECL&#8208;emitting Ru&#8208;MCOF was proposed for the sensitive detection of the cardiac troponin&#8208;I (cTnI). Imine&#8208;linked Ru&#8208;MCOF was prepared as an ECL emitter via solvothermal method using tris (4,4&#8242; &#8208;diamino&#8208;2,2&#8242; &#8208;bipyridine) ruthenium (II) (Ru(dbpy)32+) as a precursor. Compared with monomers, the imine&#8208;linked Ru&#8208;MCOF achieved structural extension through covalent bonds, which not only effectively facilitated the electrochemical activation of the luminophores, but also shortened the transmission distance between electrons and co&#8208;reactants, generating significant ECL emission. In addition, the porous Ru&#8208;MCOF provided a microreactor with nanoconfinement effect, which could accelerate the diffusion of co&#8208;reactants into the framework and promote the excitation of internal and external ECL emitters, significantly enhancing the ECL intensity. Considering the excellent ECL performance of Ru&#8208;MCOF, combined with dual DNAzymes&#8208;driven catalytic hairpin amplification, the ECL immunosensor achieved sensitive detection of cTnI with a detection limit as low as 0.42&#8197;fg/mL. The proposed highly stable Ru&#8208;MCOF raises a new approach for exploring MCOF&#8208;based luminophores, highlighting the potential of MCOFs in advanced ECL emitters.

Compared with monomers, the imine-linked Ru-MCOF achieved structural extension through covalent bonds, which not only effectively facilitated the electrochemical activation of the luminophores, but also shortened the transmission distance between electrons and co-reactants, generating significant ECL emission. In addition, the porous Ru-MCOF provided a microreactor with nanoconfinement effect, which could accelerate the diffusion of co-reactants into the framework and promote the excitation of internal and external ECL emitters, significantly enhancing the ECL intensity. Considering the excellent ECL performance of Ru-MCOF, combined with dual DNAzymes-driven catalytic hairpin amplification, the ECL immunosensor achieved sensitive detection of cTnI with a detection limit as low as 0.42&#8197;fg/mL. The proposed highly stable Ru-MCOF raises a new approach for exploring MCOF-based luminophores, highlighting the potential of MCOFs in advanced ECL emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Metal&#8208;Mediated Molecular Switching of a Phosphaethene Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;triggered isomerization of truxene&#8208;based phosphaalkene Z&#8208;P1 gives approx. 15&#8201;% E&#8208;isomer in the photostationary state. In contrast, gold (I) coordination affords the selective inversion of the phosphaalkene stereochemistry yielding quantitatively [AuCl(E&#8208;P1)]







Abstract
This experimental and theoretical study illustrates how phosphaalkenes, which are isolobal to alkenes, can utilize a variety of external triggers for molecular switching. The E/Z isomerization of a truxene&#8208;based phosphaalkene, i.&#8201;e. TruxC=P&#8208;Mes* (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tris&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;benzene), is accomplished by irradiation, metal coordination, or deprotonation of the truxene core. The reversible and quantitative Z/E double bond isomerization by gold(I) coordination/decoordination of the phosphorous lone pair represents a novel fuelling strategy for molecular switches.

         <title>Luminescence and Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species in Solution by Ta6Br12 Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unprecedently reveals the NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence of {Ta6Br12}2+ cluster complexes dissolved in water and deuterated water, with lifetimes ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds. DFT calculations indicate that the emission is mainly associated with fluorescence transitions. Reaction with O&#8322; promotes partial quenching of the luminescence and the generation of peroxide and superoxide radical species.







Abstract
An intrinsic metal cluster NIR&#8208;II emission of the {Ta6Br12}2+ aqua/hydroxocomplexes was determined in aqueous solutions under inert atmosphere. The photoluminescence (PL) is enhanced in D2O, and the lifetime scale expands from nanoseconds to microseconds. Possible cluster emission transitions have been assigned and analyzed from a computational perspective. In the presence of O2, the cluster compound kept its robustness but showed partial quenching of the PL. Stern&#8208;Volmer and laser&#8208;flash photolysis studies confirmed that quenching is mainly associated with O2 diffusion. Laser&#8208;flash photolysis experiments showed that singlet oxygen (1O2) was not detected under measurement conditions. Generation of peroxide and superoxide radical species after irradiation in D2O was confirmed by using luminol as a probe, whereas no hydroxide radical species were detected as evidenced by the emission of the 3&#8208;coumarin carboxylic acid (3&#8208;CCA) molecular sensor.

         <title>Exploring the Metal&#8208;Centered Reactivity of Isomeric, N&#8208;Bridged Biscyclometalated Platinum(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of platinum chemistry is ubiquitous in the research of anticancer drugs and new OLED materials. Within the vast library of existing compounds, the majority of work focuses on complexes in the +2 and +4 oxidation states, with comparatively few examples of PtIII complexes reported without bridging ligands. PtIII complexes with metal&#8208;metal bonding can be made by mild oxidation of PtII complexes having bis(phenylpyridine) ligands. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of two new PtII complexes bearing tetradentate N&#8208;bridged bis(phenylpyridine) ligands with N^C*C^N and C^N*N^C coordinating atoms. Through chemical oxidation with PhICl2 and N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide, we obtained four new complexes containing PtIV and PtIII centres. The dynamics of the PtIII complexes were explored by variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies and showed surprisingly free rotation of the appended N&#8208;aryl group. This work uncovers the importance of the destabilizing nature of the bulky N&#8208;aryl group on intermetallic bonds, and sheds light on how the molecular rotation observed in the PtIII compounds could inspire new molecular rotors driven by intermetallic bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Binder with Self&#8208;Emulsifying Characteristics for Practical Si/C Anode in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon/carbon (Si/C) materials have achieved commercial applications as a solution to the problems of large volume expansion and short lifespan of silicon&#8208;based anodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the potential risk of structural fracture and localized differences in surface adsorption properties lead to difficulties in maintaining the structural integrity of Si/C anodes using conventional binders during repeated lithiation/delithiation. Herein, an aqueous binder (PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M) based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) grafted methacrylic acid (MAA) obtained by self&#8208;emulsifyingemulsion polymerization is reported. The introduction of carboxyl groups of MAA enables PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M to form more hydrogen bonds, thereby enhancing both the cohesion of the binder film and its adhesion to silicon&#8208;based surface. Simultaneously, the methyl&#8208;containing segments of MAA can wet the carbon&#8208;based surface, thereby enhancing the adhesion of PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M to carbonaceous materials. In addition, the hydroxyl groups on both the PVA segments and the silicon surface can be esterified with the carboxyl groups during the heat treatment, thus further improving the bonding strength. As&#8208;prepared Si/C anodes with PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M binder can significantly inhibit the electrode volume expansion and maintain high structural integrity during cycling as well as form SEIs with high lithium fluoride content, showing excellent cycling stability (81.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles).</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Deracemization: A Sustainable Approach to Enantiopurity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical deracemization (MCDR) is presented as a new, general and sustainable approach to obtain enantiomerically pure compounds. By combining ball milling with deracemization, various functionalities such as ketones, isoindolinones, imines, esters and even an inorganic compound are successfully deracemized. High enantiomeric excesses (ee) are achieved, while reaction time is reduced by up to 97&#8201;% and solvent consumption by up to 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
We introduce mechanochemical deracemization (MCDR) as a novel strategy for obtaining enantiopure compounds. This study demonstrates the successful transposition of six archetypical deracemization reactions from a solvent&#8208;based to a solvent&#8208;minimized ball milling environment. The scope includes a ketone, isoindolinones, imines, an ester, and an inorganic compound, all of which deracemized successfully. Key parameters such as milling material, ball number and size, the use of a bulk material and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) were systematically investigated, revealing their crucial role. Quantitative enantiomeric excesses (ee) were achieved, while reaction times were reduced by up to 97&#8201;% and solvent consumption by as much as 100&#8201;%. This work establishes MCDR as a versatile, sustainable pathway to enantiopure compounds. By highlighting the generalizability of this approach and its huge potential for minimizing waste, this study provides the foundation for future advancements in mechanochemical deracemization.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#932;his Review presents a comprehensive overview of the very recent developments on COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for H2O2 evolution. First, neat COFs with variable architecture are critically explored, followed by the presentation of the most promising hybrid COF&#8208;based heterojunctions. Several structure&#8208;activity aspects affecting the photocatalytic performance of these materials is thoroughly discussed.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered advanced class materials due to their exotic structural and optical properties. The abundance of starting monomers with variable linkage motifs may give rise to multiple conformations in either 2D or 3D fashion. Tailoring of the abovementioned properties has facilitated the application of COFs in a wide range of applications, which are strongly correlated with energy conversion schemes. Having a crystalline porous character and a large set of donor&#8208;acceptor combinations, COFs are expected to make huge impact in photocatalytic processes. In this Review, we present the recent advances in the development of semiconducting COF&#8208;based systems towards the photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide evolution. An overview is given about the effect of various parameters on the photocatalytic performance, such as charge transfer tuning, wettability by chemical functionalization, topology, porosity and crystallinity. Various challenges are discussed, and constructive insights are given for the development of highly functional COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for H2O2 evolution.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyl (CBBC) represents a readily available figure&#8208;eight molecule. Herein, we prepared ten donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type CBBC derivatives with changing the donor substituents and their substituent positions to systematically investigate the structure&#8211;property relationship. The functionalization of the para&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups resulted in better tunability of emission colors rather than meta&#8208;functionalization, whose color variation ranges from light blue to red.







Abstract
The scalable synthesis of figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;systems is challenging for the conventional bottom&#8208;up approach. We have recently reported that the oxidative inner&#8208;bond cleavage of commercially available dibenzo[g,p]chrysene efficiently furnishes a figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;acceptor, cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyl (CBBC), in large quantity. Furthermore, its donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type derivative with four N&#8208;carbazolyl substituents at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups exhibited thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high |gCPL| value of 1.0&#215;10&#8722;2. Herein, we synthesized nine donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type CBBC derivatives by changing the donor substituents and their positions. Compared to previously reported carbazole&#8208;substituted CBBC, tetramethylcarbazole&#8208; and 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylacridine&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibited enhanced emission quantum yields and accelerated reverse intersystem crossing. The functionalization of the para&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups resulted in better tunability of emission colors rather than meta&#8208;functionalization, whose color variation ranges from light blue to red. The incorporation of bulky substituents at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups induced the conformational change to a distorted ring structure. Investigation of the substituent effect on the chiroptical properties revealed that the introduction of less bulky donor units such as carbazole at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups is effective in achieving high |gCPL| values.

         <title>Recent Applications of Pillararene&#8208;Inspired Water&#8208;Soluble Hosts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillararenes has emerged as versatile and efficient tools for molecular recognition and assembly. Moreover, the design and synthesis of novel macrocycles with distinctive structures and properties can unleash new opportunities for supramolecular chemistry. This review highlights recent advances in novel pillararene&#8208;inspired water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic hosts including their molecular recognition and applications in functional material, catalysis and biomedicine.







Abstract
Pillararenes and their derivatives have emerged in supramolecular chemistry as unique macrocycles for applications in host&#8211;guest chemistry, materials science and biomimetics. Many variations have been conceived and synthesized in recent years and in this review, we relate progress in water&#8208;soluble versions: leaning towerarenes, extended&#8208;pillararenes, biphenarenes, helicarenes and octopusarenes. These are applied in targeted drug delivery, selective uptake and release of aromatic guests, fabrication of gold/silver and mesoporous silica nanoparticles, cell imaging, pollutant separation, biomedicine (e.&#8201;g. biofilm disruptors, taste masking containers, neuromuscular blockers, antidotes for macromolecular biotoxin) and enantioselective recognition. It is intended that this review will be helpful for research in synthetic macrocyclic chemistry and supramolecular functional systems, leading to practical applications in various research areas.

         <title>The Missing Link in the Monogermanide Series: YbGe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the synthesis of YbGe under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions, the series of binary rare&#8208;earth monogermanides is completed. The compound crystallizes in a FeB&#8208;type structure, such as the representatives La&#8722;Pr, and Lu. Despite the absence of &#8220;excess&#8221; electrons, 4&#8208;atomic Yb4 basins were found, with an increasing formation tendency as Yb&#8810;Lu&lt;La.







Abstract
High&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature synthesis at 12&#8197;GPa between 750 and 1000&#8201;&#176;C for 30 to 300&#8197;min yields the last missing rare&#8208;earth metal monogermanide, YbGe. Powder and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements reveal that the compound crystallizes in a FeB&#8208;type structure (space group Pnma, a=7.901(2)&#8197;&#197;, b=3.8981(9)&#8197;&#197;, and c=5.873(2)&#8197;&#197;). The results of the chemical bonding study, while supporting the presence of polyanionic Ge chains interacting with the surrounding Yb through multi&#8208;atomic polar bonds, suggest a transitional scenario between the monogermanides formed by alkaline&#8208;earth elements and those formed by trivalent rare&#8208;earth metals.

         <title>Unusual Reaction of Isocyanides with Aromatic Aldehydes Catalyzed by a Supramolecular Capsule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented reaction between isocyanides and electron poor aromatic aldehydes leading to the corresponding imine and carbon monoxide was disclosed to be promoted by the hexameric self&#8208;assembled resorcinarene capsule. The mechanism was elucidated considering kinetic investigation, isotopic labelling, metadynamics calculations and intermediate synthesis.







Abstract
The supramolecular resorcinarene hexameric capsule efficiently promotes the unprecedented reaction between isocyanides and electron&#8208;deficient aromatic aldehydes leading to the formation of imines and carbon monoxide. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated via isotope labelling, kinetic analysis of the reaction, computational studies and the independent synthesis of a proposed intermediate. Control experiments indicate that the formation of the key aziridinone intermediate is limited to the cavity of the capsule.

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Liquid Synthesis of Atomic Molybdenum Nitride Clusters as Bifunctional Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMNs) have garnered considerable attention for energy conversion applications owing to their exceptional electronic structures and high catalytic activities. However, the scarcity of active sites in TMNs impedes their large&#8208;scale application. This study describes the use of wetness impregnation and ionic&#8208;liquid methods to enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency of molybdenum nitride (MoN) atomic clusters finely dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (MoN@NC) substrates. The as&#8208;synthesized electrocatalysts feature atomically dispersed MoN clusters, achieving an impressive onset potential of 0.93 V vs. RHE for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and maintaining an overpotential of just 295 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The MoN@NC&#8208;based zinc&#8211;air battery demonstrated a high&#8208;power density of 151 mW/cm2, a robust specific discharge capacity of 759 mAh/gZn at 20 mA/cm2, and superior charge&#8211;discharge cycling stability exceeding 190 cycles. The detailed experimental characterization revealed that the uniformly dispersed MoN clusters served as the primary active sites driving the observed catalytic performance. Additionally, the present findings suggested significant correlations between the phase of the material, crystallization, atomic cluster distribution, support porosity, and nitridation temperature. These insights are expected to refine strategies for achieving atomically dispersed nitrides with optimized ORR performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Asymmetrical Ligand Substitution on the Formation, Stability, and Reactivity of Ruthenium(III)&#8208;Hypochlorite Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypohalites are commonly generated in biological systems, mostly with functions related to defense and immune system response. These hypohalites can bind to metal centers and are known for their strong oxidizing properties that play crucial roles in various biological processes. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of novel biomimetic Ru(III)&#8208;hypochlorite complexes and focus the work on the electronic effects associated with the incorporation of methyl groups in a pentadentate ligand framework in an asymmetric fashion. The intermediates are stable at room temperature and were characterized by mass spectrometry, UV&#8208;vis absorption, resonance Raman and EPR spectroscopy. We show for the first time that the resultant ruthenium&#8208;hypochlorite adducts function as an electrophilic oxidant and efficiently catalyze hydrogen atom abstraction reactions from phenol and oxygen atom transfer reactions with dimethylsulfide.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vitro Selection of Collagen&#8208;Binding Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Containing Genetically Encoded Mussel&#8208;Inspired Adhesive Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein immobilization technology is important in medical and industrial applications. We previously reported all&#8208;in&#8208;one in vitro selection, wherein a collagen&#8208;binding vascular endothelial growth factor (CB&#8208;VEGF) was identified from a fusion library of random and VEGF sequences. However, its interaction chemistry is mainly limited to the interaction established by the 20 canonical amino acids. Herein, we incorporated an adhesive non&#8208;natural amino acid found in marine mussels, L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), into the library for all&#8208;in&#8208;one in vitro selection. After selection, we identified DOPA&#8208;containing CB&#8208;VEGF. CB&#8208;VEGF binds to collagen with an apparent dissociation constant of 2 nM; na&#239;ve VEGF does not bind to collagen. The collagen&#8208;binding peptide domain of CB&#8208;VEGF (CB&#8208;peptide) exhibited stronger binding to collagen than a mutant peptide (substitution from DOPA to tyrosine), indicating the importance of DOPA to collagen binding. The collagen&#8208;binding affinity of CB&#8208;VEGF is 10&#8208;fold higher than that of CB&#8208;peptide, suggesting that the collagen&#8208;binding ability of CB&#8208;VEGF is not due to the additive function of CB&#8208;peptide to VEGF, but is synergistic. Furthermore, increased cell growth was observed on CB&#8208;VEGF&#8208;treated collagen surfaces, not VEGF&#8208;treated collagen surfaces. Thus, integrating all&#8208;in&#8208;one in vitro selection and DOPA incorporation shows promise in generating adhesive proteins on solid supports.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated&#8208;Quinoxaline Based Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptors Enables Efficient As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;fused electron acceptors have obtained increasing curiosity in organic solar cells (OSCs) thanks to simple synthetic route and versatile chemical modification capabilities. However, non&#8208;fused acceptors with varying quinoxaline core and as&#8208;cast device have rarely been explored, and the molecular structure&#8208;photovoltaic performance relationship of such acceptors remains unclear. Herein, two non&#8208;fused acceptors L19 and L21 with thienyl substituted non&#8208;fluorinated/fluorinated quinoxaline core were developed via five&#8208;step synthesis. Compared with L19, L21 with F&#8208;containing quinoxaline exhibited higher molar extinction coefficient, boosted charge mobility, improved exciton dissociation, more ordered molecular stacking and optimized film morphology. Thereafter, a notable power conversion e&#64259;ciency (PCE) of 11.45% could be obtained for the as&#8208;cast PBDB&#8208;T:L21 &#8208;based device, which is significantly better than the device based on PBDB&#8208;T:L19 (8.68%). Furthermore, PM6:Y6:L21&#8208;based ternary devices were fabricated and exhibited the highest PCE of 17.81%. This work discloses that the introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated quinoxaline core and appropriate side&#8208;chain engineering can play an important role in improving the performance of as&#8208;cast solar cell devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Azine Dearomatization in Natural Product Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since antiquity, alkaloid natural products have served as medicinal ingredients that still contribute as an inspiration for the development of novel therapeutics. For the synthetic chemist, much of the importance of natural products lies in their acting as a forcing&#8208;function for the invention of new synthetic strategies and tactics for molecular assembly. With this rich history in mind, it remains an important goal for chemists to build nitrogenous structures with greater efficiency, abiding by economies of synthesis. Nitrogenous aromatic feedstocks have been an intriguing starting point for the functionalization and construction of alkaloids for several decades, but recent advances in reaction design have opened new doors for leveraging their abundance in concise synthesis. Herein, advances in this area of synthetic ingenuity will be summarized with the aim of instructing chemists towards considering dearomatization as a strategic avenue for both target&#8208;oriented and diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic campaigns. Overall, syntheses are evaluated, compared, and contrasted to give a systematic overview of this continued area of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly Linked Azulene Dimer: A Novel Non&#8208;benzenoid Isomer of Perylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the synthesis of an unprecedented isomer of perylene, dicyclohepta[cd,fg]&#8208;as&#8208;indacene bearing two phenyl groups (1&#8208;Ph) by the nickel&#8208;mediated intramolecular homocoupling of a 4,4'&#8208;biazulene derivative (2). The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that 1&#8208;Ph adopts a unique helically twisted geometry although the local aromaticity of azulene moieties was preserved. The double covalent linkage of the two azulene skeletons imparts significant orbital interaction, which affords near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption (up to 1720 nm) and remarkable redox behaviors despite its closed&#8208;shell electronic structure. The optical band gap of 1&#8208;Ph is calculated to be 0.72 eV from its absorption onset, which is one of the narrowest values among the hitherto reported air&#8208;stable non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs. Furthermore, the thin&#8208;film of 1&#8208;Ph serves as a p&#8208;type semiconductor.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report herein the synthesis of an unprecedented isomer of perylene, dicyclohepta[cd,fg]-as-indacene bearing two phenyl groups (1-Ph) by the nickel-mediated intramolecular homocoupling of a 4,4'-biazulene derivative (2). The X-ray crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that 1-Ph adopts a unique helically twisted geometry although the local aromaticity of azulene moieties was preserved. The double covalent linkage of the two azulene skeletons imparts significant orbital interaction, which affords near-infrared (NIR) absorption (up to 1720 nm) and remarkable redox behaviors despite its closed-shell electronic structure. The optical band gap of 1-Ph is calculated to be 0.72 eV from its absorption onset, which is one of the narrowest values among the hitherto reported air-stable non-benzenoid PAHs. Furthermore, the thin-film of 1-Ph serves as a p-type semiconductor. Our study offers fundamental insights into not only the aromaticity with the nonalternant topologies of 1-Ph but also its potential application in novel organic electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;dimensional Branched PdAg Nanoalloy Rich in Defects for Boosting Glycerol and Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The development of Pd&#8208;based bimetallic nanoalloys (NAs) with abundant active sites for achieving highly efficient electrocatalysis in alcohol oxidation deserves continuous attention. Herein, we utilized a facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase method involving adjusting reaction time to generate active sites, successfully&#160;synthesizing&#160;one&#8208;dimensional (1D) PdAg NAs rich in defects. The optimized 1D PdAg NA exhibits remarkable electrochemical activity, stability, and antipoisonous properties in glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), far exceeding pure Pd and commercial Pd/C catalysts. Notably, compared to glycerol oxidation (1496 mA mg&#8208;1Pd and 4.13 mA cm&#8722;2), the optimized PdAg NA demonstrated higher mass activity (2990 mA mg&#8208;1Pd) and specific activity (7.86 mA cm&#8722;2) in ethanol oxidation. In summary, this work may provide a strategy for designing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts enriched with defects, thereby promoting the development of high&#8208;performance alcohol oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Characteristics of a Partially Planarized Triarylmethyl Cation with Unsymmetrical Push&#8211;Pull Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved for the first time the synthesis and isolation of the push&#8211;pull&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;cation salts with sufficient stability. The unique feature is not limited to the structure. We found that the &#960;&#8208;cation salt with planar anion exhibits panchromatic absorption in the solid state accompanying a near&#8208;infrared absorption with a &#955;onset value of 1030&#8197;nm.







Abstract
We report the physical properties of a new class of triarylmethyl&#8208;based carbocations containing both an electron&#8208;donating diphenyl ether moiety and an electron&#8208;accepting carbonyl group with a helical plane framework. Their unique packing patterns were clarified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which depend on the counter anions to influence their photophysical properties in the solid states. Notably, the interactions between &#960;&#8208;cation species and planar anion species lead to a unique panchromatic property, accompanying a near&#8208;infrared absorption with a &#955;onset value of 1030&#8197;nm, which can be assigned to intermolecular charge transfer transition. We found that the &#960;&#8208;cation species with planar anion formed cation dimers, being stacked in opposite directions. The two cation molecules are flanked by two anions on both the top and bottom side. Pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) calculations imply that the origins of the unique packing patterns of the &#960;&#8208;cations originate from the electrostatic forces of four neighbouring &#960;&#8208;anion species.

         <title>Intermolecular 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Nitriles via Redox Gold Catalysis: Synthesis of Benzoxazoles and Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unprecedent gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of nitriles with aryl iodides via Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis has been developed, providing an expedient route to the synthesis of benzoxazoles and benzimidazoles with broad substrate scope and high functional compatibility. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the Au(III)&#8208;Ar species generated via oxidative addition of o&#8208;iodophenol to MeDalphosAu+, serves as a key intermediate. Particularly and this annulation is initiated by oxidative addition, rather than the nucleophilic attack of the phenol moiety in o&#8208;iodophenol towards the nitrile. The method was also applied to the synthesis of poly aza&#8208;heterocycles via a cascade Au(I)/Au(III) and Au(I) catalysis relay.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we have reduced CO2 with HBpin to afford borylated methanol product selectively in ~99% yield using Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as a catalyst. This led to multigram scale isolation of methanol obtained from CO2 reduction via the hydrolysis of borylated methanol, this establishes the potential of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as an efficient homogeneous catalyst for the bulk scale methanol synthesis. A practical application of this catalytic system was also shown by reducing CO2&#8208;containing motorbike exhaust efficiently and selectively. Further, C&#8210;O bond activation of esters and epoxides using HBpin and 1&#8208;2 mol% of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 at 60 &#176;C afforded the borylated alcohols in good to excellent yields, which can easily be hydrolysed to the eco&#8208;friendly corresponding alcohol. The stoichiometric experiments were performed to prove the formation of in&#8208;situ generated cerium hydride [Ce]&#8208;H as an active catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>AIE&#8208;active Circularly Polarized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Stable Solution&#8208;Processed Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) have significant promise for naked&#8208;eye 3D displays. However, most devices are fabricated using vacuum deposition technology, and development of efficient solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs, particularly those exhibiting low efficiency roll&#8208;off, remains a formidable challenge. This research successfully designed and synthesized two pairs of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) enantiomers through isomer engineering, namely (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;5&#8208;TPA and (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;4&#8208;TPA, which features fifth and fourth substitution sites of phthalimide (acceptor) by tri&#8208;phenylamine (donor), respectively. Both molecules displayed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Notably, the CP&#8208;OLED devices, fabricated by solution&#8208;process, exhibited vivid blue&#8208;green and green emission with the maximum current efficiency of 7.4 and 29.6 cd A&#8208;1, the external quantum efficiency of 2.7% and 10.2%, and the low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 3.7% and 16.7%. Moreover, these devices demonstrated CP&#8208;EL signals with gEL values of +6.61 &#215; 10&#8208;4 /&#8208;6.84 &#215; 10&#8208;4 and +1.13 &#215; 10&#8208;3/&#8208;1.25 &#215; 10&#8208;3, respectively.</dc:description>

This research successfully designed and synthesized two pairs of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) enantiomers through isomer engineering, namely (R/S)-N-5-TPA and (R/S)-N-4-TPA, which features fifth and fourth substitution sites of phthalimide (acceptor) by tri-phenylamine (donor), respectively. Both molecules displayed aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties. Notably, the CP-OLED devices, fabricated by solution-process, exhibited vivid blue-green and green emission with the maximum current efficiency of 7.4 and 29.6 cd A-1, the external quantum efficiency of 2.7% and 10.2%, and the low efficiency roll-off of 3.7% and 16.7%. Moreover, these devices demonstrated CP-EL signals with gEL values of +6.61 &#215; 10-4 /-6.84 &#215; 10-4 and +1.13 &#215; 10-3/-1.25 &#215; 10-3, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Scaffolded Detergents for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detergents are essential for preserving the structural integrity and functionality of membrane proteins (MPs) outside the biological membrane or in aqueous solution, and thus ensuring accurate biochemical and structural analyses. Here, we introduce peptide&#8208;scaffolded detergents, a novel class of hybrid molecules formed by preassembling detergent monomers with peptides of varying lengths, mediated via Click chemistry. These detergents are characterized by scalable, straightforward synthesis and enhanced solubility. Among the variants, A4B2 emerged as the optimal detergent, demonstrating superior thermal stabilization across a range of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, including A2AAR, SMO and GLP&#8208;1R. Additionally, A4B2 exhibits a low critical micelle concentration and small micelle size, together making it particularly effective for electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. This innovative design leverages the benefits of peptide&#8208;based and traditional detergents, offering new insights for the development of advanced detergents in MP research.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Chlorite as an Efficient Oxidant for Controlled Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the demand for organosulfur materials and the challenges associated with currently used oxidation processes, in this study, we evaluated the counter&#8208;cation of sodium chlorite (Na+ClO2&#8211;) with tetrabutylammonium chloride (Bu4N+Cl&#8211;) to synthesise tetrabutylammonium chlorite (Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;). Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;exhibited good solubility in organic solvents like chloroform (1.6 g mL&#8211;1) and ethyl acetate (0.86 g mL&#8211;1). The oxygenation reaction of organosulfides with Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;was examined in an HCl&#8208;acidic ethyl acetate solution under ambient conditions, selectively forming the corresponding sulfoxides as mono&#8208;oxygenated products. The reaction was initiated by the formation of chlorine dioxide (ClO2&#8226;) as an oxidant and an active species generated from Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;with HCl. This oxygenation method also enables the surface oxidation of sulfide polymers like polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) resins to increase their surface hydrophilicity. Therefore, the use of Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;for applications in organic solvents is an environment&#8208;friendly, efficient, and highly selective approach for selective oxidation.</dc:description>
