         <title>Rapid Access to Encapsulated Molecular Rotors via Coordination&#8208;Driven Macrocycle Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We've got you surrounded! Conjugated units that are encapsulated within the cavities of macrocycles can have unique properties often including the ability to rotate or wobble within an otherwise stationary crystal lattice. We introduce a strategy for forming macrocycles of this type in only a few synthetic steps using pyridine coordination to transition metals as the final, ring&#8208;closing step. More information can be found in the Research Article by N.&#8197;P.&#8197;Bowling and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301745).

         <title>Harnessing Pillar[5]arene Host&#8211;Guest Complexation To Improve pH Stability and Affect Enzymatic Degradation of the Anticancer Prodrug Capecitabine: A 19F&#160;NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving the ADMET: The stability of capecitabine, a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug sold under the brand name Xeloda, in an acidic environment can be improved significantly by complexation with water&#8208;soluble pillararene derivatives. These host systems also modulate the enzymatic degradation of this clinically used anticancer prodrug.







Abstract
Cancer is a global health problem, and supramolecular chemotherapy is emerging as a novel strategy to battle the disease. Here, we first evaluated the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the complexes formed between several water&#8208;soluble per&#8208;substituted pillar[5]arene derivatives and capecitabine (1), a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug. The exchange rate was studied, for the first time in pillararene chemistry, by the 19F guest exchange saturation transfer (GEST) NMR technique. Importantly, when we evaluated the effect of complexation on the characteristics of 1, we found that the complexation of 1 with such pillar[5]arene hosts increased capecitabine stability at acidic pH very significantly and slowed its enzymatic degradation by the carboxylesterase enzyme in a manner that depended on the host. These interesting findings could have implications on the clinical use of this heavily used prodrug and might affect the management of cancer patients.

         <title>Reactivity of [AuF3(SIMes)]: Pathway to Unprecedented Structural Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Offering a hand in gold fluorine chemistry: The trans&#8208;F in [AuF3(SIMes)] can be substituted by several ligands with varying electronic properties, yielding complexes of the type trans&#8208;[AuF2X(SIMes)]. They are introduced either by using trimethylsilyl compounds or, by using electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl&#8208;bearing molecules, the latter route being new in gold chemistry.







Abstract
We report on a comprehensive reactivity study starting from [AuF3(SIMes)] to synthesize different motifs of monomeric gold(III) fluorides. A plethora of different ligands has been introduced in a mono&#8208;substitution yielding trans&#8208;[AuF2X(SIMes)] including alkynido, cyanido, azido, and a set of perfluoroalkoxido complexes. The latter were better accomplished via use of perfluorinated carbonyl&#8208;bearing molecules, which is unprecedented in gold chemistry. In case of the cyanide and azide, triple substitution gave rise to the corresponding [AuX3(SIMes)] complexes. Comparison of the chemical shift of the carbene carbon atom in the 13C{1H}&#8197;NMR spectrum, the calculated SIMes affinity and the Au&#8722;C bond length in the solid state with related literature&#8208;known complexes yields a classification of trans&#8208;influences for a variety of ligands attached to the gold center. Therein, the mixed fluorido perfluoroalkoxido complexes have a similar SIMes affinity to AuF3 with a very low Gibbs energy of formation when using the perfluoro carbonyl route.

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Subsequent Molecular Conversion to Control Photoluminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise approach combining the functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and subsequent reactions to introduce functional groups into the addenda on the SWCNTs achieved control over the photoluminescence properties and the addition of functionality in the addenda.







Abstract
Functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) has attracted interest because it alters the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) wavelength and emission efficiency. These modifications depend on the binding configuration and degree of functionalization. Excessive functionalization reduces the emission efficiency as the integrity of the conjugated &#960; system decreases; thus, controlling the degree of functionalization is essential. Because the binding configurations and degree of functionalization are affected by the reagent structure, a stepwise approach combining SWCNTs functionalization and subsequent reactions to introduce functional groups into the addenda could effectively control their PL properties and functionalities. We studied this approach by implementing the reductive alkylation of SWCNTs by using bromoalkanes with t&#8208;butyl carbamate (Boc)&#8208;protected amino groups and subsequent deprotection and amidation reactions. The reaction products were analyzed based on absorption, PL, and Raman spectroscopy and the Kaiser test. Depending on the structure of the reagent, deprotection and amidation reactions competed with the elimination reaction of addenda, altering the PL properties of the SWCNTs. Furthermore, the elimination reaction was inhibited in the adducts functionalized using dibromoalkane with Boc&#8208;protected amino groups, demonstrating that the use of appropriate reagents enables the molecular conversion of the functional groups of SWCNT adducts without affecting their PL properties.

         <title>Vectorization via Siderophores Increases Antibacterial Activity of K(RW)3 Peptides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of Trojan Horse antibiotics is introduced, consisting of a six amino acid long synthetic antimicrobial peptide (synAMPs) and a number of different siderophore&#8208;type vectors. Excellent activity and internalization by a (yet) unidentified receptor are key features of the new conjugates.







Abstract
A series of new conjugates comprised from a small synthetic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and a siderophore&#8208;type vector component was designed and tested for activity on P. aeruginosa PAO1 and several genetically modified strains. As AMP, the well&#8208;established arginine&#8208;tryptophane combination K(RW)3 (P1) was chosen with an added lysine for siderophore attachment. This peptide is easy to prepare, modify, and possesses good anti&#8208;bacterial activity. On the vector part, we examined several moieties: (i) the natural siderophore deferoxamine (DFO); (ii) bidentate iron chelators based on the hydroxamate building block (4&#8201;a&#8211;c) ; (iii) the non&#8208;siderophore chelators deferasirox (DFX) and deferiprone&#8208;carboxylate (DFP&#8208;COOH). All conjugates were prepared by solid phase synthesis techniques and fully characterized by HPLC and mass spectrometry (including HR&#8208;MS). 55Fe uptake assays indicate a receptor&#8208;mediated uptake for 4&#8201;a&#8211;c, DFP&#8208;COOH and DFO, which is dependent on the outer membrane transporter FoxA in the case of DFO. All conjugates showed increased antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa compared to the parent peptide P1 alone when investigated in iron&#8208;depleted medium. MIC values were as low as 2&#8197;&#956;M (for P1&#8208;DFP) on wild type P. aeruginosa. The activity of P1&#8208;DFO and P1&#8208;DFP was even better on genetically mutated strains unable to produce siderophores (down to 0.5&#8197;&#956;M). Although the DFX vector on its own was not able to transport iron inside the bacterial cell as shown by 55Fe uptake studies, the P1&#8208;DFX conjugate had excellent antibacterial activity compared to P1 (2&#8197;&#956;M, and as low as 0.25&#8197;&#956;M on a receptor&#8208;deficient strain unable to produce siderophores), suggesting that the conjugates were indeed recognized and internalized by an (unknown) transporter. Control experiments with an equimolar mixture of P1 and DFX confirm that the observed activity is intrinsic to vectorization. This work thus demonstrates the power of linking small AMPs covalently to siderophores for a new class of Trojan Horse antibiotics, with P1&#8208;DFP and P1&#8208;DFX being the most potent conjugates.

Excellent activity and internalization by a (yet) unidentified receptor are key features of the new conjugates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of new conjugates comprised from a small synthetic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and a siderophore-type vector component was designed and tested for activity on &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; PAO1 and several genetically modified strains. As AMP, the well-established arginine-tryptophane combination K(RW)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt;) was chosen with an added lysine for siderophore attachment. This peptide is easy to prepare, modify, and possesses good anti-bacterial activity. On the vector part, we examined several moieties: (i) the natural siderophore deferoxamine (&lt;b&gt;DFO&lt;/b&gt;); (ii) bidentate iron chelators based on the hydroxamate building block (&lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;) ; (iii) the non-siderophore chelators deferasirox (&lt;b&gt;DFX&lt;/b&gt;) and deferiprone-carboxylate (&lt;b&gt;DFP-COOH&lt;/b&gt;). All conjugates were prepared by solid phase synthesis techniques and fully characterized by HPLC and mass spectrometry (including HR-MS). &lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Fe uptake assays indicate a receptor-mediated uptake for &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;DFP-COOH&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DFO&lt;/b&gt;, which is dependent on the outer membrane transporter FoxA in the case of &lt;b&gt;DFO&lt;/b&gt;. All conjugates showed increased antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; compared to the parent peptide &lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt; alone when investigated in iron-depleted medium. MIC values were as low as 2&#8197;&#956;M (for &lt;b&gt;P1-DFP&lt;/b&gt;) on wild type &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;. The activity of &lt;b&gt;P1-DFO&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;P1-DFP&lt;/b&gt; was even better on genetically mutated strains unable to produce siderophores (down to 0.5&#8197;&#956;M). Although the &lt;b&gt;DFX&lt;/b&gt; vector on its own was not able to transport iron inside the bacterial cell as shown by &lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Fe uptake studies, the &lt;b&gt;P1-DFX&lt;/b&gt; conjugate had excellent antibacterial activity compared to &lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt; (2&#8197;&#956;M, and as low as 0.25&#8197;&#956;M on a receptor-deficient strain unable to produce siderophores), suggesting that the conjugates were indeed recognized and internalized by an (unknown) transporter. Control experiments with an equimolar mixture of &lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DFX&lt;/b&gt; confirm that the observed activity is intrinsic to vectorization. This work thus demonstrates the power of linking small AMPs covalently to siderophores for a new class of Trojan Horse antibiotics, with &lt;b&gt;P1-DFP&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;P1-DFX&lt;/b&gt; being the most potent conjugates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The cover picture illustrates a molecule as a racing car driving on a circuit. The frame of the racing car shows the central skeleton of the molecule of different shape, which can be converted as it passes through a gate (electrode), accompanied by a drastic change in color. This cover implies that the redox reaction occurs in a stepwise manner, and they show tricolor chromic response. Moreover, the circuit represents its high reversibility. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;Ishigaki and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301476).

Luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers composed of Ag10 or Ag12 cluster cores and multidentate pyridine linkers were synthesized as well as luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers. It was found that these coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effect to nitrobenzene, attributed to the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and nitrobenzene as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of nitrobenzene.

         <title>The Power of Automation in Polymer Chemistry: Precision Synthesis of Multiblock Copolymers with Block Sequence Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;to&#8208;air, room&#8208;temperature RAFT polymerization procedure is employed in an automated platform to produce unprecedented complex macromolecular structures unobtainable manually. The precise structures made using this machine pave the way for the next generation of material design, harnessing large databases accessible using such automated material manufacturing.







Abstract
Machines can revolutionize the field of chemistry and material science, driving the development of new chemistries, increasing productivity, and facilitating reaction scale up. The incorporation of automated systems in the field of polymer chemistry has however proven challenging owing to the demanding reaction conditions, rendering the automation setup complex and costly. There is an imminent need for an automation platform which uses fast and simple polymerization protocols, while providing a high level of control on the structure of macromolecules via precision synthesis. This work combines an oxygen tolerant, room temperature polymerization method with a simple liquid handling robot to automatically prepare precise and high order multiblock copolymers with unprecedented livingness even after many chain extensions. The highest number of blocks synthesized in such a system is reported, demonstrating the capabilities of this automated platform for the rapid synthesis and complex polymer structure formation.

         <title>Organotin(IV)&#8208;Decorated Graphene Quantum Dots as Dual Platform for Molecular Imaging and Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pharmacological activity of organotin(IV) complexes in cancer therapy is well recognized but their large applicability is hampered by their poor water solubility. Hence, carbon dots, in particular nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs), may be a promising alternative for the efficient delivery of organotin(IV) compounds as they have a substantial aqueous solubility, a good chemical stability, and non&#8208;toxicity as well as a bright photoluminescence that make them ideal for theranostic applications against cancer. Two different multifunctional nanosystems have been synthesized and fully characterized based on two fragments of organotin&#8208;based cytotoxic compounds and 4&#8208;formylbenzoic acid (FBA), covalently grafted onto the NGQDs surface. Subsequently, an in vitro determination of the therapeutic and theranostic potential of the achieved multifunctional systems was carried out. The results showed a high cytotoxic potential of the NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn materials against breast cancer cell line (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and a lower effect on a non&#8208;cancer cell line (kidney cells, HEK293T). Besides, thanks to their optical properties, the dots enabled their fluorescence molecular imaging in the cytoplasmatic region of the cells pointing towards a successful cellular uptake and a release of the metallodrug inside cancer cells (NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A chloroplatinum complex was arylated to obtain stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals. The resulting arylplatinum complex showed polymorph&#8208;dependent emission, mechano&#8208; and thermochromic luminescence as well as comproportionation and &#960;&#8208;bridged dimerization. Simple mixing of structurally similar arylplatinum complexes at room temperature resulted in transfer of their aryl groups (comproportionation), which allowed tuning their mechanochromic profiles. We also found that recrystallization of the complex afforded a dimerized product in which two platinum ions are bridged via aryl groups resulting in a very short Pt&#8211;Pt distance (3.0466(10) &#197;).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemistry of oxo&#8208;carboxylic acids contributes significantly to the complex chemistry occurring in the atmosphere. In this regard, pyruvic acid undergoes photoreactions that lead to many diverse products. The presence of sodium cation near pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution, or its conjugate base in non&#8208;acidic conditions,&#160;influences the hydration equilibrium and the photosensitivity to UV&#8208;visible light of the oxocarboxylic acid. We performed an ab initio metadynamics simulation which serves two purposes: first, it unveils the mechanisms of the reversible hydration reaction between the keto and the diol forms, with a free&#8208;energy difference of only 2 kJ/mol at 300 K, which shows the influence of sodium on the keto/diol ratio; second, it provides solvent&#8208;shared ion pairing (SSIP) and contact ion pairing (CIP) structures, including Na+&#160;coordinated to carbonyl, for the calculations of the electronic transition energies to an antibonding &#960;* orbital, which sheds light on the photoactivity of these two forms in the actinic region.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Solution Phase Synthesis and Functionalization of 2D WSe2 for Ambient Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2H phase tungsten diselenide (WSe2) is a p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor from the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family with unique opto&#8208;electrical properties. Solution phase production of atomically thin WSe2&#160;is challenging due to its instability under ambient conditions. We present a highly efficient and scalable solution method for simultaneously exfoliating and functionalizing&#160;WSe2&#160;by leveraging the noncovalent interaction between mercapto&#8208;group and bulk WSe2.&#160;Single and few&#8208;layer 2H phase pure WSe2&#160;sheets of lateral size up to 5&#160;&#181;m with minimal basal plane defects, as revealed by XPS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, are produced in water&#8208;ethanol mixture. Remarkably, WSe2&#160;dispersion remains stable even at high concentrations (10 mg/ml) and exhibited high colloidal stability with shelf&#8208;life exceeding a year. The findings from our study suggest that through precise manipulation of intercalation chemistry, mass production of solution processable phase&#8208;sensitive 2D materials such as WSe2&#160;can be achieved. This advancement holds great potential for facilitating their practical utilization in various real&#8208;world applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Mediated Cyclizations of Triene&#8208;Yne Systems: An Easy Access to Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel triene&#8208;yne systems with a benzofulvene moiety were prepared and applied in the field of gold catalysis. Cyclopenta&#8208;fused anthracenes were obtained under mild conditions and easy steps synthesis.







Abstract
The direct synthesis of cyclopenta&#8208;fused anthracenes (CP&#8208;anthracenes) through a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of easily available triene&#8208;yne systems bearing a benzofulvene substructure, is reported. The targets are of great interest due to the potential use as organic materials and the preparation of these compounds is gaining huge importance. The applied starting materials are readily available through a three&#8208;step synthesis, which further contributes to the advantages of this route. In addition, UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescent spectra of the obtained CP&#8208;anthracenes were recorded.

         <title>Surface Chemistry and Specific Surface Area Rule the Efficiency of Gold Nanoparticle Sensitizers in Proton Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiosensitizer efficiency of gold nanoparticles from laser synthesis in liquids for proton therapy was tuned and factors maximizing the production of reactive oxygen species were identified. Here, I) high particle surface areas, II) the absence of surface ligands (citrate), III) alteration of surface chemistry for example higher defect densities were identified as main contributing factors.







Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are currently the most studied radiosensitizers in proton therapy (PT) applicable for the treatment of solid tumors, where they amplify production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is underexplored how this amplification is correlated with the AuNPs&#8217; surface chemistry. To clarify this issue, we fabricated ligand&#8208;free AuNPs of different mean diameters by laser ablation in liquids (LAL) and laser fragmentation in liquids (LFL) and irradiated them with clinically relevant proton fields by using water phantoms. ROS generation was monitored by the fluorescent dye 7&#8208;OH&#8208;coumarin. Our findings reveal an enhancement of ROS production driven by I) increased total particle surface area, II) utilization of ligand&#8208;free AuNPs avoiding sodium citrate as a radical quencher ligands, and III) a higher density of structural defects generated by LFL synthesis, indicated by surface charge density. Based on these findings it may be concluded that the surface chemistry is a major and underexplored contributor to ROS generation and sensitizing effects of AuNPs in PT. We further highlight the applicability of AuNPs in&#8197;vitro in human medulloblastoma cells.

         <title>Dearomatization of C6 Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Main Group Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dearomatization reaction is a powerful method for transformation of simple aromatic compounds to unique chemical architectures rapidly in synthetic chemistry. Over the past decades, the chemistry in this field has evolved significantly and various important organic compounds such as crucial bioactive molecules have been synthesized through dearomatization. In general, photochemical conditions or assistance by transition metals are required for dearomatization of rigid arenes. Recently, main&#8208;group elements, especially naturally abundant elements in the Earth&#8217;s crust, have attracted attention as they have low toxicity and are cost&#8208;effective compared to the late transition metals. In recent decades, a variety of low&#8208;valent main&#8208;group molecules, which enable the activation of stable aromatic compounds under mild conditions, have been developed. This minireview highlights the developments in the chemistry of dearomatization of C6 aromatic hydrocarbons by main&#8208;group compounds leading to the formation of seven&#8208;membered EC6 (E = main&#8208;group elements) ring or cycloaddition products.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterisation, and Functionalisation of Charged Two&#8208;Dimensional MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The applications of exfoliated MoS2 are limited by its inert surface and poor interface. We have activated the surface of exfoliated 2H&#8208;MoS2 by reacting it with NaBH4, forming an n&#8208;doped material as demonstrated by a negative zeta&#8208;potential value &#950; = &#8208;25 mV and a 20 nm (0.05 eV) red&#8208;shift in its photoluminescence spectrum. The novel material&#8217;s spectral properties were consistent with pristine 2H&#8208;MoS2 (as determined by HR&#8208;TEM, XPS, pXRD, DRIFT, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy). Importantly, it was readily dispersed in H2O unlike 2H&#8208;MoS2. Its dispersibility properties were explored for a variety of solvents and could be directly correlated with the relative permittivity of the respective solvents. The charged 2H&#8208;MoS2 reacted readily with an organo&#8208;iodide to deliver functionalized 2H&#8208;MoS2. Our approach delivers aqueous dispersions of semiconducting 2H&#8208;MoS2, without additives or chemical functionalities, and allows for controlled and facile functionalization of 2H&#8208;MoS2 opening multiple new avenues of semi&#8208;conducting MoS2 application.</dc:description>

Currently developed and reported sorbents in 99TcO4&#8211; sequestration from the nuclear waste are unstable and show low adsorption efficiency in harsh conditions. To address this issue, we developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy by grafting imidazole&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) onto the backbone of covalent organic framework (COF) via vinyl polymerization. The resultant COF&#8208;polyILs sorbent exhibits fast adsorption kinetics (&lt; 5 min) and good sorption capacity (388 mg g&#8211;1) for ReO4&#8722; (a nonradioactive surrogate of 99TcO4&#8722;). Outstandingly, COF&#8208;polyILs composite shows superior ReO4&#8722; removal even under highly acidic conditions and in the presence of excess competing ions of Hanford low&#8208;level radioactive waste stream, benefiting from the stable covalent bonds between the COF and polyILs, mass of imidazole rings, and hydrophobic pores in COF.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Stepwise Functionalization of the Pyridazine Scaffold by using Thio&#8208;substituted Pyridazine Building Blocks</title>

         <dc:description>We described a regioselective tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;functionalization of the pyridazine scaffold using two readily available building blocks: 3&#8208;alkylthio&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine and 3,4&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine by performing selective metalations with TMPMgCl&#183;LiCl and catalyst&#8208;tuned cross&#8208;coupling reactions with arylzinc halides. Several of the resulting pyridazines were converted into more elaborated N&#8208;heterocycles such as thieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyridazines and 1H&#8208;pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyridazines.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron Polycation Supported by Cyclic Bis(carbodiphosphorane)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel cyclic bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand was prepared and investigated in coordination with group 13 elements, B, Al and Ga. Al and Ga afforded dinuclear adduct where two metal centers were bridged by the bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand. In contrast, the reaction with boron trichloride afforded a monomeric dicationic three&#8208;coordinate boron species composed of one boron moieties and one ligand. The structures of these products were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In the dicationic boron compound, the sterically constrained cyclic structure enforced the boron center to acquire strained trigonal geometry with wide C&#8208;B&#8208;C angle of 140&#176;.&#160; Furthermore, theoretical investigation with DFT and NBO suggested a significant contribution of tricationic two&#8208;coordinate boron resonance structure supported by two CDP ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in RNA Labeling with Trifluoromethyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine labeling of ribonucleic acids&#160;in conjunction with 19F&#8208;NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful strategy for spectroscopic analysis of RNA structure and dynamics, and RNA&#8211; ligand interactions. Here, we present the first syntheses of 2'&#8208;OCF3 guanosine and uridine phosphoramidites, their incorporation into oligoribonucleotides by solid&#8208;phase synthesis and a comprehensive study of their properties. NMR spectroscopic analysis showed that the 2'&#8208;OCF3 modification is associated with preferential C2'&#8208;endo conformation of the U and G ribose in single&#8208;stranded RNA. When paired to the complementary strand, slight destabilization of the duplex caused by the modification was revealed by UV melting curve analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate the power of the 2'&#8208;OCF3 label for NMR spectroscopy by dissecting RNA pseudoknot folding and its binding to a small molecule.&#160;Furthermore, the 2'&#8208;OCF3 modification has potential for applications in therapeutic oligonucleotides. To this end, we tested 2'&#8208;OCF3 modified siRNAs in silencing of the BASP1 gene which indicated enhanced performance. Importantly, together with our earlier work, the present study completes the set of 2'&#8208;OCF3 nucleoside phosphoramidites to all four standard nucleobases and hence enables applications that utilize the favorable properties of the 2'&#8208;OCF3 group without any restrictions in placing the modification into the RNA target sequence.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and similar nanohoops is usually based on the combination of building blocks to a macrocyclic precursor, which is then aromatized in the final step. Access to those building blocks in large amounts will simplify the synthesis and studies of CPPs as novel functional materials in applications. Herein, we report a continuous flow synthesis of key CPP building blocks using versatile synthesis techniques such as electrochemical oxidation, lithiations and Suzuki cross couplings in self&#8208;built reactors on up&#8208;to kilogram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metallabicycle From Thiocarbonyl&#8208;Cyclopropenium Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel architecture with no organic isolobal analogue, the bicyclic 3&#8208;mercaptopyrylium rhodium complexes, [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)X2(PPh3)2] (X=Cl, Br), arise from thiocarbonyl&#8208;cyclopropenium coupling.







Abstract
Addition of triphenylcyclopropenium bromide to the thiocarbonyl complex [RhCl(CS)(PPh3)2] affords novel bicyclic metalla&#8208;3&#8208;mercapto&#8208;thiapyrylliums [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(PPh3)2X2] (X=Cl, Br) &#8211; heterocycles with no metal&#8208;free isolobal precedent. Halide abstraction with silver triflate (AgOTf) in acetonitrile affords the salt [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(NCMe)2(PPh3)2{Ag(OH2)2}{Ag(OTf)3}]&#8208;OTf which in turn reacts with sodium chloride to return [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(PPh3)2Cl2].

         <title>The Oxidation of Oxygen and Sulfur&#8208;Containing Heterocycles by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiophene/Furan metabolization: A model cytochrome P450 enzyme was used to demonstrate that thiophene substrates were oxidized via sulfoxidation before activation towards Diels&#8211;Alder dimerization. Replacing the thiophene ring with a furan resulted in oxidative ring opening to a hydroxybutanoyl derivative, using a whole&#8208;cell system, and this reaction was demonstrated to proceed via a reactive &#947;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde species.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of monooxygenase enzymes play important roles in the metabolism of molecules which contain heterocyclic, aromatic functional groups. Here we study how oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic groups interact with and are oxidized using the bacterial enzyme CYP199A4. This enzyme oxidized both 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acid and 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzoic acid almost exclusively via sulfoxidation. The thiophene oxides produced were activated towards Diels&#8208;Alder dimerization after sulfoxidation, forming dimeric metabolites. Despite X&#8208;ray crystal structures demonstrating that the aromatic carbon atoms of the thiophene ring were located closer to the heme than the sulfur, sulfoxidation was still favoured with 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzoic acid. These results highlight a preference of this cytochrome P450 enzyme for sulfoxidation over aromatic hydroxylation. Calculations predict a strong preference for homodimerization of the enantiomers of the thiophene oxides and the formation of a single major product, in broad agreement with the experimental data. 4&#8208;(Furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acid was oxidized to 4&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxybutanoyl)benzoic acid using a whole&#8208;cell system. This reaction proceeded via a &#947;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde species which could be trapped in&#8197;vitro using semicarbazide to generate a pyridazine species. The combination of the enzyme structures, the biochemical data and theoretical calculations provides detailed insight into the formation of the metabolites formed from these heterocyclic compounds.

     alt="The Oxidation of Oxygen and Sulfur-Containing Heterocycles by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thiophene/Furan metabolization&lt;/b&gt;: A model cytochrome P450 enzyme was used to demonstrate that thiophene substrates were oxidized via sulfoxidation before activation towards Diels&#8211;Alder dimerization. Replacing the thiophene ring with a furan resulted in oxidative ring opening to a hydroxybutanoyl derivative, using a whole-cell system, and this reaction was demonstrated to proceed via a reactive &#947;-keto-&#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehyde species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of monooxygenase enzymes play important roles in the metabolism of molecules which contain heterocyclic, aromatic functional groups. Here we study how oxygen- and sulfur-containing heterocyclic groups interact with and are oxidized using the bacterial enzyme CYP199A4. This enzyme oxidized both 4-(thiophen-2-yl)benzoic acid and 4-(thiophen-3-yl)benzoic acid almost exclusively via sulfoxidation. The thiophene oxides produced were activated towards Diels-Alder dimerization after sulfoxidation, forming dimeric metabolites. Despite X-ray crystal structures demonstrating that the aromatic carbon atoms of the thiophene ring were located closer to the heme than the sulfur, sulfoxidation was still favoured with 4-(thiophen-3-yl)benzoic acid. These results highlight a preference of this cytochrome P450 enzyme for sulfoxidation over aromatic hydroxylation. Calculations predict a strong preference for homodimerization of the enantiomers of the thiophene oxides and the formation of a single major product, in broad agreement with the experimental data. 4-(Furan-2-yl)benzoic acid was oxidized to 4-(4&#8242;-hydroxybutanoyl)benzoic acid using a whole-cell system. This reaction proceeded via a &#947;-keto-&#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehyde species which could be trapped in&#8197;vitro using semicarbazide to generate a pyridazine species. The combination of the enzyme structures, the biochemical data and theoretical calculations provides detailed insight into the formation of the metabolites formed from these heterocyclic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Formation of CoP/Co3O4 Heterojunction for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoP/Co3O4@TM (TM=titanium mesh) heterojunction exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. OER requires an overpotential of 257&#8197;mV to reach 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and can work stably for more than 40&#8197;h, HER requires an overpotential of 98&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and overall water splitting only needs 1.590&#8197;V to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is an environmentally friendly and effective energy storage method. However, it is still a huge challenge to prepare non&#8208;noble metal based electrocatalysts that possess high activity and long&#8208;term durability to realize efficient water splitting. Here, we present a novel method of low&#8208;temperature phosphating for preparing CoP/Co3O4 heterojunction nanowires catalyst on titanium mesh (TM) substrate that can be used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction showed an excellent catalytic performance and long&#8208;term durability in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 257&#8197;mV at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 during the OER process, and it could work stably more than 40&#8197;h at 1.52&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). During the HER process, the overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 98&#8197;mV at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, when used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalyst, they achieved 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.59&#8197;V. The Faradaic efficiencies of OER and HER were 98.4&#8201;% and 99.4&#8201;%, respectively, outperforming Ru/Ir&#8208;based noble metal electrocatalysts and other non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

         <title>Shape Transformation via Etching and Regrowth: A Systematic Study of Pd Nanocrystals with Different Shapes and Twin Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study was conducted to investigate the etching and regrowth behaviors of Pd nanocrystals, including single&#8208;crystal cubes bounded by {100} facets, single&#8208;crystal octahedra and tetrahedra enclosed by {111} facets; and multiple&#8208;twinned icosahedra covered by {111} facets and twin boundaries.







Abstract
This article describes a systematic study of the oxidative etching and regrowth behaviors of Pd nanocrystals, including single&#8208;crystal cubes bounded by {100} facets, single&#8208;crystal octahedra and tetrahedra enclosed by {111} facets; and multiple&#8208;twinned icosahedra covered by {111} facets and twin boundaries. During etching, Pd atoms are preferentially oxidized and removed from the corners regardless of the type of nanocrystal, and the resultant Pd2+ ions are then reduced back to elemental Pd. For cubes and icosahedra, the newly formed Pd atoms are deposited on the {100} facets and twin boundaries, respectively, due to their relatively higher energies. For octahedra and tetrahedra, the Pd atoms self&#8208;nucleate in the solution phase, followed by their growth into small particles. We can control the regrowth rate relative to etching rate by varying the concentration of HCl in the reaction solution. As the concentration of HCl is increased, 18&#8208;nm Pd cubes are transformed into octahedra of 23, 18, and 13&#8197;nm, respectively, in edge length. Due to the absence of regrowth, however, Pd octahedra are transformed into truncated octahedra, cuboctahedra, and spheres with decreasing sizes whereas Pd tetrahedra evolve into truncated tetrahedra and spheres. In contrast, Pd icosahedra with twin boundaries on the surface are converted to asymmetric icosahedra, flower&#8208;like icosahedra, and spheres. This work not only advances the understanding of etching and growth behaviors of metal nanocrystals with various shapes and twin structures but also offers an alternative method for controlling their shape and size.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Metal Catalysts for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalytic sites and recent developments of dual&#8208;site metal catalysts (DSMCs) in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are presented. This Review includes a description and generalization of the classification of DSMCs used for CO2RR according to the form of metal existence; a detailed analysis of the mechanisms and importance of synergy in enhancing electrocatalytic properties for CO2RR.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising and green approach for reducing atmospheric CO2 concentration and achieving high&#8208;valued conversion of CO2 under the carbon&#8208;neutral policy. In CO2RR, the dual&#8208;site metal catalysts (DSMCs) have received wide attention for their ingenious design strategies, abundant active sites, and excellent catalytic performance attributed to the synergistic effect between dual&#8208;site in terms of activity, selectivity and stability, which plays a key role in catalytic reactions. This review provides a systematic summary and detailed classification of DSMCs for CO2RR, describes the mechanism of synergistic effects in catalytic reactions, and also introduces in&#8197;situ characterization techniques commonly used in CO2RR. Finally, the main challenges and prospects of dual&#8208;site metal catalysts and even multi&#8208;site catalysts for CO2 recycling are analyzed. It is believed that based on the understanding of bimetallic site catalysts and synergistic effects in CO2RR, well&#8208;designed high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts are promising for achieving CO2 conversion, electrochemical energy conversion and storage in the future.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Tropane Scaffolds by an Organocatalyzed 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of 3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Betaines and Dienamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyzed (5+2) cycloaddition of 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines and dienamines is presented. The protocol allows for the enantioselective construction of functionalized tropane scaffolds in up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee and up to quantitative yield. DFT calculations propose a stepwise mechanism in which multiple cycloaddition pathways are possible, but the reversibility of diverging routes renders the reaction fully periselective.







Abstract
Tropane alkaloids constitute a compound&#8208;class which is structurally defined by a central 8&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane core. A diverse bioactivity profile combined with an unusual aza&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework has made tropanes molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest within organic chemistry.

     alt="Enantioselective Synthesis of Tropane Scaffolds by an Organocatalyzed 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition of 3-Oxidopyridinium Betaines and Dienamines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An organocatalyzed (5+2) cycloaddition&lt;/b&gt; of 3-oxidopyridinium betaines and dienamines is presented. The protocol allows for the enantioselective construction of functionalized tropane scaffolds in up to &amp;gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;&lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt; and up to quantitative yield. DFT calculations propose a stepwise mechanism in which multiple cycloaddition pathways are possible, but the reversibility of diverging routes renders the reaction fully periselective.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tropane alkaloids constitute a compound-class which is structurally defined by a central 8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane core. A diverse bioactivity profile combined with an unusual aza-bridged bicyclic framework has made tropanes molecules-of-interest within organic chemistry. Enantioselective examples of (5+2) cycloadditions between 3-oxidopyridinium betaines and olefins remain unexplored, despite 3-oxidopyridinium betaines being useful reagents in organic synthesis. The first asymmetric (5+2) cycloaddition of 3-oxidopyridinium betaines is reported, affording tropane derivatives in up to quantitative yield and with excellent control of peri-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivity. The reactivity is enabled by dienamine-activation of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-unsaturated aldehydes combined with in&#8197;situ formation of the pyridinium reaction-partner. A simple &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-deprotection protocol allows for liberation of the tropane alkaloid motif, and synthetic elaborations of the cycloadducts demonstrate their synthetic utility to achieve highly diastereoselective modification around the bicyclic framework. DFT computations suggest a stepwise mechanism where regio- and stereoselectivity are defined during the first bond-forming step in which the pyridinium dipole exerts critical conformational control over its dienamine partner. In the second bond-forming step, a kinetic preference toward an initial (5+4) cycloadduct was identified; however, a lack of catalyst turn-over, reversibility, and thermodynamic bias favoring a (5+2) cycloadduct rendered the reaction fully periselective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;Dispersible Carbon Nano&#8208;Test Tubes as a Container for Concentrated DNA Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nano&#8208;test tubes whose inner surfaces were selectively oxidized work well as a nano&#8208;container for concentrated DNA molecules. The Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction is exerted between DNA phosphate groups and the carboxylate anions formed on the inner carbon surface and the interaction attracts DNA molecules to the inner space so as to make the total net charge of DNA equal to the charge of the carboxylate anions.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible carbon nano&#8208;test tubes (CNTTs) with an inner and outer diameter of about 25 and 35&#8197;nm, respectively, were prepared by the template technique and then their inner carbon surface was selectively oxidized to introduce carboxy groups. The adsorption behavior of DNA molecules on the oxidized CNTTs (Ox&#8208;CNTTs) was examined in the presence of Ca2+ cations. Many DNA molecules are attracted to the inner space of Ox&#8208;CNTTs based on the Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction between DNA phosphate groups and carboxylate anions on the inner carbon surface. Moreover, the total net charge of the DNA adsorbed was found to be equal to the total charge of the carboxylate anions. This selective adsorption into the interior of Ox&#8208;CNTTs can be explained from the fact that the electrostatic interaction onto the inner concave surface is much stronger than that on the outer convex surface. On the other hand, the desorption of DNA easily occurs whenever Ca2+ cations are removed by washing with deionized water. Thus, each of Ox&#8208;CNTTs works well as a nano&#8208;container for a large amount of DNA molecules, thereby resulting in the occurrence of DNA enrichment in the nanospace.

         <title>Photocaging of Carboxylic Function Bearing Biomolecules by New Thiazole Derived Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of a new fluorophore containing an arylidene thiazole scaffold resulted in a compound with good photophysical characteristics. Furthermore, the thiazole C5&#8208;methyl group was easily modified into specific functional groups (CH2Br and CH2OH) for the formation of a series of photocourier molecules containing model compounds (benzoic acids), as well as prodrugs, including salicylic acid, caffeic acid, and chlorambucil via a &#8220;benzyl&#8221; linker. Spectral characteristics (1&#1053;, 13&#1057; NMR, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectra) corresponded to the proposed structures. The photocourier molecules demonstrated absorption with high values of coefficient of molar extinction, exhibited contrasting green emission, and showed good dark stability. The mechanism of the photorelease was investigated through spectral analysis, HPLV&#8208;HRMS, and supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The photoheterolysis and elimination of carboxylic acids were proved to occur in the excited state, yielding a carbocation as an intermediate moiety. The fluorophore structure provided stability to the carbocation through the delocalization of the positive charge via resonance structures. Viability assessment of Vero cells using the MTT&#8208;test confirmed the weak cytotoxicity of prodrugs without irradiation and it increase upon UV&#8208;light.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;doped two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) with atomically precise thickness have attracted much research interest due to their inherent photo&#8208;physical properties. In this work, we have synthesized 2D Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs, investigated the charge transfer dynamics using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and fabricated an efficient photodetector device. A large Stoke&#8217;s shifted emission at ~685 nm with an average lifetime of about ~1.45 &#181;s is observed in Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs.&#160; Slower bleach recovery kinetics leads to large charge carrier separation in Cu&#8208;doped NPLs which is beneficial for photodetector applications. Cu&#8208;doped NPLs&#8208;based photodetectors exhibit high photocurrent, fast response (~120 ms), ~600 times higher photoresponsivity, and ~300 times higher detectivity (~4.1&#215;1013 Jones) than undoped CdS NPLs. These excellent properties of Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs make this material an efficient alternative for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>An Iron Macrocyclic Complex Containing Four &#8220;Hybrid&#8221; Pyridinium Amidate/Amidate N&#8208;Donors as a Catalyst for Oxidations With Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The macrocyclic pro&#8208;ligand [H4L][OTf]2, which contains four carboxamide functions and two conjugated pyridinium groups, is easily deprotonated by the weak base sodium acetate to give the corresponding neutral pro&#8208;ligand [H2L]. Metalation of [H2L] with iron(II) chloride proceeds rapidly to form the macrocyclic complex, [FeIIICl(L)]. This is an effective catalyst for the oxidation of the organic dye orange II by hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and the kinetic parameters for this reaction have been determined. In striking contrast to an analogous iron&#8208;TAML complex that contains two phenyl groups in place of the two pyridinium groups, [FeIIICl(L)] is a very active oxidation catalyst at pH 7 and is also highly stable towards acid promoted demetallation at pH 5 or above. The results show that the two pyridinium groups bring greatly enhanced catalytic properties to [FeIIICl(L)].</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydropolymerization of Amine&#8208;Boranes using Bis(imino)pyridine Rhodium Pre&#8208;Catalysis: &#963;&#8208;Amine&#8208;Borane Complexes, Nanoparticles, and&#160;Low Residual&#8208;Metal BN&#8208;Polymers that can be Chemically Repurposed</title>

         <dc:description>The sigma amine&#8208;borane complexes [Rh(L1)(h2:h2H3B&#183;NRH2)][OTf] (L1 = 2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;[1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenylimino)ethyl]pyridine, R = Me, Et, nPr) are described, alongside [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf]. Using R = Me as the pre&#8208;catalyst (1 mol%) the dehydropolymerization of H3B&#183;NMeH2 gives [H2BNMeH]n selectively. Added NMeH2, or the direct use of [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf], is required for initiation of catalysis, which is suggested to operate through formation of a neutral hydride complex, Rh(L1)H. The formation of small (1&#8208;5 nm) nanoparticles is observed during catalysis, but studies are ambiguous as to whether the catalysis is solely nanoparticle promoted or if there is a molecular homogeneous component. [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf] is shown to operate at 0.025 mol% loadings on a 2 g scale to give polyaminoborane [H2BNMeH]n [Mn = 30,900 g/mol, &#208; = 1.8] that can be purified to a low residual [Rh] (6 &#181;g/g). Addition of Na[N(SiMe3)2] to [H2BNMeH]n results in selective depolymerization to form the eee&#8208;isomer of N,N,N&#8208;trimethylborazane [H2BNMeH]3: the chemical repurposing of a main&#8208;group polymer.</dc:description>

         <title>2,4,5,7&#8208;Tetranitrofluorenone Oximate for the Naked&#8208;Eye Detection of H&#8208;Bond Donors and the Chiroptical Sensing of Enantiopure Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen bonding greatly influences rates and equilibrium positions of chemical reactions, conformations, and sometimes even stereochemistry. Herein, we report on tetranitrofluorenone oximate, a novel dye capable of naked&#8208;eye detection of hydrogen&#8208;bond donating species (HBDs) and of rapid determination of H&#8208;bond donation strength by hypsochromic shift monitoring. In addition, the molecule possesses atropisomeric conformations, of M and P configuration, as evidenced in solid and solution state studies by X&#8208;ray diffraction and electronic circular dichroism (ECD), respectively. In the latter case, enantiopure bis&#8208;thioureas were the most effective HBDs to promote a chiral induction (diastereoselective recognition, Pfeiffer effect); the ECD results being rationalized by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Based on these experiments, bis&#8208;thioureas were used as chiral reagents in asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of structurally&#8208;related nitrones; the ECD sensing of the stereoinduction between bis&#8208;thioureas and the oximate serving as an indirect method of selection of the most effective HBD for asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>An Acid&#8208;Controlled Method for the Regioselective Functionalization of Anilines over Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regioselective transformations at similar functional groups is of paramount importance in organic synthesis. Traditional strategies towards regioselective functionalization include serial protection/deprotection and sequential synthesis. Modern organic synthesis emphasizes pathway efficiency and protecting group free routes with a goal of exploiting inherent differences in reactivity. Here we report a method for the regioselective functionalization of anilines over aliphatic amines. Utilizing classic conditions for the Baeyer&#8211;Mills reaction, we were able to show that anilines will react preferentially in the presence of aliphatic amines. Subsequently, we illustrate how this principle of reactivity can be extended to other electrophiles and conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing straightforward but flexible approaches to PROTAC synthesis that can incorporate the structural elements of emerging designs can improve the quality and efficiency of PROTAC development. Solid&#8208;phase approaches could offer many advantages over conventional PROTAC synthesis if diverse chemistries and topographies can be incorporated. We have exploited the backbone&#8208;amide&#8208;linked (BAL) resin to employ an array of solid&#8208;phase organic reactions, providing access to VHL&#8208; and IAP&#8208;targeting degraders using the BRD4&#8208;targeting JQ1 conjugates as examples.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Insertion of tellurium into carbon&#8208;iodine bond has been achieved for the first time by a base&#8208;free copper&#8208;catalyzed method for the construction of aryl 2&#8208;benzamide tellurenyl iodides. Furthermore, synthesized tellurenyl iodides were explored for CO2 mitigation to synthesize cyclic carbonates and 1,3&#8208;diaryl ureas, using epoxides and anilines, respectively. In addition, for the first time, the ebtellur intermediate is isolated and characterized by SC&#8208;XRD.







Abstract
Benzamide&#8208;derived organochalcogens (chalcogen=S, Se, and Te) have shown promising interest in biological and synthetic chemistry. Ebselen molecule derived from benzamide moiety is the most studied organoselenium. However, its heavier congener organotellurium is under&#8208;explored. Here, an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed atom economical synthetic method has been developed to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzamide tellurenyl iodides by inserting a tellurium atom into carbon&#8208;iodine bond of 2&#8208;iodobenzamides in one pot with 78&#8211;95&#8201;% yields. Further, the Lewis acidic nature of Te center and Lewis basic nature of nitrogen of the synthesized 2&#8208;Iodo&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides enabled them as pre&#8208;catalyst for the activation of epoxide with CO2 at 1&#8197;atm for the preparation of cyclic carbonates with TOF and TON values of 1447&#8197;h&#8722;1 and 4343, respectively, under solvent&#8208;free conditions. In addition, 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides have also been used as pre&#8208;catalyst for activating anilines and CO2 to form a variety of 1,3&#8208;diaryl ureas up to 95&#8201;% yield. The mechanistic investigation for CO2 mitigation is done by 125Te&#8197;NMR and HRMS studies. It seems that the reaction proceeds via formation of catalytically active Te&#8722;N heterocycle, an ebtellur intermediate which is isolated and structurally characterized.

         <title>Infrared Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigations of Group 13 Oxyfluorides OMF2 and OMF (M=B, Al, Ga, In)</title>

         <dc:description>
Terminal oxygen radicals involving group 13&#8201;atoms: We investigate herein oxydifluoride OMF2 (M=B, Al, Ga and In) radicals by the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated group 13 atoms with OF2 under cryogenic conditions in solid noble gas matrices. The computed molecular orbitals and spin densities showed that the unpaired electron is mainly located at the terminal oxygen atom.







Abstract
Group 13 oxyfluorides OMF2 were produced by the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated group 13 atoms M (M=B, Al, Ga and In) with OF2 and isolated in excess neon or argon matrices at 5&#8197;K. These molecules were characterized by matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and isotopic substitution experiments in conjunction with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The calculations indicate that the OMF2 molecules have a 2B2 ground state with C2v symmetry. The computed molecular orbitals and spin densities show that the unpaired electron is mainly located at the terminal oxygen atom. Oxo monofluorides OMF were only observed in solid argon matrices and exhibit a linear structure in the singlet ground state. The M&#8722;O bonding in the OMF molecules can be rationalized as highly polar multiple bonds based on the calculated bond lengths and natural resonance theory (NRT) analyses. In particular, the molecular orbitals of OBF exhibit the character of a triple bond B&#8722;O resulting from two degenerate electron&#8208;sharing &#960; bonds and an O&#8594;B dative &#963; bond formed by the oxygen 2p lone pair which donates electron density to the boron empty 2p orbital.

         <title>Oriented External Electric&#8208;Field Effects on the Activation of Aryl CO Bond in Anisole using Rh(PEP) (E=Al, B, Ga) Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculations with density functional theory (DFT) demonstrate the effect of Oriented External Electric Field (OEEF) on the heterolytic activation reactions of the C(sp2)&#8722;O bond in aryl ether compounds, such as anisole, catalysed by Rh&#8722;E (E= Al/B/Ga) complexes. New Rh&#8722;E catalyst complexes with improved activity has also been proposed.







Abstract
The present work reports a DFT&#8208;based mechanistic investigation of aryl C&#8722;O bond activation in anisole catalysed by a Rh&#8722;Al pincer&#8208;type complex at room temperature. The study is extended to analogues Rh&#8722;E complexes based on Group&#8197;13 elements (E=B/Ga). Our results show a preference for the heterolytic cleavage pathway over oxidative addition in the C&#8722;O bond activation. The calculated barriers range from 16 to 36&#8197;kcal/mol, following the order: E=Al&lt;E=Ga&lt;E=B. A strong correlation between the activation barriers and the local electric field (LEF) at the Rh metal centre for the studied Rh&#8722;E complexes was observed. Additionally, the ability of Oriented External Electric Field (OEEF) to lower the reaction barrier by applying the OEEF along the direction of electron reorganization, that is, &#8220;the reaction axis&#8221;, was examined. Our results demonstrate the significant effect of applied OEEF on the aryl C&#8722;O bond activation in Rh&#8722;E systems. Furthermore, the effect of OEEF on the C&#8722;O bond activation using modified Rh&#8722;E (E=B, Al, or Ga) complexes, in which electronic structure modifications enable a more efficient barrier control by the OEEF, was showcased. Notably, applying a moderate field strength reduces the high reaction barrier for the Rh&#8722;B system by approximately 13&#8197;kcal/mol.

In both the trinuclear N4+ and the pentanuclear M5+ complexes, there exists the neighboring RuII &#8594; FeIII MM'CT transitions, and the MM&#8217;CT energy in the corresponding trinuclear system is higher than those in the pentanuclear system in which no remote metal&#8208;metal interaction occurs. Meanwhile, as the substituted methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene increases, the redox potential of the ruthenium in the trinuclear N4+series increases, but that in the pentanuclear M5+ complexes decreases.</dc:description>

         <title>Interaction between the transferrin protein and plutonium (and thorium), what&#8217;s new?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transferrin (Tf) is a glycoprotein that transports iron from the serum to the various organs. Several studies have highlighted that Tf can interact with&#160;metals other than&#160;Fe(III), including actinides that are chemical and radiological toxics.&#160;We propose here to report on the behavior of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) in comparison with Fe(III) upon Tf complexation. We considered UV&#8208;Vis and IR data of the M2Tf complex (M = Fe, Th, Pu) and combined experimental EXAFS data with MD models. EXAFS data of the first M&#8208;O coordination sphere are consistent with the MD model considering 1 synergistic carbonate. Further EXAFS data analysis strongly suggests that contamination by Th/Pu colloids seems to occur upon Tf complexation, but it seems limited. SAXS data have also been recorded for all complexes and also after the addition of DFOB in the medium. The Rg values are very close for apoTf, ThTf and PuTf, but slightly larger than for holoTf.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transferrin (Tf) is a glycoprotein that transports iron from the serum to the various organs. Several studies have highlighted that Tf can interact with&#160;metals other than&#160;Fe(III), including actinides that are chemical and radiological toxics.&#160;We propose here to report on the behavior of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) in comparison with Fe(III) upon Tf complexation. We considered UV-Vis and IR data of the M2Tf complex (M = Fe, Th, Pu) and combined experimental EXAFS data with MD models. EXAFS data of the first M-O coordination sphere are consistent with the MD model considering 1 synergistic carbonate. Further EXAFS data analysis strongly suggests that contamination by Th/Pu colloids seems to occur upon Tf complexation, but it seems limited. SAXS data have also been recorded for all complexes and also after the addition of DFOB in the medium. The Rg values are very close for apoTf, ThTf and PuTf, but slightly larger than for holoTf. Data suggest that the structure of the protein is more ellipsoidal than spherical, with a flattened oblate form. From this data, the following order of conformation size might be considered : holoTf &amp;lt; M2Tf (M = Th, Pu) &amp;lt; apoTf &amp;lt; M2Tf-DFOB (M = Fe, Th, Pu).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable Fluorescence and Morphology of Aggregates Built from a Mechanically Bonded Amphiphilic Bistable [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically bonded amphiphiles (MBAs), also known as mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), have emerged as an important kind of functional building block for the construction of artificial molecular machines and soft materials. Herein, a novel MBA, i.e., bistable [2]rotaxane H2 was designed and synthesized. In the solution state, H2 demonstrated pH and metal ion&#8208;responsive emissions due to the presence of a distance&#8208;dependent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process, respectively. Importantly, the amphiphilic feature of H2 has endowed it with unique self&#8208;assembly capability, and nanospheres were obtained in a mixed H2O/CH3CN solvent. Moreover, the morphology of H2 aggregates can be tuned from nanospheres to vesicles due to the pH&#8208;controlled shuttling motion&#8208;induced alternation of H2 amphiphilicity. Interestingly, larger spheres with novel pearl&#8208;chain&#8208;like structures from H2 were observed after adding stoichiometric Zn2+. In particular, H2 shows pH&#8208;responsive emissions in its aggregation state, allowing the visualization of the shuttling movement by just naked eyes. It is assumed that the well&#8208;designed [2]rotaxane, and particularly the proposed concept of MBA shown here, will further enrich the families of MIMs, offering prospects for synthesizing more MIMs with novel assembly capabilities and bottom&#8208;up building dynamic smart materials with unprecedented functions.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure and High&#8208;Temperature Dion&#8211;Jacobson Layered Perovskite Polymorphs of KWO3F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural relationship between the known normal&#8208;pressure modification of KWO3F and its two new siblings synthesized under high pressure and at high temperature is explored. The three polymorphs exhibit varying degrees of symmetry, but all of them belong to an overarching Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite structure type. In addition to a thorough examination of the phase transitions of KWO3F specifically, this work provides a closer look at the role of anion site occupation in phase transitions of mixed&#8208;anion compounds.







Abstract
Two new Dion&#8211;Jacobson layered perovskite polymorphs of the known oxyfluoride compound KWO3F are reported. A high&#8208;pressure modification was synthesized using a multianvil setup and subsequently transformed into a high&#8208;temperature phase at &#8764;311&#8201;&#176;C. The crystal structures of both polymorphs were determined by use of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and are described in detail herein. Differential thermal analyses and thermogravimetric analyses were carried out to further investigate the phase transition characteristics. Bond valence (BV) and charge distribution (CHARDI) calculations confirm the occupancy of mixed O|F anion positions, and Rietveld refinements as well as MAPLE calculations support the structure models.

         <title>Mechanism of Acyl Group Migration in Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acyl groups are prone to migrate in carbohydrates, causing issues in the laboratory setting. Migration could also have biological relevance, such as in regulation of cell signaling. Recently, deeper investigations have been performed on the mechanism of this phenomenon. In this concept article some of the investigations are discussed, providing insights into the mechanism and the migration process in general.







Abstract
Acyl group migration has been the subject of several studies. Such migration processes may cause problems during synthesis, isolation, and purification of different acyl&#8208;bearing compounds, and have biological relevance, for example, in the metabolism of pharmaceuticals. Considering the recent evidence of acyl group migration being possible even over glycosidic bonds, it could be hypothesized to be involved also in the regulation of biological activity of natural polysaccharides in the host cells. Migrations are mostly observed in carbohydrates, typically having several hydroxyl groups near each other. Several studies have investigated the migration in a single or only a few different carbohydrate molecules, providing different suggestions for the mechanisms of migration, seldom supported by comprehensive computational investigations. In this concept article we discuss the recent progress on the mechanistic aspects of acyl group migration, with carbohydrates in particular focus.

         <title>Orthogonal Strategies for Profiling Potential Cellular Targets of Anandamide and Cannabidiol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) and &#8216;label&#8208;free&#8217; 2D&#8208;TPP (2 Dimensional&#8208;Thermal Protein Profiling) platforms have been used to identify potential cellular targets of cannabinoids, especially cannabidiol (CBD), leading to the discovery of both shared and unique protein targets. Subsequent target validation led to the conclusion that this 2D&#8208;TPP strategy complements well with AfBPP.







Abstract
The human endocannabinoid system regulates a myriad of physiological processes through a complex lipid signaling network involving cannabinoids and their respective receptors, cannabinoid receptor 1 (hCB1R) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (hCB2R). Anandamide (AEA) and cannabidiol (CBD) are classical examples of cannabinoids that elicit a variety of effects, both beneficial and detrimental, through these receptors. Mounting evidence suggested the presence of other potential cannabinoid targets that may be responsible for other observable effects. However, prior pharmacological studies on these cannabinoid compounds provided scant evidence of direct engagement to these proposed targets. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no chemoproteomic studies have been demonstrated on CBD. Here we showed that, by taking advantage of a recently developed &#8216;label&#8208;free&#8217; 2D&#8208;TPP (2 Dimensional&#8208;Thermal Protein Profiling) approach, we have identified several new putative targets of both AEA and CBD. Comparison of these interaction landscapes with those obtained from well&#8208;established affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) platforms has led to the discovery of both shared and unique protein targets. Subsequent target validation of selected proteins led us to conclude that this 2D&#8208;TPP strategy complements well with AfBPP.

         <title>Use of Biomass Glycerol as a Reducing Agent for Photocatalytic Deprotection of Pyridine N&#8208;Oxides in an Aqueous Suspension of Titanium(IV) Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxides was achieved using glycerol as the biomass reducing reagent, water as the solvent, TiO2 as the photocatalyst, and solar light as the light and thermal energy source.







Abstract
Deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxides under mild conditions with an inexpensive and environmentally friendly reducing reagent is an important chemical procedure. The use of biomass waste as the reducing reagent, water as the solvent and solar light as the energy source is one of the most promising approaches with minimal impact on the environment. Therefore, a TiO2 photocatalyst and glycerol are suitable components of this type of reaction. Stoichiometric deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxide (PyNO) with a minimal amount of glycerol (PyNO:glycerol= 7&#8201;:&#8201;1) was achieved, with only CO2 being produced as the final oxidation product of glycerol. The deprotection of PyNO was thermally accelerated. Under solar light, the temperature of the reaction system increased to 40&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C and PyNO was also quantitatively deprotected, indicating that solar energy, i.&#8201;e., UV light and thermal energy, can be effectively used. The results provide a new approach in the fields of organic chemistry and medical chemistry using biomass waste and solar light.

         <title>Electrophilic Si&#8722;H Activation by Acetonitrilo Benzo[h]quinoline Iridacycles: Influence of Electronic Effects in Catalysis</title>

The evaluation in hydrosilylation catalysis of six new benzo[h]quinoline&#8208;derived acetonitrilo pentamethylcyclopentadienyl iridium(III) tetrakis(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)borate salts bearing different substituents &#8722;X (&#8722;OMe, &#8722;H, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, &#8722;NO2 and &#8722;(NO2)2) at the heterochelating ligand shows direct substituent dependence consistent with the electrophilic activation of the hydrosilane by the precatalyst.







Abstract
The performance of six newly synthesized benzo[h]quinoline&#8208;derived acetonitrilo pentamethylcyclopentadienyl iridium(III) tetrakis(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl)borate salts bearing different substituents &#8722;X (&#8722;OMe, &#8722;H, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br, &#8722;NO2 and &#8722;(NO2)2) on the heterochelating ligand were evaluated in the dehydro&#8208;O&#8208;silylation of benzyl alcohol and the monohydrosilylation of 4&#8208;methoxybenzonitrile by Et3SiH, two reactions involving the electrophilic activation of the Si&#8722;H bond. The benchmark shows a direct dependence of the catalytic efficiency with the electronic effect of &#8722;X, which is confirmed by theoretical assessment of the intrinsic silylicities &#928; of hydridoiridium(III)&#8208;silylium adducts and by the theoretical evaluation of the propensity of hydridospecies to transfer the hydrido ligand to the activated substrate. The revisited analysis of the Ir&#8722;Si&#8722;H interactions shows that the most cohesive bond in hydridoiridium(III)&#8208;silylium adducts is the Ir&#8722;H one, while the Ir&#8722;Si is a weak donor&#8208;acceptor dative bond. The Si&#8230;H interaction in all the cases is noncovalent in nature and dominated by electrostatics confirming the heterolytic cleavage of the hydrosilane's Si&#8722;H bond in this key catalytically relevant species.

         <title>Cooperatively Catalyzed Activation of Thioglycosides That Bypasses Intermediacy of Glycosyl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for the activation of thioglycosides without a glycosyl halide intermediate by using a silver salt coupled with an acid additive and molecular iodine is reported. Application of the H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) method lead to an enhanced stereocontrol.







Abstract
Reported herein is the development of a novel method for activating thioglycosides without a glycosyl halide intermediate. This has been achieved through the use of a silver salt coupled with an acid additive and molecular iodine. The enhanced stereocontrol was achieved via the H&#8208;bond mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) method, and the extended trisaccharide synthesis was achieved via iteration of deprotection and glycosylation steps.

         <title>Strong and Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Circular Dichroism in Helical Tetrapyrrole Complexes</title>

Helical metal complexes of tetraphenylbilatrienones (TPBT) have been selectively synthesized, and for the first time, their structure was revealed by XRD. Contrary to theoretical predictions, their 20&#8208;phenyl group points alongside the tetrapyrrole backbone, yielding a well&#8208;defined molecule with stable helicity, 800&#8197;nm ECD absorption and &#8211; if copper is coordinated &#8211; noninnocent properties.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of nickel and copper complexes of 19&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;bilatrien&#8208;1&#8208;one (H2TPBT) is reported, a molecule which crystallizes as a molecular helix of one&#8208;and&#8208;a&#8208;quarter which turns with a 5.7&#8197;&#197; radius and a 3.2&#8197;&#197; pitch, and all 26 participating atoms are sp2&#8208;hybridized. UV/vis, ECD, ESR and cyclic voltammetry experiments reveal a strong interaction between metal and ligand and partial radical character when copper is coordinated instead of nickel. Strong ECD absorption in the 800&#8197;nm range is found which, using TD&#8208;DFT calculations as well as literature spectra, is shown to be highly tunable both by metal coordination and variation of the aryl groups in the TPBT periphery. The radical character of the ligand in Cu(TPBT) enables rapid interconversion between (M)&#8208; and (P)&#8208;enantiomers, possibly via intermittent breakage of a Cu&#8722;N bond. The 19&#8208;benzoyl group kinetically stabilizes enantiopure (M/P)&#8208;Ni(TPBT). The results are interpreted with regard to the application as circularly polarized light (CPL) detectors as well as to the chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity (CISS) effect which is currently lacking a concise theoretical model.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization for the Divergent Synthesis of Podophyllotoxin Derivatives by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent synthesis of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives from available starting materials by late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy by rhodium catalysis is described. Exquisite selectivity for podophyllotoxin functionalization was demonstrated through arylation, alkenylation and cyclization at C5 position.







Abstract
A divergent synthesis of podophyllotoxin derivatives from simple and readily available starting materials through a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy by rhodium catalysis is reported here. This strategy uses the ketone and oxime in substrates as directing groups. Four kinds of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives have been obtained without any erosion of the enantiopurity, thus indicating the broad substrate scope of this method. Additionally, by using the newly developed strategy, 9&#8201;aa, which exhibited excellent anticancer activity, can be prepared by a sequential transformation.

     alt="Late-Stage Functionalization for the Divergent Synthesis of Podophyllotoxin Derivatives by Rhodium Catalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Divergent synthesis&lt;/b&gt; of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives from available starting materials by late-stage functionalization strategy by rhodium catalysis is described. Exquisite selectivity for podophyllotoxin functionalization was demonstrated through arylation, alkenylation and cyclization at C5 position.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A divergent synthesis of podophyllotoxin derivatives from simple and readily available starting materials through a late-stage functionalization strategy by rhodium catalysis is reported here. This strategy uses the ketone and oxime in substrates as directing groups. Four kinds of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives have been obtained without any erosion of the enantiopurity, thus indicating the broad substrate scope of this method. Additionally, by using the newly developed strategy, &lt;b&gt;9&#8201;aa&lt;/b&gt;, which exhibited excellent anticancer activity, can be prepared by a sequential transformation. In particularly, &lt;b&gt;9&#8201;aa&lt;/b&gt; suppressed HeLa cells with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 74.5&#8197;nM, thus providing a promising lead compound for future drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Smart Temperature&#8208;Gating and Ion Conductivity Control of Grafted Anodic Aluminum Oxide Membranes</title>

Progress in solid&#8208;state nanochannels development: A thermo&#8208;responsive polymer poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes grafted anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane by surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP) is presented. This thermo&#8208;gated smart membrane shows a reversible surface wettability change, which allows the smart membrane to control the ion conductivity and ensures the dye release ability.







Abstract
Over the past few decades, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials have been widely applied to porous surfaces. Permeability and conductivity control of ions confined in nanochannels modified with stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, however, have been less investigated. In this work, the permeability and conductivity control of ions confined in nanochannels of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates modified with thermo&#8208;responsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes are demonstrated. By surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP), PNIPAM brushes are successfully grafted onto the hexagonally packed cylindrical nanopores of AAO templates. The surface hydrophilicities of the membranes can be reversibly altered because of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior of the PNIPAM polymer brushes. From electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, the temperature&#8208;gating behaviors of the AAO&#8208;g&#8208;PNIPAM membranes exhibit larger impedance changes than those of the pure AAO membranes at higher temperatures because of the aggregation of the grafted PNIPAM chains. The reversible surface properties caused by the extended and collapsed states of the polymer chains are also demonstrated by dye release tests. The smart thermo&#8208;gated and ion&#8208;controlled nanoporous membranes are suitable for future smart membrane applications.

         <title>Effect of Flexible Spacer and Alkyl Tail Length on the Liquid Crystalline Phase Behavior of Fullerene Block Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel superlattice containing 3 hydrocarbon single layers alternating with 4 fullerene 2D crystals can be generated in a wide range of fullerene block molecules (n=10 or 12; m=5&#8211;7), owing to the cooperative effect of a long spacer and short terminal tails. This offers a practical way to construct unconventional semi&#8208;conductive superstructures.







Abstract
Here the supramolecular liquid crystalline (LC) phase behavior of a series of fullerene block molecules was investigated regarding spacer length, alkyl tail length and temperature. These compounds exhibit several lamellar LC phases with different packings of self&#8208;organized fullerene two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystals. With a short hexamethylene spacer, they form sandwich&#8208;like structures with triple or quadruple fullerene layers. By increasing the spacer length to 10 or 12 carbons, a composite layers&#8208;in&#8208;lamella superlattice structure with alternating soft hydrocarbon single layers and fullerene single or double layers was obtained. As the molecular configurational freedom between incompatible moieties was enhanced by the elongated spacer, the required cross&#8208;sectional fullerene&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon ratio for the superlattice could be achieved despite of different volume fractions of the blocks. The superlattice phase range is efficiently widened by the design principle of constructing LC molecules with a long spacer, which also provides a facile way to tailor novel superstructures.

A series of asymmetric bistricyclic aromatic ene&#8208;based molecules were synthesized with fluoreneylidene&#8208;cyclopentadithiophene skeleton, and exhibited low bandgap characteristic with long wavelength absorption tail.

Abstract
Low band gap materials have always been a focus of attention due to their potential applications in various fields. In this work, a series of asymmetric bistricyclic aromatic ene (BAE) compounds with fluorenylidene&#8208;cyclopentadithiophene (FYT) skeleton were facially synthesized, which were modified with different substituents (&#8722;OMe, &#8722;SMe). The FYT core exhibit twisted C=C bond with dihedral angles around 30&#176;, and the introduction of &#8722;SMe group can provide additional S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interaction between molecules, which is conducive to the charge transporting. The UV&#8208;Vis spectra, electrochemistry and photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that these compounds have relatively narrow band gaps, particularly, the &#8722;SMe modified compounds have slightly lower HOMO and Fermi energy levels than that of the &#8722;OMe modified compounds. Furthermore, PSCs devices were fabricated with the three compounds as HTMs, and FYT&#8208;DSDPA exhibit the best performance among them, revealing the fine&#8208;tuning band structure could influence properties of HTMs.

The discovery of new catalytic applications for metals remains an important goal in organic synthesis. Herein, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of imidazolidine through heterocyclic recombination between aziridine and diazetidine is presented. The scope is sufficiently broad to form various imidazolidines, since the reaction conditions are suitable for many functional groups.Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Heterocyclic Recombination of Aziridine and Diazetidine for the Synthesis of Imidazolidine (Murakami et al.)







Abstract
The discovery of new catalytic applications for metals remains an important goal in organic synthesis. If a catalyst has multiple functions, such as inducing bond cleavage and formation, it can streamline multi&#8208;step transformations. Herein, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of imidazolidine through heterocyclic recombination between aziridine and diazetidine is reported. Mechanistically, Cu catalyzes the conversion of diazetidine into the corresponding imine, which then reacts with aziridine to form imidazolidine. The scope is sufficiently wide to form various imidazolidines, as many functional groups are compatible with the reaction conditions.

         <title>Stepwise Stimuli&#8208;Responsive, Multicolor&#8208;Chromic Perylene Bisimide/Polyvinyl Alcohol Co&#8208;assembly System for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular strategy based on a co&#8208;assembly system of perylene bisimides/polyvinyl alcohol for the application of multidimensional information encryption has been developed. The multidimensional chromic response is achieved through an evolution process including photoinduced electron transfer to PBI, packing rearrangement and oxidation of PBI radical anions/dianions.







Abstract
The issue of information security has become a concern in all aspects of daily life, prompting the development of encryption technologies. Therein, optical encryption using color/graphical patterns holds great potential. However, current approaches generally rely on monochromic change upon one or more stimuli, limiting their further application in advanced confidential encryption. Herein, we propose a delicate strategy based on a co&#8208;assembly system of perylene bisimides (PBI)/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) that demonstrates stepwise stimuli response and multicolor changes. The color of the supramolecular system changes from red to purple under the stimulus of UV light, and to orange when exposed to water. The multidimensional chromic response is achieved by an evolution process including the generation, packing rearrangement and quenching of PBI radical anions/dianions. With the virtues of photo&#8208; and hydrochromism, this novel co&#8208;assembly system was successfully employed for advanced anticounterfeiting and versatile information encryption applications.

         <title>3&#8208;Ligated Phenothiazinyl&#8208;terephthalonitrile Dyads and Triads &#8208; Synthesis, Electronic Properties, Delayed Fluorescence and Electronic Structure</title>

Prompt and delayed emission: A series of 3&#8208;ligated or bridged phenothiazinyl&#8208;terephthalonitrile dyads and triads are accessed in a one&#8208;pot fashion and photophysical studies in solution, solid&#8208;state and in polymer matrix reveal TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) as estimated experimentally for four dyes and confirmed by DFT/MRCI calculations for one dyad.







Abstract
The bromine&#8208;lithium exchange&#8208;borylation&#8208;Suzuki sequence efficiently furnishes phenothiazine&#8208;terephthalonitrile donor&#8208;acceptor dyads and triads in high yields. In contrast to most phenothiazine&#8208;acceptor conjugates the title compounds are ligated in p&#8208;position to the phenothiazine nitrogen atom. Moreover, the acceptors are either directly linked or ligated by an arylene bridge and p&#8208;anisyl N&#8208;substituents on the phenothiazine are chosen to lock the tricycle into an intra&#8208;configuration. Cyclic voltammetry reveals effects of bridging and ligation of the N&#8208;substituent. Optical spectroscopy likewise displays similar band gaps, large Stokes shifts and substantial to high quantum yields in solution, in the solid state and in PMMA matrix. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy indicates quite long fluorescence decay times in solution and emission components in the microsecond time range. TADF properties are further assessed by fluorescence increase in deoxygenated solution, gated emission spectroscopy and temperature&#8208;dependent determination of phosphorescence. The nature of the electronically excited states is investigated by DFT/MRCI. While for the directly ligated dyad a singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap &#916;
of 0.24&#8197;eV can be estimated and is consistently confirmed by quantum chemical calculations on the lowest energy conformer, even lower 
of 0.029 and 0.008&#8197;eV are estimated for the investigated dyads and the triad in the solid state and in PMMA matrix.

         <title>The First Cu(I)&#8208;Peptoid Complex: Enabling Metal Ion Stability and Selectivity via Backbone Helicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu(I)&#8208;peptoid complex is presented here. This complex is based on a helical peptoid incorporating 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (Bipy) ligands pre&#8208;organized on the same side of the helix. Interplay between the first and second coordination spheres is demonstrated, where the first coordination sphere is provided by the two Bipy ligands and the second by the helical structure, enabling the high stability of Cu(I).







Abstract
Stabilization of Cu(I) is ubiquitous within native copper proteins. Understanding how to stabilize Cu(I) within synthetic biomimetic systems is therefore desired towards biological applications. Peptoids are an important class of peptodomimetics, that can bind metal ions and stabilize them in their high oxidation state. Thus, to date, they were not used for Cu(I) binding. Here we show how the helical peptoid hexamer, having two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (Bipy) groups that face the same side of the helix, forms the intramolecular air stable Cu(I) complex. Further study of the binding site by rigorous spectroscopic techniques suggests that Cu(I) is tetracoordinated, binding to only three N atoms from the Bipy ligands and to the N&#8208;terminus of the peptoid's backbone. A set of control peptoids and experiments indicates that the Cu(I) stability and selectivity are dictated by the intramolecular binding, forced by the helicity of the peptoid, which can be defined as the second coordination sphere of the metal center.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Charge Separated States in Anthraquinone&#8208;Phenothiazine Dyads: Synthesis and Study of the Photophysical Property by Using Transient Optical and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived charge separated state was observed in phenothiazine&#8208;anthraquinone dyads containing adamantane linker. The photophysical processes were studied with steady state and femtosecond/nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopic method. The electron exchange of the radical ion pairs was quantified with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectra.







Abstract
In order to obtain long&#8208;lived charge separated (CS) states in electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, herein we prepared a series of anthraquinone (AQ)&#8208;phenothiazine (PTZ) dyads, with adamantane as the linker. UV&#8211;vis absorption spectra show negligible electronic interaction between the AQ and PTZ units at ground state, yet charge transfer (CT) emission bands were observed. Nanosecond transient absorption shows that the 3AQ state is populated upon photoexcitation for AQ&#8208;PTZ in cyclohexane (CHX), but in acetonitrile (ACN) a 3CS state is formed. Similar results were observed for AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M. The 3CS state lifetimes were determined as 0.52&#8197;&#956;s and 0.49&#8197;&#956;s, respectively. Upon oxidation of the PTZ unit, the 3AQ state was observed in both polar and non&#8208;polar solvents. For AQ&#8208;PTZ, femtosecond transient absorption spectra show fast formation of the 3AQ state in all solvents, with no charge separation in CHX, while formation of the 3CS state takes 106&#8197;ps in ACN. For AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M, a 3CS state is formed in CHX within 241&#8197;ps. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra show that a radical ion pair with electron exchange energy of |2&#8197;J|&#8805;5.68&#8197;mT was observed for AQ&#8208;PTZ and AQ&#8208;PTZ&#8208;M, whereas in the dyads with the PTZ unit oxidized, only the 3AQ state was observed.

Chemoselective C=C bond transfer hydrogenation in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is described using a cost&#8208;effective pincer&#8208;ligated manganese catalyst at room temperature.







Abstract
Chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of C=C bond in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones is demonstrated at room temperature employing a manganese(I) catalyst and half an equivalent of ammonia&#8208;borane (H3N&#8722;BH3). A series of mixed&#8208;donor pincer&#8208;ligated Mn(II) complexes, (tBu2PN3NPyz)MnX2 [&#954;P,&#954;N,&#954;N&#8208;(N&#8208;(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphaneyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine)MnX2] {X=Cl (Mn2), X=Br (Mn3), X=I (Mn4)} were synthesized and characterized. Amongst the Mn(II) complexes, (Mn2, Mn3, Mn4) and Mn(I) complex, (tBu2PN3NPyz)Mn(CO)2Br (Mn1) screened; the Mn1 acts as an efficient catalyst for the chemoselective C=C bond reduction in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. Various synthetically important functionalities like halides, methoxy, trifluoromethyl, benzyloxy, nitro, amine, and unconjugated alkene and alkyne groups, including heteroarenes, were compatible and provided saturated ketones in excellent yields (up to 97&#8201;%). A preliminary mechanistic study highlighted the crucial role of metal&#8211;ligand (M&#8211;L) cooperation through the dearomatization&#8208;aromatization process in catalyst Mn1 for the chemoselective C=C bond transfer hydrogenation.

         <title>Turning the Imidazole Core into Three&#8208;Dimensional Ring Systems: Mild Organocatalytic Entry to Enantiopure 6,7&#8208;Dihydrobenzimidazoles</title>

The challenging side of simplicity: Easily available imidazole&#8208;based substrates were coupled with &#946;&#8208;aryl enals via eliminative [4+2] cycloaddition under mild aminocatalytic conditions to access rare chiral [d]&#8208;fused imidazole ring systems with optimal enantio&#8208; and regioselectivity and good potential for post&#8208;cycloaddition functional group editing.







Abstract
Organocatalytic asymmetric transformation of common aromatic heterocycles via in&#8197;situ formation of highly reactive dearomatized ortho&#8208;quinodimethane diene species and subsequent [4+2] cycloaddition with suitable dienophiles has become a powerful tool to enter cyclohexane&#8208;fused heterocycles. Most of these reactions were previously applied to benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles or poorly aromatic rings. Herein, we disclose how previously intractable aromatic imidazole rings, equipped with removable methylidene malononitrile activating handle, could be involved as competent cycloaddends with &#946;&#8208;aryl enals in efficient eliminative [4+2] cycloadditions under mild organocatalytic conditions. This method allowed the efficient and direct preparation of scantly represented 6,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[d]imidazoles with optimal enantio&#8208; and regioselectivities. Post&#8208;cycloaddition chemical editing provided imidazole&#8208;based ring systems with diverse oxidation state and functional groups.

         <title>Construction of Five Tryptophan Isomers and Application of the Isomers to Solid&#8208;Phase Total Syntheses of Lysocin E Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five tryptophan (Trp) isomers were prepared in which the indole C3&#8208;substitution was changed to the C2/4/5/6/7&#8208;substitutions and were then applied to Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase total syntheses of the analogues of antibiotic lysocin E. The biological evaluation revealed the importance of the precise three&#8208;dimensional shape of the original Trp residue.







Abstract
Tryptophan (Trp) plays a unique role in peptides and proteins as its indole ring possesses an electron&#8208;rich character and an N1&#8722;H hydrogen&#8208;bond donor. Because of its non&#8208;rotationally symmetric structure, synthetic alterations of the orientation of the indole ring would modulate the intrinsic structures and functions of peptides and proteins. Here we developed synthetic routes to the five Trp isomers in which the C3&#8208;substitution of the indole ring was changed to the C2/4/5/6/7&#8208;substitutions, and applied the five monomers to Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Specifically, the five monomers were prepared via Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions of C2/4/5/6/7&#8208;iodoindoles. To demonstrate the applicability of the monomers to the solid&#8208;phase synthesis, the five Trp isomers of macrocyclic antibiotic lysocin E were selected as target molecules and synthesized through peptide elongation, on&#8208;resin macrocyclization, and global deprotection. The Trp isomers displayed markedly weaker antibacterial activity than the parent natural product, revealing the biological importance of the precise three&#8208;dimensional shape of the original Trp residue of lysocin E. The present methods for the preparation and application of these five Trp isomers provide a new strategy for analyzing and modifying the specific functions of numerous Trp&#8208;containing peptides and proteins beyond this study.

         <title>Nonorthogonal Cascade Catalysis in Multicompartment Micelles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;base bifunctional multicompartment micelle prepared from amphiphilic bottlebrush copolymers is reported for the nonorthogonal reaction sequence: deacetalization&#8208;Knoevenagel condensation &#8211; Michael addition of acetals to 2&#8208;amino chromene derivatives. Multicompartment micelles are promising nanostructures for compartmentalization of nonorthogonal catalysts for multistep transformations.







Abstract
Multicompartment micelles (MCMs) containing acid and base sites in discrete domains are prepared from poly(norbornene)&#8208;based amphiphilic bottlebrush copolymers in aqueous media. The acid and base sites are localized in different compartments of the micelle, enabling the nonorthogonal reaction sequence: deacetalization &#8211; Knoevenagel condensation &#8211; Michael addition of acetals to 2&#8208;amino chromene derivatives. Computational simulations using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) elucidated the bottlebrush composition required to effectively site&#8208;isolate the nonorthogonal catalysts. This contribution presents MCMs as a new class of nanostructures for one&#8208;pot multistep nonorthogonal cascade catalysis, laying the groundwork for the isolation of three or more incompatible catalysts to synthesize value&#8208;added compounds in a single reaction vessel, in water.

         <title>Stable Spiro&#8208;Fused Diarylaminyl Radicals: A New Type of a Neutral Mixed&#8208;Valence System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of stable spiro&#8208;fused diarylaminyl radicals that are radical cations with the &#8220;canceled charge&#8221; was obtained. The radicals belong to Class&#8197;II Robin&#8208;Day neutral mixed&#8208;valence systems that are rare. They are valuable models to mimic natural electron transfer reactions promoting a deeper understanding of their mechanism. The advanced properties of the radicals make them of potential interest in materials science.







Abstract
A new type of neutral mixed&#8208;valence system was synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot procedure. The spiro&#8208;conjugated framework is additionally &#8220;fastened&#8221; with a biphenyl bridge, which does not directly participate in spin delocalization but makes the molecule stable and influences the reorganization energy and the energy barrier of the intramolecular electron transfer. The in&#8208;depth experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical study allowed determining the radicals as the Class&#8197;II Robin&#8208;Day&#8208;mixed&#8208;valence systems. The structure of the radicals was confirmed by the X&#8208;ray data, which are relatively rare for Class&#8197;II MV molecules. Advanced properties of the radicals, such as an ambipolar redox behavior and panchromatic absorption in the visible and NIR regions, along with their stability, make them of interest for materials science. All radicals demonstrate the SOMO&#8208;HOMO inversion phenomenon, which was supported by the DFT and the experimental study.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first example&lt;/b&gt; of stable spiro-fused diarylaminyl radicals that are radical cations with the &#8220;canceled charge&#8221; was obtained. The radicals belong to Class&#8197;II Robin-Day neutral mixed-valence systems that are rare. They are valuable models to mimic natural electron transfer reactions promoting a deeper understanding of their mechanism. The advanced properties of the radicals make them of potential interest in materials science.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new type of neutral mixed-valence system was synthesized using a facile one-pot procedure. The spiro-conjugated framework is additionally &#8220;fastened&#8221; with a biphenyl bridge, which does not directly participate in spin delocalization but makes the molecule stable and influences the reorganization energy and the energy barrier of the intramolecular electron transfer. The in-depth experimental and quantum-chemical study allowed determining the radicals as the Class&#8197;II Robin-Day-mixed-valence systems. The structure of the radicals was confirmed by the X-ray data, which are relatively rare for Class&#8197;II MV molecules. Advanced properties of the radicals, such as an ambipolar redox behavior and panchromatic absorption in the visible and NIR regions, along with their stability, make them of interest for materials science. All radicals demonstrate the SOMO-HOMO inversion phenomenon, which was supported by the DFT and the experimental study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Experimental and theoretical investigations on the reactions between cis&#8208;[Ru/Os(dppm)2Cl2] and pyridine/quinoline&#8208;substituted homopropargylic alcohols provided strategies to prepare new metalated heterocyclic and metalacyclic complexes by utilizing temperature&#8208;controlled divergent pathways and an unexpected decyclization mechanism. Cyclization, decyclization, and metallacyclization of pyridine&#8208;substituted homopropargylic alcohols on ruthenium(II) and osmium(II) centers (C.&#8197;Y. Wong et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Systematic investigations on the reactions between cis&#8208;[M(dppm)2Cl2] (M=Ru/Os; dppm=1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and pyridine/quinoline substituted homopropargylic alcohols uncovered the diverse Ru(II)/Os(II)&#8208;induced alkyne activation pathways. The alkynes underwent cyclization on M via a &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8221; pathway at lower temperatures, resulting in alkenyl intermediates which might further metallacyclize to give metallapyrroloindolizines. Conversely, reactions at higher temperatures induced alkyne cyclization on M via a &#8220;vinylidene&#8221; pathway, affording cyclic oxacarbene complexes. Additionally, a rare decyclization mechanism was observed during the transformation of a metallacyclization&#8208;resistant alkenyl complex into a cyclic oxacarbene complex. DFT calculations were employed to validate the experimental findings. Overall, these results not only provide insights into controlling alkyne activation pathways, but also offer new strategies for preparing metalated heterocyclic and metallacyclic complexes.

         <title>Alkali Metal Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Binding in Conformationally Dynamic Halogen Bonding Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heteroditopic halogen bonding [2]rotaxanes display metal cation binding&#8208;induced co&#8208;conformational dynamism and significant positive cooperativity upon binding of alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pairs. Detailed analysis of the 1H&#8197;NMR titration spectra reveal a complex suite of parallel and competing equilibria which need to be considered to obtain reliable estimates of the rotaxanes&#8217; ion&#8208;pair binding affinities.







Abstract
A series of heteroditopic halogen bonding (XB) [2]rotaxanes were prepared via a combination of passive and active metal template&#8208;directed strategies. The ability of the [2]rotaxanes to bind alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pairs was investigated by extensive 1H&#8197;NMR titration studies, wherein detailed analysis of cation, anion and ion&#8208;pair affinity measurements indicate dramatic positive cooperative enhancements in halide anion association upon either Na+ or K+ pre&#8208;complexation. This study demonstrates that careful consideration of multiple, parallel and competing binding equilibria is essential when interpreting observed 1H&#8197;NMR spectral changes in ion&#8208;pair receptor systems, especially those which exhibit dynamic behaviour. Importantly, in comparison to XB [2]catenane analogues, these neutral XB heteroditopic [2]rotaxane host systems demonstrated that despite their relatively weaker cation and anion binding affinities, they exhibit a notably higher level of positive cooperativity for alkali metal halide ion&#8208;pair binding, highlighting the role of greater co&#8208;conformational adaptive behaviour in mechanically&#8208;bonded hosts for the purposes of charged species recognition.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Drug Release from Nanometric Micelles in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micelles constructed with sydnonimines are cleaved upon addition of cyclooctynes in a bioorthogonal manner, leading to the massive release of an anticancer drug in living cells. Fast release of the drug triggered a stronger antiproliferative activity on tumor cells compared to the passive diffusion from the micelles core.







Abstract
We explored a bioorthogonal approach to release drugs from stimuli&#8208;responsive micelles inside tumor cells. The concept relies on sydnonimine&#8208;based micelles that undergo quantitative cleavage in presence of cyclooctynes, hence releasing their content within living cells. Four cleavable micelles were developed to allow massive burst release of Entinostat, a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor, following their internalization inside cancer cells. A comparative study on the influence of the bioorthogonal&#8208;mediated versus passive drug release from micelles was carried out. The results indicated that a fast release of the drug triggered a stronger antiproliferative activity on tumor cells compared to the passive diffusion of the drug from the micelles core. These finding may be of great interest for the development of new nanomedicines.

A ribozyme capable of functioning at low Mg2+ concentrations catalyzes efficient template&#8208;directed ligation of RNA substrates inside a prebiotically plausible fatty acid protocell. Compartmentalized RNA assembly catalyzed by ribozymes is central to the viability of spontaneously evolving protocells.







Abstract
Demonstrating RNA catalysis within prebiotically relevant models of primordial cells (protocells) remains a challenge in origins of life research. Fatty acid vesicles encapsulating genomic and catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) are attractive models for protocells; however, RNA catalysis has largely been incompatible with fatty acid vesicles due to their instability in the presence of Mg2+ at the concentrations required for ribozyme function. Here, we report a ribozyme that catalyzes template&#8208;directed RNA ligation at low Mg2+ concentrations and thus remains active within stable vesicles. Ribose and adenine, both prebiotically relevant molecules, were found to greatly reduce Mg2+&#8208;induced RNA leakage from vesicles. When we co&#8208;encapsulated the ribozyme, substrate, and template within fatty acid vesicles, we observed efficient RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA ligation upon subsequent addition of Mg2+. Our work shows that RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA assembly can occur efficiently within prebiotically plausible fatty acid vesicles and represents a step toward the replication of primordial genomes within self&#8208;replicating protocells.

         <title>EnT&#8208;Mediated Amino&#8208;Sulfonylation of Alkenes with Bifunctional Sulfonamides: Access to &#946;&#8208;Amino Sulfone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benign method was developed for the economical and sustainable amino&#8208;sulfonylation of alkenes with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. This approach showed high functional group tolerance and compatibility, facilitating the late&#8208;stage modification of some bioactive alkenes and sulfonamide molecules, thereby expanding the biologically relevant chemical space. Mechanistic investigations suggest that an energy transfer (EnT) process was in operation.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Amino sulfones are commonly found structural motifs in biologically active compounds. Herein, we report a direct photocatalyzed amino&#8208;sulfonylation reaction of alkenes for the efficicient production of important compounds by simple hydrolysis without the need for additional oxidants and reductants. In this transformation, the sulfonamides worked as bifunctional reagents, simultaneously generating sulfonyl radicals and N&#8208;centered radicals which were added to alkene in a highly atom&#8208;economical fashion with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. This approach showed high functional group tolerance and compatibility, facilitating the late&#8208;stage modification of some bioactive alkenes and sulfonamide molecules, thereby expanding the biologically relevant chemical space. Scaling up this reaction led to an efficient green synthesis of apremilast, one of the best&#8208;selling pharmceuticals, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the applied method. Moreover, mechanistic investigations suggest that an energy transfer (EnT) process was in operation.

         <title>Photoinduced Minisci Reaction with Diazines: An Approach Toward Original Fused Heterocycles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoinduced Minisci reaction on diazines, starting from carboxylic acid is reported using 4CzIPN (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the photoinitiator. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yields (28 examples, 44&#8201;% to 89&#8201;%) under white LEDs irradiation with a slight excess of the acid reagent (1.2&#8197;equiv.) and the extension to continuous flow was demonstrated. Further cyclization reactions were developed to build up unprecedented N&#8208;heterocycles building blocks. A plausible radical chain mechanism was suggested.

         <title>Inversion of Diaza[5]Helicenes Through an N&#8722;N Bond Breaking Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diaza[5]helicenes with N&#8722;N linkages were found to racemize through the N&#8722;N bond&#8208;breaking pathway by kinetic experiments and DFT calculations. Modification of S to SO2 at the outer position of the helix reduced the electronic repulsion in the N&#8722;N bond, resulting in a significant increase in the inversion barrier.







Abstract
1,1&#8217;,10,10&#8217;&#8208;Biphenothiazine and its S,S,S&#8217;,S&#8217;&#8208;tetroxide are diaza[5]helicenes with N&#8722;N linkages. Kinetic experiments on racemization together with DFT calculations revealed that they undergo inversion through the N&#8722;N bond breaking pathway rather than the general conformational pathway. In these diaza[5]helicenes with this inversion mechanism, the reduction of electronic repulsion in the N&#8722;N bond by modification of S to SO2 at the outer position of the helix led to a significantly higher inversion barrier, 35.3&#8197;kcal/mol, compared to [5]helicene. 1,1&#8217;,10,10&#8217;&#8208;Biphenothiazine S,S,S&#8217;,S&#8217;&#8208;tetroxide was highly resistant to acid&#8208;mediated N&#8722;N bond breaking and racemization under acidic conditions.

A series of ambipolar molecular donor&#8208;acceptor dyads D5&#8208;D10 was synthesized and characterized allowing for the elaboration of valuable structure&#8208;property relationships, which were correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single&#8208;material organic solar cells, in which power conversion efficiencies of up to 4.3&#8201;% were reached.







Abstract
A series of ambipolar covalently linked oligothiophene&#8208;fullerene dyads have been synthesized by systematical structural variations. In this respect, the length of linker between donor and acceptor unit was altered and in a second series the terminal acceptor units in the donor unit of the dyads were varied. Characterization of the optical and redox properties gave valuable structure&#8208;property relationships and were correlated to the photovoltaic performance in single&#8208;material organic solar cells, in which power conversion efficiencies of up to 4.3&#8201;% were reached.

The blue dye indigo has historically been isolated from the plant family Indigofera and widely applied in the denim industry for producing blue jeans. The advantageous photochemical properties of indigo and its derivatives have now attracted the attention of the scientific community for their use as molecular photoswitches. In their review Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300981), C.&#8208;Y. Huang and S. Hecht detail the synthetic approaches to preparing indigos and discuss indigos&#8217; applications as photoresponsive molecular tools.

         <title>Front Cover: Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization for the Divergent Synthesis of Podophyllotoxin Derivatives by Rhodium Catalysis (Chem. Eur. J. 43/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed methodology leads to four kinds of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives starting from readily available podophyllotoxin in a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy. Some of them are found to show excellent anticancer activity. This direct C&#8722;H functionalization can be expressed the podophyllotoxin (roots of podophyllum species) being converted into derivatives (leaves) by rhodium catalysis. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Li, H. Liu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300960).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Indigo dye is one of the most iconic compounds connecting chemistry to our society. In addition to providing the characteristic blue color, indigos display fascinating photochemical properties. This Review first discusses the synthetic construction and derivatization of indigos. Then their photoswitching and photoinduced electron transfer behaviors are described to showcase the utility of indigos as photoresponsive molecular tools.







Abstract
Indigo, one of the most ancient and abundant dyes in human history, has recently emerged as a potential functional motif due to its intriguing photochemical properties. This review aims to provide insights into both the preparation of these molecules and their utilization in molecular systems. First, the synthesis of the indigo core as well as available methods to derivatize indigo are described to outline synthetic strategies to build the desired molecular structures. Then, the photochemical behavior of indigos is discussed, with particular focus on E&#8208;Z photoisomerization and photoinduced electron transfer. Connections between the molecular structures and their photochemical properties are highlighted and serve as guiding principles for designing indigos to be applied as photoresponsive tools.

         <title>Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity Based on Dibenzodioxin Linkage: Design, Synthesis, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 43, August 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) with dibenzodioxin linkage have been reviewed in terms of monomer design based on a wide range of rigid and contorted scaffolds, syntheses, properties, and their applications to understand the structure&#8208;property relationship, which is crucial for tailoring the properties.







Abstract
The development of polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) over the last two decades has established them as a distinct class of microporous materials, which combine the attributes of microporous solid materials and the soluble nature of glassy polymers. Due to their solubility in common organic solvents, PIMs are easily processable materials that potentially find application in membrane&#8208;based separation, catalysis, ion separation in electrochemical energy storage devices, sensing, etc. Dibenzodioxin linkage, Tr&#246;ger's base, and imide bond&#8208;forming reactions have widely been utilized for synthesis of a large number of PIMs. Among these linkages, however, most of the studies have been based on dibenzodioxin&#8208;based PIMs. Therefore, this review focuses precisely on dibenzodioxin linkage chemistry. Herein, the design principles of different rigid and contorted monomer scaffolds are discussed, as well as synthetic strategies of the polymers through dibenzodioxin&#8208;forming reactions including copolymerization and postsynthetic modifications, their characteristic properties and potential applications studied so far. Towards the end, the prospects of these materials are examined with respect to their utility in industrial purposes. Further, the structure&#8208;property correlation of dibenzodioxin PIMs is analyzed, which is essential for tailored synthesis and tunable properties of these PIMs and their molecular level engineering for enhanced performances making these materials suitable for commercial usage.

         <title>Schlenk&#8208;type Equilibria of Grignard&#8208;analogous Arylberyllium Complexes: Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of complex Schlenk equilibria is a central property of synthetically invaluable Grignard reagents substantially affecting their reactivity and selectivity in chemical transformations. In this work, we systematically studied the steric effects of aryl substituents on the Schlenk&#8208;type equilibria of their lighter congeners, arylberyllium bromides. Combination of diarylberyllium complexes Ar2Be(OEt2) (1Ar, Ar = Tip, Tcpp; Tip = 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H3, Tcpp = 2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3C6H3, Cyp = c&#8208;C5H9), containing sterically demanding aryl groups, and BeBr2(OEt2)2 (2) affords the Grignard&#8208;analogous arylberyllium bromides ArBeBr(OEt2) (3Ar, Ar = Tip, Tcpp). In contrast, Mes2Be(OEt2) (1Mes, Mes = 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H3) and 2 exist in a temperature&#8208;dependent equilibrium with MesBeBr(OEt2) (3Mes) and free OEt2. Ph2Be(OEt2) (1Ph) reacts with 2 to afford dimeric [PhBeBr(OEt2)]2 ([3Ph]2). Moreover, the influence of replacing the OEt2 donor by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, IPr2Me2 (IPr2Me2 = C(iPrNCMe)2), on the redistribution reactions was investigated. The solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state structures of the diarylberyllium and arylberyllium bromide complexes were comprehensively characterized using multinuclear (1H, 9Be, 13C) NMR spectroscopic methods and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, while DFT calculations were employed to support the experimental findings.</dc:description>

Combination of diarylberyllium complexes Ar2Be(OEt2) (1Ar, Ar = Tip, Tcpp; Tip = 2,4,6-iPr3C6H3, Tcpp = 2,4,6-Cyp3C6H3, Cyp = c-C5H9), containing sterically demanding aryl groups, and BeBr2(OEt2)2 (2) affords the Grignard-analogous arylberyllium bromides ArBeBr(OEt2) (3Ar, Ar = Tip, Tcpp). In contrast, Mes2Be(OEt2) (1Mes, Mes = 2,4,6-Me3C6H3) and 2 exist in a temperature-dependent equilibrium with MesBeBr(OEt2) (3Mes) and free OEt2. Ph2Be(OEt2) (1Ph) reacts with 2 to afford dimeric [PhBeBr(OEt2)]2 ([3Ph]2). Moreover, the influence of replacing the OEt2 donor by an N-heterocyclic carbene, IPr2Me2 (IPr2Me2 = C(iPrNCMe)2), on the redistribution reactions was investigated. The solution- and solid-state structures of the diarylberyllium and arylberyllium bromide complexes were comprehensively characterized using multinuclear (1H, 9Be, 13C) NMR spectroscopic methods and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, while DFT calculations were employed to support the experimental findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of Biological Activity of Ferrocene&#8208;Ispinesib Hybrids: Impact of a Ferrocenyl Group on the Antiproliferative and Kinesin Spindle Protein Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ferrocenyl&#8208; and adamantyl&#8208;ispinesib hybrids showing significantly higher anticancer activity than ispinesib were designed. The presence of an ispinesb core is responsible for KSP inhibitory activity, whereas bulky ferrocenyl and adamantyl substituents are responsible for increased ability to ROS generation and significantly increased G2/M phase cell arrest of the new compounds.







Abstract
With the aim to combine more than one biologically&#8208;active component in a single molecule, derivatives of ispinesib and its (S) analogue were prepared that featured ferrocenyl moieties or bulky organic substituents. Inspired by the strong kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitory activity of ispinesib, the compounds were investigated for their antiproliferative activity. Among these compounds, several derivatives demonstrated significantly higher antiproliferative activity than ispinesib with nanomolar IC50 values against cell lines. Further evaluation indicated that the antiproliferative activity is not directly correlated with their KSP inhibitory activity while docking suggested that several of the derivatives may bind in a manner similar to ispinesib. In order to investigate the mode of action further, cell cycle analysis and reactive oxygen species formation were investigated. The improved antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds may be assigned to synergic effects of various factors such as KSP inhibitory activity due to the ispinesib core and ability to generate ROS and induce mitotic arrest.

         <title>[(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; &#8211; An Unprecedented Molecular Fluoridobromate(V) Anion in Cs[Br3F16]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first fluoride&#8208;bridged oligonuclear Br(V) anion, [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722;, has been obtained in the compound Cs[Br3F16]. The lone pairs on the Br atoms are shown to be stereochemically active, which has never been observed before for fluoridobromates(V) but only for fluoridoiodates(V).







Abstract
The reaction of Cs[BrF6] with BrF5 gave the compound Cs[Br3F16] with the unprecedented propeller&#8208;shaped, C3&#8208;symmetric [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; anion. All other currently known fluoridobromates(V) contain only octahedral [BrF6]&#8722; anions, which, unlike the related [IF6]&#8722; anions, never exhibited stereochemical activity of the lone pair on the Br atoms. Despite the same coordination number of six for the Br atom in the [BrF6]&#8722; and [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; anions, the longer &#956;3&#8208;F&#8722;Br bonds provide additional space, allowing the lone pairs on the Br atoms to become stereochemically active. Cs[Br3F16] was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations for both the solid&#8208;state compound and the isolated anion at 0&#8197;K. Intrinsic bond orbital calculations show that the &#956;3&#8208;F&#8722;Br bond is essentially ionic in nature and also underpin the stereochemical activity of the lone pairs of the Br(V) atoms.

         <title>Manipulation of hierarchical chiral self&#8208;assembly and anion recognition by supramolecular systems of &#946;&#8208;glucopyranoside&#65292;Pillar[5]arenes, and Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical chiral structures have broad applications in optical devices, asymmetric catalysis, and biological systems. The delicate balance of various interactions are key to the self&#8208;assembly of chiral structures. Herein, a ternary co&#8208;assembly consisting of cationic pillar[5]arenes (P5As), anionic &#946;&#8208;glucopyranoside (&#946;GlcD / &#946;GlcL), and Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) were constructed. Through adjusting the stoichiometry of &#946;GlcD, the assemblies were effectively controlled to form hierarchical nano&#8208;leaf assemblies with twisted nanoribbons in a homochiral direction. The co&#8208;assemblies exhibit strong Cotton effects, and successfully induced the chirality of Anderson&#8208;type POMs. More interestingly, by changing the central metal in Anderson&#8208;type POMs (XMo6O243&#8208; (X = Cr, Al, and Ga)), even though the three clusters have the same numbers of charge and size, the hierarchical chirality of the related assemblies varied in the morphology of the assemblies and the Cotton effect in the CD spectra. Results in theoretical calculations and ITC titration indicates that the tiny difference in long&#8208;range electrostatic interaction would result in the anion recognition of POMs, modulated by &#946;GlcD through host&#8208;guest inclusion and hydrogen bonding in the assembly process.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Aided NO2 Discrimination with an Array of Graphene Chemiresistors Covalently Functionalized by Diazonium Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boosted by the emerging need for highly integrated gas sensors in IoT ecosystems, electronic noses (e&#8208;noses) are gaining interest for the detection of specific molecules over a background of interfering gases. The sensing of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is particularly relevant for applications in environmental monitoring and precision medicine. Here we present an easy and efficient functionalization procedure to covalently modify graphene layers, taking advantage of diazonium chemistry. Separate graphene layers were functionalised with one of three different aryl rings 4&#8208;nitrophenyl, 4&#8208;carboxyphenyl, and 4&#8208;bromophenyl). The distinct mod(ified graphene layers were assembled with a pristine layer into an e&#8208;nose for NO2 discrimination. A remarkable sensitivity to NO2 is demonstrated through exposures to gaseous solutions with NO2 concentrations in the 1&#8208;10 ppm range at room temperature. Then, the discrimination capability of the sensor array is tested by carrying out exposures to several interfering gases and analyzing the data through multivariate statistical analysis. This analysis shows that the e&#8208;nose can discriminate NO2 among all the interfering gases in a two&#8208;dimensional principal component analysis space. Finally, the e&#8208;nose is trained to accurately recognize NO2 contributions with a linear discriminant analysis approach, thus providing a metric for discrimination assessment with a prediction accuracy above 95%.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduced Tiara&#8208;like Palladium Complex for Suzuki Cross Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of highly active and structurally well&#8208;defined catalysts has become a crucial issue for heterogeneous catalysed reactions while reducing the amount of catalyst employed. Beside conventional synthetic routes, the employment of polynuclear transition metal complexes as catalysts or catalyst precursors has progressively intercepted a growing interest. These well&#8208;defined species promise to deliver catalytic systems where a strict control on the nuclearity allows to improve the catalytic performance while reducing the active phase loading. This study describes the development of a very active and reusable palladium&#8208;based catalyst on alumina (Pd8/Al2O3) for Suzuki cross coupling reactions. An octanuclear tiara&#8208;like palladium complex was selected as active phase precursor to give isolated Pd&#8208;clusters of ca. 1 nm in size on Al2O3. The catalyst was thoroughly characterised by several complementary techniques to assess its structural and chemical nature. The high specific activity of the catalyst has allowed to carry out the cross&#8208;coupling reaction in 30 minutes using only 0.12 mol% of Pd loading under very mild and green reaction conditions. Screening of various substrates and selectivity tests, combined with recycling and benchmarking experiments, have been used to highlight the great potentialities of this new Pd8/Al2O3 catalyst.</dc:description>

An octanuclear tiara-like palladium complex was selected as active phase precursor to give isolated Pd-clusters of ca. 1 nm in size on Al2O3. The catalyst was thoroughly characterised by several complementary techniques to assess its structural and chemical nature. The high specific activity of the catalyst has allowed to carry out the cross-coupling reaction in 30 minutes using only 0.12 mol% of Pd loading under very mild and green reaction conditions. Screening of various substrates and selectivity tests, combined with recycling and benchmarking experiments, have been used to highlight the great potentialities of this new Pd8/Al2O3 catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>(Bio)Functionalisation of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra via Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface chemistry of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs) is crucial to their physicochemical properties because it governs how they interact with external substances such as solvents, synthetic organic molecules, metal ions, and even biomolecules. Consequently, the advancement of synthetic methods that facilitate the incorporation of diverse functional groups onto MOP surfaces will significantly broaden the range of properties and potential applications for MOPs. Herein, we describe the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalysed, azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click reactions to post&#8208;synthetically modify the surface of alkyne&#8208;functionalised cuboctahedral MOPs. To this end, we synthesised a novel Rh(II)&#8208;based MOP with 24&#160;available surface alkyne groups. We have demonstrated that each of the 24 alkyne groups on the surface of our &#8220;clickable&#8221; Rh&#8208;MOP can be reacted with azide&#8208;containing molecules at room temperature, without compromising the integrity of the MOP. We exploited the wide substrate catalogue and orthogonal nature of CuAAC click chemistry to densely functionalise MOPs with diverse functional groups, including polymers, carboxylic and phosphonic acids, and even biotin moieties, which retained their recognition capabilities once anchored onto the surface of the MOP.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Inverted Ligand Field in the Electronic Structure and Reactivity of Octahedral Formal Platinum (IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum complexes are ubiquitous in chemistry and largely used as catalysts or as precursors in drug chemistry, thus a deep knowledge of their electronic properties may help in planning new synthetic strategies or exploring new potential applications. Herein, the electronic structure of many octahedral platinum complexes is drastically revised especially when they feature electronegative elements such as halogens and chalcogens. The investigation revealed that in most cases the five d platinum orbitals are invariably full, thus the empty antibonding orbitals, usually localized on the metal, are mainly centered on the ligands, suggesting a questionable assignment of formal oxidation state IV. The analysis supports the occurrence of the Inverted Ligand Field theory in all cases with the only exceptions of the Pt&#8208;F and Pt&#8208;O bonding. The trends for the molecular complexes are mirrored also by the Density of States plots of extended structures featuring octahedral platinum moieties in association with chalcogens atoms. Finally, the oxidative addition of a Se&#8208;Cl linkage to a square platinum complex to achieve an octahedral moiety has been revised in the framework of the Inverted Ligand Field.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl Substituted LnDOTA Chelates from Achiral Starting Materials by Deracemization Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Substituted derivatives of the DOTA framework are of general interest to alter chelate properties and facilitate conjugation of chelates to other molecular structures. However, the scope of substituents that can be introduced into the &#945;&#8208;position has traditionally been limited by the availability of a suitable enantiopure starting materials to facilitate a stereoselective synthesis. Tetra&#8208;substituted DOTA derivatives with phenyl and benzoate substituents in the &#945;&#8208;position were prepared. Initial syntheses used enantiopure starting materials but did not afford enantiopure products. This indicates that integrity of the stereocentres was not preserved during synthesis, despite the homo&#8208;chiral diastereoisomer being the major reaction product. The homochiral diastereoisomer could be produced as the major or sole reaction product when starting from racemic or even achiral materials. Deracemization was found to occur during chelation through formation of an enolate stabilized by the aryl substituent. This general ability of aryl groups to enable deracemization greatly increases the range of substituents that can be introduced into DOTA&#8208;type ligands with diastereochemical selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Activation with Manganese Tricarbonyl Complexes via an H&#8208;Atom Responsive Benzimidazole Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two manganese tricarbonyl complexes, MnI(HL)(CO)3Br (1a&#8208;Br) and MnI(MeL)(CO)3Br (1b&#8208;Br) (where HL = 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole; MeL = 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridy)benzimidazole) and assayed their electrocatalytic properties for CO2 reduction. A redox&#8208;active pyridine benzimidazole ancillary ligand in complex 1a&#8208;Br displayed unique hydrogen atom transfer ability to facilitate electrocatalytic CO2 conversion at a markedly lower reduction potential than that observed for 1b&#8208;Br.&#160; Notably, a one&#8208;electron reduction of 1a&#8208;Br yields a structurally characterized H&#8208;bonded binuclear Mn(I) adduct (2a&#8217;) rather than the typically observed Mn(0)&#8208;Mn(0) dimer, suggesting a novel method for CO2 activation. Combining advanced electrochemical, spectroscopic, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques, we demonstrate the use of an H&#8208;atom responsive ligand may reveal an alternative, low&#8208;energy pathway for CO2 activation by an earth&#8208;abundant metal complex catalyst.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fused&#8208;benzoheptagon&#8208;installed NiII porphyrins were synthesized by a protocol consisting of (2&#8208;formyl)arylation at the meso&#8208;position(s) of NiII porphyrins, conversion of formyl group to methoxyethene group by Wittig reaction, and final Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzedcyclization. The structures of these porphyrins have been revealed by X&#8208;ray analysis. Owing to the installed heptagon ring(s), these porphyrins show curved structures with conformational flexibility.

         <title>Iso&#8208;Pentadienyl Carbonate as a Five Carbon Synthon in Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Linear 1,3&#8208;Dienylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective linear 1,3&#8208;dienylations are essential transformations, and numerous synthetic efforts have been documented. However, a general method enabling access to electron&#8208;rich, electron&#8208;poor, and biologically relevant dienyl molecules is in high demand. Hence, we report a straightforward method of manganese(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H dienylation of arenes using iso&#8208;pentadienyl carbonate as a five carbon synthon. This is a highly unprecedented report for selective linear 1,3&#8208;dienylation using manganese C&#8208;H activation catalysis. Our method facilitates the synthesis of varieties of dienes, including those suitable for normal or inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, dienyl glycoconjugates, and unnatural amino acids. Extensive mechanistic studies, including isolation of C&#8208;H activated organo&#8208;manganese complex and isotopic analyses, have supported the proposed mechanism of this dienylation. The synthetic applicability of this method eased to deliver a 6/6/5&#8208;fused tricyclic nagilactone scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiroptical Recognition of Carboxylates with Charge&#8208;Neutral Double&#8208;Stranded Zinc(II) Helicates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality analysis of small molecules for the determination of their enantiopurity is nowadays ruled by streamlined chromatographic methods which utilize chiral stationary phases. Chiroptical probes which rely on host&#8208;guest interactions are so far overshadowed by the latter but have the benefit of depending only on common spectroscopic techniques such as CD spectroscopy to distinguish enantiomers and to quantify their ratio. Interest into this receptor&#8208;based approach is constantly rising because non&#8208;invasive high&#8208;throughput screenings with a minimal waste production can be performed. In this study we investigate the possibility to utilize metal&#8208;based containers in form of charge&#8208;neutral helicates able to recognize anions for this purpose. Key building block of the helicates are triazole units which show rotational freedom and give rise to either a meso&#8208;structure or a racemic mixture of the right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed complex. A chiroptical response of the probe is observed upon recognition of chiral mono&#8208; or dicarboxylates and chirality analysis of tartrate is conducted by CD spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Functionalized SWCNTs with a Dopamine Derivative as a Support for Pd Nanoparticles: A Recyclable Catalyst for the Reduction of Nitro Compounds and the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were functionalized with a dopamine derivative in which the amine group was converted to azide (dopamine azide). The direct reaction of SWCNTs and dopamine azide in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene at high temperature (160 &#176;C) led to very highly functionalized CNTs (&#8776;60 wt%). Surprisingly, despite this high degree of functionalization, Raman spectroscopy detected a low disruption of the &#960;&#8208;network of the carbonaceous support. This finding was justified by the rehybridization from sp3 to sp2 of the sidewall carbon atoms of CNTs involved in the functionalization process. Further characterization by means of different techniques such as X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allowed to shed some light on the chemical composition and morphology of the obtained material. Moreover, the estimation of the total content of phenolic units and their reducing potential after CNTs functionalization was also assessed using Folin and Ciocalteu and 2,2&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;picryl hydrazide (DPPH) assays. The functionalization of CNTs was exploited to immobilize palladium(II) species that were subsequently reduced with NaBH4 leading to the formation of Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The so obtained hybrid material was used as a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the reduction of nitro compounds and the Heck reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Erythronium Bonds: Noncovalent Interactions Involving Group 5 Elements as Electron Density Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database and theoretical calculations (PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level, atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules, natural bond orbital studies) prove the formation of net attractive noncovalent interactions between group 5 elements and electron&#8208;rich atoms (neutral or anionic). These bondings are markedly different from coordination bonds formed by the same elements and possess the distinctive features of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions. The term erythroniumbond is proposed to denote these bonds. X&#8208;ray structures of vanadate&#8208;dependent bromoperoxidases show these interactions are present also in biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Resolved Chiroptical Spectroscopies Emphasizing Recent Applications to Thin Films of Chiral Organic Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Instrumental techniques able to identify and structurally characterize the aggregation states in thin films of chiral organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials at different levels of hierarchy are very helpful for clarifying structure&#8208;property relationships. Microscopy techniques are widely used for the characterization of thin films morphology on the 10&#8211;100 nm scale or higher, while they can hardly provide insight into the supramolecular organization at the first level of hierarchy (1&#8208;10 nm). On the contrary, chiroptical spectroscopies typically provide relevant information about the &#64257;rst level of supramolecular organization at the nanometer scale with no spatial resolution. A solution is offered by combining chiroptical and microscopy techniques: spatially resolved chiroptical spectroscopies represent a promising tool for mapping and disentangling local supramolecular structures in thin films. In the present review we give an overview of all the techniques developed for spatially resolved chiroptical investigation of thin films of chiral organic dyes: electronic circular dichroism imaging (ECDi), circularly polarized luminescence imaging (CPLi), and vibrational circular dichroism imaging (VCDi).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A general and concise synthetic pathway for the preparation of four different 5,8&#8217;&#8208;coupled naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids, employing a specially developed nickel/N,N&#8208;ligand&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective Negishi coupling is reported. In the first reported direct atroposelective coupling of the fully substituted precursors, the naturally occurring cross&#8208;coupled products were generally obtained directly in reasonable yields and high optical purities. For the synthesis of the cross&#8208;coupling precursors, we employed a modification of Bringmann&#8217;s known approach to the dihydroisoquinoline compounds and a newly developed route for the naphthalene building blocks. For the latter 1,8&#8208;dioxynaphthalene precursors, our strategy utilized Hartwig&#8217;s borylation/methylation approach and included the efficient installation of orthogonal protecting groups.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this article, the enrichment of graphene and graphene oxide with free radicals through their functionalization with tyrosine is studied. In contrast with what is commonly observed in the functionalization of graphene with organic species the addition of tyrosine radicals on to the graphene substrate led to a remarkable increase of the aromatic character as indicated by the spectroscopic data. Similar behavior was observed for the functionalization of graphene oxide. In addition, a brief analysis of the tyrosine functionalized graphene with EPR spectroscopy showed a remarkable enhancement of the spin density that could be useful in spintronics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a novel visible&#8208;light photoredox strategy for the efficient dehydroxylative alkylation of a wide array of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives using diaryl boron radical. The reaction features readily accessible starting materials, broad substrate scope with excellent functionality tolerance. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) process is responsible for the C&#8208;O bond activation, which is promoted by the diaryl boron radical generated from bench&#8208;stable and commercially available tetraphenyl borate (NaBPh4).</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions for The Conformational Control of Urea</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual chalcogen&#8208;bonding interactions is proposed as a novel means for the conformational control of urea derivatives. The formation of a chalcogen&#8208;bonding interaction at both sides of the urea carbonyl group was unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as computational studies including&#160;non&#8208;covalent interaction (NCI) plot index analysis, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis, and&#160;natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis via DFT calculations. By virtue of this dual interaction, urea derivatives that bear chalcogen atoms (X = S and Se) adopt a planar structure via the carbonyl oxygen (O) with an X&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;X arrangement on the same side of the molecule. The rigidity of the conformational lock was evaluated using the molecular arrangement in the crystal and the rotational barrier of benzochalcogenophene ring, which indicated a stronger conformational lock in benzoselenophene than in benzothiophene urea derivatives. Furthermore, the acidity of the urea derivatives increases according to the Lewis&#8208;acidic properties of the chalcogen&#8208;bonding interactions, whereby benzoselenophene urea is more acidic than benzothiophene urea. Tweezer&#8208;shaped urea derivatives were prepared, and their stereostructure proved the viability of the conformational control for defining the location of the substituents on the urea framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum(IV)&#8208;Gold(I) Agents with Promising Anticancer Activity. Selected Studies in 2D and 3D Triple Negative Breast Cancer Models</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New heterometallic binuclear and trinuclear platinum(IV)&#8208;gold(I) compounds of the type [Pt(L)nCl2(OH){(OOC&#8208;4&#8208;C6H4&#8208;PPh2)AuCl}x] (L=NH3, n = 2; x = 1,2; L = diaminocyclohexane, DACH, n = 1; x = 2) are described. These compounds are cytotoxic and selective against a small panel of renal, bladder, ovarian and breast cancer cell lines. We selected a trinuclear PtAu2 compound containing the Pt(IV) core based on oxaliplatin, to further investigate its cell death pathway, cell and organelle uptake and anticancer effects against triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cell line. This compound induces apoptosis and accumulates mainly in the nucleus and mitochondria. It also exerts remarkable antimigratory and antiangiogenic properties, and has a potent cytotoxic effect against TNBC 3D spheroids. Trinuclear compounds do not seem to display relevant interactions with calf thymus (CT) DNA and plasmid (pBR322) even in the presence of reducing agents, but inhibit pro&#8208;angiogenic enzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in TNBC cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Stretched Central Double Bonds in Dialumene and Disilene by Amino Substituents: A Case of Lone Pair Repulsion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There have been remarkable advances in the syntheses and applications of groups 13 and 14 homonuclear ethene analogues. However, successes are largely limited to aryl&#8208; and/or silyl&#8208;substituted species. Analogues bearing two or more heteroatoms are still scarce. In this work, we employed the block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method at the density functional theory (DFT) level to study dialumene and disilene bearing two amino substituents whose optimal geometries exhibit significantly stretched central M=M (M = Al or Si) double bonds compared with aryl&#8208; and/or silyl&#8208;substituted species. Computational analyses showed that the repulsion between the lone electron pairs of amino substituents and M=M &#960; bond plays a critical role in the elongation of the M=M bonds. Evidently, replacing the substituent groups &#8208;NH2 with &#8208;BH2 can enhance the planarity and shorten the central double bonds due to the absence of lone pair electrons in BH2.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly scalable and inherently safer preparation of di, tri and tetra nitrate esters using continuous flow chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate esters are important organic compounds having wide application in energetic materials, medicines and fuel additives. They are synthesized through nitration of aliphatic polyols. But the process safety challenges associated with nitration reaction makes the production process complicated and economically unviable. Herein, we have developed a continuous flow process wherein polyol and nitric acid are reacted in a microreactor to produce nitrate ester continuously. Our developed process is inherently safe and efficient. The process was optimized for industrially important nitrate esters containing two, three and four nitro groups. Molecules include glycol dinitrates: 1,2&#8208;propylene glycol dinitrate (PGDN), ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), diethylene glycol dinitrate (DEGDN), triethylene glycol dinitrate (TEGDN); trinitrates: trimethylolethane trinitrate (TMETN), 1,2,4&#8208;butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN); tetranitrates: erythritol tetranitrate (ETN). The optimized process for each molecule provided yield &gt; 90% in a short residence time of 1 min corresponding to a space time yield of &gt; 18 g/h/mL of reactor volume.</dc:description>

         <title>Isocyanides as Catalytic Electron Acceptors in the Visible Light Promoted Oxidative Formation of Benzyl and Acyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent disclosure of the ability of aromatic isocyanides to harvest visible light and act as single electron acceptors when reacting with tertiary aromatic amines has triggered a renewed interest in their application to the development of green photoredox catalytic methodologies. Accordingly, the present work explores their ability to promote the generation of both alkyl and acyl radicals starting from radical precursors such as Hantzsch esters, potassium alkyltrifluoroborates, and &#945;&#8208;oxoacids. Mechanistic studies involving UV&#8208;visible absorption and fluorescence experiments, electrochemical measurements of the ground&#8208;state redox potentials along with computational calculations of both the ground&#8208; and the excited&#8208;state redox potentials of a set of nine different aromatic isocyanides provided key insights to promote a rationale design of a new generation of isocyanide&#8208;based organic photoredox catalysts. Importantly, the green potential of the investigated chemistry has been herein demonstrated by a direct and easy access to deuterium labeled compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments on Photochemical Synthesis of 1,n&#8208;Dicarbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls, having immense applications in the pharmaceutical industry owing to their fascinating attributes and biological activity, have been exploited as versatile building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. The recent advancement on assembly of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds via different photochemical modes of reaction has been documented in this review.







Abstract
1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls are one of the most fascinating chemical feedstocks finding abundant usage in the field of pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;Hetero[5]helicenes as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Triplet Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes have been synthesized by fusing BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene structures. All the fused compounds have helical structures and their twisting angles are also increased by substitutions at the boron centre. The BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes show superior optical properties and high singlet&#8208;oxygen generation capacities that increase proportionally with their twisting angle.







Abstract
Designing heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) is a challenge for the efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. Helicenes are twisted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) that is proportional to their twisting angle. But their difficult syntheses and weak absorption profile in the visible spectral region restrict their use as heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet PSs for PDT. On the other hand, boron&#8208;containing PAHs, BODIPYs are highly recognized for their outstanding optical properties. However, planar BODIPY dyes has low ISC and thus they are not very effective as PDT agents. We have designed and synthesized fused compounds containing both BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene structures to develop red&#8208;shifted chromophores with efficient ISC. One of the pyrrole units of the BODIPY core was also replaced by a thiazole unit to further enhance the triplet conversion. All the fused compounds have helical structure, and their twisting angles are also increased by substitutions at the boron centre. The helical structures of the BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT structure optimization. The designed BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes showed superior optical properties and high ISC with respect to [5]helicene. Interestingly their ISC efficiencies increase proportionally with their twisting angles. This is the first report on the relationship between the twisting angle and the ISC efficiency in twisted BODIPY&#8208;based compounds. Theoretical calculations showed that energy gap of the S1 and T1 states decreases in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene as compared to planar BODIPY. This enhances the ISC rate in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene, which is responsible for their high generation of singlet oxygen. Finally, their potential applications as PDT agents were investigated, and one BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene showed efficient cancer cell killing upon photo&#8208;exposure. This new design strategy will be very useful for the future development of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PDT agents.

         <title>Carbonylative Self&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Boronic Acids Using a Confined Pd Catalyst within Melamine Dendron and Fibrous Nano&#8208;Silica: A CO Surrogate Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A confined Pd/DN&#8208;DFNS as a heterogeneous catalyst is synthesized and used for the oxidative carbonylative synthesis of symmetric biaryl ketones from various aryl boronic acids using N&#8208;formyl saccharine as a C1 source. This catalytic system implies the recyclability of up to five consecutive cycles without loss of catalytic activity, is free of moisture&#8208;sensitive ligands and uses molecular oxygen as an oxidant and CuI as a co&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
Development of heterogeneous catalysts with tunable activity and selectivity has posed a persistent challenge. This study addresses this challenge by fabricating a hybrid environment through the combination of mesoporous silica and N&#8208;rich melamine dendron via covalent grafting, allowing for controllable growth and encapsulation of Pd NPs. This catalyst presented an excellent catalytic activity for the oxidative carbonylative self&#8208;coupling of aryl boronic acids to afford symmetric biaryl ketones using N&#8208;formyl saccharin as a sustainable solid CO source and Cu as a co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>DNA Windmill Probe for Multiplexed mRNA Detection and Cell Type Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Differences in the relative expression levels of cancer&#8208;related biomarker deliver key information about tumor progression. Herein, we developed a DNA windmill probe with four wind blades that could respond four mRNAs simultaneously and independently. The combination of four markers would present a superior picture for a particular cancer subtype, just like solving a jigsaw puzzle.







Abstract
Accurate cancer diagnosis especially early diagnosis is of great importance for prompt therapy and elevated survival rate. mRNAs are widely used as biomarkers for cancer identification and treatment. mRNA expression levels are highly associated with cancer stage and malignant progression. Nevertheless, single type mRNA detection is insufficient and unreliable. Herein, we developed a DNA nano&#8208;windmill probe for in&#8197;situ multiplexed mRNAs detection and imaging in this paper. The probe is designed to simultaneously target four types of mRNA through wind blades. Importantly, recognition of targets is independent from each other, which further facilitate cell type discrimination. The probe can specifically distinguish cancer cell lines from normal cells. In addition, it can identify changes in mRNA expression levels in living cells. The current strategy enriches the toolbox for improving the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and therapeutic solutions.

         <title>A Doubly Dissipative System Driven by Chemical and Radiative Stimuli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motions of an alkali cation from and to the crown&#8208;ether moieties of different ligands (up to three) is controlled over time and in a dissipative fashion by contextually employing two orthogonal stimuli, namely a radiative one and a chemical one. When the stimuli are no longer supplied, moving from out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium states, the system reversibly returns to its equilibrium state.







Abstract
The operation of a dissipative network composed of two or three different crown&#8208;ether receptors and an alkali metal cation can be temporally driven by the use (combined or not) of two orthogonal stimuli of a different nature. More specifically, irradiation with light at a proper wavelength and/or addition of an activated carboxylic acid, are used to modulate the binding capability of the above crown&#8208;ethers towards the metal ion, allowing to control over time the occupancy of the metal cation in the crown&#8208;ether moiety of a given ligand. Thus, application of either or both of the stimuli to an initially equilibrated system, where the metal cation is distributed among the crown&#8208;ether receptors depending on the different affinities, causes a programmable change in the receptor occupancies. Consequently, the system is induced to evolve to one or more out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium states with different distributions of the metal cation among the different receptors. When the fuel is exhausted or/and the irradiation interrupted, the system reversibly and autonomously goes back to the initial equilibrium state. Such results may contribute to the achievement of new dissipative systems that, taking advantage of multiple and orthogonal stimuli, are featured with more sophisticated operating mechanisms and time programmability.

         <title>Impact of Catalyst Deuteration on the Reactivity of Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cards for improvement. Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were synthesized and found to display improved reactivity compared to the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. The stability and catalytic performance were generally improved by deuteration, though the improvement was structure dependent. In particular, an unexpectedly large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated catalyst.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were prepared and found to show improved reactivity over the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. Two privileged C2&#8208;symmetric chiral binaphthyl&#8208;modified tetraalkylammonium salts were selected for this study. The stability of these phase&#8208;transfer catalysts was generally improved by site&#8208;specific deuteration, though the degree of improvement was structure dependent.

         <title>Development of Fluorescent Isocoumarin&#8208;Fused Oxacyclononyne &#8211; 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent pairs of isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkynes IC9O&#8208;COOMe and IC9O&#8208;CN/1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were developed. The basis for creating IC9O&#8208;EWG is understanding the reason for the S1 state deactivation mechanism for their non&#8208;fluorescent analog IC9O using multi&#8208;configurational ab initio and DFT methodologies and eliminating this deactivation pathway through rational design.







Abstract
Fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkynes, which are reactive in SPAAC and give fluorescent triazoles regardless of the azide nature, have been developed. The key structural feature that converts the non&#8208;fluorescent cycloalkyne/triazole pair to its fluorescent counterpart is the pi&#8208;acceptor group (COOMe, CN) at the C6 position of the isocoumarin ring. The design of the fluorescent cycloalkyne/triazole pairs is based on the theoretical study of the S1 state deactivation mechanism of the non&#8208;fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne IC9O using multi&#8208;configurational ab initio and DFT methodologies. The calculations revealed that deactivation proceeds through the electrocyclic ring opening of the &#945;&#8208;pyrone cycle and is accompanied by a redistribution of electron density in the fused benzene ring. We proposed that the S1 excited state deactivation barrier could be increased by introducing a pi&#8208;acceptor group into a position that is in direct conjugation with the formed C=O group and has a reduced electron density in the transition state. As a proof of concept, we designed and synthesized two fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkynes IC9O&#8208;COOMe and IC9O&#8208;CN bearing pi&#8208;acceptors at the C6 position. The importance of the nature of a pi&#8208;acceptor group was shown by the example of much less fluorescent CF3&#8208;substituted cycloalkyne IC9O&#8208;CF3.

A game&#8208;changing generation of new protease assay substrates have been developed by using the nitrobenzofurazane (NBD) fluorophore. With applications across different protease classes, this breakthrough promises to decisively improve fluorometric assays in protease drug discovery.







Abstract
Fluorometric assays are one of the most frequently used methods in medicinal chemistry. Over the last 50&#8197;years, the reporter molecules for the detection of protease activity have evolved from first&#8208;generation colorimetric p&#8208;nitroanilides, through FRET substrates, and 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methyl coumarin (AMC)&#8208;based substrates. The aim of further substrate development is to increase sensitivity and reduce vulnerability to assay interferences. Herein, we describe a new generation of substrates for protease assays based on 7&#8208;nitrobenz&#8208;2&#8208;oxa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;amides (NBD&#8208;amides). In this study, we synthesized and tested substrates for 10 different proteases from the serine&#8208;, cysteine&#8208;, and metalloprotease classes. Enzyme&#8208; and substrate&#8208;specific parameters as well as the inhibitory activity of literature&#8208;known inhibitors confirmed their suitability for application in fluorometric assays. Hence, we were able to present NBD&#8208;based alternatives for common protease substrates. In conclusion, these NBD substrates are not only less susceptible to common assay interference, but they are also able to replace FRET&#8208;based substrates with the requirement of a prime site amino acid residue.

Abstract
Cascade aza&#8208;Piancatelli reaction and [3+3]/[4+2] cycloaddition reactions are carried out using the ideality principles of pot, atom, and step economy (PASE) synthesis.

Platinum&#8208;based bioprobes! The cationic in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated Ag(I)&#8211;thiocholine coordination polyelectrolytes were shown to induce the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of anionic alkynylplatinum(II) bzimpy complexes via Pt(II)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt(II), electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions to give low&#8208;energy red luminescence. By modulation of the self&#8208;assembly of the ensemble, new sensing strategies towards hydrogen peroxide and glucose were demonstrated.







Abstract
A new sensing strategy towards hydrogen peroxide based on metal coordination polyelectrolyte&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of alkynylplatinum(II) 2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;yl)pyridine (bzimpy) complex was demonstrated. The cationic in&#8197;situ&#8208;generated Ag(I)&#8211;thiocholine coordination polyelectrolytes were shown to induce the supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of anionic low&#8208;energy red&#8208;emissive alkynylplatinum(II) bzimpy complexes via non&#8208;covalent Pt(II)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt(II), electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The presence of hydrogen peroxide was shown to inhibit the formation of coordination polyelectrolytes and the coordination polyelectrolyte&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of platinum(II) complexes. The weakening of Pt(II)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt(II), electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions was supported by UV&#8208;vis absorption, emission, and resonance light scattering (RLS) studies. The present assay was also applied to probe glucose indirectly based on the enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidase on the substrate. Operating in a label&#8208;free manner, together with the low&#8208;energy red emission and large Stokes shift of alkynylplatinum(II) complexes, these features render the proposed design attractive for biological applications.

The cationic &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt;-generated Ag(I)&#8211;thiocholine coordination polyelectrolytes were shown to induce the supramolecular self-assembly of anionic low-energy red-emissive alkynylplatinum(II) bzimpy complexes &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; non-covalent Pt(II)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt(II), electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. The presence of hydrogen peroxide was shown to inhibit the formation of coordination polyelectrolytes and the coordination polyelectrolyte-induced self-assembly of platinum(II) complexes. The weakening of Pt(II)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt(II), electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions was supported by UV-vis absorption, emission, and resonance light scattering (RLS) studies. The present assay was also applied to probe glucose indirectly based on the enzymatic reaction of glucose oxidase on the substrate. Operating in a label-free manner, together with the low-energy red emission and large Stokes shift of alkynylplatinum(II) complexes, these features render the proposed design attractive for biological applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Co&#8208;Initiators via Base Catalysed Sequential Conjugate Addition: Application in Photoinduced Radical Polymerisation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Applications of photochemistry are becoming very popular in modern&#8208;day life due to its operational simplicity, environmentally friendly and economically sustainable nature in comparison to its thermochemistry. In particular photoinduced radical polymerisation (PRP) reaction is finding more biological applications and especially in the areas of dental restoration process, tissue engineering and artificial bone generation. Type&#8208;II photoinitiator and co&#8208;initiator promoted PRP turned out to be a cost effective protocol, and herein we report the design and synthesis of a new efficient co&#8208;initiator for PRP reaction via barrierless sequential conjugate addition reaction. Experimental mechanistic observations were further complemented by computational data. Time for newly synthesised 1,2&#8208;benzenedithiol (DTH) based co&#8208;initiator promoted polymerisation of diurethane dimethacrylate (UDMA, 70%) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA, 30%) in presence of 450 nm LED (15 W) under the aerobic conditions was 38 seconds. High glass transition temperature, improved mechanical strength (860 BHN) and longer in&#8208;depth polymerisation (3 cm) was observed.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160;Plant&#160;Dye for Photocatalytic Methane Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysis has emerged as a promising approach for aerobic methane (CH4) oxidation, but most current photocatalysts rely on metal centers. On the other hand, the excited states of many cost&#8208;effective organic photosensitizers have short lifetimes, which limits their interaction with CH4 for the reaction to occur. To overcome this, we utilized a pre&#8208;associated dye&#8208;Cl&#8208; complex with a short&#8208;lived excited state to efficiently generate active radical for CH4 conversion. By using an organic plant dye, alizarin (AQ), together with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and Cl&#8208;, we selectively converted CH4 to methyl (CH3TFA) and methylene ditrifluoroacetate (CH2(TFA)2) using molecular oxygen (O2) as the oxidant and visible light of 420 nm. This study demonstrates the potential of using affordable organic dyes and halide supramolecular chemistry for scalable CH4 photo&#8208;conversion, opening up exciting avenues for future research.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Molecular Persistent Room Temperature Phosphorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Binaphthol Decorated Optically Innocent Cyclotriphosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) features of BINOL&#8208;decorated cyclotriphosphazenes are reported for the very first time. The luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of these compounds in chloroform solutions and 1 % polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix are found to be 1.0 x 10&#8208;3, and 2.9 x 10&#8208;3, respectively. However, no CPL signal is observed for the pristine solids. The enantiomers (R/S) show ultraviolet photoluminescence (~ 350&#8208;360 nm) in solution and solid state. These compounds show ~ 10 times larger absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) than the simple BINOLs in the solutions state. In solid&#8208;state, cyclophosphazene&#8208;(R) shows larger PLQY than binaphthol&#8208;(R); in contrast, (S)&#8208;enantiomer shows lower PLQY than binaphthol&#8208;(S), which indicates that the isomer&#8208;dependent solid&#8208;state packing of these compounds plays a crucial role in controlling the PL. Thin films with more than 1 % doping concentration and pristine solids of these compounds do not show persistent room temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) due to concentration&#8208;caused quenching. However, thin films (1 % PMMA) of these chiral emitters exhibit pRTP characteristics with a lifetime of ~ 159&#8208;343 ms under vacuum. Detailed theoretical calculations reveal that the cyclophosphazene acts as an optically innocent dendritic core, and the optical features of these compounds are dictated by the pendent BINOL chromophore.</dc:description>

         <title>Milling Media&#8208;Free Suzuki Coupling by Direct Mechanocatalysis&#8208; From Mixer Mills to Resonant Acoustic Mixers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe the development of a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective approach for catalytic cross&#8208;coupling reactions in mechanochemistry. It is found that the substrate's impact with the vessel wall alone is sufficient to initiate the reaction, indicating that milling balls function primarily as a mixing agent for the direct mechanocatalytic Suzuki coupling. The absence of milling balls can be offset by adjusting the rheology using liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG). The LAG&#8208;sweet spot of 0.25 &#956;l/mg is confirmed for both resonance acoustic mixer (RAM) and ball&#8208;free mixer mills and is higher than in the presence of milling balls. The RAM exhibits excellent performance in the Suzuki reaction, achieving yields of 90% after 60 minutes and complete conversion after 90 minutes. The longevity of the milling vessel is significantly improved in the RAM, allowing for at least 20 reactions without deterioration.</dc:description>

         <title>2H&#8208;Phosphindole&#8208;Enabled Dearomatization and [4+2] Cycloaddition of (Hetero)Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heavier main group multiple bonds offer an effective tool for small molecule activation. Transient 2H&#8208;phosphinidole working as a reactive phosphadiene system undergoes phospha&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with a wide range of non&#8208;activated aromatic carbocycles and heterocycles, including naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, furan, thiophene, pyrrole, pyridine, and benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles, affording concise access to a range of polycyclic fused rings feature with phosphorus at the bridgehead. These results demonstrate that non&#8208;activated (hetero)arenes are capable of acting as 2&#960; systems in [4+2] cycloaddition with highly reactive 2H&#8208;phosphindole complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Photodynamic Activity of Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrins with and without Acetyl Protecting Groups on Cancer and Normal Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acetylated 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin&#8208;&#955;&#8208;carrageenan complex had more selective intracellular uptakes and photodynamic activity of cancer cells toward normal cells than the 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin&#8208;&#955;&#8208;carrageenan complex.

Tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (1) and tetrakis(4&#8208;acetamidophenyl)porphyrin (2) were dissolved in water with the incorporation of a polysaccharide (&#955;&#8208;carrageenan (CGN)) as a water&#8208;solubilizing agent. Although the photodynamic activity of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was considerably lower than that of the CGN&#8208;1 complex, the selectivity index (SI; IC50 in a normal cell/IC50 in a cancer cell) of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was considerably higher than that of the CGN&#8208;1 complex. This is because the photodynamic activity of the CGN&#8208;2 complex was significantly affected by the intracellular uptakes by the normal and cancer cells. During in&#8197;vivo experiments, the CGN&#8208;2 complex inhibited tumor growth under light irradiation with high blood retention compared with the CGN&#8208;1 complex and Photofrin, which exhibited lower blood retention. This study showed that the photodynamic activity and SI are influenced by substituent groups of arene in the meso&#8208;positions of porphyrin analogs.

         <title>Molecular Editing Enhances Oxidation Resistance of Menaquinone&#8208;Targeting Antibiotics Lysocin E and WAP&#8208;8294A2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the oxidative stability of antibiotic lysocin E and WAP&#8208;8294A2, we replaced the indole ring of their tryptophan residues with the benzofuran, benzothiophene, and 1&#8208;naphthalene rings. The synthetic 1&#8208;naphthalene analogues not only retained the original antibacterial activities, but also exhibited higher resistance to oxidation by peroxyl radicals.







Abstract
Lysocin E (1&#8201;a) and WAP&#8208;8294A2 (2&#8201;a) are peptidic natural products with 37&#8208; and 40&#8208;membered macrocycles, respectively. Compounds 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a have potent antibacterial activities against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria and share a unique mode of action. The electron&#8208;rich indole ring of d&#8208;Trp&#8208;10 of 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a interacts with the electron&#8208;deficient benzoquinone ring of menaquinone, which is a co&#8208;enzyme in the bacterial respiratory chain. Formation of the electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex causes membrane disruption, leading to cell death. Despite the promising activities of 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a, the susceptibility of Trp&#8208;10 to oxidative degradation potentially deters the development of these compounds as antibacterial drugs. To address this issue, we replaced the indole ring with more oxidation&#8208;resistant aromatics having a similar shape and electron&#8208;rich character. Specifically, analogues with benzofuran (1&#8201;b/2&#8201;b), benzothiophene (1&#8201;c/2&#8201;c), and 1&#8208;naphthalene (1&#8201;d/2&#8201;d) rings were designed, and chemically prepared by full solid&#8208;phase total syntheses. Antibacterial assays of the six analogues revealed similar activities of 1&#8201;d/2&#8201;d and markedly reduced activities of 1&#8201;b/2&#8201;b and 1&#8201;c/2&#8201;c compared with 1&#8201;a/2&#8201;a. Equipotent 1&#8201;d and 2&#8201;d both showed high resistance to oxidation by peroxyl radicals. Hence, the present study demonstrates a new molecular editing strategy for conferring oxidation stability on natural products with pharmacologically useful functions.

         <title>Photocatalyzed (3+2) Cycloaddition for the Dearomatization of Electron&#8208;Poor Arenes under Flow Conditions</title>

The photocatalyzed reaction between various electron&#8208;deficient aromatic compounds and a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide is successfully performed in a flow system.







Abstract
The photocatalyzed dearomative reaction between various electron&#8208;deficient aromatic compounds and a non&#8208;stabilized azomethine ylide is successfully performed in a flow system. Whereas the use of supported eosin as organic photocatalyst exhibits limited efficiency, turning to the soluble Rose Bengal allows to transform a broad range of substrates from hetarenes (indole, benzofuran, quinoline, pyridine) to naphthalenes and benzenes. This photocatalyzed (3+2) dearomative cycloaddition under green light irradiation provides a simple and efficient access to tridimensional pyrrolidino scaffolds with a tetrasubstituted carbon center at ring junction and can be performed in the friendly ethyl acetate. Computational studies support the mechanism involving azomethine ylide as reactive species toward the electron&#8208;poor arene.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Supported Metallocene for Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A more polished polyethylene: Covalent organic framework (COF) particles with hydroxy groups and well&#8208;defined micropores were synthesized and used as a novel carrier to load metallocene. The resulting supported catalyst, with a high specific surface area, demonstrated higher catalytic activity and better thermal tolerance during ethylene polymerization. It produced polyethylene with a higher molecular weight, increased crystallinity, and highly improved mechanical properties.







Abstract
The loading of homogeneous catalysts with support can dramatically improve their performance in olefin polymerization. However, the challenge lies in the development of supported catalysts with well&#8208;defined pore structures and good compatibility to achieve high catalytic activity and product performance. Herein, we report the use of an emergent class of porous material&#8212;covalent organic framework material (COF) as a carrier to support metallocene catalyst&#8212;Cp2ZrCl2 for ethylene polymerization. The COF&#8208;supported catalyst demonstrates a higher catalytic activity of 31.1&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at 140&#8201;&#176;C, compared with 11.2&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for the homogenous one. The resulting polyethylene (PE) products possess higher weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) and narrower molecular weight distribution (&#208;) after COF supporting, that is, Mw increases from 160 to 308&#8197;kDa and &#208; drops from 3.3 to 2.2. The melting point (Tm) is also increased by up to 5.2&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the PE product possesses a characteristic filamentous microstructure and demonstrates an increased tensile strength from 19.0 to 30.7&#8197;MPa and elongation at break from 350 to 1400&#8201;% after catalyst loading. We believe that the use of COF carriers will facilitate the future development of supported catalysts for highly efficient olefin polymerization and high&#8208;performance polyolefins.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The shiny diamond-like object&lt;/b&gt; represents the reported TPE-AQ crystal, with the crystal formation process from the TPE-AQ molecule illustrated in the top-left corner. The feather demonstrates the ultrahigh pressure sensitivity of TPE-AQ (&#8764;60&#8197;kPa, which is a state-of-the-art performance), and the emitted colorful light represents the crystal's unique piezochromic properties.

         <title>Supramolecular Chirogenesis in a Sterically Hindered Porphyrin: A Critical Theoretical Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) is widely used to determine chirality especially by employing porphyrins as reporter chromophores. The artwork, designed by Natalja Jemikova, shows a supramolecular complex of a porphyrin with two chiral guest molecules being irradiated to measure ECD and UV&#8208;Vis spectra. However, the electronic mechanism of induced ECD in the porphyrin has yet to be comprehensively rationalized, and computational chemistry can be successfully applied for this purpose. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Osadchuk, M.&#8197;O. Senge and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301408).

         <title>Nucleophile&#8208;Triggered &#960;&#8208;Topological Transformation: a New Synthetic Approach to Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Rhodamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a&#160;&#960;&#8208;topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method for the preparation of a new type of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive rhodamine dye called Polymethine&#8208;embedded Rhodamine Fluorophore (PeR Fluor). In contrast to conventional NIR&#8208;emissive dyes that require tedious synthetic steps and/or a high cost, linear fully&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated&#160;PeR Fluor&#160;can be regioselectively prepared in one step by mixing different nucleophiles with ABPXs, a family of rhodamines with a cross&#8208;conjugated structure.&#160;PeR Fluor&#160;exhibits bright NIR fluorescence emission and high photostability owing to the cooperative&#160;&#960;&#8208;electron system of rhodamines and polymethine scaffolds. Large bathochromic shifts of the absorption and fluorescence emission maxima can be achieved by modifying the&#160;N&#8208;substituted group to obtain NIR&#8208;absorbing/emitting&#160;PeR Fluor. We also demonstrate the stimulus&#8208;responsive functionality of&#160;PeR Fluor&#160;through the addition of chemicals (acid/base), which shows switchable NIR and visible fluorescence response. Our&#160;&#960;&#8208;topological transformation&#8208;based synthetic method is a promising approach to produce new functionalized rhodamine dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>A bifunctional coordination&#8208;chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework for quantitative enantioselective sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective sensing is highly crucial and challenging due to the highly similar physical/chemical properties of enantiomers which may have different chemical impact on organism. Luminescent coordination compounds have attracted great attention as sensing materials based on their controllable chemical and electric structures that can be highly matched with the targeted species. To achieve high&#8208;performance enantioselective sensing, the direct synthesis of chiral and luminescent bifunctional coordination compounds is a rational way but highly challenging due to the price and synthesis difficulty. Herein, an anionic coordination&#8208;chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework was applied as a host to accommodate chiral and luminescent centers via a facile cation exchange reaction, affording a bifunctional framework that possesses enantioselective sensing properties for the mixture of enantiomers. This study paves a pathway for constructing multifunctional coordination chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks for rapidly enantioselective sensing function.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkyl Chains Modulated Magnetization Dynamics of Mononuclear Trigonal Prismatic CoII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four benzeneboron&#8208;capped mononuclear CoII complexes with different alkyl substitutions on the fourth position of phenylboronic acid were obtained. The CoII ions are all wrapped by the pocket&#8208;like ligands and located in trigonal prismatic coordination geometries. Alternating&#8208;current magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that they show different magnetization dynamics, such as distinct relaxation rates at the same temperature, the faster QTM rates for the ethyl and propyl substituted complexes, as well as different relaxation processes. Magneto&#8208;structural correlation study reveals that the various deviations of coordination geometry of CoII ion, diverse crystal packings and possible different vibration modes of substituents caused by modifying alkyl chains are the key factors affecting the magnetization dynamics. This work demonstrates that the alkyl chains even locating far away from the metal center can have a large impact on the magnetic behavior of the CoII complex with a very rigid coordination geometry, offering a new perspective towards transition metal based single&#8208;molecule magnets.</dc:description>

         <title>Emissive Click Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of cofacial organic cage molecules containing aggregation&#8208;induced emissive (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) through four&#8208;fold Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) &#8220;click&#8221; reactions. The shorter AIEgen tetraphenylethylene (TPE) afforded two orientational isomers. The longer building blocks of tetrabiphenylethylene (TBPE) afforded a single isomer. The click reaction employed is irreversible, yet it yields remarkable four&#8208;fold click products above 40%. The phenyl rings around the ethylene core generate propeller&#8208;shaped chirality owing to their orientation, which influences the chirality of the resulting cages. The shorter cages are a mixture of PP/MM isomers, while the longer ones are a mixture of PM/MP isomers, at least in the solid state. The newly synthesized cage molecules were emissive even in dilute solutions (THF) and exhibited enhanced AIE upon the addition of water. Upon aggregation in aqueous solution, the organic cage molecules exhibit turn&#8208;off emission sensing of nitroaromatic explosives with selectivity for picric acid in 25&#8208;38 nanomolar detection range.</dc:description>

The phenyl rings around the ethylene core generate propeller-shaped chirality owing to their orientation, which influences the chirality of the resulting cages. The shorter cages are a mixture of PP/MM isomers, while the longer ones are a mixture of PM/MP isomers, at least in the solid state. The newly synthesized cage molecules were emissive even in dilute solutions (THF) and exhibited enhanced AIE upon the addition of water. Upon aggregation in aqueous solution, the organic cage molecules exhibit turn-off emission sensing of nitroaromatic explosives with selectivity for picric acid in 25-38 nanomolar detection range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reconsidering the Structures of C2Al4&#8722; and C2Al5&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of C2Al4&#8722;/0 and C2Al5&#8722;/0 was conducted using anion photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. Our findings reveal that C2Al4&#8722; has a boat&#8208;like structure, with a single C2 unit surrounded by four aluminum atoms. In contrast, the neutral C2Al4 species adopts a D2h planar structure with two planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) units, consistent with previous reports. Furthermore, the global minimum isomer of C2Al5&#8722; adopts a D3h symmetry, where the C2 unit interacts with five aluminum atoms. We also found that a lower symmetry structure of C2Al5&#8722;, where all five aluminum atoms are located on the same side of the C2 unit, albeit slightly higher in energy compared to the D3h structure. Our computations show that the D3h structure of C2Al5&#8722; is highly stable, exhibiting a large HOMO&#8722;LUMO gap.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Morphological Features, Aspect Ratio and Emission Patterns of Supramolecular Copolymers by Restricted Dimensional Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the bottlenecks associated with supramolecular polymerization of functional pi&#8208;systems is the spontaneous assembly of monomers leading to one&#8208; or two&#8208;dimensional (1D or 2D) polymers without control over chain length and optical properties. In the case of supramolecular copolymerization of monomers that are structurally too diverse, preferential self&#8208;sorting occurs unless they are closely interacting donor&#8208;acceptor pairs. Herein, we establish that the spontaneous 1D polymerization of a phenyleneethynylene (PE) derivative and the 2D polymerization of a Bodipy derivative (BODIPY) can be controlled by copolymerizing them in different ratios, leading to unusual spindle&#8208;shaped structures with controlled aspect ratio, as evident by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies. For example, when the content of BODIPY is 50% in the BODIPY&#8208;PE mixture, the 1D polymerization of PE is significantly restricted to form elongated spindle&#8208;like structures having an aspect ratio of 4&#8208;6. The addition of 75% of BODIPY to PE resulted in circular spindles having an aspect ratio of 1&#8208;2.5, thereby completely restricting the 1D polymerization of PE monomers. Moreover, the resultant supramolecular copolymers exhibited morphology and aspect ratio dependent emission features as observed by the time&#8208;resolved emission studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Diverse Reactions of Formazanate/Formazan with Tetrylenes: Reduction, C&#8211;H Bond Activation, Substitution and Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of the formazanate potassium salt [LtBuK(thf) (LtBu = PhNNC(4&#8208;tBuPh)NNPh) with the group 14 chlorotetrylenes [{PhC(tBuN)2}ECl] (E = Si, Ge, Sn) was investigated. Three corresponding compounds with unique configurations were formed, demonstrating the diverse reactivity of the system. In addition to the anticipated salt metathesis reactions of the potassium salt with the chlorine function of tetrylenes, unexpected reduction/insertion steps into the N=N bond of the formazanate (Si, Ge) and subsequent C&#8722;H activation (Ge) were also observed. Furthermore, when the neutral formazan ligand [LtBuH] was exposed to silylenes [{PhC(tBuN)2}SiCl] and [LPhSiNMePy], substitution and addition reactions occurred. These discoveries significantly enrich the diversity of formazanate/formazan redox chemistry, opening up new avenues for exploration in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneous decoration of Ultrasmall Pt Nanoparticles on size&#8208;separated MoS2 nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid exfoliation can be considered as a viable approach for scalable production of 2D materials due to its various benefits, although the polydispersity in the obtained nanosheet size hinders their straightforward incorporation. Size&#8208;separation can help alleviate these concerns, however a correlation between nanosheet size and property needs to be established to bring about size&#8208;specific applicability. Herein, size&#8208;selected aqueous nanosheet dispersions have been obtained via centrifugation&#8208;based protocols, and their chemical activity in the spontaneous reduction of chloroplatinic acid is investigated. Growth of ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles was achieved on nanosheet surfaces without a need for reducing agents, and stark differences in the nanoparticle coverage were observed as a function of nanosheet size. Defects in the nanosheets were probed via Raman spectroscopy, and correlated to the observed size&#8208;activity. Additionally, the effect of reaction temperature during synthesis was investigated. The electrochemical activity of the ultrasmall Pt nanoparticle decorated MoS2 nanosheets was evaluated for hydrogen evolution reaction, and enhancement in performance was observed with nanosheet size, and nanoparticle decoration density. These findings shine light on the significance of nanosheet size in controlling spontaneous reduction reactions, and provide a deeper insight to intrinsic properties of liquid exfoliated nanosheets.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes are key structural features found in a wide range of biologically active natural products, drugs, and agrochemicals. The synthesis of these derivatives has made significant progress since 2010, with some novel, efficient, and green methods developed using various transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic systems from acyclic or cyclic substrates.







Abstract
3&#8208;Azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes are an important class of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles that have been found to be key structural features in a wide range of biologically active natural products, drugs, and agrochemicals. As a cutting&#8208;edge area, the synthesis of these derivatives has made spectacular progress in recent decades, with various transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic systems being developed. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in the efficient methods for the synthesis of 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane derivatives since 2010, emphasizing the scope of substrates and synthesis&#8217; applications, as well as the mechanisms of these reactions.

         <title>Formal Synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Salvinorin A via Gold(I) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Salvinorin A, a neo clerodane diterpenoid natural product and &#956;&#8208;opioid receptor agonist, is being reported utilizing a double application of gold(I) methodology as a Lewis acid and a photoredox catalyst.







Abstract
The formal synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;salvinorin A is presented. Our approach utilizes two distinct gold(I) catalytic processes. The combination of a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction with an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction followed by a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed photoredox reaction generated in eight steps the framework of the natural product with high diastereoselectivity.

         <title>Squaramide&#8208;Based Heteroditopic [2]Rotaxanes for Sodium Halide Ion&#8208;Pair Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rotaxane! Utilizing the Lewis basic carbonyl moieties of the squaramide motif, a series of squaramide&#8208;containing heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are synthesized via sodium&#8208;cation templation. 1H&#8197;NMR binding studies reveal the bromide and iodide recognition capabilities of these heteroditopic receptors are significantly enhanced by up to ca. 20&#8208;fold in the presence of co&#8208;bound sodium cations, highlighting the unique ambidentate ion&#8208;pair binding nature of squaramides.







Abstract
A series of squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes consisting of isophthalamide macrocycle and squaramide axle components are synthesized using an alkali metal cation template&#8208;directed stoppering methodology. This work highlights the unprecedented sodium cation template coordination of the Lewis basic squaramide carbonyls for interlocked structure synthesis. Extensive quantitative 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic anion and ion&#8208;pair recognition studies reveal the [2]rotaxane hosts are capable of cooperative sodium halide ion&#8208;pair mechanical bond axle&#8208;macrocycle component recognition, eliciting up to 20&#8208;fold enhancements in binding strengths for bromide and iodide, wherein the Lewis basic carbonyls and Lewis acidic NH hydrogen bond donors of the squaramide axle motif operate as cation and anion receptive sites simultaneously in an ambidentate fashion. Notably, varying the length and nature of the polyether cation binding unit of the macrocycle component dramatically influences the ion&#8208;pair binding affinities of the [2]rotaxanes, even overcoming direct contact NaCl ion&#8208;pair binding modes in polar organic solvents. Furthermore, the cooperative ion&#8208;pair binding properties of the squaramide&#8208;based heteroditopic [2]rotaxanes are exploited to successfully extract solid sodium halide salts into organic media.

         <title>2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biquinoline&#8208;Based Recyclable Electroauxiliaries for the Generation of Alkyl Radicals via C&#8722;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biquinoline&#8208;based electroauxiliaries have successfully been developed as suitable reagents for the site&#8208;selective generation of alkyl radicals. Primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals could be generated and several free radical reactions could be studied. The platform has the advantage of recyclability, which makes these alkyl radical precursors superior compared to previous N&#8208;heterocyclic electroauxiliaries.







Abstract
Alkyl radical precursors are essential for a wide variety of photocatalytic and 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C bond forming reactions. Neutral organic heterocycles as electroauxiliaries such as 4&#8208;alkyl Hantzsch esters have become reliable tools for alkyl radical formation. Here we show that 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biquinoline&#8208;derived alkyl&#8208;substituted dihydroquinolines act as competent radical precursors with the ability to form primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl radicals. Hydroalkylation of benzalmalononitriles and N&#8208;Boc protected diazenes has been achieved through copper catalysis under mild conditions of 50&#8201;&#176;C with good to very good yields of up to 85&#8201;%. Furthermore, the dihydroquinolines&#8217; reactivity towards a denitrative alkylation of nitroolefins such as &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene was discovered. Most importantly, the released biquinoline can be recycled, which greatly improves the overall atom&#8208;economy of these alkyl radical precursors in comparison to previous N&#8208;heterocyclic electroauxiliaries.

         <title>Mono&#8208; and Difluorinated Saturated Heterocyclic Amines for Drug Discovery: Systematic Study of Their Physicochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mono&#8208; and difluorination of azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine reduces basicity (pKa) and modulates lipophilicity (LogP) while retaining metabolic stability (CLint) in nearly all cases. Analysis of the obtained physicochemical data provides a rationale for fine&#8208;tuning the compounds&#8217; properties during drug optimization.







Abstract
A comprehensive study of physicochemical properties (pKa, LogP, and intrinsic microsomal clearance) within the series of mono&#8208; and difluorinated azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine derivatives was performed. While the number of fluorine atoms and their distance to the protonation center were the major factors defining the compound's basicity, both pKa and LogP values were affected considerably by the conformational preferences of the corresponding derivatives. For example, features of &#8220;Janus face&#8221; (facially polarized) cyclic compounds (i.&#8201;e., unusually high hydrophilicity) were identified for cis&#8208;3,5&#8208;difluoropiperidine, preferring a diaxial conformation. Intrinsic microsomal clearance measurements demonstrated high metabolic stability of the compounds studied (with a single exception of the 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidine derivative). According to pKa &#8211; LogP plots, the title compounds provide a valuable extension of the fluorine&#8208;containing (e.&#8201;g., fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted) saturated heterocyclic amine series as building blocks for rational optimization studies in early drug discovery.

The study of the effects of SCS and LR residues at each intermediate level of the demethylation mechanism in the catalysis of KDM6 enzymes using QM/MM and MD simulations.







Abstract
KDM6A (UTX) and KDM6B (JMJD3) are human non&#8208;heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent JmjC oxygenases that catalyze the demethylation of trimethylated lysine 27 in the N&#8208;terminal tail of histone&#8197;H3, a post&#8208;translational modification that regulates transcription. A Combined Quantum Mechanics/ Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) study on the catalytic mechanism of KDM6A/B reveals that the transition state for the rate&#8208;limiting hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction in KDM6A catalysis is stabilized by polar (Asn217) and aromatic (Trp369)/non&#8208;polar (Pro274) residues in contrast to KDM4, KDM6B and KDM7 demethylases where charged residues (Glu, Arg, Asp) are involved. KDM6A employs both &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;electron transfer pathways for HAT, whereas KDM6B employs the &#963;&#8208;electron pathway. Differences in hydrogen bonding of the Fe&#8208;chelating Glu252(KDM6B) contribute to the lower energy barriers in KDM6B vs. KDM6A. The study reveals a dependence of the activation barrier of the rebound hydroxylation on the Fe&#8722;O&#8722;C angle in the transition state of KDM6A. Anti&#8208;correlation of the Zn&#8208;binding domain with the active site residues is a key factor distinguishing KDM6A/B from KDM7/4s. The results reveal the importance of communication between the Fe center, second coordination sphere, and long&#8208;range interactions in catalysis by KDMs and, by implication, other 2OG oxygenases.

         <title>Intramolecular Palladium Catalyst Transfer on Benzoheterodiazoles as Acceptor Monomers and Discovery of Catalyst Transfer Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular catalyst transfer takes place on dibromobenzotriazole, but not on dibromobenzothiadiazole in the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reaction and polycondensation reaction with tBu3PPd precatalyst. Furthermore, the addition of benzothiadiazole interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reaction of dibromophenylene with phenylboronic acid ester, in which the catalyst transfer occurs in the absence of any additive.







Abstract
Intramolecular catalyst transfer on benzoheterodiazoles was investigated in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling reactions and polymerization reactions with tBu3PPd precatalyst. In the coupling reactions of dibromobenzotriazole, dibromobenzoxazole, and dibromobenzothiadiazole with pinacol phenylboronate, the product ratios of monosubstituted product to disubstituted product were 0/100, 27/73, and 89/11, respectively, indicating that the Pd catalyst undergoes intramolecular catalyst transfer on dibromobenzotriazole, whereas intermolecular transfer occurs in part in the case of dibromobenzoxazole and is predominant for dibromobenzothiadiazole. The polycondensation of 1.3&#8197;equivalents of dibromobenzotriazole with 1.0&#8197;equivalent of para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzoxazole, however, para&#8208; and meta&#8208;phenylenediboronates afforded moderate&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymer with bromine at both ends and cyclic polymer, respectively. In the case of dibromobenzothiadiazole, they afforded low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers with bromine at both ends. Addition of benzothiadiazole derivatives interfered with catalyst transfer in the coupling reactions.

         <title>Unlocking The Role of Guanidinium Salts in Interface Engineering for Boosted Performance of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial passivation of Guanidinium salts for inverted perovskite solar cells was systematically investigated. With the optimal benefit by reduced defects, the efficiency of 19.95&#8201;% is achieved for GuABr&#8208;modified solar cells with superior stability, which maintains 90&#8201;% of its original efficiency after 1600&#8197;h under a relative humidity of 35&#8201;%&#8211;55&#8201;% for unencapsulated devices.







Abstract
NiOx&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted growing attention due to their low cost and large&#8208;scale application potential. However, the efficiency and stability of inverted planar heterojunction PSCs is still unsatisfactory owing to insufficient charge&#8208;extraction caused by undesirable interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx hole transport layers (HTLs). Herein an interfacial passivation strategy with guanidinium salts (guanidinium thiocyanate (GuASCN), guanidine hydrobromide (GuABr), guanidine hydriodate (GuAI)) as passivator is employed to solve this problem. We systematically study the effect of various guanidinium salts on the crystallinity, morphology, and photophysical properties of perovskite films. Guanidine salt as interfacial passivator can decrease interface resistance, reduce carrier non&#8208;radiative recombination, and boost carrier extraction. Notably, the GuABr&#8208;treated unencapsulated devices can still maintain more than 90&#8201;% of their initial PCE after aging for 1600&#8197;h at 16&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C and 35&#8201;%&#8211;50&#8201;% relative humidity in ambient conditions. This work reveals the significance of counterions in improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.

         <title>Superionic Conductivity in Sodium Zirconium Chloride&#8208;Based Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New superionic conductors based on polyanion&#8208;added chloride&#8208;based materials are reported. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the highly conducting materials are mainly a mixture of an amorphous phase and Na2ZrCl6. The sodium ionic conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are attracting intensive attention, and chloride&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for use in such batteries because of their high chemical stability and low Young's modulus. Here, we report new superionic conductors based on polyanion&#8208;added chloride&#8208;based materials. Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 showed a high ionic conductivity of 1.6&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis indicated that the highly conducting materials are mainly a mixture of an amorphous phase and Na2ZrCl6. The conductivity might be dominated by the electronegativity of the central atom of the polyanion. Electrochemical measurements reveal that Na0.67Zr(SO4)0.33Cl4 is a sodium ionic conductor and is suitable for use as a solid electrolyte in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries.

         <title>Promoting Amination of Furfural to Furfurylamine by Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Pd/MoO3&#8722;x Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valence Mo species acts as Lewis acid sites to activate aldehyde groups and deliver strong metal&#8208;support interactions to enable metallic Pd centers toward the boosted amination of furfural with a high yield of 84&#8201;%.







Abstract
The reductive amination of carbonyl compounds is one of the most straightforward protocols to construct C&#8722;N bonds, but highly desires active and selective catalysts. Herein, Pd/MoO3&#8722;x catalysts are proposed for furfural amination, in which the interactions between Pd nanoparticles and MoO3&#8722;x supports can be easily ameliorated by varying the preparation temperature toward efficient catalytic turnover. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation of MoV&#8208;rich MoO3&#8722;x and highly dispersed Pd, the optimal catalysts afford the high yield of furfurylamine (84&#8201;%) at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Thereinto, MoV species not only acts as the acidic promoter to facilitate the activation of carbonyl groups, but also interacts with Pd nanoparticles to promote the subsequent hydrogenolysis of Schiff base N&#8208;furfurylidenefurfurylamine and its germinal diamine. The good efficiency of Pd/MoO3&#8722;x within a broad substrate scope further highlights the key contribution of metal&#8208;support interactions to the refinery of biomass feedstocks.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low-valence Mo species&lt;/b&gt; acts as Lewis acid sites to activate aldehyde groups and deliver strong metal-support interactions to enable metallic Pd centers toward the boosted amination of furfural with a high yield of 84&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reductive amination of carbonyl compounds is one of the most straightforward protocols to construct C&#8722;N bonds, but highly desires active and selective catalysts. Herein, Pd/MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts are proposed for furfural amination, in which the interactions between Pd nanoparticles and MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; supports can be easily ameliorated by varying the preparation temperature toward efficient catalytic turnover. Thanks to the synergistic cooperation of Mo&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;-rich MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; and highly dispersed Pd, the optimal catalysts afford the high yield of furfurylamine (84&#8201;%) at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Thereinto, Mo&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; species not only acts as the acidic promoter to facilitate the activation of carbonyl groups, but also interacts with Pd nanoparticles to promote the subsequent hydrogenolysis of Schiff base &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-furfurylidenefurfurylamine and its germinal diamine. The good efficiency of Pd/MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; within a broad substrate scope further highlights the key contribution of metal-support interactions to the refinery of biomass feedstocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimising Electrical Interfacing between the Trimeric Copper Nitrite Reductase and Carbon Nanotubes</title>

@A_Le_Goff Optimising Electrical Interfacing between the Trimeric Copper Nitrite Reductase and Carbon Nanotubes (Le Goff**et al.).







Abstract
The immobilization of copper&#8208;containing nitrite reductase (NiR) from Alcaligenes faecalis on functionalised multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes is reported. It is demonstrated that this immobilization is mainly driven by hydrophobic interactions, promoted by the modification of MWCNTs with adamantyl groups. Direct electrochemistry shows high bioelectrochemical reduction of nitrite at the redox potential of NiR with high current density of 1.41&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the desymmetrization of the trimer upon immobilization induces an independent electrocatalytic behavior for each of the three enzyme subunits, corroborated by an electron&#8208;tunneling distance dependence.

Abstract
1,3&#8208;Disubstituted N&#8208;aryl&#8208;2H&#8208;isoindoles have been synthesized by a cascade reaction of divinyl ethers, which are derived from easily available 4&#8208;bromoisocoumarins, with substituted anilines in HFIP. This cascade reaction consists of a ring&#8208;opening step through addition&#8208;elimination mechanism and the following 5&#8208;exo&#8208;tet type ring&#8208;closing step via the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction. Thus obtained 2H&#8208;isoindoles have been derivatized to high&#8208;order nitrogen&#8208;containing polycycles including less accessible benzo[a]ullazines.

         <title>Insight into the Structural Ambiguity of Actinide(IV) Oxalate Sheet Structures: A Case for Alternate Coordination Geometries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Old, limited data in the nuclear field is relied upon, but often requires revisiting for clarity. Like cracked glasses, flaws in old data can lead to missing information. Structural assumptions about PuIV oxalate hexahydrate have existed for decades, but only now has the structure been reported. These data have led to the identification of previously unreported coordination of water and changing oxalate positions across the isostructural AnIV series. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;K. Sockwell, A.&#8197;E. Hixon and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301164).

         <title>Substitution Effects on the Photophysical and Photoredox Properties of Tetraaza[7]helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of substituted polyaza[7]helicenes were synthesized and their (photo)physical properties and capabilities as photoredox catalysts were investigated. DFT calculations on the derivatives and three more model compounds were performed to predict the photoredox properties of these compounds.







Abstract
A series of substituted derivatives of tetraaza[7]helicenes were synthesized and the influence of the substitution on their photophysical and photoredox&#8208;catalytic properties was studied. The combination of their high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 0.65 and their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity results in CPL brightness values (BCPL) that are among the highest recorded for [7]helicenes so far. A sulfonylation/hetarylation reaction using cyanopyridines as substrates for photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the excited helicenes was conducted to test for viability in photoredox catalysis. DFT calculations predict the introduction of electron withdrawing substituents to yield more oxidizing catalysts.

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Mononuclear Cationic Aluminium Alkoxide Complexes: Syntheses, Reactivity and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New cationic aluminium complexes with terminal alkoxy substituents (&#8722;OMe and &#8722;OtBu) are reported; these showed markedly higher Lewis acidity than the known hydride and methyl analogues, as evident from their Gutmann&#8208;Beckett test, NBO analysis and hydride ion affinity calculations. These complexes activate triethylsilane and are good catalysts for the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and alkene.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate&#8208;supported aluminium complexes bearing terminal alkoxide and mono&#8208;thiol functional groups: LAlOMe(Et) (2), LAlOtBu(Et) (3), and LAlSH(Et) (4), (L=[HC{C(Me)N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)}2]). Complexes 2 and 3 are further used as synthons to generate the fascinating cationic aluminium alkoxide complexes, [LAlOMe(&#956;&#8208;OMe)&#8208;Al(Et)L][EtB(C6F5)3] (5), [LAlOMe(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (6), and [LAlOtBu(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (8). These electrophilic cationic species are well characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques. The assessment of Lewis acidity by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method revealed superior Lewis acidity of the cations substituted with electron&#8208;demanding alkoxy groups in comparison to the known methyl analogue [LAlMe][B(C6F5)4]. This has been further endorsed by computational calculations to determine the NBO charges and hydride ion affinity for complexes 6 and 8. These complexes are also capable of activating triethylsilane in stoichiometric reactions. The applicability of these complexes has been realized in the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and olefines. Additionally, the solid&#8208;state structure of a new THF stabilized aluminium halide cation [LAlCl(THF)][B(C6F5)4] (11) has also been reported.

Complexes &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are further used as synthons to generate the fascinating cationic aluminium alkoxide complexes, [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;AlOMe(&#956;-OMe)-Al(Et)&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;][EtB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;AlOMe(OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)][EtB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;), and [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;AlO&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu(OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)][EtB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;). These electrophilic cationic species are well characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques. The assessment of Lewis acidity by the Gutmann-Beckett method revealed superior Lewis acidity of the cations substituted with electron-demanding alkoxy groups in comparison to the known methyl analogue [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;AlMe][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]. This has been further endorsed by computational calculations to determine the NBO charges and hydride ion affinity for complexes &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;. These complexes are also capable of activating triethylsilane in stoichiometric reactions. The applicability of these complexes has been realized in the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and olefines. Additionally, the solid-state structure of a new THF stabilized aluminium halide cation [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;AlCl(THF)][B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;) has also been reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The reaction of an iridium tetrahydride (LIrH4, L=DippNacnac) with main&#8208;group (E=Sn, Pb, Bi) amides/alkoxides results in the extrusion of amines/alcohols with formation of iridium dimetallotetrylenes (LIrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2. Computational investigations of the Ir2E2 (E=Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open&#8208;shell singlets; in contrast, Ir2Bi2 is characterized as having a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state.







Abstract
Reactions of the IrV hydride [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 {BDI=(Dipp)NC(Me)CH(Me)CN(Dipp); Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3} with E[N(SiMe3)2]2 (E=Sn, Pb) afforded the unusual dimeric dimetallotetrylenes ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 in good yields. Moreover, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Ge)2 was formed in&#8197;situ from thermal decomposition of [MeBDIDipp]Ir(H)2Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2. These reactions are accompanied by liberation of HN(SiMe3)2 and H2 through the apparent cleavage of an E&#8722;N(SiMe3)2 bond by Ir&#8722;H. In a reversal of this process, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 reacted with excess H2 to regenerate [MeBDIDipp]IrH4. Varying the concentrations of reactants led to formation of the trimeric ([MeBDIDipp]IrH2)3(&#956;2&#8208;E)3. The further scope of this synthetic route was investigated with group&#8197;15 amides, and ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Bi)2 was prepared by the reaction of [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 with Bi(NMe2)3 or Bi(OtBu)3 to afford the first example of a &#8220;naked&#8221; two&#8208;coordinate Bi atom bound exclusively to transition metals. A viable mechanism that accounts for the formation of these products is proposed. Computational investigations of the Ir2E2 (E=Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open&#8208;shell singlets with confined nonbonding lone pairs at the E centers. In contrast, Ir2Bi2 is characterized as having a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Substituted Phosphasilenes and its Rare Homologue Stibasilene &gt;Si=Sb&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amidinate stabilized low valent phosphasilenes &gt;Si=P&#8722; and a heavier homologue stibasilene &gt;Si=Sb&#8722; are reported. Compounds 1, 2, and 3 are heavy analogues of imine or Schiff base. In both phosphorus compounds, Si exhibits double bond character. All compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and 1 and 2 also by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis.







Abstract
Herein we report the reduction of R&#8208;EX2 (E=P, Sb) with two equivalents of KC8 in the presence of silylene (LSiR; L=PhC(NtBu)2) to give Trip&#8208;P=SiL(C6H4PPh2) (1), TerPh&#8722;P=(tBu)SiL (2) and TerPh&#8722;Sb=(tBu)SiL (3). The last (3) belongs to a new class of heavier analogues of Schiff bases (&gt;C=N&#8722;), containing a formal &gt;Si=Sb&#8722; double bond. The theoretical calculations suggest that lone pairs on the dicoordinated group&#8208;15 centers are stabilized by hyperconjugative interactions resulting in pseudo&#8208;Si&#8722;P/Si&#8722;Sb multiple bonds which are highly reactive as indicated by the high first and second proton affinities.
