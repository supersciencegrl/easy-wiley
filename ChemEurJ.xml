         <title>Stereospecific Radical Bromination of &#946;&#8208;Aryl Alcohols with Thiourea Additives Through A Serendipitous Discovery of A 1,2&#8208;Aryl Migration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the bromination of diastereomeric &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols using the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;succinimide (NBS) and thiourea protocol provides a novel pathway to a direct fully stereoretentive bromination of &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols under very mild conditions.







Abstract
The development of new protocols for stereospecific and stereoselective halogenation transformations by mild reaction conditions is a highly desirable research target for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Following the straightforward methodology for directly transforming a wide scope of alcohols to alkyl bromides and chlorides using substoichiometric amounts of thioureas and N&#8208;halo succinimides (NXS) as a halogen source in a single step, we noticed that in apolar solvents bromination of chiral secondary alcohols did not produce the expected racemates. In this study, the stereochemical aspects of the bromination reaction were examined. Surprisingly, bromination of (&#177;)&#8208;threo&#8208; or (&#177;)&#8208;erythro&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;butanols revealed a single diastereomeric brominated product with retention of configuration. The scope of these reactions was expanded on several &#946;&#8208;aryl alcohols. During these studies, an unexpected stereospecific 1,2&#8208;migration of the phenyl group was shown to take place. The proposed mechanism of the 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration involves the formation of a spiro[2,5]octadienyl radical, which is then attacked by a bromide radical at any of the two cyclopropyl positions anti to the phenyl position, leading to products that retain the stereoisomeric configuration of the starting material.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Continuous Flow Synthesis of Pentafluorosulfanyl Chloride (SF5Cl) Using a Custom&#8208;Made Stirring Packed&#8208;Bed Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein is reported the first continuous flow synthesis of pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF5Cl), the most widely used reagent for introducing the SF5 group onto aliphatic molecules. For this purpose, a custom&#8208;made stirring reactor was designed and allowed rapid, safe and highly efficient synthesis of SF5Cl. Moreover, the following radical addition of SF5Cl on alkynes in a telescoped manner was realized.







Abstract
The pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5&#8722;) group has been the subject of a surge of interest in the past decade, but there is still little practicality associated with its synthesis and installation. Herein is reported the first continuous flow synthesis of pentafluorosulfanyl chloride (SF5Cl), the most common reagent for the synthesis of SF5&#8208;substituted compounds. The synthesis is based on inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle reagents: sulfur powder (S8), trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCCA) and potassium fluoride (KF). To this end, a custom&#8208;made stirring reactor was designed to allow for fast, safe, and highly efficient on&#8208;demand synthesis of SF5Cl. The resulting SF5Cl solution is showcased in the radical addition on alkynes in a telescoped fashion.

         <title>Substrate Specificity of Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 Nanozyme: Ascorbic Acid Oxidation and Selective Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 nanozyme, synthesized with Cu2+ as an active site and adenine as a linker in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline, specifically catalyzes ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation to dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), and concurrently produced ROS could efficiently triggers intratumor oxidative stress to induce tumor cell death.







Abstract
Though nanozymes are becoming promising alternatives to natural enzymes due to their superior properties, constructing nanozyme with high specificity is still a great challenge. Herein, with Cu2+ as an active site and adenine as a ligand, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 is synthesized in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. As an oxidase mimic, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 could selectively catalyze oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA) to dehydroascorbic acid, but not universal substrates (3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), 2,2&#8217;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis (3&#8208;ethylbenzthiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol (2,4&#8208;DP)), small biomolecules (dopamine, glutathione, glucose, galactose), other vitamins (vitamin A acid, vitamin B1, vitamin K1) and even dithiothreitol (a common interference of AA). Such the specific AA catalytic oxidation is revealed that Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 selectively binds with AA through hydrogen bonds, accompanied with catalyzing AA oxidation, and concurrently O2 transferring to H2O2 via O2&#8901;&#8722;, further to H2O via &#8901;OH. Based on the produced reactive oxygen species, with AA as a pro&#8208;oxidant, Adenine&#8208;Cu&#8208;PO4 nanozyme efficiently triggers severe intratumor oxidative stress to induce tumor cell death. This work opens a new avenue to design intrinsic nanozymes with high specificity, and also presents a promising application in the field of AA oxidation induced cancer therapy.

         <title>Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Long Chain Esters via Formate Hydroesterification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic olefin carbonyl methods commonly rely on fossil fuel sourced carbon monoxide feedstocks. Extension of carbon dioxide hydrogenation catalysis has produced a new, selective route to long chain esters from olefins using a tandem catalytic process. In either single or dual stage reactions, cooperative ruthenium and palladium catalysts reduce CO2 to formate esters then hydroesterify olefins to generate value added esters.







Abstract
CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification is an attractive route to produce value added ester compounds, which could replace widely used CO&#8208;based hydroesterification processes if sufficient catalytic technologies are developed. One path to CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification could proceed through an organoformate intermediate, which is then used in olefin hydroesterification to generate the desirable esters. This route opens the possibility of creating a net CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification process using tandem catalytic systems for CO2 hydrogenation to organoformate paired with formate&#8208;olefin hydroesterification. The tandem use of tripodal phosphine ruthenium(II) and 1,2&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphinomethyl)benzene palladium catalysts were found to successfully produce methyl nonanoate from CO2, H2, methanol and 1&#8208;octene in a single&#8208;stage batch process. The CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification catalysis efficiency was found to be largely limited by the productivity of organoformate generation and competitive 1&#8208;octene reduction. Catalytic yields of methyl nonanoate can be enhanced by adjustments in reaction procedures, including the use of a two&#8208;stage batch reaction process or delayed introduction of 1&#8208;octene, achieving a yield of up to 32&#8201;%. Under select conditions, control experiments indicate yields of methyl nonanoate can be improved to ca 75&#8201;%. Preliminary studies indicate significant interplay between the two ligands employed in the molecular tandem catalytic systems and establish the first catalytic protocol for the selective CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification of olefins via organoformates.

         <title>Panchromatic Absorption of Unsymmetrical Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyes Based on a Meta&#8208;conjugated 1,3,5&#8208;Heteroaryltriazine Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Attachment of three different heterocycles with electron donor or acceptor character to a central 1,3,5&#8208;triazine core generates readily soluble side&#8208;chain free dyes with two displaying soft crystalline mesomorphism and one displaying a nematic liquid crystal phase as confirmed by polarized optical microscopy, calorimetry, gravimetric analysis, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. Equally intriguing is the dyes&#8217; relatively strong electronic communication between donor and acceptor subchromophores that are meta&#8208;conjugated to one another, which is experimentally observed as a broad intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer absorption that can extend over 100 nm past the most intense absorption event and is computationally confirmed through density functional theory (DFT) evaluations of the molecular ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state properties. This molecular design permits the preparation of dyes with panchromatic absorption not just based on the additive absorption of individual subchromophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Three dimensional CNTs interweaved layered MnTe nanoparticles as a new cathode for aqueous zinc ion battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the development of suitable transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) for aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) is plagued by the terrible conductivity and electrochemical properties. Herein, a one&#8208;step ball milling method is applied to enhance the conductivity of commercial MnTe cathode by constructing three dimensional (3D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) interweaved MnTe nanoparticles (abbreviated as MnTe@CNTs), which can achieve ultrafast ion conduction. The stable electrochemistry properties benefit from the synergistic effects between layered MnTe and 3D CNTs, which can improve the electrons/ions diffusion kinetics as cycling. So MnTe@CNTs achieves a ultra&#8208;high capacity of 427.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and superior capacity retention of 97.6% at 1 A g&#8208;1 over 200 cycles. Zinc&#8208;storage mechanisms can be revealed with the aid of operando XRD and ex situ XPS spectra. MnTe as a new cathode presents superior Zn&#8208;storage ability for high&#8208;performance AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrylenes Are Able to Discern between Isomeric Structures of Unsaturated Osmium(IV) Polyhydrides</title>

         <dc:description>Hexahydride OsH6(PiPr3)2 (1) releases H2 to form the isomeric tetrahydrides 2a and 2b of general formula OsH4(PiPr3)2.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Polyferrocenylmethylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polyferrocenylmethylenes was prepared via ring&#8208;opening transmetalation polymerization (ROTP), starting from the corresponding carba[1]magnesocenophanes. Different substitution patterns have been investigated with regards to the polymers&#8217; properties and gave some insights into the underlying reaction mechanism. Furthermore, the polyferrocenylmethylenes were investigated as preceramic polymers.







Abstract
The synthesis of differently substituted polyferrocenylmethylenes (PFM) via ring&#8208;opening transmetalation polymerization (ROTP) is reported. A number of novel, symmetrically and asymmetrically substituted carba[1]magnesocenophanes have been prepared, which were used as precursors and allowed investigations of the influence of different substitution patterns on the PFM polymer properties. The novel carba[1]magnesocenophanes have been fully characterized by 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, and structurally authenticated by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD). The corresponding PFMs were obtained with molecular weights in a range of Mw=1900&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 up to 15100&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and corresponding dispersities of &#272;=1.48 to 1.81. All PFMs have been fully characterized by 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, as well as by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (MALDI&#8208;ToF) mass spectrometry. Pyrolysis of spyrocyclic substituted PFM resulted in a ceramic yield above 50&#8201;%, while the obtained residue was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD).

         <title>Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carbonyl Compounds via Cu/TEMPO/O2 Aerobic Catalytic System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu/TEMPO/O2 system that is suitable for converting alcohols, ketones, lactones, and lactams to their &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is reported. The Cu&#8208;catalyzed system performs high activity and selectivity, and H2O is the byproduct produced.







Abstract
An N,N,N&#8208;type Cu(II) complex&#8208;catalyzed desaturation method for converting alcohols, ketones, lactones, and lactams to their &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds is reported. The dehydrogenation reaction can be conducted with a green terminal oxidant O2 without requiring strong acid/base or stoichiometric oxidants. The Cu(II) complex/TEMPO/O2 system uses a non&#8208;noble catalyst, and a green terminal oxidant as well as demonstrates high activity and functional group tolerance. Notably, H2O is the byproduct produced and overoxidation is not observed during the reaction process. The proposed mechanism was investigated via high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), in&#8197;situ FT&#8208;IR spectrometry, and GC analysis, and the formation of intermediates of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds from the aerobic dehydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;saturated counterparts was observed.

         <title>[1+5] Cyclization of Indoline&#8208;Derived Azadienes with 1,3,5&#8208;Triazinanes: An Efficient Protocol for the Synthesis of Indoline&#8208;Spiro&#8208;Hexahydropyrimidines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work firstly disclosed that indoline&#8208;derived azadienes could serve as 1&#8208;atom synthons, providing a straightforward protocol for indoline&#8208;spiro&#8208;hexahydropyrimidines via an innovative formal [1+5] cyclization between indoline&#8208;derived azadienes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes.







Abstract
An unprecedented formal [1+5] cyclization of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes with 1,3,5&#8208;triazinanes has been realized, providing a facile access to biologically important indoline&#8208;spiro&#8208;hexahydropyrimidines with good to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield). Different from previous reports, this is the first study that indoline&#8208;derived azadienes could participate in cyclizations as one&#8208;atom synthons. This methodology is also distinguished by not involving any additive or catalyst, readily available starting materials, wide range of substrate applicability, operational simplicity and simultaneously reassembling two C&#8722;N and two C&#8722;C bonds in one&#8208;step reaction.

     alt="[1+5] Cyclization of Indoline-Derived Azadienes with 1,3,5-Triazinanes: An Efficient Protocol for the Synthesis of Indoline-Spiro-Hexahydropyrimidines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work firstly disclosed that indoline-derived azadienes could serve as 1-atom synthons, providing a straightforward protocol for indoline-spiro-hexahydropyrimidines via an innovative formal [1+5] cyclization between indoline-derived azadienes and 1,3,5-triazinanes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unprecedented formal [1+5] cyclization of indoline-derived azadienes with 1,3,5-triazinanes has been realized, providing a facile access to biologically important indoline-spiro-hexahydropyrimidines with good to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield). Different from previous reports, this is the first study that indoline-derived azadienes could participate in cyclizations as one-atom synthons. This methodology is also distinguished by not involving any additive or catalyst, readily available starting materials, wide range of substrate applicability, operational simplicity and simultaneously reassembling two C&#8722;N and two C&#8722;C bonds in one-step reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Polar Pore Surface Designed for Purification of Both Natural Gas and Ethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZJNU&#8208;402 achieves a remarkable C3H8 adsorption capacity and selectivity values of 375 for C3H8/CH4 and 31 for C2H6/CH4. This innovation enables efficient one&#8208;step purification, particularly in separating C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixtures, yielding high&#8208;purity methane.







Abstract
The advancement of high&#8208;value CH4 purification technology within the natural gas industry is paramount for industrial processes. Herein, we constructed ZJNU&#8208;402, a new porous material characterized by permanent porosity, as an effective adsorbent for separating C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 mixtures. The findings reveal an outstanding C3H8 adsorption capacity of 68&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a moderate C2H6 adsorption rate of 42&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a notably lower CH4 adsorption rate of 11&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1. Noteworthy is the exceptional selectivity of ZJNU&#8208;402 for C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4, standing at 375 and 31, respectively, surpassing many previously documented high&#8208;performance adsorbents and breaking the traditional trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and separation selectivity. Adsorption heat calculations show that compared with CH4 molecules, C3H8 and C2H6 molecules form stronger bonds with the skeleton, resulting in excellent separation performance. In addition, the breakthrough experiment of ZJNU&#8208;402 can also completely separate the ternary component C3H8/C2H6/CH4 mixture to obtain 99.95&#8201;% high&#8208;purity methane. At the same time, ZJNU&#8208;402 also has excellent structural stability, excellent recyclability, and low isosteric adsorption heat. Consequently, ZJNU&#8208;402 exhibits substantial potential for augmenting the efficacy of natural gas enrichment processes.

         <title>Construction of MOF&#8208;Derived Vanadium Nitride Decorated Micro/Mesoporous Carbon Nanofibers for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
V&#8211;MOF was incorporated into the electrostatic spinning technique to prepare VN decorated N&#8208;doped micro/mesoporous carbon nanofibers (VN/N&#8208;MCNF) with abundant porous structure and high electronic conductivity as a stabilizing host structure for ZIBs. The capacity retention rate of the VN/N&#8208;MCNF electrode can reach more than 90&#8201;% after 200 cycles at a low current density of 0.3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Design and manufacture of cathode materials, with suitable pore structure and high electrical conductivity to matching zinc anode, solving the problem of dissolution and structural degradation of cathode materials for zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), is great significance to the development of ZIBs. Herein, Vanadium Nitride (VN) uniformly decorated N&#8208;doped micro/mesoporous carbon nanofibers (VN/N&#8208;MCNF) with appropriate porous and reactive sites for Zn2+ is prepared by using V&#8211;MOF, as important precursor via electrostatic spinning and pyrolysis technique. As a cathode electrode for ZIBs, the VN/N&#8208;MCNF is suitable for diffusion and adsorption of large&#8208;sized solvated structured [Zn(H2O)6]2+, for its abundant micro/mesoporous structure and good electrical conductivity. The VN/N&#8208;MCNF electrode has high specific capacity of 242&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and rate performance. Moreover, the VN/N&#8208;MCNF&#8208;based ZIBs can reach 92.5&#8201;% capacity retention after 200 cycles at a low current density of 0.3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and can reach 86.1&#8201;% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. These findings highlight the importance of a rational design of cathode materials for high&#8208;performance metal batteries, which can also be extended to the design of other materials.

The reaction of 1 with 0.5 equiv. of m&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) in acetonitrile at &#8722;40 &#176;C resulted in the formation of a &#956;&#8208;oxodicobalt(IV) complex (2), which was characterized by an array of spectroscopic techniques, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy which revealed a short Co&#8722;Ooxo distance of 1.67 &#197;. Reactivity studies of 2 towards oxidation/oxygenation of hydrocarbon C&#8722;H bond and triphenylphosphine or thioanisole derivatives have been examined. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy studies showed the appearance of clear isosbestic points during the oxidation of substrates together with a neat transformation of 2 to 1. Detailed kinetic investigations established that 2 follows a Concerted Proton&#8208;Electron Transfer (CPET) mechanism for hydrocarbon oxidation and has a weak electrophilic character. Catalytic behavior of 1 was noted towards the oxygen atom transfer reactions. This study showcases the spectroscopic investigation and reactivity studies of a CoIV(&#956;&#8208;O)CoIV moiety.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidation of Methane to Methanol on a Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methane oxidation to methanol was efficiently catalyzed a zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on cobalt vanadotungstate at a low temperature without co&#8208;reductants. The hydroxyl&#8208;based active species generated in the V and Co sites in the micropore of the catalyst, which selectively oxidized methane to form methanol.







Abstract
Direct oxidation of methane to methanol utilizing molecular oxygen under mild conditions is an important yet challenging process due to the difficulty in activating of methane under such conditions. In this research, we report on zeolitic octahedral metal oxides based on cobalt vanadotungstates, which act as the catalysts for the oxidation of methane using molecular oxygen as the oxidant without co&#8208;reductants at a low temperature of 90&#8201;&#176;C even as low as 60&#8201;&#176;C. This catalytic process results in the high&#8208;yield production of methanol as the primary product. The micropores within the catalyst are critical for achieving high activity in the reaction, in which molecular oxygen is activated. The active species in the reaction are found to be hydroxyl&#8208;based. Both VO5 with reduced V4+ and Co2+ are crucial for generating the active species for the reaction.

Both VO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with reduced V&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are crucial for generating the active species for the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impact of Structural Subtleties on Chirality Induction and Amplification in Trizinc(II)Porphyrin Trimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subtle modification in a &#8216;nano&#8208;size&#8217; trizinc(II) porphyrin trimer profoundly affects its complexation and chirogenic responses with chiral diamine substrates: while &#8216;open&#8217; form generates &#8216;monomeric&#8217; complex with low CD amplitude, &#8216;closed&#8217; form produces exclusive &#8216;polymer&#8217; with large, amplified CD signal with opposite sign.







Abstract
Herein, we report the precise control of molecular to supramolecular chirality induction at the single&#8208;molecule level just upon subtle modification in an achiral &#8216;nano&#8208;size&#8217; trizinc(II) porphyrin trimer. A slight variation in the projection of the substituent at the periphery of the central porphyrin unit in a porphyrin trimer (host) resulted in pronounced changes in the interchromophoric arrangement, leading to distinct &#8216;open&#8217; and &#8216;closed&#8217; conformations. While &#8216;open&#8217; form generates &#8216;monomeric&#8217; complex with low CD amplitude, &#8216;closed&#8217; form produces exclusive &#8216;polymer&#8217; with large, amplified CD signal with opposite sign due to stronger intermolecular excitonic coupling. Also, the sign of the CD couplets is just opposite between R and S substrates for both polymer and monomer which suggest that the chirality is predominantly governed by the stereogenic projection of the chiral center. X&#8208;ray structures of the host and polymer have been reported here. Crystallographic characterization offers a detailed perspective on the structural and geometrical transformations in the polymer, enabling a systematic understanding of its optical properties. DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations strongly corroborate with the experimental findings.

         <title>Piezochromic Luminescence of Pyrene Derivatives Polymorphism Around Excimer Forming Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent behavior and structural evolution of a polymorphous system comprising a blue&#8208;emitting phase (IMPY&#8208;B) and a green&#8208;emitting phase (IMPY&#8208;G), both featuring dimeric pyrene stacking, were investigated under high&#8208;pressure conditions. IMPY&#8208;B, characterized by weaker intermolecular interactions within a dimer, exhibits a larger red&#8208;shift in its PL spectra and requires higher pressure to form excimers.







Abstract
Pyrene aggregates, as classic luminescent materials, are of great interest from a scientific viewpoint owing to the development of optoelectronic materials. In this study, we designed a compound 1,4,5&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole (IM&#8208;PY) which was achieved with two crystalline polymorphs (IMPY&#8208;G and IMPY&#8208;B). They exhibit the green emission and the blue emission, respectively, both with pyrene serving as the luminescent core. At ambient conditions, both phases exhibit &#960;&#8211;&#960; pyrene dimer stacking, but IMPY&#8208;B has the obviously smaller overlapping area and slightly shorter distance of pyrene planes than IMPY&#8208;G. During compression, the experiment results of photoluminescence, in&#8197;situ UV&#8208;vis absorption, time&#8208;resolved emission, and synchrotron angular dispersive X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations indicate that IMPY&#8208;B shows a more pronounced red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence spectra and forms excimers at higher pressure than IMPY&#8208;G. This fully reflects the influence of different stacking structures on the piezochromic phenomenon of aggregates, which is beneficial for expanding the application of pyrene aggregated state.

         <title>Controllable Self&#8208;Assembly Morphologies of PPV&#8208;Based Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(p&#8208;phenylenevinylene) (PPV) is a classic semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers with outstanding optical and electronic properties, which shows important applications in the fields of optoelectronic, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic solar cells (OSCs), and organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). In the working process of the device, the microstate of PPV decides its property. Therefore, it is significant to achieve ordered morphologies based on PPV at micro scale. Due to the long rigid backbone and large area of delocalized electron, PPV has a strong tendency towards ordered aggregation through intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction, and &#8220;rod&#8208;coil&#8221; type block copolymer (BCP) based on PPV with a corona chain to improve the solubility is always built for self&#8208;assembly in situ solution. However, obtaining regular PPV based micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;structures in a controllable and uniform form remains challenging. In this review, we summarize the progresses in constructing multi&#8208;dimensional regular self&#8208;assembly morphologies based on PPV BCPs and exploring the application potential of these delicate functional nanomaterials. The molecular design strategy and growth mechanism can be extended to regulate the aggregation state of functional semiconducting conjugated polymers, which is beneficial to improving their performance in application of microelectronics, optoelectronics, biology and so on.</dc:description>

         <title>Broken Symmetry and Elastic Frustration in Isostructural Spin Crossover Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Symmetry&#8208;breaking spin&#8208;state transitions in two of three isostructural salts of MnIII spin&#8208;crossover cations, [MnIII(3&#8208;OMe&#8208;5&#8208;NO2&#8208;sal2323)]+, with heavy anions are reported. The ReO4&#8722; &#160;salt undergoes two&#8208;step spin crossover which is coupled with a re&#8208;entrant symmetry&#8208;breaking structural phase transition between a high temperature phase (S = 2, C2/c), an intermediate ordered phase (S = 1/S = 2, P21/c), and a low temperature phase (S = 1, C2/c). The AsF6&#8722; &#160;complex undergoes an abrupt transition between a high temperature phase (S = 2, C2/c) and a low temperature ordered phase (S = 1/S = 2, P&#8208;1).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Symmetry-breaking spin-state transitions in two of three isostructural salts of MnIII spin-crossover cations, [MnIII(3-OMe-5-NO2-sal2323)]+, with heavy anions are reported. The ReO4&#8722; &#160;salt undergoes two-step spin crossover which is coupled with a re-entrant symmetry-breaking structural phase transition between a high temperature phase (S = 2, C2/c), an intermediate ordered phase (S = 1/S = 2, P21/c), and a low temperature phase (S = 1, C2/c). The AsF6&#8722; &#160;complex undergoes an abrupt transition between a high temperature phase (S = 2, C2/c) and a low temperature ordered phase (S = 1/S = 2, P-1). The SbF6&#8722; &#160;complex undergoes a gradual transition between a high temperature phase (S = 2, P-1) and a low temperature spin-state ordered phase (S = 1/S = 2, P-1).

         <title>Programing Green Light&#8208;Responsive Hydrogels: from Photo&#8208;Weakening to Photo&#8208;unresponsiveness and Photo&#8208;Strengthening</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;responsive hydrogels are highly valued for their dynamic mechanical properties and biocompatibility. In this study, we present a hydrogel system that can either soften or strengthen on green light exposure, or remain unresponsive to light, depending on the addition of adenosyl cobalamin (AdoCbl) and Co2+. These protein&#8208;based hydrogels were formed using genetically encoded SpyTag&#8208;SpyCatcher chemistry and included green light&#8208;sensitive CarHc protein domains. As previously reported, these hydrogels formed in the dark with the addition of AdoCbl, due to the tetramerization of the CarHc domains. Under green light exposure, the CarHc tetramers disassembled, leading to a rapid transition from gel to sol. Interestingly, we discovered that an excess of AdoCbl leads to photo&#8208;strengthening rather than photo&#8208;weakening. This occurred because light exposure induces interchain crosslinks between AdoCbl and poly&#8208;histidine tags (His6&#8208;tags) of the proteins. Furthermore, incorporating Co2+ ions enhanced hydrogel stiffness by coordinating to His6&#8208;tags. This not only suppressed photo&#8208;weakening but also promoted photo&#8208;strengthening behaviour. These findings highlight the role of His6&#8208;tags in photochemical crosslinking with excess AdoCbl and in coordination to Co2+ ions, providing a novel strategy for designing tuneable, light responsiveness in materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a fascinating class of structured materials with diverse functionality originating from the distinctive physicochemical properties. This review focuses on the specific chemical design of geometrically frustrated MOFs along with the origin of the intriguing magnetic properties. We have discussed the arrangement of spin centres (metal and ligand) which are responsible for the unusual magnetic phenomena in MOFs. Both two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOFs with frustrated magnetism, their synthetic routes, and evaluation of magnetic properties are highlighted. Such spin&#8208;frustrated MOFs may find applications in the field of memory devices, transistors, sensors, and development of unconventional superconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Adaptive Molecular Crystals Activated by [2+2] and [4+4] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomechanical crystals of [2+2] or [4+4] cycloaddition: This article presents a summary of the recent research progress on photomechanical properties of organic and metal&#8208;organic crystals where the mechanical effects are based on [2+2] and [4+4] cycloaddition reactions.







Abstract
Photomechanical crystals act as light&#8208;driven material&#8208;machines that can convert the energy carried by photons into kinetic energy via shape deformation or displacement, and this capability holds a paramount significance for the development of photoactuated devices. This transformation is usually attributed to anisotropic expansion or contraction of the unit cell engendered by light&#8208;induced structural modifications that lead to accumulation and release of stress that generates a momentum, resulting in readily observable mechanical effects. Among the available photochemical processes, the photoinduced [2+2] and [4+4] reactions are known for their robustness, predictability, amenability to control with molecular and supramolecular engineering approaches, and efficiency that has already been elevated to a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept smart devices based on organic crystals. This review article presents a summary of the recent research progress on photomechanical properties of organic and metal&#8208;organic crystals where the mechanical effects are based on [2+2] and [4+4] cycloaddition reactions. It consolidates the current understating of the chemical strategies and structure&#8211;property correlations, and highlights the advantages and drawbacks of this class of adaptive crystals within the broader field of crystal adaptronics.

         <title>DNA Origami Adsorption and Lattice Formation on Different SiOx Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface&#8208;assisted assembly of DNA origami lattices on silicon oxide surfaces is of great importance for molecular lithography. Here, it is shown that the type of the silicon oxide employed has a tremendous impact on DNA origami adsorption and lattice assembly, with efficient lattice formation requiring low surface roughness and high oxide density.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled DNA origami lattices on silicon oxide surfaces have great potential to serve as masks in molecular lithography. However, silicon oxide surfaces come in many different forms and the type and history of the silicon oxide has a large effect on its physicochemical surface properties. Therefore, we here investigate DNA origami lattice formation on differently fabricated SiOx films on silicon wafers after wet&#8208;chemical oxidation by RCA1. Despite having similar oxide compositions and hydroxylation states, of all surfaces tested, only thermally grown SiOx performs similarly well as native oxide. For the other SiOx films deposited by plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition and magnetron sputtering, DNA origami adsorption is strongly suppressed. This is attributed to an increased surface roughness and a lower oxide density, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the employed SiOx surface may decide over the outcome of an experiment and should be considered as an additional parameter that may require optimization and fine&#8208;tuning before high&#8208;quality lattices can be assembled. In particular, our observations suggest that efficient DNA origami lattice assembly on SiOx surfaces requires a low surface roughness and a high oxide density.

         <title>Under&#8208;strain Synergistic Oscillatory Twisting Manipulates the Bifunction in Rubrene Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a statistic strategy over sufficient ab initio molecular dynamics samplings and for the first time uncovers that synergistic oscillatory twisting of neighboring under&#8208;strain monomers manipulates the experimentally observed bifunction of rubrene crystal. A general rule for how synergistic oscillatory twisting modulates the conversion between singlet fission and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation and its temperature dependence are discussed.







Abstract
Photophysical properties of condensed systems generally originate from collective contributions of all components in their stochastically fluctuated structures and are strongly influenced under strain of chromophores. To precisely identify how the stochastically fluctuated monomers synergistically manipulate the properties, we propose a statistic strategy over sufficient ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) samplings and for the first time uncover that synergistic oscillatory twisting (SOT) of neighboring under&#8208;strain monomers manipulates the bifunction of rubrene crystal. The under&#8208;strain trunk SOT can regulate both singlet fission (SF) and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), enabling their coexistence and dominance switching by dynamically modulating the matching of excitation energies. A general rule is that small amplitude of SOT maintains the crystal TTA, while the large one boosts SF and the SF function occurs only when two neighboring monomers simultaneously have the twisting angles larger than the critical one. Temperature can govern the twisting amplitudes, thus manipulating the bifunction. These findings rationalize the experimentally observed temperature&#8208;modulated bifunction of rubrene crystal from statistical insights and proposes a combined strain&#8208;fluctuation strategy for engineering the bifunctionality of materials.

         <title>Convergent Total Synthesis of Ixabepilone and Its Analogues Enabled by Highly Efficient Asymmetric Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we developed a highly efficient and convergent total synthesis of ixabepilone and its analogues in a 13&#8208;step longest linear sequence by the assembly of three key synthons which are synthezied through practical asymmetric hydrogenation.







Abstract
The convergent total synthesis of ixabepilone and its analogues in a 13&#8208;step longest linear sequence is reported. The crucial chiral centers at challenging C3&#8208;O, C8&#8208;C and C15&#8208;N positions on the scaffold of the ixabepilone were installed via highly efficient asymmetric hydrogenations (up to 95&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% e.e.) and all three fragments could be prepared on gram scale. The key aldol reaction bridges the aldehyde and keto fragments with high yield and exquisite diastereo control (8&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;d.r.). Finally, a novel RCM reaction conformationally controlled by a bulky silyl group was reported, which allows the facile synthesis of ixabepilone and its analogues.

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Experimentation Enables the Development of a Nickel&#8208;catalyzed Cyanation Platform for (Hetero)aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel screening platform for the nickel&#8208;catalyzed cyanation of (hetero)aryl halides relying on the use of air&#8208;stable Ni(COD)DQ at low loading is reported. Through high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE), various ligand and solvent combinations are systematically explored, allowing the fast identification of suitable conditions. This standardized workflow serves as an excellent starting point for selecting other competent nickel precatalysts and for further optimization of reluctant substrates. The transformation exhibits broad functional group tolerance and can be readily scaled up to gram&#8208;scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Sustainable Electrochemical Pd Catalyst Generation from Bulk Metal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium catalysts form a cornerstone of modern chemistry with upmost scientific and industrial impact. Bulk palladium metal itself is chemically inert, and a sequence of chemical transformations has to be utilized to convert the metal into Pd pre&#8208;catalyst covered by ligands. However, the &#8220;cocktail&#8221; of catalysis concept discovered recently has shown that Pd systems can efficiently operate in catalysis without the necessity of a complicated and expensive pre&#8208;installed ligand environment. Here, we point out on a green and sustainable process for Pd active species generation without the need of waste&#8208;abundant pre&#8208;catalyst&#8208;related chemistry. In this work, an electric current was used to generate an active Pd catalyst from a bulk metal in an ionic liquid medium for the efficient cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides/bromides and boronic acids. Synthetically important Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling was utilized as a representative test reaction to confirm the idea. It should be emphasized that electric current is used only at the Pd dissolution stage. Afterwards, the electrodes are removed from the reaction mixture and a standard reaction procedure can be followed. The reported catalyst preparation process via electrochemical dissolution is potentially compatible with a number of already existing catalytic methods.</dc:description>

         <title>What Factors Determine the Brevione B Desaturation Mechanism in the Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase BrvJ?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The natural product synthesis of brevione J undergoes a cascade of reactions including an oxidative desaturation and a ring&#8208;expansion. The C1&#8722;C2 desaturation of brevione B is catalyzed by the nonheme iron dioxygenase BrvJ using one molecule of O2 and a&#8208;ketoglutarate (aKG). However, whether the subsequent oxidative ring expansion reaction is also catalyzed by the same enzyme is unknown and remains controversial. To gain insight into the mechanism of brevione J biosynthesis a computational study is reported here using molecular dynamics and density functional theory approaches. The work predicts that both cycles can proceed in the same protein structure on an iron center with O2 and aKG for each cycle. The rate&#8208;determining step is a hydrogen atom abstraction step in both reaction cycles. Interestingly, the OH rebound barriers are high in energy in cycle 1 due to stereochemical interactions and substrate positioning that enable an efficient desaturation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative Study of Iminodibenzyl and Diphenylamine Derivatives as Hole Transport Materials in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently achieved over 26% power conversion efficiency, challenging the dominance of silicon&#8208;based alternatives. This progress is significantly driven by innovations in hole transport materials (HTMs), which notably influence the efficiency and stability of PSCs. However, conventional organic HTMs like PTAA, although highly efficient, suffer from thermal degradation, moisture ingress, and high cost. This study explores the potential of iminodibenzyl, a moiety known for its strong electron&#8208;donating capabilities in pharmaceutical applications, as a novel HTM. A series of fluorene&#8208;based derivatives incorporating iminodibenzyl (TMF&#8208;2 and TDF&#8208;2) and diphenylamine (TMF&#8208;1 and TDF&#8208;1) units were synthesized and characterized. The new HTMs demonstrated commendable optical, electrochemical, and thermal properties, as well as enhanced photostability. Among them, TDF&#8208;2 achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.38%, the highest of the new materials. Although these efficiencies are slightly lower than the benchmark PTAA (20.20%), the study underscores the potential of iminodibenzyl to enhance photostability and increase HOMO levels, making it a promising candidate for future HTM development in PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ Products Based on M&#8208;SACs/Cu Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tandem strategy demonstrates efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to produce C2+ products. M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem electrocatalysts have garnered significant interest owing to the high activity and selectivity of single atoms, along with their high conversion rates of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review focusing on the structure&#8208;activity relationship and design principle of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts in ECO2RR.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) is considered a highly promising method to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels, contributing significantly the artificial carbon balance. Plenty catalysts can facilitate the conversion of CO2 into mono&#8208;carbon (C1) products. Among these catalysts, Cu species exhibit a distinct role in the formation of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products characterized by enhanced energy density. However, the limited selectivity of C2+ products, along with the inferior stability, and high overpotential demonstrated by single&#8208;component Cu catalysts, hinders their applicability in industrial&#8208;scale production. The implementation of a tandem strategy, which involves coupling the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO pathway using Ag, Au, metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8208;SACs), etc., with the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion on Cu, represents a novel approach for the efficient generation of C2+ products. Given the high cost and restricted availability of noble metals, M&#8208;SACs have attracted substantial interest in tandem systems due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and efficient atom utilization. The systematic analysis of the design principles and structure&#8208;activity relationship is essential for the advancement of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts. Here we first introduce various prevalent design strategies of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts for ECO2RR and then systematically summarize the latest advancements of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem system, encompassing metal&#8208;organic frameworks/Cu (MOFs/Cu), covalent organic frameworks/Cu (COFs/Cu), and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support transition metal single atomic materials/Cu (M&#8722;N&#8722;C/Cu). Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities with the design and construction of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysis for ECO2RR.

Here we first introduce various prevalent design strategies of M-SACs/Cu-based tandem catalysts for ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and then systematically summarize the latest advancements of M-SACs/Cu-based tandem system, encompassing metal-organic frameworks/Cu (MOFs/Cu), covalent organic frameworks/Cu (COFs/Cu), and nitrogen-doped carbon support transition metal single atomic materials/Cu (M&#8722;N&#8722;C/Cu). Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities with the design and construction of M-SACs/Cu-based tandem catalysis for ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights into Structural Diversity and Morphotropic Evolution in A4Th(WO4)4 (A=Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs) Family</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A4Th(WO4)4 series (A=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) shows morphotropic evolution driven by size of alkali metal cations. Transition from Li (compact sheets) to Na/K (3D scheelite superlattices) to Rb/Cs (layered sheets) highlights cation size influence. ThO8 polyhedra remain stable, while W shifts from WO6 to WO4 coordination.







Abstract
A series of four new thorium tungstates, A4Th(WO4)4 (A=Li, K, Rb, Cs), were synthesized using high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Structural studies of the materials reveal distinct structural changes with underlying similarities influenced by the nature of A&#8208;site cations. Li4Th(WO4)4 exhibits a two&#8208;dimensional corrugated sheet structure stabilized by Li+ cations, crystallizing in P

space group. K4Th(WO4)4 crystallizes in I41/a space group and exhibits a three&#8208;dimensional framework consisting of ThO8 antiprisms and WO4 tetrahedra. Rb4Th(WO4)4 forms in C2/c space group, showcasing a framework with two&#8208;dimensional sheet structure. Cs4Th(WO4)4 is isostructural to Rb4Th(WO4)4 but displays increased interlayer spacing due to the larger ionic radius of Cs. Raman spectroscopy confirms the structural data, revealing distinct vibrational modes that correlate with tungsten coordination changes from WO6 in Li4Th(WO4)4 to WO4 in the Cs4Th(WO4)4. This study demonstrates how variation of alkali metals affects the structural properties of thorium tungstates series, showing a morphotropic evolution as a factor of the ionic radii of the alkali metals.

         <title>Photogeneration and Direct Observation of a 2H&#8208;phosphirene and a Closed&#8208;shell Singlet Arylphosphenium Ion</title>

Photogeneration and direct observation of a 2H&#8208;phosphirene and an arylphosphenium ion.







Abstract
Phosphenium ions are highly reactive species with the formula of RR&#8216;P+. Although phosphenium ions were proposed as the invaluable intermediates of various important chemical processes, the methods to generate and characterize them were very limited. In this study, a novel photoprecursor to give rise to the arylphosphenium ions, 1&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phosphirane, was synthesized and investigated by femtosecond to nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopies, photoproduct analysis, and density functional theory calculations. Subsequent to photoexcitation, the S1 state of the photoprecursor of interest is populated from the higher excited states, accompanied by the generation of an unexpected 2H&#8208;phosphirene, 7bH&#8208;naphtho[1,2&#8208;b]phosphirene. After that, the resulted 2H&#8208;phosphirene is protonated by H2O in the solvent to generate the naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl(hydryl)phosphenium ion, which can be attacked by H2O and oxidized by O2 to give naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphinic acid as the major final product. The presence of these transient species is supported by density functional theory calculation and control experiments with different solvents. This study provides an understanding of the reactivity of arylphosphenium ions as well as 2H&#8208;phosphirenes, and provides a novel method to generate and characterize these reactive species, which may help to further reveal their reactivity and explore their chemistry and use in a range of applications.

         <title>Seeing Double: The Persistent Dimer&#8208;of&#8208;Dimers Structure of Drug Resistant Influenza A M2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
S31N M2 proton channel of influenza A virus, which is predominant in the circulating strains, persists in a dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers structure in different lipid environments regardless of lipid concentration. NMR spectra recorded with 55&#8197;kHz magic angle spinning show characteristic resonances confirming this conformation and indicate rotameric states of I32 and I39 side chains that are compatible with native helical backbone geometry.







Abstract
The currently circulating S31N variant of the M2 proton channel of influenza A is resistant to antiviral drugs. Recently, there has been a growing concern regarding the impact of the lipid environment on the structural features of the S31N variant. The native symmetry of the M2 tetramer remains controversial. Here we show that S31N M2 persists in a dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers structure in different lipid preparations independent of the amount of solvating lipids up to at least 180 lipids per tetramer. NMR spectra clearly detect the characteristic resonances of the dimer&#8208;of&#8208;dimers of M2 (residues 18&#8211;60 or 18&#8211;62) reconstituted in lipids. NMR&#8208;based distance measurements indicate that two isoleucine residues with upfield shifted alpha carbon resonances, typical of extended conformations, are compatible with a particular side&#8208;chain rotameric state and helical backbone geometry. These chemical shifts are therefore compatible with the expected native transmembrane helical fold. Symmetry breaking at the pH sensing H37 residues, detected via peak doubling, is a stable feature of S31N M2 based on the reference strain Udorn/1972(H3N2). By contrast, the spectrum is dramatically altered for Columbia/2014/(H3N2) M2, which differs in sequence in the amphipathic helices. This highlights an allosteric coupling between the amphipathic helices and the pH sensing residues.

         <title>Synthesis of Clickable Isotactic Poly(vinyl ether)s through Organocatalytic Stereoselective Cationic Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stereoselective cationic copolymerization of C&#8722;C triple bond&#8208;containing vinyl ethers with simple alkyl vinyl ethers has been successfully developed by employing confined Br&#248;nsted acid as catalyst. Subsequent post&#8208;modification of the clickable alkyne groups via thiol&#8208;yne click reactions or copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction enables a modular access to isotactic polymers with various functional groups.







Abstract
By virtue of the high reliability of click chemistry, polymers with clickable groups provide a useful platform for the rapid synthesis of polymer materials with diverse functionalities and architectures. However, the polymerization of clickable vinyl monomers with a concurrent regulation on tacticity remains underdeveloped. Herein, we report the successful development of a stereoselective cationic copolymerization of C&#8722;C triple bond&#8208;containing vinyl ethers with simple alkyl vinyl ethers by employing confined Br&#248;nsted acid as catalyst, which allows for the synthesis of alkyne&#8208;functionalized vinyl ether copolymers with high isotacticity (up to 90&#8201;% m), controlled molecular weight, and variable content of C&#8722;C triple bonds. Further transformation of the pendant clickable alkyne groups via thiol&#8208;yne click reactions and copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction enables a modular access to isotactic polymers with various functional groups.

         <title>Utilizing Alkyne&#8208;Nitrone Cycloaddition for the Convenient Multi&#8208;Component Assembly of Protein Degraders and Biological Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a fast, modular, and convenient multi&#8208;component assembly strategy of multi&#8208;functional molecules via strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8211;nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC), facilitating the synthesis of proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and biological probes. The 2&#8208;component PROTACs were assembled via SPANC in&#8197;vivo. The 3&#8208;component PROTACs were assembled by sequential nitrone formation and SPANC, and photocages can be used to provide extra control of protein degradation.







Abstract
Proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have become a popular therapeutic strategy, and the development of multi&#8208;functional PROTACs has added complexity to their synthetic process. Although click reactions have been widely applied to prepare highly functionalized biomolecules, most of them are limited to two&#8208;component reactions, restricting the creation of more complex structures. Here, we developed a convenient multi&#8208;component assembly strategy via strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8211;nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC), which can be extended to a 3&#8208;component reaction when combined with nitrone formation. Using the 2&#8208;component assembly, we demonstrated the targeted protein degradation with both preassembled and in&#8208;cell assembled PROTACs. This strategy was also applied to facilitate the screening of E3 ligases in PROTACs and the preparation of various biological probes. Moreover, the 3&#8208;component assembly, via sequential nitrone formation and SPANC, enabled the synthesis of trifunctional 3&#8208;component PROTACs. The N&#8208;substituent, serving as an additional functional moiety, was designed as a photocage for sterically controlling PROTAC activity. The 3&#8208;component assembly can be further modified to provide additional control or enhance the cell&#8208;targeting ability of PROTACs. In short, our multi&#8208;component SPANC assembly strategy offers a modular and versatile synthetic platform for creating multi&#8208;functional PROTACs and biological probes.

         <title>A Chalcogenide&#8208;Derived NiFe2O4 as Highly Efficient and Stable Anode for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a new strategy for reconstructing NiFe&#8208;based chalcogenides to highly efficient and alkali&#8208;stable NiFe2O4&#8208;based OER electrode (NiFeOx&#8208;350&#8208;Ov) for the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Coupled with a non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based cathode, the resulting device displays energy efficiency and stability as high as the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost, highly active, and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes is one of the critical scientific issues for anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEM&#8208;WE). Herein, we report a vacancy&#8208;rich and alkali&#8208;stable NiFe2O4&#8208;type electrode (named as NiFeOx&#8208;350&#8208;Ov), derived from the chemical&#8208;vapor deposited precursor NiFeSexSy&#8208;350, as an efficient and robust anode material. The obtained electrode affords current densities of 100 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 245 and 270&#8197;mV, respectively, and displays excellent long&#8208;term durability sustaining 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at least for 1000&#8197;h. When coupled with Ni4Mo/MoO2/NF as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, the resulting platinum&#8208;group metal (PGM)&#8208;free single&#8208;cell AEM&#8208;WE exhibits a cell voltage of 1.71&#8197;V at the current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and long&#8208;term durability during a current&#8208;cycling test between 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over 150&#8197;h at 60&#8201;&#176;C. This work highlights a unique reconstruction strategy for preparing highly active and durable OER catalysts used in PGM&#8208;free AEM&#8208;WE.

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Derived Tetracarboxylate Featuring AIE Properties for Dual Ion Sensing and Mechanochromic Self&#8208;Erasable Writing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission molecule (TPEC) derived from tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetracarboxylate was designed and synthesized. It self&#8208;assembles into single&#8208;layer nanosheets in water, demonstrating multifunctional capabilities: fluorescence colorimetric sensing for Al3+ ions, fluorescence quenching sensing for Fe3+ ions, and mechanochromism for self&#8208;erasable writing.







Abstract
The integration of multiple functions within a single fluorescent molecule provides a promising platform for developing versatile, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective materials with enhanced performance across diverse applications. In this study, we introduce TPEC, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecule derived from tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetracarboxylate, which demonstrates multifunctional capabilities, including metal ion sensing and self&#8208;erasable writing. TPEC exhibits amphiphilicity in water, self&#8208;assembling into single&#8208;layer nanosheets with robust blue fluorescence. Notably, the aqueous solution of TPEC displays a fluorescence colorimetric response to Al3+ ions and fluorescence quenching in the presence of Fe3+ ions. Additionally, TPEC powders undergo fluorescence colorimetric changes under mechanical stimulation, enabling self&#8208;erasable writing on prepared paper. This study presents a straightforward strategy for the development of multifunctional luminescent materials based on the self&#8208;assembly of a single&#8208;component fluorophore.

         <title>Copper Nanoclusters Imparted Metalloporphyrin Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoclusters have been successfully introduced into metalloporphyrin MOFs to prepare a series of hybrid catalysts (i.&#8201;e. Cu NCs@MOF&#8208;54&#8208;M, M=Fe, Co and Ni) that can be applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR for efficient CO production.







Abstract
Strategies that can introduce catalytic auxiliary into electrocatalysts to boost the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are meaningful in exploring hybrid electrocatalytic systems. Here, a series of hybrid electrocatalysts (Cu NCs@MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M, M=Fe, Co and Ni) have been prepared by assembly Cu NCs with MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M=Fe, Co and Ni) and successfully applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR. In the obtained MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M=Fe, Co and Ni), the integration of Cu NCs with MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M=Fe, Co and Ni) can create a hybrid electrocatalytic system that enhances the charge transfer efficiency and electrocatalytic CO2RR activity. Specifically, the optimal Cu NCs@MOF&#8208;545&#8208;Co presents remarkable FECO over a wide potential range (&#8722;0.7&#8197;V to &#8722;1.0&#8197;V), high CO generation rate (8.2&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1) and excellent maximum energy efficiency (69&#8201;%, &#8722;0.7&#8197;V), which is superior to Cu NCs and MOF&#8208;545&#8208;Co, and represented to be one of the best performances to date. This work demonstrates a facile approach to significantly improve the FECO by loading metal nanoclusters into MOFs, providing a valuable reference for future studies on hybridization strategies to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts.

Specifically, the optimal Cu NCs@MOF-545-Co presents remarkable FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; over a wide potential range (&#8722;0.7&#8197;V to &#8722;1.0&#8197;V), high CO generation rate (8.2&#8197;mol&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and excellent maximum energy efficiency (69&#8201;%, &#8722;0.7&#8197;V), which is superior to Cu NCs and MOF-545-Co, and represented to be one of the best performances to date. This work demonstrates a facile approach to significantly improve the FE&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; by loading metal nanoclusters into MOFs, providing a valuable reference for future studies on hybridization strategies to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Ionic Liquid Film Thickness and Flow Rate on Macrocyclization Efficiency and Selectivity in Supported Ionic Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic setup consisting of a supported ionic liquid film situated on the inner surface of a mesoporous material and an organic transport phase, creates a liquid confinement that offers control over the spatial restraints in which a catalytic reaction occurs. Atomistic simulations are conducted and correlated with experimental observations to elucidate the molecular processes at the liquid&#8208;liquid interphase.







Abstract
Supported ionic&#8208;liquid phase (SILP) technology in a biphasic setting with n&#8208;heptane as the transport phase was applied to the Ru&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed macrocyclization of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;dienes to elucidate the effect of ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;film thickness, flow rate as well as substrate and product concentration on macrocyclization efficiency, and Z&#8208;selectivity. To understand the molecular&#8208;level behavior of the substrates and products at the n&#8208;heptane/IL interphase, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were conducted and correlated with experimental observations. The thickness of the IL layer strongly influences the Z/E ratio of the products in that a thin IL layer favors higher Z/E ratios by confining the catalyst between the pore wall and the liquid&#8208;liquid interphase whereas a thick IL layer favors formation of the E&#8208;product and Ru&#8208;hydride catalyzed isomerization reactions. Also, macrocyclization efficiency, expressed by the ratio of oligomers/macromonocycle (O/MMC), is influenced both by the flow rate and the thickness of the IL layer.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Interactions Facilitated by Chalcogen Bonding within Selenadiazole Functionalised Porphyrin Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and robust porphyrin nanotube (PNT) has been generated by the combination of tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin, a selenadiazole carboxylate anion and Cd(II) centres. Solvent&#8208;filled regions within the PNTs can be evacuated, allowing the incorporation of a variety of guests. X&#8208;ray diffraction and solid&#8208;state NMR provide information relating to chalcogen bonding interactions between the host and appropriate guest solvent molecules.







Abstract
The structural rigidity of tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin (TPyP) has been utilised to prepare a robust novel porous coordination polymer of composition Cd2(TPyP)(sez)2 (TPyP=5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin, sez=1,2,5&#8208;benzoselenadiazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylate). The coordination polymer may be described as a hexagonal porphyrin nanotube (PNT) and has the potential to bind guest molecules through chalcogen bonding. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) data indicate an internal pore diameter ~9&#8197;&#197; which represents ~35&#8201;% of the crystal volume. Immersion of the PNTs in solvents such as DMSO and CS2 result in the incorporation of these molecules within the nanotubes with chalcogen bonding between host and guest. The crystallographic guest&#8208;inclusion investigations are complemented by solid&#8208;state 77Se, 13C, 113Cd and 2H&#8197;NMR studies which provide insights into dynamic behaviour. The porosity of the crystals was further explored using gas adsorption experiments, indicating the reversible uptake of CO2, CH4, H2 and N2. Structure&#8208;function relationships are clearly established from complementary crystallographic, NMR and adsorption investigations.

         <title>Apoptosis&#8208;Inducing Activity of a 2&#8208;Hydroxyphenyl Benzamide&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assembled Anion Channel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports readily prepared 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzamide derivatives that self&#8208;assemble into chloride channels through intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Interestingly, transmembrane chloride transport mediated by the nanotubes induces apoptosis in a human breast cancer MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cell lines while remaining relatively non&#8208;toxic to non&#8208;cancerous cells.







Abstract
Despite the significant interest in designing artificial ion channels, there is limited availability of channel&#8208;forming molecules to tackle complex issues, especially in biological systems. Moreover, a major challenge is the scarcity of chloride transporters that can selectively induce toxicity in cancer cells while minimizing harm to normal healthy cells. This work reports a series of 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzamide&#8208;based small molecules 1&#8201;a&#8211;1&#8201;c, which self&#8208;assemble to form barrel rosette&#8208;type artificial ion channels that adequately transport chloride ions across membranes. The formation of these ion channels primarily relies on intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, as supported by the analysis of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Importantly, chloride ion transport by these compounds specifically triggers apoptosis in cancer cells while demonstrating relatively low toxicity toward non&#8208;cancerous cell lines.

         <title>Bismuth Bound to Transition Metals: Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Olefin Coordination, Reductive Elimination, and Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of transition metal carbonyl complexes with a bismuth&#8208;ligand that bears an olefin functional group have been investigated. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;irradiation leads to CO elimination and concomitant coordination of the olefin moiety to the transition metal center in a chemically reversible process. Complexes featuring two bismuth&#8208;based ligands engage in oxidative addition/reductive elimination reactions of the corresponding dibismuthane, R2Bi&#8211;BiR2.







Abstract
A series of dibenzobismepinyl (C14H10Bi) substituted transition metal complexes of the type [(C14H10Bi)M(CO)x(L)] (M=Mn, Co, Fe) was prepared in salt elimination reactions from a halobismepine and sodium metallates. Irradiation of these complexes with visible light has been investigated, aiming at the elimination of one carbonyl ligand and the concomitant coordination of the bismepine's olefin moiety to the transition metal center. The resulting complexes of the type [{&#954;2C,&#954;1Bi&#8208;(C14H10)Bi}M(CO)x&#8722;1(L)] (M=Co, Fe) have been isolated and fully characterized. When two dibenzobismepinyl units are positioned in the coordination sphere of an iron carbonyl complex fragment, reductive elimination/oxidative addition events of the dibismuthane (C14H10Bi)2 have been shown to be relevant. The analytical techniques applied in this work include (heteronuclear) NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and (TD)&#8208;DFT calculations.

         <title>Highly Active and Stable Cu&#8722;Cd Bimetallic Oxides for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 4.73&#8201;% Cd&#8208;CuO catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and stability for CO2RR, while facile modulation of product selectivity from CO to C2+ can be readily achieved by precise control of electrolysis conditions. The enhanced performance of the electrocatalyst is ascribed to the introduction of CdO to improve the ability of CuO to activate CO2, the electronic interactions between Cu and Cd can boost the activation and conversion the key intermediates of CO2RR.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) can produce value&#8208;added chemicals such as carbon monoxide (CO) and multicarbon (C2+). However, the complex reaction pathways of CO2 electro&#8208;reduction reaction (CO2RR) greatly limit the product selectivity and conversion efficiency. Herein, the Cu&#8722;Cd bimetallic oxides catalyst was designed and applied for the CO2RR. The optimized 4.73&#8201;%Cd&#8208;CuO exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic CO2RR activity for selective CO production in H&#8208;cell using 0.5&#8197;M 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)/MeCN as electrolyte. The Faradaic efficiency of CO (FE(CO)) can be maintained above 90&#8201;% over a wide potential range of &#8722;2.0 to &#8722;2.4&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+. Particularly, the catalyst achieves an impressive FE(CO) of 96.3&#8201;% with a current density of 60.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.2&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+. Furthermore, scaling up the 4.73&#8201;%Cd&#8208;CuO catalyst into a flow cell can reach 56.64&#8201;% FE of C2+ products (ethylene, ethanol and n&#8208;propanol) with a current density as high as 600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 steadily. The excellent CO2RR performance of the as&#8208;synthesized 4.73&#8201;%Cd&#8208;CuO can be mainly attributed to the introduction of CdO to improve the ability of CuO to activate CO2, the electronic interactions between Cu and Cd can boost the activation and conversion the key intermediates of CO2RR and ensure the continuous stability of the 4.73&#8201;%Cd&#8208;CuO in electrolysis process.

         <title>Enantiopure Macrocycles Based on Tr&#246;ger&#8216;s Base and Diphenyl Maleimide Exhibiting Strong Chiral Emission and Host&#8208;Guest Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pairs of enantiomeric macrocycles are synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura [2+2] cyclization, using Tr&#246;ger&#8242;s base and diphenyl maleimide as building blocks. These macrocycles display strong fluorescence with near&#8208;unity quantum yields. The chiral Tr&#246;ger&#8242;s base units confer excellent circularly polarized luminescence and well&#8208;defined cavities for efficient guest encapsulation..







Abstract
While a plenty of macrocyclic hosts have been developed in supramolecular chemistry, those that combine chiral luminescent properties and host&#8208;guest recognition abilities are still uncommon. Herein, two pairs of enantiomeric macrocycles were synthesized via Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura [2+2] cyclization reactions using Tr&#246;ger's base and diphenyl maleimide as the building blocks. The diphenyl maleimide units impart these macrocycles with highly strong fluorescence, achieving quantum yields up to 100&#8201;% in apolar solvents. Furthermore, the chiral, V&#8208;shaped Tr&#246;ger's base units provide the macrocycles with circularly polarized luminescence (|glum|=1.68&#215;10&#8722;3) and well&#8208;define cavity for hosting electron&#8208;deficient or positively charged guests with Ka up to 1.7&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1.

         <title>Quadruple Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Behaviour of Acylhydrazone Crystals: Mechanical, Photomechanical, Thermomechanical, and Optical Waveguide Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acicular crystal, BBFH, with quadruple stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour that can undergo mechanical bending, phoptomechanical effects, thermomechanical responses and optical waveguide behaviour has been prepared.







Abstract
As society advances, the demand for high&#8208;performance crystal materials with versatile stimuli&#8208;responsive capabilities has increased. However, there remains a notable shortage of simple molecular crystals that exhibit stable and swift responses to various stimuli. In this study, we synthesized a novel acylhydrazone crystal by integrating benzene&#8208;fused heterocycles and halogens, achieving a crystal material with multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviours. The crystal demonstrates good mechanical flexibility, capable of with standing a strain of 2.3&#8201;% under applying mechanical force and recovering its original shape after force removal. Crystal structure analysis reveals this property is due to the strong and flexible intermolecular interactions. It also exhibits rapid photomechanical bending away from light source under UV irradiation, which could be attributed to the facile photoisomerization. Moreover, the crystal undergoes significant thermomechanical transitions, including cracking and jumping, upon heating. Additionally, the prepared crystal exhibits passive optical waveguide of red light at 640&#8197;nm, which, combining the photomechanical bending, can achieve controllable light output direction. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors make the acylhydrazone crystal a promising candidate for applications in multifunctional sensors, optoelectronic devices, and thermal switches. This work provides a helpful reference for the study of potential crystal material design and functionality of advanced responsive systems.

Disclosed here is an EDA&#8208;complex&#8208;mediated radical tandem difluoroalkylation/cyclization for the construction of diverse CF2&#8208;containing isoquinolin&#8208;1,3(2H,4H)&#8208;diones under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This protocol features operational simplicity, sustainability (without any catalysts or oxidants), mild conditions, and broad substrate scopes in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields, providing a novel environmentally friendly choice for the synthesis of isoquinolinonedione derivatives.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced radical tandem difluoroalkylation/cyclization to construct CF2&#8208;containing isoquinolinonedione skeletons with methacryloyl benzamides is developed. Broad substrate scopes are compatible with metal&#8208;, oxidant&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions under room temperature in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Mechanistic analysis revealed that the transformation is initiated by photoinduced electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes formation.

         <title>Fluorescent Coating through Melanisation of Merocyanine Based on Catechol Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel NIR&#8208;fluorophore featuring a merocyanine core and catechol moiety was synthesised for the first time using a straightforward multicomponent approach. Leveraging the catechol's exceptional surface adhesion and polymerisation capabilities, innovative fluorescent polymeric coatings were successfully developed on substrates, including glass, cupronickel, and polypropylene, via bioinspired melanisation. This work paves the way for advanced applications in surface functionalisation and material science.







Abstract
In this study, we present a novel approach for synthesising a merocyanine (MC) compound that integrates gallol and a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophore using a straightforward method. We conduct a comprehensive structural analysis to elucidate the specific roles of each functional group during monomer synthesis and their effects on the properties of both the spiropyran (SP) and MC forms, particularly their fluorescence. As a proof of concept, we explore the use of these compounds in formulating innovative fluorescent polymeric coatings by melanising catechol and gallol moieties on various substrates, including glass, a cupronickel coin, and an organic polymer. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a bioinspired approach utilizing the melanisation of a catechol and gallol moiety containing merocyanine.

         <title>Construction and Comparative Research of Two MOFs Proton Conducting Materials Containing Nitro Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two nitro&#8208;containing Cd&#8208;based MOFs, MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2, are being synthesized and investigated for their proton conductivity. Both materials show peak conductivity at 98% RH and 90 &#176;C, with MOF&#8208;1 demonstrating significantly higher proton conductivity (9.13 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S&#8901;cm&#8722;1) compared to MOF&#8208;2 (3.00&#215;10&#8722;3 S&#8901;cm&#8722;1). The study emphasizes the role of nitrate in enhancing proton conduction.







Abstract
In field of electrochemistry, there has been a growing interest in the potential applications of proton&#8208;conducting metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Therefore, how to design and synthesize MOFs with high proton conductivity is considered crucial. In this study, two examples of nitro&#8208;containing Cd&#8208;based MOFs, MOF&#8208;1 {[Cd3(TIPE)1.5(NO3)5Cl(H2O)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;17H2O}n and MOF&#8208;2 {[Cd(TIPE)0.5(nip)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10H2O}n (TIPE=1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)ethene, H2nip=5&#8208;Nitroisophthalic Acid), had been successfully designed and synthesized, and their proton&#8208;conducting properties were thoroughly investigated. Notably, both materials displayed peak proton conductivity at 98&#8201;% RH and 90&#8201;&#176;C, exhibiting values of 9.13&#215;10&#8722;3 and 3.00&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2, respectively. The plausible proton conduction pathways and mechanisms were elucidated through structural analyses, water vapor adsorption studies, and the determination of activation energy (Ea) values. It was found that the difference in proton conductivity between MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2 was mainly associated with the different water absorption rates of the samples. The uniqueness of this study was that for the first time conducted an in&#8208;depth study of the role of nitrate in proton conduction, providing new ideas for designing materials with excellent proton conductivity.

         <title>Insights into the Solution Processing of Non&#8208;van der Waals Boron Carbide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid phase exfoliation of B4C resulted in ultrathin nanosheets in various solevnts. Dispersibility study of B4C enables to determine its Hansen solubility parameter. In situ dispersion stability is investigated using analytical centrifuge and the sedimentation kinetics are analyzed based on instability index, integral extinction, and sedimentation velocity. Solution&#8208;processed B4C showed superior field emission properties compared to bulk B4C.







Abstract
Exfoliation of non&#8208;layered materials is crucial to unleash their enormous potential in wide range of applications. However, the presence of strong non&#8208;van der Waals interactions in all three dimensions makes exfoliation challenging. Boron carbide (B4C), known for its high hardness, holds great potential for diverse applications. In this work, B4C is exfoliated in 29 solvents to determine its Hansen solubility parameters (HSP) and understand the dispersion stability. The experimentally determined HSP values are 19.6, 15.3 and 15.1&#8197;MPa1/2 for dispersive interactions (&#948;D), polar interactions (&#948;P) and hydrogen bonding interactions (&#948;H), respectively. Subsequently, in&#8197;situ dispersion stability is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively from the space&#8208;time resolved extinction profiles employing an analytical centrifuge. The sedimentation kinetics of B4C dispersions are analyzed using instability index, integral extinction and sedimentation velocity. B4C dispersions in solvents like &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone, isopropyl alcohol, propylene carbonate and formamide exhibited excellent stability. Additionally, B4C nanosheets are utilized to investigate their field emission properties. These nanosheets exhibit a turn&#8208;on electric field of 3.35&#8197;V/&#956;m at an emission current density of 1&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and it delivered a large emission current density of ~375&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at an applied electric field of 5.7&#8197;V/&#956;m.

         <title>Non&#8208;alternant Benzodifluoranthene Tetraimides from 7,8,9,10&#8208;Fluoranthene Diimides: Synthesis, Structure, and Optical&#8208;Limiting Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;alternant benzodifluoranthene tetraimides is synthesized using UV&#8208;photocyclization of a vinyl&#8208;bridged dimer that features two newly developed 7,8,9,10&#8208;fluoranthene diimide (FDI) units. The tetraimide molecule exhibits several advantages over the FDI cores, including an extended absorption band and a red&#8208;shift in photoluminescence spectra. The fully fused aromatic tetraimides shows typical reverse saturable absorption behavior, demonstrating superior optical&#8208;limiting performance compared to vinyl&#8208;bridged dimer.







Abstract
A novel tetraimide&#8208;functionalized non&#8208;alternant &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, namely, benzodifluoranthene tetraimides (BDFTI), has been designed and synthesized through highly efficient UV&#8208;photocyclization of a vinyl&#8208;bridged fluoranthene diimide dimer (i.&#8201;e., FDI&#8722;V). The synthesis of FDI&#8722;V starts from a straightforward three&#8208;step route to produce novel 7,8,9,10&#8208;fluoranthene diimide (FDIs) building&#8208;blocks, followed by nearly complete bromination and then Stille&#8208;coupling reaction to give the desired dimer. The analysis by X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms a near&#8208;coplanar geometry for FDIs, while BDFTI shows a U&#8208;shaped and distorted backbone configuration proven by theoretical optimizations. The tetraimide BDFTI exhibits several advantages over the FDI cores, including an extended absorption band and a red&#8208;shift in photoluminescence spectra. This enhancement can be attributed to the presence of additional electron&#8208;deficient imide units, which promotes increased intramolecular charge transfer and improved electron affinity. All the imides show a local aromatic characteristic owing to the incorporation of pentagon rings in the &#960;&#8208;frameworks. The fully fused BDFTI exhibits nonlinear optical properties as analyzed by the open&#8208;aperture Z&#8208;scan technique, demonstrating superior optical&#8208;limiting performance compared to vinyl&#8208;bridged FDI&#8722;V. The versatile UV&#8208;photocyclization chemistries provide a pathway for developing complex and unique multiimide&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems, paving the way for creating high&#8208;performance optical&#8208;limiting materials.

The tetraimide BDFTI exhibits several advantages over the FDI cores, including an extended absorption band and a red-shift in photoluminescence spectra. This enhancement can be attributed to the presence of additional electron-deficient imide units, which promotes increased intramolecular charge transfer and improved electron affinity. All the imides show a local aromatic characteristic owing to the incorporation of pentagon rings in the &#960;-frameworks. The fully fused BDFTI exhibits nonlinear optical properties as analyzed by the open-aperture Z-scan technique, demonstrating superior optical-limiting performance compared to vinyl-bridged FDI&#8722;V. The versatile UV-photocyclization chemistries provide a pathway for developing complex and unique multiimide-functionalized &#960;-conjugated systems, paving the way for creating high-performance optical-limiting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Sulfurization of Cubic Cu2O to Form Cu2S Nanostructure&#8208;Decorated Catalysts for Light&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalytic H2 Evolution and Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slight surface sulfurization was employed to prepare cubic Cu2O@Cu2S core&#8208;shell structures, which can deliver a maximum high surface photovoltage (SPV) of 30 mV. The as&#8208;prepared Cu2O@Cu2S has demonstrated efficient charge separation and migration, which then served as high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts for light&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic H2 evolution and photocatalytic CH4 production, suggesting its promising applications in light&#8208;driven catalysis.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for electrocatalysis and photocatalysis suffers from sluggish charge transfer and poor photo&#8208;to&#8208;electric conversion rate. Herein, micro&#8208;sized Cu2O cubes were initially prepared for subsequent transformation into Cu2O@Cu2S core&#8208;shell structures by a slight surface sulfurization. The formation of nanostructured Cu2S thin layer at Cu2O surface can endow an immediate charge separation and migration under light irradiation, leading to high surface photovoltages (SPV, 18&#8211;30&#8197;mV). As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Cu2O@Cu2S catalysts exhibited reduced overpotentials (&#951;, only 86&#8197;mV is required for the optimized sample to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for H2 evolution with good cycling stability in electrocatalytic water splitting. Meanwhile, a high methane (CH4) production rate of 30.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 can be delivered from the optimized Cu2O@Cu2S sample when used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work has provided a strategy to prepare bifunctional catalysts with improved photoelectric properties for photo/electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>Anion&#8208;substituted Hybrid Zinc Halides with Remarkable Dielectric Switches</title>

         <dc:description>
Thermo&#8208;responsive dielectric switching hybrid halides, displaying reversible dielectric bistability, have recently made them highly versatile. Herein, by the strategy of substituting the X site in the general formula A2BX4, the low&#8208;dimensional [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2ZnX4 (X=Br, I) hybrid halides exhibite remarkable dielectric bistability/switching characteristics with ultra&#8208;wide dielectric hysteresis loop of about 55&#8197;K near room temperature.







Abstract
Thermo&#8208;responsive dielectric switching hybrid halides, displaying reversible dielectric bistability, have recently made them highly versatile and attractive for their structural tunability and rich functional properties. However, the substantial improvement of the dielectric switching operating range is limited near room temperature, and obtaining ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region is a major challenge. Herein, a remarkable dielectric switching effect is reported with ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region in a hybrid halide system, caused by dipolar orientational polarization ascribing order&#8208;disorder phase transitions. The new A2BX4 hybrid halide [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2ZnBr4 (4PBA&#8208;ZnBr4) with an ultra&#8208;wide dielectric hysteresis loop of about 55&#8197;K near room temperature is designed successfully through halogen substitution. Meanwhile, structurally similar hybrid materials 4PBA&#8208;ZnI4 were designed as controls. More interestingly, the crystal structure, phase transition temperature (Tc), dielectric and semiconductor properties exhibit significant discrepancies as the halogen atoms vary from Br to I. This discovery provides an efficiently regulated anionic framework to construct hybrid halides with ultra&#8208;wide high dielectric switching and reliable cycling stability by assembling with various cations, making them potentially excellent candidates for highly responsive room temperature smart switches or transducer devices.

Abstract
Exploiting advanced solid particles is crucial to the construction of Pickering emulsions catalysis. Recently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used as ideal emulsifiers stabilizing Pickering emulsions for interfacial catalysis. Although Pickering emulsions stabilized by core&#8208;shell MOFs have significant importance in practical studies, to date there have been very limited reports on this topic.

It was firstly applied as an emulsifier in Pickering emulsions to catalyze the deacetalization&#8208;Knoevenagel tandem reaction, which exhibited excellent catalytic properties and achieved extremely high yields. Additionally, ZIF&#8208;90@ZIF&#8208;67 showed high stability and remained well repeatable after five cycles.

         <title>Metalized Borylene in Boron&#8208;Gold Carbonyl Complexes: Infrared Spectra and Theoretical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic boron&#8722;gold carbonyl complexes that were mass&#8208;isolated and spectroscopically characterized in the gas phase are demonstrated to be inorganic analogues to borylenes and feature classical borylene reactivity to CO. In particular, the quasi&#8208;T&#8208;shaped BAu3+ examplifies an amphoteric metalized borylene stabilized by a unique multicenter covalent bond rather than the well&#8208;documented coordination tactics, disclosing a conceptually new platform for accessing borylenes with transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mimicking reactivity.







Abstract
Borylenes (:B&#8722;R) that are built on a single B&#8722;R bond between boron and another nonmetallic atom or group are a heated subject of special interest due to their intriguing transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mimicking reactivity, but the relative lack of understanding for the electronic structure and chemical bonding of transition metal borides leads to lingering neglect of metalized borylenes (:B&#8722;M) based on covalent B&#8722;M bonding. Here we use infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in combination with density functional calculations to study the geometric structure and chemical bonding of boron&#8208;gold carbonyl complex cations. The structure and bonding analyses demonstrated that the BAu(CO)3+ and BAu2(CO)4+ complexes can be described as bis&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;trapped borylene adducts. While the metal&#8208;rich BAu3(CO)4+ complex represents an unusual multicenter&#8208;bond&#8208;stabilized borylene cation with excellent &#963;&#8208;acidity and &#960;&#8208;backbonding capability for CO activation, featuring Cs symmetry with a quasi&#8208;T&#8208;shaped BAu3+ core. It is manifested that BAu3+ presents greater amphoteric reactivity and improved stability compared to BAu1,2+ due to the presence of the three&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron Au&#8722;B&#8722;Au bond. This study discloses a conceptually new platform for accessing reactive metalized borylenes by exploiting the boron&#8208;mediated multicenter&#8208;bond stabilization strategy and using more bench&#8208;stable and ubiquitous metal carbonyl fragments as starting materials, thus providing a broader opportunity for the design of novel chemical structures and catalytic reactions.

&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; examplifies an amphoteric metalized borylene stabilized by a unique multicenter covalent bond rather than the well-documented coordination tactics, disclosing a conceptually new platform for accessing borylenes with transition-metal-mimicking reactivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borylenes (:B&#8722;R) that are built on a single B&#8722;R bond between boron and another nonmetallic atom or group are a heated subject of special interest due to their intriguing transition-metal-mimicking reactivity, but the relative lack of understanding for the electronic structure and chemical bonding of transition metal borides leads to lingering neglect of metalized borylenes (:B&#8722;M) based on covalent B&#8722;M bonding. Here we use infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in combination with density functional calculations to study the geometric structure and chemical bonding of boron-gold carbonyl complex cations. The structure and bonding analyses demonstrated that the BAu(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and BAu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes can be described as bis-carbonyl-trapped borylene adducts. While the metal-rich BAu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complex represents an unusual multicenter-bond-stabilized borylene cation with excellent &#963;-acidity and &#960;-backbonding capability for CO activation, featuring C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry with a quasi-T-shaped BAu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; core. It is manifested that BAu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; presents greater amphoteric reactivity and improved stability compared to BAu&lt;sub&gt;1,2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; due to the presence of the three-center-two-electron Au&#8722;B&#8722;Au bond. This study discloses a conceptually new platform for accessing reactive metalized borylenes by exploiting the boron-mediated multicenter-bond stabilization strategy and using more bench-stable and ubiquitous metal carbonyl fragments as starting materials, thus providing a broader opportunity for the design of novel chemical structures and catalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Sonochemistry and Sonobiology: A novel ferrocene appended Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complex was developed as a potent sonosensitizer and ultrasound&#8208;activable CO&#8208;releasing molecule for synergistic sonodynamic therapy and CO gas therapy. The complex&#8208;induced apoptosis in cancer cells via 1O2 and &#8901;OH radical generation and release of CO.







Abstract
A novel ferrocene conjugated Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complex viz [Mn(Fc&#8208;tpy)(CO)3Br] (Mn2) where, Fc&#8208;tpy=4&#8242;&#8208;ferrocenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine was synthesized and fully characterized along with its non&#8208;ferrocene analog [Mn(Ph&#8208;tpy)(CO)3Br] Ph&#8208;tpy=4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (Mn1) for ultrasound (US) activated anticancer applications. The X&#8208;ray structure of Mn2 confirmed its distorted octahedral geometry. Mn1 and Mn2, for the first time, showed US&#8208;triggered release of CO and ROS generation (1O2 and &#8901;OH) in an aqueous solution from any Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl complexes, indicating its potential for synergetic CO gas therapy and sonodynamic therapy. The above&#8208;mentioned in&#8208;solution chemistry was successfully translated into in&#8197;vitro cellular models. These complexes showed unprecedented US&#8208;triggered toxicity against T&#8208;cell lymphoma and human breast cancer cells (IC50 for Mn2&lt;1&#8197;&#956;M) while were minimally toxic without US or against normal spleen and human embryonic kidney cells. Mn2 was ca. 12 fold more anticancer active than Mn1, indicating that the ferrocene conjugation augmented the US sensitivity. The apoptotic sonotoxicity of Mn2 was due to US&#8208;promoted mitochondrial depolarization via ROS generation and CO release. The apoptosis was triggered by caspase 3 activation. This is the first report of Mn(I)&#8208;tricarbonyl&#8208;based sonosensitizers for cancer SDT. Overall, this study, for the first time, establishes the effectiveness of 3d metal carbonyls in SDT.

         <title>A Photolockable Polyaromatic Capsule Designed via Regiochemical Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bent amphiphile featuring two 2&#8208;substituted anthracene panels, designed via the regiochemical substitution of a previous bent amphiphile with 9&#8208;substituted panels, quantitatively assembles into a well&#8208;defined polyaromatic capsule in water with improved host ability. Upon short light irradiation, the capsule and its host&#8208;guest composites undergo efficient intermolecular [4+4] photo&#8208;oligomerization in water, without release of the bound guests.







Abstract
Photocontrol over host frameworks is an elegant way to manipulate host&#8208;guest composites, yet the majority of previous systems suffer from long irradiation time and narrow guest scope, and are restricted to intramolecular photoreactions in organic solvents. Herein we present a photolockable polyaromatic capsule with high guest binding abilities in water. The capsule assembles from bent amphiphiles featuring two 2&#8208;subsutituted anthracene panels, which shows high stability against dilution and undergoes intermolecular [4+4] photo&#8208;oligomerization upon short light irradiation (&lt;10&#8197;min). The photolocked capsule provides a roughly spherical framework, with an average, core diameter of ~3&#8197;nm, composed of amphiphilic oligomers (e.&#8201;g., trimer). The new capsule shows improved host ability (up to 10&#8208;fold) in water toward various hydrophobic compounds (e.&#8201;g., organic and metal&#8208;complex dyes), as compared with an analogous, non&#8208;photolockable capsule with 9&#8208;subsutituted anthracene panels. In addition, the resultant dye&#8208;loaded capsules are also successfully photolocked via short irradiation with high retention of the bound dyes.

         <title>Origins of Catalysis in Non&#8208;Heme Fe(II)/2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Histone Lysine Demethylase KDM4A with Differently Methylated Histone H3 Peptides</title>

This study investigates the factors influencing Fe(II)/2OG KDM4A&#8208;mediated demethylation of three different trimethylated H3 substrates using MD, QM/MM, QM/MM MD, and QM/MM metadynamics simulations. The study reveals how SCS and LR residues, protein dynamics, active site geometry, and the intrinsic electric field of KDM4A affect the demethylation process, contributing valuable insights for developing substrate&#8208;specific inhibitors for JmjC KDMs.







Abstract
Histone lysine demethylase 4&#8197;A (KDM4A), a non&#8208;heme Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent oxygenase that catalyzes the demethylation of tri&#8208;methylated lysine residues at the 9, 27, and 36 positions of histone H3 (H3&#8197;K9me3, H3&#8197;K27me3, and H3&#8197;K36me3). These methylated residues show contrasting transcriptional roles; therefore, understanding KDM4A's catalytic mechanisms with these substrates is essential to explain the factors that control the different sequence&#8208;dependent demethylations. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD)&#8208;based combined quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods to investigate determinants of KDM4A catalysis with H3&#8197;K9me3, H3&#8197;K27me3 and H3&#8197;K36me3 substrates. In KDM4A&#8208;H3(5&#8211;14)K9me3 and KDM4A&#8208;H3(23&#8211;32)K27me3 ferryl complexes, the O&#8722;H distance positively correlates with the activation barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step, however in the KDM4A&#8208;H3(32&#8211;41)K36me3, no direct one&#8208;to&#8208;one relationship was found implying that the synergistic effects between the geometric parameters, second sphere interactions and the intrinsic electric field contribute for the effective catalysis for this substrate. The intrinsic electric field along the Fe&#8722;O bond changes between the three complexes and shows a positive correlation with the HAT activation barrier, suggesting that modulating electric field can be used for fine engineering KDM catalysis with a specific substrate. The results reveal how KDM4A uses a combination of strategies to enable near equally efficient demethylation of different H3Kme3 residues.

         <title>Front Cover: Origins of Catalysis in Non&#8208;Heme Fe(II)/2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Histone Lysine Demethylase KDM4A with Differently Methylated Histone H3 Peptides (Chem. Eur. J. 3/2025)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows three trimethylated histone H3 substrates to be demethylated by the non&#8208;heme FeII/2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent histone demethylase KDM4A, thus highlighting the roles of the enzyme&#8242;s dynamics, second coordination sphere and intrinsic electric field on the catalytic process. Molecular orbital visualization highlights the &#963;*dz2 orbital driving electron transfer during the hydrogen atom transfer. The study explored factors influencing KDM4A catalysis with differently methylated histone H3 peptides that could be targeted for developing substrate&#8208;specific inhibitors. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;Z. Christov and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403989).

The Cover Feature highlights the first report of ultrasound&#8208;active ferrocenyl&#8208;appended MnI tricarbonyl complex that is useful for sonodynamic cancer therapy. Under ultrasound exposure, this complex releases CO and generates ROS, including 1O&#8322; and &#8901;OH, leading to mitochondrial depolarization and apoptotic cancer cell death while sparing healthy cells. The artwork visually captures the triple&#8208;action mechanism and selective therapeutic potential of this innovative complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Koch, S. Banerjee and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202403454).

This review highlights that the synthesis of perylene (P) and perylene diimide (PDI) organic linkers, involves their integration into coordination frameworks of different dimensionalities &#8211; i.&#8201;e. 2D and 3D MOFs, and 0D MOCs. Additionally, the review highlights the structure&#8208;property relationships of P/PDI&#8208;based coordination frameworks for potential applications including electrochemical devices, photocatalysis, fluorescence sensing and photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of materials composed of coordinative interactions between metal ions and organic linkers, encompassing two&#8208;dimensional (2D), and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architectures. Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs), a special case of these species, are discrete molecular &#8220;capsules&#8221; with zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structures. Over the last two decades, MOFs and MOCs composed of organic perylene (P) and perylene diimide (PDI) linkers have gained much attention due to their versatile properties, which can be further enhanced after incorporation into frameworks. This minireview highlights recent progress in the construction and application of P/PDI&#8208;based coordination framework materials. The text offers an overview of the synthesis of P/PDI organic linkers, proceeds to their integration into coordination frameworks of different dimensionalities &#8211; 2D and 3D MOFs, and 0D MOCs, and then explores potential applications. These include sensing, photocatalysis, electrochemical devices and photothermal conversion and focus on the apparent structure&#8208;property relationships. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of P/PDI&#8208;derived coordination frameworks will be addressed.

         <title>Recent Advances in NIR&#8208;Switchable Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Based on Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 3, January 14, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated organic systems with multi&#8208;step redox behavior often exhibit electrochromic properties. Among them, organic molecules that can exhibit ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption are rare but have been developed rapidly. Isolation, structural determination, and electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements of multiple redox states are essential for a better understanding of their natures.







Abstract
Electrochromic systems capable of switching absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (750&#8211;2500&#8197;nm) are attractive from the viewpoint of applications for material and life science, and thus several examples have been reported to date.

&lt;p&gt;&#960;-Conjugated organic systems with multi-step redox behavior often exhibit electrochromic properties. Among them, organic molecules that can exhibit ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption are rare but have been developed rapidly. Isolation, structural determination, and electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements of multiple redox states are essential for a better understanding of their natures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochromic systems capable of switching absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region (750&#8211;2500&#8197;nm) are attractive from the viewpoint of applications for material and life science, and thus several examples have been reported to date. In general, the development of organic-based systems is needed to reduce the environmental impact and improve biocompatibility. Although extending the switchable spectral range is crucial for the application of organic electrochromic molecules, the switching of NIR absorption based on redox interconversion is still a challenging issue regarding reversibility and durability during interconversion. To overcome this potential instability, the introduction of heteroatoms into the molecular backbone and/or &#960;-extension could be useful strategies in terms of effective delocalization of charge and spin in the corresponding redox states. In this review, we focus on redox-active well-defined small molecules that enable ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption based on precise control of the redox states, and present recent studies on their intrinsic electrochemical and spectroscopic properties and/or structural characterization of their charged states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Dynamic crystals are an emerging class of engineering materials that possess unique ability to convert external energy into mechanical motion. However, the inherent defects of molecular crystals like brittleness, short&#8208;life and fatigue, have significantly impeded their practical applications. Building stimuli&#8208;response composites materials can be regarded as one of the ways to break through the current limitations of molecular crystals.







Abstract
Dynamic molecular crystals are an emerging class of smart engineering materials that possess unique ability to convert external energy into mechanical motion. Moreover, they have being considered as strong candidates for dynamic elements in applications such as flexible electronic devices, artificial muscles, sensors, and soft robots. However, the inherent defects of molecular crystals like brittleness, short&#8208;life and fatigue, have significantly impeded their practical applications. Inspired by the concept of &#8220;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&#8221; in the field of biology, building stimuli&#8208;response composites materials can be regarded as one of the ways to break through the current limitations of dynamic molecular crystals. Moreover, the hybrid materials can exhibit new functionalities that cannot be achieved by a single object. In this review, the focus was placed on the analysis and discussion of various hybrid strategies and options, as well as the functionalities of hybrid dynamic molecular crystal materials and the important practical applications of composite materials, with the introduction of photomechanical molecular crystals and flexible molecular crystals as a starting point. Moreover, the efficiency, limitations, and advantages of different hybrid methods were compared and discussed. Furthermore, the promising perspectives of smart dynamic molecular crystal materials were also discussed and the potential directions for future work were suggested.

         <title>Deciphering the Role of Crown&#8208;ether Receptor Orientation in C&#8208;H Oxidation Catalyzed by Supramolecular Nonheme FeIV(O) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding how modification of receptor position and orientation in a supramolecular catalyst affects its efficiency is key for rational catalyst design but still underexplored. Herein, we quantified the impact of different receptor orientations on the C&#8722;H oxidation efficiency by supramolecular Fe(IV)=O complexes. Overall, their efficiency is similar but some changes in the selectivity profile are observed.







Abstract
The outstanding efficiency and selectivity of enzymatic reactions, such as C&#8722;H oxidation by nonheme iron oxygenases, stems from a precise control of substrate positioning inside the active site. The resulting proximity between a specific moiety (a certain C&#8722;H bond) and the reactant (a FeIV(O) active species) translates into higher rates and selectivity, that can be in part replicated also with artificial supramolecular catalysts. However, structural modification of the position and orientation of the binding site both in enzymes and in artificial catalysts often leads to significant variations in reactivity that can be difficult to rationalize due to the system&#8216;s complexity. Herein, we quantitatively analyzed the impact of such a structural modification (namely receptor orientation) on the C&#8722;H oxidation reactivity (kinetics, Effective Molarity) and selectivity by comparing simple supramolecular FeIV(O) models. Overall, we did not observe significant differences in reaction rates, but we noticed slight changes in the selectivity profile. These results indicate that, when a crown&#8208;ether is employed as a recognition site, the key ingredient for enhanced reactivity is the presence of the supramolecular receptor itself rather than its exact orientation, providing a guide for the rational design of supramolecular catalysts.

         <title>A Fluorescent Probe Differentiates Apoptosis from Cysteine&#8208;Deprivation Ferroptosis through Imaging of Viscosity and Lipid Droplets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a unique fluorescent probe PS&#8208;NAP, a MMP independent molecule that can potentially target mitochondria and map elevated mitochondrial viscosity during different cellular stress. However, during ferroptosis induced by cysteine deprivation, PS&#8208;NAP exclusively colocalizes in newly generated lipid droplets (LDs), thus demarcating cysteine deprivation&#8208;induced ferroptosis from other cellular stresses such as apoptosis.







Abstract
Since death is an inevitable phenomenon, exploring cell deaths holds importance. During this process, the cellular microenvironment within cells such as pH, polarity, viscosity etc alter. One such microenvironment, viscosity elevates during different cell deaths. However, demarcating cell death processes solely based on viscosity sensing is challenging. Herein, we develop a unique fluorescent probe PS&#8208;NAP after careful investigation among three analogues for efficient viscosity imaging in HeLa cells. Cationic PS&#8208;NAP, a MMP independent molecular probe, can potentially target mitochondria and map elevated mitochondrial viscosity during apoptosis, starvation and drug induced ferroptosis processes. Notably, during ferroptosis induced by cysteine deprivation, PS&#8208;NAP exclusively colocalizes in newly generated lipid droplets (LDs) instead of mitochondria. Thus, the probe has a potential for demarcating cysteine deprivation&#8208;induced ferroptosis from other cellular stresses such as apoptosis.

         <title>Heterogeneous Catalytic Oxidations with In Situ&#8208;Generated Hypervalent Iodine&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous organic polymers (IA&#8208;POPs) with in&#8208;built o&#8208;iodobenzoic acid (IA) moieties, accessed by Friedel&#8208;Crafts polyalkylation, are demonstrated as exceptional heterogeneous precatalysts for i) oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds and diols to lactones, and ii) cleavage of olefins, vicinal diols, and acyloins in the presence of Oxone&#174;, producing hypervalent iodine(V) IBX.







Abstract
Porous organic polymers (POPs) are novel emergent materials for heterogeneous organocatalysis owing to their remarkable physicochemical stabilities. Through a bottom&#8208;up approach entailing diligent design of twisted biaryl building blocks with in&#8208;built o&#8208;iodobenzoic acid (IA) moieties, a series of POP precatalysts, p&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP, DiMeIA&#8208;POP, and m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP, were synthesized by employing Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. These IA&#8208;POP precatalysts can undergo in&#8197;situ oxidation in the presence of Oxone&#174; to generate hypervalent iodine(V) species (&#955;5&#8208;iodanes), in particular, modified o&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid, popularly termed IBX, which mediates diverse oxidative transformations. The applications of m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP as a heterogeneous precatalyst in the presence of Oxone&#174; are demonstrated for facile oxidation of i) primary and secondary alcohols to carbonyl compounds, ii) cleavage of olefins, vicinal diols, and acyloins into carboxylic acids and iii) oxidation of diols to lactones; the in&#8197;situ formation of the &#955;5&#8208;iodane species in catalytic amounts precludes potential explosive attributes of IBX. It is shown that the IA&#8208;precatalyst (m&#8208;OMeIA&#8208;POP) can be easily recycled without any loss of catalytic activity. The results constitute the first demonstration of the development of IA&#8208;bearing POP precatalysts for in&#8197;situ generation of hypervalent iodine(V) species and various heterogeneous oxidations mediated therefrom.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed 1,4&#8208;Dichloromethyldimerization of Alkenes with Chloroform: Access to Polychlorinated Vicinal Diaryl Alkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated strategy for directly synthesizing polychlorinated vicinal diaryl alkanes from aryl alkenes and chloroform is reported. Besides chloroform, this method also works with carbon tetrachloride, bromotrichloromethane, and &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylic esters, yielding 1,4&#8208;disubstituted vicinal diaryl alkanes. The approach uses simple, accessible materials, offering high selectivity, broad substrate scope, and mild conditions.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated strategy is reported for the direct synthesis of polychlorinated vicinal diaryl alkanes from aryl alkenes and chloroform. In this approach, two haloalkyl radicals generated from chloroform via halogen atom transfer (XAT) and direct single electron transfer (SET) within the same photoredox catalysis cycle enable the 1,4&#8208;dichloromethyldimerization of alkenes. Besides chloroform, this strategy is applicable to carbon tetrachloride, bromotrichloromethane, and &#945;&#8208;bromo carboxylic esters, yielding corresponding 1,4&#8208;disubstituted vicinal diaryl alkanes. Diverse polychlorinated structures containing highly congested vicinal quaternary carbon centers are effectively synthesized by this method. The potential of this reaction in late&#8208;stage drug modification is highlighted by the successful transformation of olefins with pharmaceutical structures.

         <title>The Doping of Al3+ at the Tetrahedral Site of Spinel Mn3O4 for Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn3O4 spinel structure is unique in having both tetrahedral and octahedral metal sites to bring about interesting electrocatalytic behaviors. The phase transition from MnAl&#8208;LDH to Al&#8208;Mn3O4 is realized by a one&#8208;step annealing strategy, Al3+ preferentially occupies the center of Mn(II)O4, leaving Mn(III) with redox activity located in the key octahedral position. The OER performance of Al&#8208;doped Mn3O4 is effectively enhanced.







Abstract
Spinel oxides have attracted much attention for electrocatalytic water oxidation. Specially, the Mn&#8208;based spinel structures merits fundamental investigation, as Mn is involved in water oxidation in natural photosynthesis. Herein, Al&#8208;doped Mn3O4 spinel electrocatalyst was prepared for water oxidation. The Al cations selectively occupy the tetrahedral sites of Mn3O4 spinel structure, leaving Mn(III) at the catalytically critical octahedral sites. The substitution of Al3+ regulated the electronic structure of Mn3O4, induced lattice distortion and produced higher concentration of oxygen vacancy to promote the water oxidation performance.

         <title>Towards White Light Emission Through Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer (MMCT) Effect in Bi3+ Activated Ca2YTi2&#8208;mZrmGa3O12 (0&#8804;m&#8804;2) Garnets</title>

The garnet, Ca2YTi2Ga3O12, was explored as a host for Bi3+ ions (CYT:Bi) and its associated emission behaviour. A broad emission in the yellow&#8208;orange region with a maxima at 552&#8197;nm attributed to the MMCT transitions (Bi3+&#8722;Ti4+ pair). The compound, Ca2YZr2Ga3O12: Bi3+ (CYTZ:Bi), exhibits emission the violet region with a maxima at 395&#8197;nm was due to the 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 transition (A&#8208;band emission). Both the compounds, CYT:Bi, and CYTZ:Bi, were shown to exhibit white light emission by suitable co&#8208;doping of Tm3+ and Sm3+ ions.







Abstract
Herein, we report the high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state synthesis and intriguing optical features of Bi3+/Ln3+ doped Ca2YTi2Ga3O12 (CYT). The optical properties of CYT were fine&#8208;tuned by judiciously substituting Zr4+ ions at Ti4+ sites and Bi3+, Ln3+ ions at Y3+ sites. All these compounds are crystallized in a cubic crystal system with an Ia&#8208;3d (no. 230) space group. The Bi3+ doped systems showed a broad photoluminescence (PL) band in the yellow&#8208;orange region centered at ~552&#8197;nm from the metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer state (MMCT). The yellow&#8208;orange emissive CYT:Bix was co&#8208;doped with blue emissive Tm3+ to obtain an excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent color tuneable white light phosphor CYT:Tm0.02Bi0.012. Substituting Zr4+ ions in place of Ti4+ ions in CYT gave rise to CYTZ (Ca2YTi2&#8208;mZrmGa3O12), which upon doping with Bi gave Ca2YZr2Ga3O12:Bix (CYZ:Bix) and they exhibit the 3P0,1&#8594;1S0 emission in the violet&#8208;indigo region ( &#955;em=395&#8197;nm; &#955;ex=315&#8197;nm). On co&#8208;doping CYTZ:Bix with Sm3+ ions produced white light emissive Ca2YTi0.1Zr1.9Ga3O12:Bi3+; Sm3+, (CYTZ:Bi3+; Sm3+). CYT:Bix showed slower (microsecond) PL decay than the CYZ:Bix (nanosecond). The crystal structure, steady state, and time&#8208;resolved optical studies, and semiempirical calculations were employed to rationalize the observed optical features of these compounds. The optical features of CYT:Bi0.1, were explored for potential applications in secret writing.

         <title>Electrochemically Mediated Synthesis of Cyanated Heterocycles from &#945;&#8208;amino Esters, Pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes and NH4SCN as Cyano Group Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work reveals a mechanistically and conceptually rich electrochemical approach to the construction of CN&#8208;functionalized heterocycles from easily available substrates using the symbiosis of anodic oxidation of SCN anion to cyanide and cascade cyclization with Shono&#8208;type oxidation of saturated C&#8722;N bonds to C=N bonds.







Abstract
The electrochemically mediated cyanation/annulation process with in&#8197;situ cyanide ion generation from NH4SCN and multi&#8208;step oxidative construction of CN&#8208;functionalized heterocycles from easily available &#945;&#8208;amino esters and pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehydes has been discovered. Depending on the nature of the &#945;&#8208;amino ester, 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates, 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208; and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridines&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles, and the first reported 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles were obtained. The electrosynthesis is carried out in an undivided electrochemical cell under constant current conditions. The success of the discovered electrochemical synthesis is based on the combination of two anodic processes: oxidation of SCN anion to CN anion and oxidation of C&#8722;N bonds to C=N bonds during heterocycle construction. Mechanistic studies based on CV measurements, and control experiments confirm the generation of [CN] species from NH4SCN with subsequent addition to an imine formed from &#945;&#8208;amino esters and pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carbaldehyde. Computational analysis suggests that for reactive intermediates from glycine esters, the subsequent 5&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization leading to 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates is more favourable and the 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization leading to 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitriles is less favourable. For &#945;&#8208;amino esters with alkyl or aryl substituents, both cyclization pathways are relatively thermodynamically possible. The leading 4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;pyrido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbonitrile showed high fungicidal activity against phytopathogenic fungi.

     alt="Electrochemically Mediated Synthesis of Cyanated Heterocycles from &#945;-amino Esters, Pyridine-2-carbaldehydes and NH4SCN as Cyano Group Source"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present work reveals a mechanistically and conceptually rich electrochemical approach to the construction of CN-functionalized heterocycles from easily available substrates using the symbiosis of anodic oxidation of SCN anion to cyanide and cascade cyclization with Shono-type oxidation of saturated C&#8722;N bonds to C=N bonds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemically mediated cyanation/annulation process with &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; cyanide ion generation from NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SCN and multi-step oxidative construction of CN-functionalized heterocycles from easily available &#945;-amino esters and pyridine-2-carbaldehydes has been discovered. Depending on the nature of the &#945;-amino ester, 1-cyano-imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxylates, 3-alkyl- and 3-aryl-imidazo[1,5-a]pyridines-1-carbonitriles, and the first reported 4-oxo-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine-1-carbonitriles were obtained. The electrosynthesis is carried out in an undivided electrochemical cell under constant current conditions. The success of the discovered electrochemical synthesis is based on the combination of two anodic processes: oxidation of SCN anion to CN anion and oxidation of C&#8722;N bonds to C=N bonds during heterocycle construction. Mechanistic studies based on CV measurements, and control experiments confirm the generation of [CN] species from NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SCN with subsequent addition to an imine formed from &#945;-amino esters and pyridine-2-carbaldehyde. Computational analysis suggests that for reactive intermediates from glycine esters, the subsequent 5-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-trig cyclization leading to 1-cyano-imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxylates is more favourable and the 6-&lt;i&gt;exo&lt;/i&gt;-trig cyclization leading to 4-oxo-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine-1-carbonitriles is less favourable. For &#945;-amino esters with alkyl or aryl substituents, both cyclization pathways are relatively thermodynamically possible. The leading 4-oxo-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine-1-carbonitrile showed high fungicidal activity against phytopathogenic fungi.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Elastomers and Coatings via Metal Coordination Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarized the self&#8208;healing performance and mechanical properties of elastomers and coatings based on coordination bonds. Metal&#8208;ligand coordination structures can form metal ion clusters or induce microphase separation in polymer matrix, which can effectively dissipate mechanical energy and endowing the material with self&#8208;healing capabilities.







Abstract
Self&#8208;healing materials can recover the materials from physical damage, and extend the life of equipment. Metal coordination bonds are supramolecular interactions with tunable stability and sensitivity to external stimuli, which are crucial for developing self&#8208;healing materials. Incorporating metal coordination bonds into elastomers and coatings can enable materials to repair damage and enhance material performance. This review details the advance in self&#8208;healing elastomers and coatings. The structural characteristics, mechanical properties, and self&#8208;healing efficacy of these materials are discussed, and a perspective on the challenges and development directions is given.

         <title>pH&#8208; and Saccharide&#8208;Responsive Cyclometalated Iridium(III) Complexes with Boronic Acid Moieties Displaying a Wide Range of Phosphorescence Colors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single compounds that display a wide range of luminescent colors are attractive as sensing materials. Novel cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes bearing two boronic acid moieties, which emit phosphorescent colors ranging from orange to greenish&#8208;blue depending on the solution pH and saccharide concentration, were developed.







Abstract
Single compounds displaying a wide range of luminescent colors are attractive optical materials for sensor applications. In this study, we present the beneficial combination of a cyclometalated iridium(III) complex scaffold and boronic acid units for designing stimulus&#8208;responsive luminescent materials with various emission colors. Five iridium(III) complexes bearing a diboronic acid ligand (bpyB2) were synthesized: Ir(C^N)bpyB2 (C^N=2&#8208;phenylpyridine (1), 2&#8208;(2,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)pyridine (2), 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)pyridine (3), benzo[h]quinoline (4), 1&#8208;phenylisoquinoline (5)). The luminescence color of Complexes 1&#8211;4 changed in response to the solution pH or saccharide concentration. Complex 1 exhibited a color change from orange to green&#8208;blue due to structural alteration of the boronic acid moiety from trigonal to tetrahedral. Furthermore, the luminescence color of Complex 1 changed reversibly due to repetitive changes in the solution pH between 5 and 10, enabling tuning of the luminescence color and pH tracking. Furthermore, the color range was tuned by selecting an appropriate C^N ligand. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory investigations revealed that the dramatic and reversible color changes could be ascribed to a switch in the electronic distribution in the lowest excited state from bpyB2 to C^N. The stimulus&#8208;responsive iridium(III) complexes provide a prospective scaffold for future applications in color&#8208;tunable optical devices and chemosensing systems.

         <title>Transition Metal Based Spin&#8208;Tuned Charge Transfer in Single&#8208;Molecule Junctions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article presents an investigation into the conductivity of single&#8208;molecule wires featuring a ligand backbone with two different metal centers&#8208;Co2+ and Zn2+. This study emphasizes a significant method for examining metal&#8208;ligand interactions at the single&#8208;molecule scale, for both spin and non&#8208;spin systems. The findings could have implications for our understanding of electron transport in systems with metal atoms.







Abstract
Investigating the correlation between metal coordination and molecular conductivity in single&#8208;molecule systems is essential for advancing our knowledge of molecular electronics, particularly in the realm of spintronics. In the present study, we developed two complex wires utilizing the bipyridine ligand and two transition metal ions, Co2+ and Zn2+, aiming to study the impact of different spin characters on single&#8208;molecule charge transport properties. Single&#8208;molecule conductance was investigated using scanning tunnelling microscope breaking junctions (STM&#8208;BJ) technique and the underlying mechanism was analysed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We demonstrated that the conductance predominantly increases after inserting Zn2+, indicating a conducting channel has been constructed. In contrast, the conductance of the analogue coordinated with Co2+ does not change significantly, this can be explained by distinct disparities between spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down channels, in which destructive quantum interference in spin&#8208;down state counteracts the enhancement of molecular conductance. Our study establishes the groundwork for a systematic approach to the design, fabrication, and implementation of single&#8208;complex conductance explorations.

         <dc:description>
A photosensitizer&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free C&#8722;N coupling of aldehydes with azoles was described. The coupling reagent was directly excited by light to obtain the product in high yield, and this strategy was successfully applied to gram&#8208;scale reactions and late&#8208;modification of various drug molecules and natural products.







Abstract
A catalyst&#8208;free photochemical N&#8208;acylation of azoles with aldehydes has been developed using inexpensive BrCCl3 as the oxidant. This transition&#8208;metal&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free amidation proceeded efficiently with a wide variety of substrates to give the corresponding N&#8208;acylazoles, including for the late modification of pharmaceutically active molecules, and on a gram&#8208;scale.

         <title>Anodic Activation of Prussian Blue Analog Leads to Highly Active Cobalt&#8208;Doped Nickel (Oxy)Hydroxide for Organic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anodic activation of NiCo Prussian blue analog yields a highly active Co&#8208;doped Ni(O)OH catalyst with nanosheet architecture, enabling efficient and selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. This catalyst achieves up to 97&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for the production of benzoic acid and industrial&#8208;level current densities at low applied potential, outperforming conventional pristine Ni and Co&#8208;based analogs.







Abstract
Water&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols into valuable chemicals is a promising strategy to circumvent the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation, while also reducing cell voltage and improving energy efficiency. Recently, transition metal (TM)&#8208;based catalysts have been investigated for anodic alcohol oxidation, but success has been limited due to competition from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within the working regime. In this study, NiCo&#8208;based Prussian blue analog (PBA) was electrochemically activated at the anodic potential to produce a Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH active catalyst with a nanosheet&#8208;like architecture. This catalyst was further employed for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (PhCH2OH) to benzoic acid (PhCOOH), achieving a 97&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE). The electrochemical activity of Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH was also compared with hydrothermally prepared CoNi&#8208;LDH, demonstrating that the PBA&#8208;derived Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH was more effective.

     alt="Anodic Activation of Prussian Blue Analog Leads to Highly Active Cobalt-Doped Nickel (Oxy)Hydroxide for Organic Oxidation Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anodic activation of NiCo Prussian blue analog yields a highly active Co-doped Ni(O)OH catalyst with nanosheet architecture, enabling efficient and selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol. This catalyst achieves up to 97&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for the production of benzoic acid and industrial-level current densities at low applied potential, outperforming conventional pristine Ni and Co-based analogs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water-assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols into valuable chemicals is a promising strategy to circumvent the sluggish kinetics of water oxidation, while also reducing cell voltage and improving energy efficiency. Recently, transition metal (TM)-based catalysts have been investigated for anodic alcohol oxidation, but success has been limited due to competition from the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within the working regime. In this study, NiCo-based Prussian blue analog (PBA) was electrochemically activated at the anodic potential to produce a Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH active catalyst with a nanosheet-like architecture. This catalyst was further employed for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (PhCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) to benzoic acid (PhCOOH), achieving a 97&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (FE). The electrochemical activity of Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH was also compared with hydrothermally prepared CoNi-LDH, demonstrating that the PBA-derived Co&#8722;Ni(O)OH was more effective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>De Novo Design of Lipopeptide&#8208;Based &#946;&#8208;Sheet&#8208;Like Self&#8208;Assemblies: A Strategy to Develop Fusion Inhibitors as Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antivirals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Membrane&#8208;assisted supramolecular self&#8208;assembly and &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like organization of a lipopeptide inhibit fusion and combat infections from enveloped viruses.







Abstract
The recent surge in emerging viral infections warrants the design of broad&#8208;spectrum antivirals. We aim to develop a lead molecule that targets a common biochemical feature of many enveloped viruses, membrane fusion. To achieve the broad&#8208;spectrum ability, instead of targeting the fusion machinery, we plan to modulate the physicochemical properties of the host and viral membranes to block fusion. The approach is based on the Coronin&#8208;1 protein of Mycobacterium, which presumably inhibits the phagosome&#8208;lysosome fusion, and a unique Trp&#8211;Asp (WD) sequence is placed at the distorted &#946;&#8208;meander motif. We designed a WD&#8208;based branched lipopeptide (Myr&#8208;D(WD)2) that supported the intermolecular interactions to create a &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like supramolecular assembly at the membrane surface. TEM and confocal fluorescence experiments also suggest that the lipopeptide self&#8208;assembled at the bilayer interface and modulated the interfacial order and the water penetration. We demonstrated that the supramolecular organization of Myr&#8208;D(WD)2 could block artificial membrane fusion completely and restrict pH&#8208;dependent influenza virus (H1N1, H9N2), and pH&#8208;independent mouse hepatitis virus, human coronavirus (HCoV&#8208;OC43) infections. The present study provided an evidence&#8208;based broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral potential of a designed self&#8208;assembled lipopeptide.

         <title>Reversed Allylation of 3&#8208;Alkenyl Indoles Using Allyl Boronic Acids: Access to Tryptamine Based Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique indole&#8208;C2&#8208;reverse allylation is reported employing allyl boronic acid in the absence of any catalyst and additive. The electrophilic vinylogous&#8208;imine&#8208;like structure generated by dearomatization of 3&#8208;alkenyl indole first undergoes N&#8594;B chelation which eventually drives the selective 1,2&#8208;allylation and aromaticity of indole nucleus is regained by alkene isomerization, rendering the process redox&#8208;neutral. This method enabled the first total syntheses of brocaeloid C, penindolene C, fluevirine E and mucronatin B.







Abstract
All&#8208;carbon quaternary and tertiary stereocenters connected at the C2&#8208;position of functionalizable C3&#8208;alkylated indole nucleus are commonly occurring frameworks found in many indole alkaloids of medicinal importance. Their direct access is scarcely reported, a long&#8208;standing problem, and developing a unique yet simple method can pave the pathway to an entirely different retrosynthetic route for the total synthesis of these alkaloids. Herein, this problem is addressed by developing an unprecedented branch&#8208;selective allylation strategy employing a broad range of structurally and electronically different 3&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;indoles and allylboronic acids. The use of readily accessible starting precursors renders this method attractive for the total synthesis of indole alkaloids. The present strategy shows excellent functional group tolerance, atom economic, redox&#8208;neutral, scalable and easy to operate. The DFT calculation on the possible transition states indicated that allylboronic acid acts as a nucleophile rather than a more reactive boroxine. Mechanistically, this strategy is designed by exploiting the loss as well as regaining the indole's aromaticity. The utility of this method is demonstrated in the total syntheses of seven prenylated tryptamine alkaloids and the first total syntheses of dimeric indole alkaloids, fluevirine E and mucronatin B.

         <title>Recent Progress in Atomically Precise Cu&#8722;M Alloy Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review encapsulates recent progress in efficient synthetic methodologies and structural elucidation techniques tailored for Cu&#8722;M alloy nanoclusters. It underscores the intrinsic physical and chemical properties that enable precise control over their sizes and surface characteristics. Illustrative instances of Cu&#8722;M alloy nanoclusters are leveraged to showcase their photoluminescent and catalytic traits, shedding light on their multifaceted functionalities and prospective applications.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (NCs) with dimensions of approximately 3&#8197;nm serve as a crucial link between metal&#8208;organic complexes and metal nanoparticles, garnering significant interest due to their distinctive molecule&#8208;like characteristics. These include well&#8208;defined molecular structures, clear HOMO&#8211;LUMO transitions, quantized charge, and robust luminescence emission. Atomically precise alloy NCs, in contrast to homometallic NCs, exhibit a wealth of structures and intriguing properties, with their novel attributes often intricately tied to the positions of alloyed elements within the structure, facilitating the exploration of structure&#8208;property relationships. A notable subgroup within this category comprises Cu&#8722;M (where M represents metals such as Au, Ag, Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt, Zn, Al etc.) alloy NCs. In this review, we initially outline recent advancements in the development of efficient synthetic techniques for Cu&#8722;M alloy NCs, emphasizing the underlying physical and chemical properties that enable precise control over their sizes and surface characteristics. Subsequently, we delve into recent progress in structural elucidation techniques for Cu&#8722;M alloy NCs. This structural insight is instrumental in comprehensively understanding the structure&#8208;property correlations at the molecular level. Finally, we showcase various examples of Cu&#8722;M alloy NCs to illustrate their photoluminescent and catalytic properties, shedding light on their diverse functionalities and potential applications.

A supramolecular fluorescent material is constructed by using double&#8208;cavity twisted cucurbit[14]uril (tQ[14]) and positively charged Astrazon Pink FG (APFG) based on the non&#8208;covalent host&#8208;guest interaction. The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect induces the APFG@tQ[14] probe to emit a strong orange&#8208;red fluorescence.

In this study, a supramolecular fluorescent material was constructed by using double&#8208;cavity twisted cucurbit[14]uril (tQ[14]) and positively charged Astrazon Pink FG (APFG) based on the non&#8208;covalent host&#8208;guest interaction for the first time. The thermodynamic parameters of the APFG@tQ[14] in aqueous solution were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), the results indicated that the spontaneous assembly of APFG@tQ[14] is mainly driven by enthalpy. The intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect induced the APFG@tQ[14] probe to emit a strong orange&#8208;red fluorescence. Due to its good optical properties and low toxicity, APFG@tQ[14] was successfully applied to multi&#8208;channel imaging of HK2 cells. This demonstrates the great potential of APFG@tQ[14] in labeling and tracking living cells.

         <title>In situ Selenization Induced Electron&#8208;Rich Pd with Weakened O2 Adsorption for Boosted Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd cocatalysts show great potential for the photocatalytic production of H2O2. However, the catalytic efficiency of Pd cocatalyst is limited due to the strong adsorption of O2, which promotes O&#8208;O bond cleavage and thus reduces selectivity for the two&#8208;electron O2 reduction reaction. Considering that adjusting the electron density of Pd can predominately optimize Pd&#8208;Oads bond strength, in this work, electron&#8208;rich Pd sites are constructed by introducing Bi2Se3 middle layer between Pd cocatalysts and (010) facet of BiVO4 using an in&#8208;situ selenization strategy. The photocatalytic results indicate that the designed BiVO4/Bi2Se3&#8208;Pd(0.3%) photocatalyst achieves a high H2O2 yield of 2166 &#956;mol L&#8208;&#185; in 2 h, which is 36 times and 3.75 times higher than BiVO4/Bi2Se3 and BiVO4/Pd photocatalyst, respectively. Additionally, the corresponding AQE value of BiVO4/Bi2Se3&#8208;Pd is 6.71%. The subsequent Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and XPS spectra confirm that the introduction of Bi2Se3 via in&#8208;situ selenization increases the electron density of Pd. This enhances the formation of electron&#8208;rich Pd sites, reduces O2 adsorption, and ultimately improves the photocatalytic H2O2 yield. This strategy provides insights into designing efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production through electronic structure modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures and Properties of Axially Chiral (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;Nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;Tetraenoate Derivatives Highly Substituted by Aryl groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprecedented (2E,4E,6Z,8Z)&#8208;nona&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetraenoate derivatives highly substituted by aryl groups have been synthesized by the reaction of rhodium complexes having aryl&#8208;substituted hexa&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trienyl ligands with acrylates. These compounds have potential axial chirality, and their enantiomers are isolable by the chiral HPLC technique. Although the racemization barrier of isolated enantiomers was not high, it was found that a cyclic dimer synthesized by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail transesterification of a modified analog has quite a stable axial chirality even at a high temperature. From a structural analogy with tetraphenylethene, those compounds are emissive in the solid state, and the chiral cyclic dimer exhibits solid&#8208;state circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Monosubstituted [n]Paracyclophane using a Desymmetrization/Kinetic Resolution Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically pure monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes are promising candidates for material synthesis, asymmetric catalysis, and drug discovery. Thus far, only a few catalytic asymmetric synthesis processes have been reported for assessing these stained atropisomers. In this study, we describe a highly enantioselective synthesis of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes by combining desymmetrization and kinetic resolution. The proposed protocol involves Pd&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8211;H bond olefination enabled by a monoprotected amino acid ligand, which affords a variety of monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes with excellent enantioselectivity (&#8805;99% ee). Thermodynamic experiments are conducted to investigate the racemization barrier. The synthesized monosubstituted [n]paracyclophanes exhibit vivid fluorescence and impressive circularly polarized luminescence. Further, the emission color and dissymmetry factor can be tuned and controlled by switching the substituent on the benzene ring of the cyclophanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Propargylations of Azinium Ions&#160;via&#160;Hydroxydihydroazine Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nucleophilic propargylation of azinium ions with a propargylboronate proceeds efficiently under gold(I) catalysis. A range of N&#8208;alkylated pyridinium, quinolinium, and pyrazinium ions undergo propargylation with good yields and high regioselectivities to give various functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,2&#8208;dihydropyridines, 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines, 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines, and 4,5&#8208;dihydropyrazines. No allenylation side&#8208;products are observed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insight into the mechanisms of these reactions. Hydroxydihydroazine &#160;intermediates formed by the addition of LiOH to the azinium ions were found to be the reactive electrophiles in these reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemically induced dimerization/proximity (CID/CIP) systems controlled by chemical dimerizers (also known as molecular glues) provide valuable means for understanding and manipulating complex, dynamic biological systems. In this study, we present the development of versatile chemo&#8208;optogenetic systems utilizing azobenzene&#8208;based photoswitchable molecular glues (sMGs) for reversible protein dimerization controlled by visible light. These systems allow multiple cycles of light&#8208;induced dimerization, overcoming the limitations of irreversible photolysis in previous systems. Through optimizing photoswitch properties and linker strategies, we achieved efficient and reversible control using blue, green, and red light. We demonstrate that these systems enable rapid and reversible control of protein function in vitro and in cells. The findings represent a significant advancement in chemo&#8208;optogenetics, offering opportunities to expand applications requiring precise spatiotemporal regulation of dynamic biological processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8211;Bismuth Tricycles: Maximizing Stability by Constraint</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constrained peptides possess excellent properties for identifying lead compounds in drug discovery. While it has become increasingly straightforward to discover selective high&#8208;affinity peptide ligands, especially through genetically encoded libraries, their stability and bioavailability remain significant challenges. By integrating macrocyclization chemistry with bismuth binding, we generated series of linear, cyclic, bicyclic, and tricyclic peptides with identical sequences. Utilizing bismuth to rigidify the peptide structure allows for a better comparison of different constraint levels, reducing confounding effects of interactions often seen with hydrophobic stapling reagents. Our study facilitated the identification of a peptide&#8211;bismuth tricycle that fully withstands cellular levels of glutathione, acts as a nanomolar protease inhibitor without being proteolytically digested by its target, and is fully stable in human plasma. Importantly, this multicyclic peptide does not possess any non&#8208;canonical amino acid modifications. Using oxime ligation, we conjugated an analogue of this tricycle to the N&#8208;terminus of two nanobodies to demonstrate potential applications in targeted therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic reduction of imines with silylformates: Formation of silyl carbamates through CO2 insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silylformates are emerging surrogates of hydrosilanes, able to reduce carbonyl groups in transfer hydrosilylation reactions, with the concomitant release of CO2. In this work, a new reactivity is revealed for silylformates, in the presence of imines. Using ruthenium catalysts, and lithium iodide as a co&#8208;catalyst, imines are shown to undergo hydrocarboxysilylation by formal insertion of CO2 to the N&#8208;Si bond of silyl amine to yield silyl carbamates in excellent yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Dependent Chemoselective Amide or Thioamide Ligation of Acylsilanes with Amines using Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the diverse chemical and physical properties of functional groups, mild and controllable ligation methods are often required to construct complex drugs and functional materials. To make diverse sets of products with tunable physicochemical properties, it is also useful to employ complimentary ligation methods that adopt the same starting materials. Here, we disclose the efficient and modular synthesis of amides or thioamides through the chemical ligation of acyl silanes with amines, simply by turning a light on or off. This method is fast, mild, high&#8208;yielding and displays excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance. The versatility of these reactions is highlighted by their ability to perform post&#8208;synthetic modifications on a variety of marketed medications, peptides, natural substances, and compounds with biological activity. In&#8208;depth computational and experimental studies clarified the photo&#8208;dependent umpolung of reactivity of acyl silanes, namely: photoexcitation leads to nucleophilic O&#8208;silyl carbenes that react with S8 to form O&#8208;silyl thionoesters and eventually amides. In contrast, acyl silanes react as electrophiles with amines thermally in the dark, with C&#8594;O silyl transfer, prior to reacting with S8 to form thioamides. These mechanistic details are expected to guide the development of similar coupling reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>pH Controlled Transient Cyclization of Peptides for Increased Stability towards Oral Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral delivery of peptides is challenged by low bioavailability. Here, pH responsive linearization of cyclic peptides is described as a strategy for transient protection of peptides to extend their half&#8208;life in model systems. Peptides were cyclized to increase their stability at the low pH in the stomach, while they linearize at neutral pH. This led to PYY3&#8208;36 analogues with pH responsive linearization for increased stability.







Abstract
Peptides are highly efficient for treatment of many diseases, especially in oncology and diabetes. Oral delivery of peptides is desirable, but is challenged by low bioavailability and new chemical methods to enable oral delivery are needed. Here, we developed pH responsive linearization as a strategy for transient protection of peptides to extend their half&#8208;life in model systems. Peptides were cyclized to increase their stability at the low pH in the stomach, while they linearize at neutral pH to form the active peptide. We developed ester based responsive linkers with a protonable amine for O&#8208;to&#8208;N acyl shift, which allowed linearization strategies based on pyroglutamoyl (pGlu) or diketopiperazine (DKP) formation. After coupling of the linker, peptides were cyclized by CuAAC. We studied the stability against simulated gastric fluid (SGF) at different pH and the ability of cyclic peptides to linearize. This led to PYY3&#8211;36 analogues with pH responsive linearization for increased stability.

         <title>Facile and Regioselective Deuteration of C2&#8208;Alkylated Imidazolium Salts in the Presence of Cesium Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C2&#8208;alkylated imidazolium salts are readily and regioselectively deuterated on their C2&#945; exocyclic position and/or C4=C5 heterocyclic backbone using D2O, a cheap, non&#8208;toxic deuterium source, and Cs2CO3, a weak, innocuous, inorganic base. This simple and efficient procedure eases the access to valuable isotopomers of compounds that are widely employed as bioactive molecules, ionic liquids, organocatalysts, and carbene ligand precursors.







Abstract
Thirteen imidazolium iodides bearing benzyl, mesityl, or 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl substituents on their nitrogen atoms, and C1&#8211;C4 alkyl chains on their C2 carbon atom were readily deuterated with D2O as a cheap and non&#8208;toxic deuterium source in the presence of Cs2CO3, a weak, innocuous, inorganic base. The isotopic exchange proceeded quickly and efficiently under mild, aerobic conditions to afford a range of aNHC and NHO precursors regioselectively labeled on their C2&#945; exocyclic position and/or C4=C5 heterocyclic backbone. A &#8220;carbene&#8208;free&#8221; mechanism was postulated, in which the carbonate anion acts as a catalyst to activate an exocyclic, acidic C&#8722;H bond and ease a deuterium transfer from D2O to the imidazolium salt in a concerted fashion.

         <title>Optoelectronic Properties and Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Application of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Derived From 2,6&#8208;DicarboxyBODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized BODIPY dyes with benzyl ester and carboxylic acid groups, showing charge transfer, polarity&#8208;dependent triplet state formation, and pH&#8208;dependent emission. Fluorescence lifetime microscopy revealed distinct lifetime gradients in colon cancer cells and pig enteroids. These results highlight the potential of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPYs as fluorescent probes for cancer and stem cell imaging.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor BODIPY dyads, functionalized at the 2 and 6 positions with benzyl ester (BDP&#8208;DE) or carboxylic acid (BDP&#8208;DA) groups, were synthesized, and their optoelectronic properties were investigated. Carbonyl groups were found to increase the reduction potential of the BODIPY core by 0.15&#8211;0.4&#8197;eV compared to regular alkyl&#8208;substituted BODIPYs. These compounds exhibited efficient intramolecular charge separation and triplet state formation through the spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process, achieving singlet oxygen quantum yields of up to 92&#8201;%, depending on the solvent polarity. Notably, the fluorescence and singlet oxygen generation of BDP&#8208;DAs were found to depend on the ionization state of the carboxylic groups. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements revealed that complexation of BDP&#8208;DAs with bovine serum albumine (BSA) significantly extended their excited state lifetimes. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) studies of human colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) cells and pig small intestinal organoids (enteroids) provided insights into subcellular localization. The diacid with 2,4&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl group at the meso&#8208;position (DA1) displayed longer lifetimes in lipid&#8208;droplet&#8208;like structures and shorter lifetimes in cytoplasmic regions. The diacid containing a meso&#8208;anthracenyl group (DA2) formed &#8242;islands&#8217; in cell monolayers, exhibiting a distinct lifetime gradient from the periphery to the center. These results highlight the potential of donor&#8208;acceptor BODIPYs as fluorescent probes for biological imaging, particularly in revealing subtle differences in cellular environments.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay of cTnI with Ruthenium&#8208;Based Metal Covalent Organic Framework and Dual DNAzymes Cascade Amplification Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous structural Ru&#8208;MCOF acts as a microreactor with a nanoconfinement effect, accelerating co&#8208;reactant diffusion and promoting ECL emitter excitation. Combined with dual DNAzymes&#8208;driven catalytic hairpin amplification, an ECL immunosensor was constructed for sensitive cTnI detection with high sensitivity and accuracy. The high&#8208;stable Ru&#8208;MCOF opens a new approach for the exploitation of MCOF&#8208;based luminophores for early clinical diagnosis.







Abstract
Currently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunability and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high stability are promising nanomaterials for electrochemiluminescence (ECL), while Ru&#8208;based metal covalent organic frameworks (Ru&#8208;MCOFs) have rarely been reported. Herein, an ECL immunosensor based on a strong ECL&#8208;emitting Ru&#8208;MCOF was proposed for the sensitive detection of the cardiac troponin&#8208;I (cTnI). Imine&#8208;linked Ru&#8208;MCOF was prepared as an ECL emitter via solvothermal method using tris (4,4&#8242; &#8208;diamino&#8208;2,2&#8242; &#8208;bipyridine) ruthenium (II) (Ru(dbpy)32+) as a precursor. Compared with monomers, the imine&#8208;linked Ru&#8208;MCOF achieved structural extension through covalent bonds, which not only effectively facilitated the electrochemical activation of the luminophores, but also shortened the transmission distance between electrons and co&#8208;reactants, generating significant ECL emission. In addition, the porous Ru&#8208;MCOF provided a microreactor with nanoconfinement effect, which could accelerate the diffusion of co&#8208;reactants into the framework and promote the excitation of internal and external ECL emitters, significantly enhancing the ECL intensity. Considering the excellent ECL performance of Ru&#8208;MCOF, combined with dual DNAzymes&#8208;driven catalytic hairpin amplification, the ECL immunosensor achieved sensitive detection of cTnI with a detection limit as low as 0.42&#8197;fg/mL. The proposed highly stable Ru&#8208;MCOF raises a new approach for exploring MCOF&#8208;based luminophores, highlighting the potential of MCOFs in advanced ECL emitters.

Compared with monomers, the imine-linked Ru-MCOF achieved structural extension through covalent bonds, which not only effectively facilitated the electrochemical activation of the luminophores, but also shortened the transmission distance between electrons and co-reactants, generating significant ECL emission. In addition, the porous Ru-MCOF provided a microreactor with nanoconfinement effect, which could accelerate the diffusion of co-reactants into the framework and promote the excitation of internal and external ECL emitters, significantly enhancing the ECL intensity. Considering the excellent ECL performance of Ru-MCOF, combined with dual DNAzymes-driven catalytic hairpin amplification, the ECL immunosensor achieved sensitive detection of cTnI with a detection limit as low as 0.42&#8197;fg/mL. The proposed highly stable Ru-MCOF raises a new approach for exploring MCOF-based luminophores, highlighting the potential of MCOFs in advanced ECL emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Metal&#8208;Mediated Molecular Switching of a Phosphaethene Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;triggered isomerization of truxene&#8208;based phosphaalkene Z&#8208;P1 gives approx. 15&#8201;% E&#8208;isomer in the photostationary state. In contrast, gold (I) coordination affords the selective inversion of the phosphaalkene stereochemistry yielding quantitatively [AuCl(E&#8208;P1)]







Abstract
This experimental and theoretical study illustrates how phosphaalkenes, which are isolobal to alkenes, can utilize a variety of external triggers for molecular switching. The E/Z isomerization of a truxene&#8208;based phosphaalkene, i.&#8201;e. TruxC=P&#8208;Mes* (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tris&#8208;t&#8208;butyl&#8208;benzene), is accomplished by irradiation, metal coordination, or deprotonation of the truxene core. The reversible and quantitative Z/E double bond isomerization by gold(I) coordination/decoordination of the phosphorous lone pair represents a novel fuelling strategy for molecular switches.

         <title>Luminescence and Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species in Solution by Ta6Br12 Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unprecedently reveals the NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence of {Ta6Br12}2+ cluster complexes dissolved in water and deuterated water, with lifetimes ranging from nanoseconds to microseconds. DFT calculations indicate that the emission is mainly associated with fluorescence transitions. Reaction with O&#8322; promotes partial quenching of the luminescence and the generation of peroxide and superoxide radical species.







Abstract
An intrinsic metal cluster NIR&#8208;II emission of the {Ta6Br12}2+ aqua/hydroxocomplexes was determined in aqueous solutions under inert atmosphere. The photoluminescence (PL) is enhanced in D2O, and the lifetime scale expands from nanoseconds to microseconds. Possible cluster emission transitions have been assigned and analyzed from a computational perspective. In the presence of O2, the cluster compound kept its robustness but showed partial quenching of the PL. Stern&#8208;Volmer and laser&#8208;flash photolysis studies confirmed that quenching is mainly associated with O2 diffusion. Laser&#8208;flash photolysis experiments showed that singlet oxygen (1O2) was not detected under measurement conditions. Generation of peroxide and superoxide radical species after irradiation in D2O was confirmed by using luminol as a probe, whereas no hydroxide radical species were detected as evidenced by the emission of the 3&#8208;coumarin carboxylic acid (3&#8208;CCA) molecular sensor.

         <title>Exploring the Metal&#8208;Centered Reactivity of Isomeric, N&#8208;Bridged Biscyclometalated Platinum(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of platinum chemistry is ubiquitous in the research of anticancer drugs and new OLED materials. Within the vast library of existing compounds, the majority of work focuses on complexes in the +2 and +4 oxidation states, with comparatively few examples of PtIII complexes reported without bridging ligands. PtIII complexes with metal&#8208;metal bonding can be made by mild oxidation of PtII complexes having bis(phenylpyridine) ligands. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of two new PtII complexes bearing tetradentate N&#8208;bridged bis(phenylpyridine) ligands with N^C*C^N and C^N*N^C coordinating atoms. Through chemical oxidation with PhICl2 and N&#8208;chlorosuccinimide, we obtained four new complexes containing PtIV and PtIII centres. The dynamics of the PtIII complexes were explored by variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies and showed surprisingly free rotation of the appended N&#8208;aryl group. This work uncovers the importance of the destabilizing nature of the bulky N&#8208;aryl group on intermetallic bonds, and sheds light on how the molecular rotation observed in the PtIII compounds could inspire new molecular rotors driven by intermetallic bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Microbial&#8208;induced Synthesis of nano NiFe LDH for High&#8208;efficiency Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) currently are the most efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline environments. However, the development of high&#8208;performance low cost OER electrocatalysts using straightforward strategies remains a significant challenge. In this study, we describe an innovative microbial mineralization&#8208;based method for in situ&#8208;induced preparation of NiFe LDH nanosheets loaded on nickel foam and demonstrate that this material serves as an efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. In the microbial mineralization process, bacteria adhere to electrode materials and promote the surface nucleation of nanomaterials when metal ions are present. Specifically, our findings indicate that biomineralization accelerates the formation and regulation of NiFe LDH. The new electrocatalyst displays excellent OER performance, with a small overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope down to 38.6 mV dec&#8722;1 in alkaline solution. The remarkable OER performance of the microbial mineralization&#8208;derived electrocatalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect of NiFe LDH and a bacterial&#8208;specific surface area that contains multiple active sites. This study has uncovered a new approach for the assembly of NiFe LDH that relies on biomineralization to bring about morphological and structural modification of LDH nanosheets.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Binder with Self&#8208;Emulsifying Characteristics for Practical Si/C Anode in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon/carbon (Si/C) materials have achieved commercial applications as a solution to the problems of large volume expansion and short lifespan of silicon&#8208;based anodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the potential risk of structural fracture and localized differences in surface adsorption properties lead to difficulties in maintaining the structural integrity of Si/C anodes using conventional binders during repeated lithiation/delithiation. Herein, an aqueous binder (PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M) based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) grafted methacrylic acid (MAA) obtained by self&#8208;emulsifyingemulsion polymerization is reported. The introduction of carboxyl groups of MAA enables PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M to form more hydrogen bonds, thereby enhancing both the cohesion of the binder film and its adhesion to silicon&#8208;based surface. Simultaneously, the methyl&#8208;containing segments of MAA can wet the carbon&#8208;based surface, thereby enhancing the adhesion of PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M to carbonaceous materials. In addition, the hydroxyl groups on both the PVA segments and the silicon surface can be esterified with the carboxyl groups during the heat treatment, thus further improving the bonding strength. As&#8208;prepared Si/C anodes with PVA&#8208;g&#8208;M binder can significantly inhibit the electrode volume expansion and maintain high structural integrity during cycling as well as form SEIs with high lithium fluoride content, showing excellent cycling stability (81.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles).</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Deracemization: A Sustainable Approach to Enantiopurity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical deracemization (MCDR) is presented as a new, general and sustainable approach to obtain enantiomerically pure compounds. By combining ball milling with deracemization, various functionalities such as ketones, isoindolinones, imines, esters and even an inorganic compound are successfully deracemized. High enantiomeric excesses (ee) are achieved, while reaction time is reduced by up to 97&#8201;% and solvent consumption by up to 100&#8201;%.







Abstract
We introduce mechanochemical deracemization (MCDR) as a novel strategy for obtaining enantiopure compounds. This study demonstrates the successful transposition of six archetypical deracemization reactions from a solvent&#8208;based to a solvent&#8208;minimized ball milling environment. The scope includes a ketone, isoindolinones, imines, an ester, and an inorganic compound, all of which deracemized successfully. Key parameters such as milling material, ball number and size, the use of a bulk material and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG) were systematically investigated, revealing their crucial role. Quantitative enantiomeric excesses (ee) were achieved, while reaction times were reduced by up to 97&#8201;% and solvent consumption by as much as 100&#8201;%. This work establishes MCDR as a versatile, sustainable pathway to enantiopure compounds. By highlighting the generalizability of this approach and its huge potential for minimizing waste, this study provides the foundation for future advancements in mechanochemical deracemization.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#932;his Review presents a comprehensive overview of the very recent developments on COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for H2O2 evolution. First, neat COFs with variable architecture are critically explored, followed by the presentation of the most promising hybrid COF&#8208;based heterojunctions. Several structure&#8208;activity aspects affecting the photocatalytic performance of these materials is thoroughly discussed.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered advanced class materials due to their exotic structural and optical properties. The abundance of starting monomers with variable linkage motifs may give rise to multiple conformations in either 2D or 3D fashion. Tailoring of the abovementioned properties has facilitated the application of COFs in a wide range of applications, which are strongly correlated with energy conversion schemes. Having a crystalline porous character and a large set of donor&#8208;acceptor combinations, COFs are expected to make huge impact in photocatalytic processes. In this Review, we present the recent advances in the development of semiconducting COF&#8208;based systems towards the photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide evolution. An overview is given about the effect of various parameters on the photocatalytic performance, such as charge transfer tuning, wettability by chemical functionalization, topology, porosity and crystallinity. Various challenges are discussed, and constructive insights are given for the development of highly functional COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for H2O2 evolution.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyl (CBBC) represents a readily available figure&#8208;eight molecule. Herein, we prepared ten donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type CBBC derivatives with changing the donor substituents and their substituent positions to systematically investigate the structure&#8211;property relationship. The functionalization of the para&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups resulted in better tunability of emission colors rather than meta&#8208;functionalization, whose color variation ranges from light blue to red.







Abstract
The scalable synthesis of figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;systems is challenging for the conventional bottom&#8208;up approach. We have recently reported that the oxidative inner&#8208;bond cleavage of commercially available dibenzo[g,p]chrysene efficiently furnishes a figure&#8208;eight &#960;&#8208;acceptor, cyclobisbiphenylenecarbonyl (CBBC), in large quantity. Furthermore, its donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type derivative with four N&#8208;carbazolyl substituents at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups exhibited thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high |gCPL| value of 1.0&#215;10&#8722;2. Herein, we synthesized nine donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type CBBC derivatives by changing the donor substituents and their positions. Compared to previously reported carbazole&#8208;substituted CBBC, tetramethylcarbazole&#8208; and 9,10&#8208;dihydro&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylacridine&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibited enhanced emission quantum yields and accelerated reverse intersystem crossing. The functionalization of the para&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups resulted in better tunability of emission colors rather than meta&#8208;functionalization, whose color variation ranges from light blue to red. The incorporation of bulky substituents at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups induced the conformational change to a distorted ring structure. Investigation of the substituent effect on the chiroptical properties revealed that the introduction of less bulky donor units such as carbazole at the meta&#8208;positions of the carbonyl groups is effective in achieving high |gCPL| values.

         <title>Recent Applications of Pillararene&#8208;Inspired Water&#8208;Soluble Hosts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillararenes has emerged as versatile and efficient tools for molecular recognition and assembly. Moreover, the design and synthesis of novel macrocycles with distinctive structures and properties can unleash new opportunities for supramolecular chemistry. This review highlights recent advances in novel pillararene&#8208;inspired water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic hosts including their molecular recognition and applications in functional material, catalysis and biomedicine.







Abstract
Pillararenes and their derivatives have emerged in supramolecular chemistry as unique macrocycles for applications in host&#8211;guest chemistry, materials science and biomimetics. Many variations have been conceived and synthesized in recent years and in this review, we relate progress in water&#8208;soluble versions: leaning towerarenes, extended&#8208;pillararenes, biphenarenes, helicarenes and octopusarenes. These are applied in targeted drug delivery, selective uptake and release of aromatic guests, fabrication of gold/silver and mesoporous silica nanoparticles, cell imaging, pollutant separation, biomedicine (e.&#8201;g. biofilm disruptors, taste masking containers, neuromuscular blockers, antidotes for macromolecular biotoxin) and enantioselective recognition. It is intended that this review will be helpful for research in synthetic macrocyclic chemistry and supramolecular functional systems, leading to practical applications in various research areas.

         <title>The Missing Link in the Monogermanide Series: YbGe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the synthesis of YbGe under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions, the series of binary rare&#8208;earth monogermanides is completed. The compound crystallizes in a FeB&#8208;type structure, such as the representatives La&#8722;Pr, and Lu. Despite the absence of &#8220;excess&#8221; electrons, 4&#8208;atomic Yb4 basins were found, with an increasing formation tendency as Yb&#8810;Lu&lt;La.







Abstract
High&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature synthesis at 12&#8197;GPa between 750 and 1000&#8201;&#176;C for 30 to 300&#8197;min yields the last missing rare&#8208;earth metal monogermanide, YbGe. Powder and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements reveal that the compound crystallizes in a FeB&#8208;type structure (space group Pnma, a=7.901(2)&#8197;&#197;, b=3.8981(9)&#8197;&#197;, and c=5.873(2)&#8197;&#197;). The results of the chemical bonding study, while supporting the presence of polyanionic Ge chains interacting with the surrounding Yb through multi&#8208;atomic polar bonds, suggest a transitional scenario between the monogermanides formed by alkaline&#8208;earth elements and those formed by trivalent rare&#8208;earth metals.

         <title>Unusual Reaction of Isocyanides with Aromatic Aldehydes Catalyzed by a Supramolecular Capsule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unprecedented reaction between isocyanides and electron poor aromatic aldehydes leading to the corresponding imine and carbon monoxide was disclosed to be promoted by the hexameric self&#8208;assembled resorcinarene capsule. The mechanism was elucidated considering kinetic investigation, isotopic labelling, metadynamics calculations and intermediate synthesis.







Abstract
The supramolecular resorcinarene hexameric capsule efficiently promotes the unprecedented reaction between isocyanides and electron&#8208;deficient aromatic aldehydes leading to the formation of imines and carbon monoxide. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated via isotope labelling, kinetic analysis of the reaction, computational studies and the independent synthesis of a proposed intermediate. Control experiments indicate that the formation of the key aziridinone intermediate is limited to the cavity of the capsule.

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Liquid Synthesis of Atomic Molybdenum Nitride Clusters as Bifunctional Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMNs) have garnered considerable attention for energy conversion applications owing to their exceptional electronic structures and high catalytic activities. However, the scarcity of active sites in TMNs impedes their large&#8208;scale application. This study describes the use of wetness impregnation and ionic&#8208;liquid methods to enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency of molybdenum nitride (MoN) atomic clusters finely dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (MoN@NC) substrates. The as&#8208;synthesized electrocatalysts feature atomically dispersed MoN clusters, achieving an impressive onset potential of 0.93 V vs. RHE for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and maintaining an overpotential of just 295 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The MoN@NC&#8208;based zinc&#8211;air battery demonstrated a high&#8208;power density of 151 mW/cm2, a robust specific discharge capacity of 759 mAh/gZn at 20 mA/cm2, and superior charge&#8211;discharge cycling stability exceeding 190 cycles. The detailed experimental characterization revealed that the uniformly dispersed MoN clusters served as the primary active sites driving the observed catalytic performance. Additionally, the present findings suggested significant correlations between the phase of the material, crystallization, atomic cluster distribution, support porosity, and nitridation temperature. These insights are expected to refine strategies for achieving atomically dispersed nitrides with optimized ORR performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Asymmetrical Ligand Substitution on the Formation, Stability, and Reactivity of Ruthenium(III)&#8208;Hypochlorite Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypohalites are commonly generated in biological systems, mostly with functions related to defense and immune system response. These hypohalites can bind to metal centers and are known for their strong oxidizing properties that play crucial roles in various biological processes. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and reactivity of novel biomimetic Ru(III)&#8208;hypochlorite complexes and focus the work on the electronic effects associated with the incorporation of methyl groups in a pentadentate ligand framework in an asymmetric fashion. The intermediates are stable at room temperature and were characterized by mass spectrometry, UV&#8208;vis absorption, resonance Raman and EPR spectroscopy. We show for the first time that the resultant ruthenium&#8208;hypochlorite adducts function as an electrophilic oxidant and efficiently catalyze hydrogen atom abstraction reactions from phenol and oxygen atom transfer reactions with dimethylsulfide.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vitro Selection of Collagen&#8208;Binding Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Containing Genetically Encoded Mussel&#8208;Inspired Adhesive Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein immobilization technology is important in medical and industrial applications. We previously reported all&#8208;in&#8208;one in vitro selection, wherein a collagen&#8208;binding vascular endothelial growth factor (CB&#8208;VEGF) was identified from a fusion library of random and VEGF sequences. However, its interaction chemistry is mainly limited to the interaction established by the 20 canonical amino acids. Herein, we incorporated an adhesive non&#8208;natural amino acid found in marine mussels, L&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), into the library for all&#8208;in&#8208;one in vitro selection. After selection, we identified DOPA&#8208;containing CB&#8208;VEGF. CB&#8208;VEGF binds to collagen with an apparent dissociation constant of 2 nM; na&#239;ve VEGF does not bind to collagen. The collagen&#8208;binding peptide domain of CB&#8208;VEGF (CB&#8208;peptide) exhibited stronger binding to collagen than a mutant peptide (substitution from DOPA to tyrosine), indicating the importance of DOPA to collagen binding. The collagen&#8208;binding affinity of CB&#8208;VEGF is 10&#8208;fold higher than that of CB&#8208;peptide, suggesting that the collagen&#8208;binding ability of CB&#8208;VEGF is not due to the additive function of CB&#8208;peptide to VEGF, but is synergistic. Furthermore, increased cell growth was observed on CB&#8208;VEGF&#8208;treated collagen surfaces, not VEGF&#8208;treated collagen surfaces. Thus, integrating all&#8208;in&#8208;one in vitro selection and DOPA incorporation shows promise in generating adhesive proteins on solid supports.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorinated&#8208;Quinoxaline Based Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptors Enables Efficient As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;fused electron acceptors have obtained increasing curiosity in organic solar cells (OSCs) thanks to simple synthetic route and versatile chemical modification capabilities. However, non&#8208;fused acceptors with varying quinoxaline core and as&#8208;cast device have rarely been explored, and the molecular structure&#8208;photovoltaic performance relationship of such acceptors remains unclear. Herein, two non&#8208;fused acceptors L19 and L21 with thienyl substituted non&#8208;fluorinated/fluorinated quinoxaline core were developed via five&#8208;step synthesis. Compared with L19, L21 with F&#8208;containing quinoxaline exhibited higher molar extinction coefficient, boosted charge mobility, improved exciton dissociation, more ordered molecular stacking and optimized film morphology. Thereafter, a notable power conversion e&#64259;ciency (PCE) of 11.45% could be obtained for the as&#8208;cast PBDB&#8208;T:L21 &#8208;based device, which is significantly better than the device based on PBDB&#8208;T:L19 (8.68%). Furthermore, PM6:Y6:L21&#8208;based ternary devices were fabricated and exhibited the highest PCE of 17.81%. This work discloses that the introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated quinoxaline core and appropriate side&#8208;chain engineering can play an important role in improving the performance of as&#8208;cast solar cell devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Azine Dearomatization in Natural Product Total Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since antiquity, alkaloid natural products have served as medicinal ingredients that still contribute as an inspiration for the development of novel therapeutics. For the synthetic chemist, much of the importance of natural products lies in their acting as a forcing&#8208;function for the invention of new synthetic strategies and tactics for molecular assembly.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since antiquity, alkaloid natural products have served as medicinal ingredients that still contribute as an inspiration for the development of novel therapeutics. For the synthetic chemist, much of the importance of natural products lies in their acting as a forcing-function for the invention of new synthetic strategies and tactics for molecular assembly.

         <title>Doubly Linked Azulene Dimer: A Novel Non&#8208;benzenoid Isomer of Perylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the synthesis of an unprecedented isomer of perylene, dicyclohepta[cd,fg]&#8208;as&#8208;indacene bearing two phenyl groups (1&#8208;Ph) by the nickel&#8208;mediated intramolecular homocoupling of a 4,4'&#8208;biazulene derivative (2). The X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that 1&#8208;Ph adopts a unique helically twisted geometry although the local aromaticity of azulene moieties was preserved. The double covalent linkage of the two azulene skeletons imparts significant orbital interaction, which affords near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption (up to 1720 nm) and remarkable redox behaviors despite its closed&#8208;shell electronic structure. The optical band gap of 1&#8208;Ph is calculated to be 0.72 eV from its absorption onset, which is one of the narrowest values among the hitherto reported air&#8208;stable non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs. Furthermore, the thin&#8208;film of 1&#8208;Ph serves as a p&#8208;type semiconductor. Our study offers fundamental insights into not only the aromaticity with the nonalternant topologies of 1&#8208;Ph but also its potential application in novel organic electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;dimensional Branched PdAg Nanoalloy Rich in Defects for Boosting Glycerol and Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The development of Pd&#8208;based bimetallic nanoalloys (NAs) with abundant active sites for achieving highly efficient electrocatalysis in alcohol oxidation deserves continuous attention. Herein, we utilized a facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase method involving adjusting reaction time to generate active sites, successfully&#160;synthesizing&#160;one&#8208;dimensional (1D) PdAg NAs rich in defects. The optimized 1D PdAg NA exhibits remarkable electrochemical activity, stability, and antipoisonous properties in glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), far exceeding pure Pd and commercial Pd/C catalysts. Notably, compared to glycerol oxidation (1496 mA mg&#8208;1Pd and 4.13 mA cm&#8722;2), the optimized PdAg NA demonstrated higher mass activity (2990 mA mg&#8208;1Pd) and specific activity (7.86 mA cm&#8722;2) in ethanol oxidation. In summary, this work may provide a strategy for designing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts enriched with defects, thereby promoting the development of high&#8208;performance alcohol oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Characteristics of a Partially Planarized Triarylmethyl Cation with Unsymmetrical Push&#8211;Pull Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved for the first time the synthesis and isolation of the push&#8211;pull&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;cation salts with sufficient stability. The unique feature is not limited to the structure. We found that the &#960;&#8208;cation salt with planar anion exhibits panchromatic absorption in the solid state accompanying a near&#8208;infrared absorption with a &#955;onset value of 1030&#8197;nm.







Abstract
We report the physical properties of a new class of triarylmethyl&#8208;based carbocations containing both an electron&#8208;donating diphenyl ether moiety and an electron&#8208;accepting carbonyl group with a helical plane framework. Their unique packing patterns were clarified by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which depend on the counter anions to influence their photophysical properties in the solid states. Notably, the interactions between &#960;&#8208;cation species and planar anion species lead to a unique panchromatic property, accompanying a near&#8208;infrared absorption with a &#955;onset value of 1030&#8197;nm, which can be assigned to intermolecular charge transfer transition. We found that the &#960;&#8208;cation species with planar anion formed cation dimers, being stacked in opposite directions. The two cation molecules are flanked by two anions on both the top and bottom side. Pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) calculations imply that the origins of the unique packing patterns of the &#960;&#8208;cations originate from the electrostatic forces of four neighbouring &#960;&#8208;anion species.

         <title>Exploring the Catalytic Potential of Bioinspired Taurine&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Quantum Dots as Bifunctional Catalysts for Diverse Sustainable Organic Transformations in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and exploration of the catalytic potential of taurine&#8208;functionalized carbon quantum dots (Tau&#8208;CQDs) under metal&#8208;, acid&#8208;, and base&#8208;free sustainable conditions, using water as a solvent for various organic transformations, including Knoevenagel condensation, the Biginelli reaction, and the Knoevenagel&#8211;Michael cascade.







Abstract
Taurine&#8208;functionalized Carbon Quantum Dots (Tau&#8208;CQDs) were synthesized and evaluated for their catalytic potential under metal&#8208;, acid&#8208;, and base&#8208;free sustainable conditions, using water as a solvent for various organic transformations, including Knoevenagel condensation, the Biginelli reaction, and the Knoevenagel&#8211;Michael cascade. These bioinspired N, S&#8208;doped CQDs exhibit bifunctionality, acting as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors for C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, and C&#8722;O bond formation. Comprehensive characterization of the catalyst was performed using HRTEM, PXRD, XPS, FTIR, AFM, Zeta potential, UV&#8211;Vis, and photoluminescence spectrometry. The Tau&#8208;CQDs demonstrated excellent reusability, maintaining catalytic performance over 10&#8197;cycles. Green chemistry metrics, including a low E&#8208;factor, high atom economy, and favorable PMI, CE, and RME values, highlight this approach's environmental and economic advantages. Key properties, such as high reaction yields, short reaction times, water solubility, enhanced surface functionality, non&#8208;toxicity, and mild operating conditions, underscore the broader significance of Tau&#8208;CQDs as an efficient, sustainable catalytic platform. Additionally, the simple recovery of the catalyst via filtration, without the need for further purification, enhances its practical applicability.

Aminoboranes (R2N=BH2; R = Me, Et) accept hydrogen from phosphine borane adducts (PhR&#8242;PH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3; R&#8242; = H, Ph). This transfer is proposed to occur via a 6&#8208;membered transition state. Further, the reaction is driven forward by the reactivity of the product phosphinoborane, which undergoes subsequent addition polymerization or dimerization.







Abstract
We report on the reactivity of aminoboranes (R2N=BH2; R = iPr, Et, Me) with phosphine&#8208;borane adducts (PhR&#8242;PH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3; R&#8242; = H, Ph): Sufficiently sterically unencumbered aminoboranes can accept hydrogen from phosphine&#8208;borane adducts. The hydrogen transfer results in the formation of amine&#8208;borane adducts (R2NH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3) and transient phosphinoboranes (PhR&#8242;P&#8722;BH2) in&#8197;situ. These phosphinoboranes undergo subsequent reactivity to yield either polyphosphinoborane, [PhPH&#8722;BH2]n, or the linear dimer, Ph2PH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2&#8722;Ph2P&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3. Unlike metal catalyzed phosphine&#8208;borane dehydrocoupling, which occurs at elevated temperatures (2&#8197;M, toluene, &#8805;100&#8201;&#176;C, &#8805;24&#8197;h), these dehydrocoupling reactions occur under ambient conditions (2&#8197;M, Et2O or C6D6, 20&#8201;&#176;C, &#8804;24&#8197;h). We performed a computational mechanistic study in which we identified that this transformation potentially occurs via a P&#8208;to&#8208;N and B&#8208;to&#8208;B hydrogen transfer through a 6&#8208;membered transition state.

         <title>High Performance of Cs2AgBiBr6 Perovskite&#8208;based Photodetectors by Adding DEAC</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites show promise in optoelectronics due to their optical and electrical properties. This study incorporates N&#8208;acetylethylenediamine (DEAC) into Cs2AgBiBr6 precursors, achieving photodetectors with detectivity up to 4.4&#215;1012 and excellent stability. Flexible devices also demonstrate 3.2&#215;1012 detectivity and durability. This work presents an effective approach for high&#8208;quality lead&#8208;free double perovskite films, extendable to other halide perovskites.







Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;based photodetectors (PDs) are broadly utilized in optical communication, non&#8208;destructive testing, and smart wearable devices due to their ability to convert light into electrical signals. However, toxicity and instability hold back their mass production and commercialization. The lead&#8208;free Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite film, promised to be an alternative, is fabricated by electrophoretic deposition (EPD), which compromises film quality. Herein, we improved the quality of the Cs2AgBiBr6 films and the performance of PDs by adding N&#8208;acetylethylenediamine (DEAC) to Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite precursor for EPD, in which the ligand DEAC provides a pair of lone electrons to Bi3+, forming coordinate covalent bonds. The optimized PDs have high detectivity, up to 4.4&#215;1012&#8197;Jones, and high stability in the air. The high&#8208;performance, flexible Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite PDs were fabricated on this basis, it also achieved the detectivity up to 3.2&#215;1012&#8197;Jones with excellent bending cycle stability. These results propose a feasible approach to improving the crystallization of double perovskite thin films by introducing ligands during the EPD process. Furthermore, they demonstrate enhanced optoelectronic performance, indicating that this method is also applicable to halide perovskites, offering an effective strategy to improve their film quality.

         <title>MOF Derived Cobalt Ferrite Cubic Rod&#8208;Like Materials for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Simultaneous Detection of Multiple Heavy Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The MOF&#8208;derived CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material prepared by solvothermal method shows mainly a uniform cubic rod&#8208;like structure with a small amount of hexagonal structure at a Co/Fe molar ratio of 1&#8201;:&#8201;2. CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE exhibits excellent electrochemical detection performance in the simultaneous detection of multiple heavy metal ions (HMIs). An interaction mechanism is found to exist between HMIs when simultaneous detection.







Abstract
A series of CoFe2O4 materials derived from metal&#8208;organic framework were successfully constructed by the solvent&#8208;thermal method. The morphology of a typical sample CoFe2O4&#8208;1 was mostly in the form of a cubic rod&#8208;like structure with a size distribution of 3.2&#177;0.2&#8197;&#956;m, while a small amount of the structure presented hexagonal shape with uniform size dispersion. The XPS characterization results confirmed that the CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material contained Co3+ (Co2+/Co3+=0.98), and the redox reaction between Co2+ and Fe3+ produced more Fe2+ (Fe2+/Fe3+=1.63), leading to the production of more OV on the surface of the CoFe2O4&#8208;1 material (OV%=0.34), thereby facilitating the efficient adsorption of the efficient adsorption of heavy metal ions (HMIs). CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE as a typical electrode presented excellent performance for the detection of multiple HMIs. The results should be attributed to the good electrical conductivity and large electrochemically active surface area of CoFe2O4&#8208;1/GCE, accelerating the transport of ions and charges in the system. Interestingly, there are interaction mechanisms between the HMIs when performing simultaneous detection, suggesting the detection of target ions can be facilitated by adding additional ions. This study provides new research insights for the development of highly sensitive electrochemical sensors for real&#8208;time environmental monitoring.

         <title>Photoinduced Deprotection of 2&#8208;Nitrophenylneopentyl Glycol Boronates Enables Light&#8208;Triggered Polycondensation of Siloxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel photolabile protecting groups for boronic and borinic acids were developed based on the 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl motif. The 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol (npnp) diol, easily synthesized on a gram scale, enables the formation of stable boronates. Efficient deprotection of RB(npnp) was achieved by irradiation at 365&#8197;nm, which was applied in light&#8208;triggered siloxane crosslinking.







Abstract
Various protecting groups have been developed for boronic acids, mostly based on diols. Alternatives include trifluoroborates and amine complexes, which offer easier synthesis and release under milder conditions. We present here a new strategy involving photocleavable protecting groups for boronic and borinic acids, based on the 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl motif. A screening of several 1,2&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;diols bearing a 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl group led us to identify 1&#8208;(2&#8208;nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol (npnp) for the protection of boronic acid derivatives. This diol is easily prepared in a single step on gram scale, and the corresponding npnp boronates are stable in wet acetonitrile at 90&#8201;&#176;C for several days, and under under acidic conditions. Irradiation at 365&#8197;nm in acetonitrile allows for the controlled liberation of boronic acids in good to excellent yields, a method also applied to a dimesitylborinic ester bearing a 2&#8208;nitrobenzylalcohol moiety. 1&#8208;(2&#8208;Nitrophenyl)neopentyl glycol boronates ArB(npnp) demonstrated their utility in light&#8208;triggered siloxane crosslinking. We showed that catalysts incorporated into a polymer matrix, irradiated, and then incubated at 50&#8201;&#176;C for 7&#8197;days resulted in efficient polymerization, forming solid materials in some cases.

         <title>Water Microdroplets Promote Spontaneous Oxidation of Amino Acid&#8208; and Peptide&#8208;related Thiols to Disulfide Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TOC text: Disulfide bonds play a significant role in multiple fields. This study shows thiol groups in amino acids or peptides spontaneously form disulfide bonds in water microdroplets without catalysts or oxygen. Hydroxyl radicals, originating from water microdroplets, facilitate this process, illustrating microdroplet chemistry&#8216;s potential for efficient disulfide bond formation.







Abstract
Disulfide bonds (S&#8722;S) play a critical role in modern biochemistry, organic synthesis and prebiotic chemistry. Traditional methods for synthesizing disulfide bonds often rely on oxygen, alkali, and metal catalysts. Herein, thiol groups involved in amino acids and peptides were spontaneously converted into symmetrical and unsymmetrical disulfide bonds within water microdroplets, without the need for catalysts or oxygen, and under room temperature. Water microdroplets displayed improved selectivity for disulfide bond formation, with minimal production of other oxidative species. Mechanistic investigations revealed that hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) present on the water microdroplet surface facilitated the oxidation process. Thiols were firstly oxidized to thiyl radicals (RS&#8901;), which subsequently coupled to form disulfide bonds. This study highlights the potential of microdroplet chemistry as an efficient and mild approach for constructing disulfide bonds.

A bis(triarylamine) radical cation bridged by two o&#8208;terphenylene moieties was prepared and characterized to explore the impact of the doubly &#960;&#8208;bridging on the intramolecular charge/spin transfer process in the 2&#8208;site organic mixed&#8208;valence system. Spectroscopic analyses on optically and thermally assisted intervalence charge&#8208;transfer processes revealed that the doubly &#960;&#8208;bridging enhanced the charge delocalization between two nitrogen redox&#8208;centers, whereas the electronic coupling was not so strengthened, in comparison with the singly &#960;&#8208;bridged reference compound.







Abstract
A bis(triarylamine) (BTA) radical cation, bridged by two o&#8208;terphenylene moieties, was prepared and characterized to explore the impact of the double&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bridge on the intramolecular charge/spin transfer process in the 2&#8208;site organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) compound. Spectroscopic analyses on optically and thermally assisted intervalence charge&#8208;transfer (IVCT) processes revealed that the doubly &#960;&#8208;bridging enhanced the charge delocalization between two nitrogen redox&#8208;active centers, whereas the electronic coupling was not so strengthened, in comparison with the singly &#960;&#8208;bridging reference compound.

         <title>Biomimetic Pseudopeptides to Decipher the Interplay between Cu and Methionine&#8208;Rich Domains in Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methionine&#8208;rich domains, unity makes strength! Tripodal pseudopeptides mimicking individual binding sites in Met&#8208;rich domains show that the trismethionine environment is highly favorable to stabilize the Cu(I) state. The moderate affinity of a single site is however amplified by efficient statistical and dynamic binding by the many methionine residues.







Abstract
Maintaining tightly copper homeostasis is crucial for the survival of all living organisms, in particular microorganisms like bacteria. They have evolved a number of proteins to capture, transport and deliver Cu(I), while avoiding Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Some Cu proteins exhibit methionine&#8208;rich (Met&#8208;rich) domains, whose role remains elusive. In this work, we designed biomimetic compounds recapitulating the possible Cu(I) binding sites in these domains, in order to examine the parameters important for Cu(I) binding. Five different biomimetic pseudopeptides were synthesized, exhibiting either three methionines or two methionines and a third amino acid likely to be present in the Met&#8208;rich domain. The affinities for Cu(I) of these model binding sites were determined, as well as their redox properties and behavior in the presence of Cu(II). Our results highlight the importance of Met residues, and their abundance in Met&#8208;rich domains, to efficiently bind Cu(I) in the periplasmic space.

         <title>Addition and Oxidation Reactivity of a Pentacoordinate Nickelacyclobutane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of a pentacoordinate nickelacyclobutane following addition and one&#8208;electron oxidation pathways is described. Ring&#8208;opening products are observed with substrates containing a stabilizing counteranion. Pathways leading to an oxidized nickelacyclobutane yield [2+2] cycloreversion&#8208;type products, suggesting that this pathway is accessible to oxidized nickelacyclobutanes.







Abstract
Nickelacyclobutanes are reactive intermediates in catalytic cycles including cyclopropanation and insertion reactions. The stoichiometric study of these intermediates has shown that their reactivity is highly influenced by the coordination environment of the nickel center. A pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane embedded in a diphosphine pincer ligand has been shown to selectively undergo various reactions with exogenous ligands, including [2+2] cycloreversion and carbene transfer to an isocyanide. Herein, we investigate the reactivity of the pentacoordinated nickelacyclobutane towards addition and oxidation reactions. Addition reactions lead to ring&#8208;opening to form stable square planar Ni(II) compounds, while metal oxidation enhances [2+2] cycloreversion. DFT calculations are used to shed light on the different mechanisms.

         <title>Chemically Robust Cationic Porous Organic Polymer (POP) for Selective Detection and Removal of ReO4&#8722; as a Surrogate of Radioactive 99TcO4&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient removal of highly radioactive 99TcO4&#8722; from alkaline nuclear waste remains essential for optimizing nuclear waste management and ensuring environmental protection. This study presents a urea&#8208;rich cationic porous organic polymer that exhibits ultrafast kinetics, high adsorption capacity, exceptional selectivity, and strong potential as a sensor, highlighting its effectiveness in detecting and removing 99TcO4&#8722; from nuclear wastewater.







Abstract
The efficient removal of 99TcO4&#8722; from alkaline nuclear waste is vital for optimizing nuclear waste management and safeguarding the environment. However, current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sorbent materials are constrained by their inability to simultaneously achieve high alkali resistance, rapid adsorption kinetics, large adsorption capacity, and selectivity. In this study, we synthesized a urea&#8208;rich cationic porous organic polymer, IPM&#8208;403, which demonstrates exceptional chemical stability, ultrafast kinetics (~92&#8201;% removal within 30 seconds), high adsorption capacity (664&#8197;mg/g), excellent selectivity, along with multiple&#8208;cycle recyclability (up to 7&#8197;cycles), making it highly promising for the removal of ReO4&#8722; (surrogate of 99TcO4&#8722;) from nuclear wastewater. Notably, after exposure to 1&#8197;M NaOH solution for 24&#8197;hours, IPM&#8208;403 maintained a high adsorption capacity of 421.3&#8197;mg/g for ReO4&#8722;. Furthermore, IPM&#8208;403 acts as an efficient sensor for ReO4&#8722;, exhibiting a turn&#8208;on response and a detection limit as low as 78.8&#8197;ppb.

         <title>Advances in Chiral Macrocycles: Molecular Design and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in the design and synthesis of chiral macrocycles, with a focus on their central, axial, helical, and planar chirality. These distinct chiral types impart unique structural and chiroptical properties, enabling a wide range of applications in fields such as enantioselective recognition, asymmetric catalysis, and circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Chiral macrocycles have recently emerged as promising materials for enantioselective recognition, asymmetric catalysis, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) due to their terminal&#8208;free structure, preorganized chiral cavities, and unique host&#8208;guest and self&#8208;assembly properties. This review summarizes recent advances in the design and synthesis of chiral macrocycles with central, axial, helical, and planar chirality, each imparting distinct structural and chiroptical characteristics. We highlight key strategies for constructing these macrocycles and their applications in optoelectronic and catalytic systems. Emphasis is placed on the balance between rigidity and flexibility in macrocycle design, essential for effective molecular recognition, adaptable catalysis, and CPL. We conclude with perspectives on future opportunities, anticipating ongoing developments in chiral macrocycle research.

         <title>Experimental Spin State Determination of Iron(II) Complexes by Hirshfeld Atom Refinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond structure correlation, the spin investigation in metal complexes is an ambiguous task. We herein present a proof of concept for the experimental determination of spin states from crystal structures by using Hirshfeld atom refinement. Relying on classical crystallographic quality indicators and residual density analysis, a novel way for the differentiation between high&#8208; and low&#8208;spin is demonstrated this way.







Abstract
In this study, we present the first experimental determination of the spin state of transition metal complexes by using Hirshfeld Atom Refinement. For the demonstration, the two iron(II) complexes, (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 &#8901; 6 H2O and lFe(pic)3jCl2 &#8901; EtOH were investigated. The method involves the refinement using wavefunctions of different spin multiplicity and comparison against experimental diffraction data by means of refinement indicators and residual electron density. Our results show a clear distinction between high&#8208;spin and low&#8208;spin configurations, even for compounds with spin&#8208;crossover behavior. The presented work demonstrates the potential of Hirshfeld Atom Refinement for the experimental determination of spin states in transition metal complexes.

         <title>Methane to Methanol Transformation on Cu2+/H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite. Characterization of Copper State and Mechanism of the Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu&#8208;modified zeolites provide methane conversion to methanol with high selectivity under mild conditions. The activity of different possible Cu&#8208;sites for methane transformation is still under discussion. Herein, ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite has been loaded with Cu2+ cations (1.4 wt% Cu) as characterized by UV&#8211;vis DRS, EPR, EXAFS, and 1H MAS NMR. It is inferred that Cu2+ cations, attached to the cation&#8208;exchange Al&#8211;O&#8211;&#8211;Si sites of the zeolite framework, can exist in the form of either isolated or paired Cu2+ sites. The transformation of methane to methanol on these sites has been verified by the observation of the methoxy species formation using 13C MAS NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. The related mechanisms have been analyzed by DFT calculations. It is obtained that Cu2+ sites enable heterolytic C&#8211;H bond dissociation via the &#8220;alkyl&#8221; pathway resulting in methylcopper species which however are not detected experimentally due to further rapid transformation to surface methoxy species. For the paired Cu2+ sites, such reaction occurs through methyl radical formation and recombination with Si&#8211;O&#8211;&#8211;Al site. Based on the obtained data, it has been concluded that methane transformation to methanol on Cu2+ sites, having no extra&#8208;framework oxygen ligand, is possible in Cu&#8208;modified zeolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular 1,2&#8208;Difunctionalization of Nitriles via Redox Gold Catalysis: Synthesis of Benzoxazoles and Benzimidazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unprecedent gold&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular 1,2&#8208;difunctionalization of nitriles with aryl iodides via Au(I)/Au(III) redox catalysis has been developed, providing an expedient route to the synthesis of benzoxazoles and benzimidazoles with broad substrate scope and high functional compatibility. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the Au(III)&#8208;Ar species generated via oxidative addition of o&#8208;iodophenol to MeDalphosAu+, serves as a key intermediate. Particularly and this annulation is initiated by oxidative addition, rather than the nucleophilic attack of the phenol moiety in o&#8208;iodophenol towards the nitrile. The method was also applied to the synthesis of poly aza&#8208;heterocycles via a cascade Au(I)/Au(III) and Au(I) catalysis relay.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we have reduced CO2 with HBpin to afford borylated methanol product selectively in ~99% yield using Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as a catalyst. This led to multigram scale isolation of methanol obtained from CO2 reduction via the hydrolysis of borylated methanol, this establishes the potential of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as an efficient homogeneous catalyst for the bulk scale methanol synthesis. A practical application of this catalytic system was also shown by reducing CO2&#8208;containing motorbike exhaust efficiently and selectively. Further, C&#8210;O bond activation of esters and epoxides using HBpin and 1&#8208;2 mol% of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 at 60 &#176;C afforded the borylated alcohols in good to excellent yields, which can easily be hydrolysed to the eco&#8208;friendly corresponding alcohol. The stoichiometric experiments were performed to prove the formation of in&#8208;situ generated cerium hydride [Ce]&#8208;H as an active catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of UCST&#8208;Responsive Claw&#8208;Like Polysulfobetaines for Efficient Capture of Cellulase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high cost of enzymatic glycolysis has seriously restricted the industrialization of lignocellulose&#8208;based sugar platform technology. Recovering and recycling cellulase can reduce the cost. Here, a thermo&#8208;responsive claw&#8208;type polysulfobetaine (PSPA) was constructed for hydrophobic grasping and efficient recycling of cellulase. Compared with the linear sulfobetaine homopolymer (PSPE), PSPA had more sensitive temperature response and strong cellulase recovery ability. PSPE&#8208;3 (Mw=355.1 kDa) was added to the hydrolysis system of corncob residue (CCR) (50 &#176;C), at 0.4 mass ratio of PSPE&#8208;3 to cellulase, and after enzymatic hydrolysis, 50% of the cellulase was saved when cooling to 25 &#176;C. But only 0.05 times PSPA&#8208;1 (Mw=30.0 kDa) was added to the CCR system, and 70% of the cellulase was saved when cooling to 25 &#176;C. This work presents a claw shaped protein&#8208;capture agent, polysulfobetaine for capturing cellulase, which is of great significance to reduce the lignocellulosic hydrolysis cost, and efficiently separate enzyme proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>A Non&#8208;Volatile Pro&#8208;Dicamba Herbicide Inspired by Meclofenoxate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dicamba is a popular herbicide with rising use but is also notorious for volatility drift. Inspired by meclofenoxate, which we show to be highly herbicidal, we developed a derivative of dicamba with an ester&#8208;bond to 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol. It remained herbicidal but is non&#8208;volatile, entering plants intact and hydrolyzing inside leaves to dicamba and 2&#8208;dimethylaminoethanol. This pro&#8208;dicamba is compatible with the relatively novel dicamba monooxygenase tolerance technology, suggesting pro&#8208;dicamba might be a suitable, non&#8208;volatile replacement for dicamba.</dc:description>

         <title>AIE&#8208;active Circularly Polarized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters for Stable Solution&#8208;Processed Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) have significant promise for naked&#8208;eye 3D displays. However, most devices are fabricated using vacuum deposition technology, and development of efficient solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs, particularly those exhibiting low efficiency roll&#8208;off, remains a formidable challenge. This research successfully designed and synthesized two pairs of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) enantiomers through isomer engineering, namely (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;5&#8208;TPA and (R/S)&#8208;N&#8208;4&#8208;TPA, which features fifth and fourth substitution sites of phthalimide (acceptor) by tri&#8208;phenylamine (donor), respectively. Both molecules displayed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Notably, the CP&#8208;OLED devices, fabricated by solution&#8208;process, exhibited vivid blue&#8208;green and green emission with the maximum current efficiency of 7.4 and 29.6 cd A&#8208;1, the external quantum efficiency of 2.7% and 10.2%, and the low efficiency roll&#8208;off of 3.7% and 16.7%. Moreover, these devices demonstrated CP&#8208;EL signals with gEL values of +6.61 &#215; 10&#8208;4 /&#8208;6.84 &#215; 10&#8208;4 and +1.13 &#215; 10&#8208;3/&#8208;1.25 &#215; 10&#8208;3, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Scaffolded Detergents for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detergents are essential for preserving the structural integrity and functionality of membrane proteins (MPs) outside the biological membrane or in aqueous solution, and thus ensuring accurate biochemical and structural analyses. Here, we introduce peptide&#8208;scaffolded detergents, a novel class of hybrid molecules formed by preassembling detergent monomers with peptides of varying lengths, mediated via Click chemistry. These detergents are characterized by scalable, straightforward synthesis and enhanced solubility. Among the variants, A4B2 emerged as the optimal detergent, demonstrating superior thermal stabilization across a range of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors, including A2AAR, SMO and GLP&#8208;1R. Additionally, A4B2 exhibits a low critical micelle concentration and small micelle size, together making it particularly effective for electron microscopy studies of A2AAR. This innovative design leverages the benefits of peptide&#8208;based and traditional detergents, offering new insights for the development of advanced detergents in MP research.</dc:description>

         <title>Property Tuning in N&#8208;Methylpyrrole Azo&#8208;Photoswitches via Modification of the Peripheral Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of pyrrole&#8208;azo&#8211;benzene molecular photoswitches was designed and prepared to comprehensively address the substitution effect on the photoswitching performance. By selecting proper substituents, the switching ranging from seconds to hours can be achieved along with a large tuning of thermal, (non)linear optical, and electrochemical properties.







Abstract
Differently substituted pyrrole&#8208;azo&#8211;benzene molecular photoswitches were prepared in a straightforward synthetic way. Their fundamental properties were investigated by XRD analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, cyclic voltammetry, UV&#8211;Vis absorption spectroscopy, Hyper&#8208;Rayleigh Scattering, and NMR spectroscopy; the experimental results were further corroborated by DFT calculations. Thermal robustness, the HOMO/LUMO levels, and the absorption properties were altered mostly by substituting the N&#8211;methylpyrrole moiety and further fine&#8208;tuned by modifying the benzene substituents. The pyrrole substituent also proved crucial for the second&#8208;order non&#8211;linear optical (NLO) response as well as the photoswitching performance. Both fast and slow molecular switches can be designed with the half&#8211;life of the (Z) &#8211;isomer ranging from 48&#8197;seconds to 23.28&#8197;hours and the E/Z molar ratio up to 12/88. This comprehensive study allowed elucidation of the fundamental structure&#8208;property relationships and subsequently addresses the key aspects of the property tuning via substitution in molecular azo&#8208;photoswitches.

The creation of multicomponent materials with desired properties and functions is a challenge of modern materials chemistry. Chiral nematic mesoporous organosilicas have iridescent properties that make them attractive for decoration and sensing. In this paper, we demonstrate the chemical functionalization of chiral nematic mesoporous organosilica films with cyclodextrin. In this way, we have been able to create chiral nematic mesoporous films with macrocyclic molecules on the surface to obtain a new class of hybrid inclusion materials.

&lt;p&gt;The creation of multicomponent materials with desired properties and functions is a challenge of modern materials chemistry. Chiral nematic mesoporous organosilicas have iridescent properties that make them attractive for decoration and sensing. In this paper, we demonstrate the chemical functionalization of chiral nematic mesoporous organosilica films with cyclodextrin. In this way, we have been able to create chiral nematic mesoporous films with macrocyclic molecules on the surface to obtain a new class of hybrid inclusion materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Geometric Effects on C&#8208;C Coupling of Aryl&#8208;Carbenes under 2D Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is well established that the confinement of reactants to two dimensions influences their reactivity. However, such confinement is often dominated by charge transfer effects between the reactants and the confining walls, in particular if the walls are conductive. Also, the reactivity of carbenes on metal surfaces is significantly affected by the charge transfer between the carbene and the metal, rendering the carbene more nucleophilic or electrophilic. Here, we investigate the geometrical effects of 2D confinement without an influence of the supporting metal for a photoinduced reaction of an aryl carbene on an ionic decoupling layer. We demonstrate the decoupling concept for the C&#8211;C coupling of 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;9&#8208;fluorenylidene (C14H10O) on a NaBr(100) bilayer on Ag(111). We combine scanning tunneling microscopy with infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy to follow the photoinduced C&#8211;C coupling of the carbene from its diazo&#8208;protected precursor in two dimensions. Our study demonstrates that the NaBr decoupling bilayer efficiently suppresses the effects of the metal surface, facilitating carbene chemistry under geometrical confinement.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrabutylammonium Chlorite as an Efficient Oxidant for Controlled Oxidation of Sulfides to Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Considering the demand for organosulfur materials and the challenges associated with currently used oxidation processes, in this study, we evaluated the counter&#8208;cation of sodium chlorite (Na+ClO2&#8211;) with tetrabutylammonium chloride (Bu4N+Cl&#8211;) to synthesise tetrabutylammonium chlorite (Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;). Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;exhibited good solubility in organic solvents like chloroform (1.6 g mL&#8211;1) and ethyl acetate (0.86 g mL&#8211;1). The oxygenation reaction of organosulfides with Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;was examined in an HCl&#8208;acidic ethyl acetate solution under ambient conditions, selectively forming the corresponding sulfoxides as mono&#8208;oxygenated products. The reaction was initiated by the formation of chlorine dioxide (ClO2&#8226;) as an oxidant and an active species generated from Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;with HCl. This oxygenation method also enables the surface oxidation of sulfide polymers like polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) resins to increase their surface hydrophilicity. Therefore, the use of Bu4N+ClO2&#8211;&#160;for applications in organic solvents is an environment&#8208;friendly, efficient, and highly selective approach for selective oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming the Tradeoff Between Reaction Rate and Overpotential in Dinuclear Cobalt Complex Catalyzed Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study focuses on enhancing the water oxidation reaction (WOR) efficacy of dinuclear cobalt complex catalysts from both kinetic (turnover frequency, TOF) and thermodynamic (overpotential, &#951;) perspectives. For this purpose, we synthesized six dinuclear cobalt complexes 1&#8211;6 comprising non&#8208;innocent ligands with different electronically active substituents (&#8208;OMe (1), &#8208;Me (2), &#8208;H (3), &#8208;F (4), &#8208;Cl (5), and &#8208;CN (6)). The electronic effects on the electrochemical WOR under neutral, acidic, and alkaline conditions were investigated experimentally and computationally. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that the valence state of the cobalt complexes was affected by electronic effects, affording different catalytic potentials, as evidenced by electrochemical measurements. Kinetic and spectroscopic studies confirmed that the synergistic effect of catalyst identity and reaction media changes the reaction mechanism of each catalyst. The WOR performance of 1&#8211;6 was tunable through ligand electronics and solvent effects, with the log(TOF)&#8208;&#951; analysis highlighting an operational &#951; as low as 40 mV. This study provides valuable insights into optimizing WOR catalysis through molecular design and environmental tuning.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic Functionalization of Activated P4 in

[CpFe(CO)2&#8211;(&#951;1&#8209;P4)][Al(ORF)4] with Alcohols R&#8208;OH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bonding situation in [Fp&#8211;P4][Al(ORF)4] (1) (Fp = (CO)2CpFe, RF = C(CF3)3) gives rise to an Umpolung of the P4 fragment, which should make it accessible for nucleophiles. To investigate this projected reactivity, the complex was combined with a series of hydroxy&#8208;nucleophiles &#8211; that all do not react with free P4 &#8211; leading to a variety of P1 building blocks. With excess of R&#8208;OH (R&#160;= Me, Et, Ph), the thermodynamically more stable complex salts [Fp&#8211;P(H)x(OR)3&#8211;x)][Al(ORF)4] (x&#160;=&#160;2,1,0) (2b&#8209;2d) are formed and show that the phosphonium type pathway is accessible. Quantum chemical calculations display a variety of reaction pathways that all lead very rapidly to the P1 building blocks. With stoichiometric amounts of R&#8208;OH, [Fp&#8211;PH3][Al(ORF)4] (2a) as well as [HP(OR)3][Al(ORF)4] (2f) were observed as products. Hence, activation of the P4&#8208;cage in complex 1 was confirmed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Here we present a simple gold&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of easily available diarylbutadiynes, with trimethoxybenzene as solvent and reactant to synthesize 4,6,8&#8208;trimethoxyazulenes. The methoxy substituents, which render the azulene very electron&#8208;rich, enable a change of azulenes typical regioselectivity for electrophilic substitutions, which enables facile electrophilic 2&#8208;substitution with iodine, bromine, chlorine, selenium or sulfur. Especially the 2&#8208;haloazulenes which can usually only be obtained through lengthy multistep syntheses are valuable building blocks for the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted azulene derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic Functionalization of a Cationic Pentaphosphole Complex &#8211; A Systematic Study of Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The systematic nucleophilic functionalization of the cationic pentaphosphole ligand complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5Me)][OTf] (A) with group 16/17 nucleophiles is reported. This method represents a highly reliable and versatile strategy for the design of novel transition&#8208;metal complexes featuring twofold substituted end&#8208;deck cyclo&#8208;P5 ligands, bearing unprecedented hetero&#8208;element substituents. By the reaction of A with classical group 16 nucleophiles, complexes of the type [Cp*Fe(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeE)] (E = OEt (1), OtBu (2), SPh (3), SePh (4)) are obtained. By transferring this protocol to group 17 nucleophiles, the highly sensitive complexes [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeX)] (X = F (5), Cl (6), Br (7), I (8)) could be isolated. All products show exclusively 1,1&#180;&#8208;substitution at the cyclo&#8208;P5 ring. Interestingly, further studies on the reactivity of the halogenated species revealed their ability to undergo ring&#8208;opening reactions with cyclic ethers such as THF and ethylene oxide yielding [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC4H8X)] (X = Br (9), I (10)) or [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC2H4X)] (X = Br (11), I (12)), respectively. Furthermore, the use of acyclic ethers such as dimethoxyethane led to the formation of [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4&#8208;P5MeOC2H4OCH3)] (13) mediated by C&#8208;O bond cleavage, followed by subsequent P&#8208;O bond formation, as further enlightened by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

Interestingly, further studies on the reactivity of the halogenated species revealed their ability to undergo ring-opening reactions with cyclic ethers such as THF and ethylene oxide yielding [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4-P5MeOC4H8X)] (X = Br (9), I (10)) or [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4-P5MeOC2H4X)] (X = Br (11), I (12)), respectively. Furthermore, the use of acyclic ethers such as dimethoxyethane led to the formation of [Cp*FeP5(&#951;4-P5MeOC2H4OCH3)] (13) mediated by C-O bond cleavage, followed by subsequent P-O bond formation, as further enlightened by DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oxidative Neutralisation of Sulfur&#8208;based Chemical Warfare Agents Mediated by a Lipase: from Batch to Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfur&#8208;containing chemical warfare agents sulfur mustard HD and nerve agent VX are highly toxic and persistent in the environment. Therefore, their neutralisation requires harsh oxidation conditions, but also precise selectivity. Here we report the safe and effective detoxification of surrogates CEES and PhX by selective oxidation of the sulfur atom by generating peracetic acid from AcOEt and aq. H2O2 assisted by the supported lipase CALB. Morever, it is possible to perform these neutralisations with safe &#8216;on demand&#8217; generation of AcOOH in a flow system by using a packed bed reactor containing the supported biocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Structures of Gas&#8208;Phase Hydrated Phosphotyrosine Revealed by Soft X&#8208;ray Action Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gas&#8208;phase near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption mass spectrometry (NEXAMS) was employed at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges to probe the influence of a single water molecule on
the protonated phosphotyrosine molecule. The results of the photodissociation experiments revealed that the water molecule forms two bonds, with the phosphate group and
another chemical group. By comparing the NEXAMS spectra at the carbon and oxygen K&#8208;edges with density functional theory calculations, we attributed the electronic transitions
responsible for the observed resonances, especially the transitions due to the presence of the water molecule. We showed that the water molecule leads to a specific spectral
feature in the partial ion yield of hydrated fragments at 536.4 eV. Moreover, comparing the NEXAMS spectra with the calculated structures allowed us to identify three
possible structures for singly hydrated phosphotyrosine that agree with the observed fragmentation and resonances.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Helical Foldamers: Conformational Control through Double Helix Formation and Light&#8208;Induced Protonation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical foldamers constitute particularly relevant targets in the field of host&#8208;guest chemistry, be that as hosts or substrates. In this context, the strategies reported so far to control the dimensions and shape of foldamers mainly involve modifications of the skeleton through covalent synthesis. Herein, we prepared an oligopyridine dicarboxamide foldamer substituted by photo&#8208;active tetraphenylethylenes (TPE). We demonstrate that it is possible to toggle the length of a helical foldamer by two means. First, the elongation of foldamers can be tuned by adjusting the concentration, as demonstrated by DOSY NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses on both the single and the double helix structures. Secondly, and in a more original manner, a photo&#8208;induced protonation process triggered by TPE units promotes a novel pathway to unfold helical foldamers, leading to dramatic conformational and spectroscopic changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Inhibition by Imidazole in Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrolysis of Protected Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study reveals an unexpected anomaly observed in the acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis of the 5,6&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene group in 3&#8208;O&#8208;protected D&#8208;gluco&#8208; and D&#8208;allofuranose derivatives. Although the removal of the 5,6&#8208;O&#8208;isopropylidene protecting group is typically rapid and quantitative under acidic conditions, an unexpected inhibition of this reaction is observed for the two C3&#8208;epimers, 3&#8208;O&#8208;imidazole sulfonyl moiety. X&#8208;ray data show a two&#8208;faced imidazole ring orientation in the crystal, while solution state NOE data reveal a critical interaction type between the isopropylidene and the imidazole rings. Advanced conformational searches coupled with ab initio molecular modeling illuminate and explain the NMR and kinetic data, and lay the groundwork for the most plausible mechanism of this unprecedented inhibition. These results provide valuable insights into the cross&#8208;coupling of carbohydrate O&#8208;protecting groups and shed light on how specific ring orientations and steric effects can trigger the inhibition of an otherwise easily feasible reaction, such as an acid&#8208;catalyzed hydrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Relaxation Pathway and Excited State Dynamics of Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes Incorporating Phosphorus&#8208;Based Monodentate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the photophysical, photochemical properties and photogenerated excited state dynamics of two new Ru(II) complexes, viz. [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(bpy)(PTA)]2+ [1]2+, [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(phen)(PTA)]2+ [2]2+ having a phosphorus&#8208;based ligand PTA [p&#8208;ttp = p&#8208;tolyl terpyridine; bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl; phen = 1,10&#8208;phenthroline and PTA = 1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane] are reported. Upon excitation with 470 nm LED, [1]2+ and [2]2+ neither undergo ligand release nor exhibit room temperature luminescence/1O2 generation. However, when excited around their respective MLCT bands at 77 K, luminescence bands ~600 nm were observed. N&#8208;methylation of the coordinated PTA in complex [1]2+ resulted in [Ru(p&#8208;ttp)(bpy)(MePTA]3+ {[1&#8208;Me]3+} (MePTA = N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane). The difference in photophysical and electrochemical properties of [1]2+ and [1&#8208;Me]3+ was rationalized by DFT calculations. Transient absorption spectroscopic analysis to unravel the relaxation pathway of&#160;complexes suggested the involvement of the 3MC state in the relaxation process. The effect of electronic modulation resulted from the N&#8208;methylation of PTA on the excited state dynamics of the complexes was observed. MTT assays in various cancer cells revealed their non&#8208;cytotoxic nature in the dark or upon irradiation with 470 nm blue LED. The non&#8208;toxicity of the complexes, despite being internalized in cancer cells as established by ICP&#8208;MS, is attributed to their dark and photostability and the inability to generate 1O2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Prebiotic Route to Lactate from Acetaldehyde, Cyanide and Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has fluctuated throughout Earth's history. However, the role of CO2 in prebiotic chemistry has predominantly been limitedly postulated as a C1 precursor, which can be reduced to carbon monoxide or methane mimicking the Wood&#8208;Ljungdahl pathway. Herein we present neglected roles of CO2 as an active promoter in accessing biologically important C3&#8208;builidng blocks such as lactate, via redox&#8208;economic reaction cycles from cyanide (C1) and acetaldehyde (C2). We verified that Lewis acidic CO2 facilitates the formation of cyanohydrin of acetaldehyde under ambient conditions. Furthermore, selective protection of cyanohydrin to carbonates by atmospheric CO2 led to anchimeric assisted hydrolysis of the nitrile group to generate lactate. This work supports both warm pond and hydrothermal vent hypotheses, postulating that a CO2&#8208;rich primordial atmosphere and the acidic aqueous solution could have fostered the emergence of biologically relevant molecules and life itself.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc Sensing with Pyridine&#8208;Based Lanthanide Contrast Agent: Structural Analysis in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc is an important physiological cation, and its misregulation is implicated in various diseases. It is therefore important to be able to image zinc by non&#8208;invasive methods such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In this work, we have successfully synthesized a novel Gd3+&#8208;based complex specifically for Zn2+ sensing by MRI. Using a combination of NMR, luminescence, potentiometric, and relaxivity experiments, completed with DFT calculations, we demonstrate that incorporating a short linker between the Zn2+ sensing unit and the Gd3+ complex leads to unique behavior of the system in the absence of Zn2+. A significant increase in efficacy of the system is observed upon Zn2+ binding, and importantly, the complex is highly selective for Zn2+ relative to other physiological cations. A comprehensive structural study reliably determines the microscopic parameters at the origin of the Zn2+ response, primarily an increase in the number of water molecules directly coordinated to Gd3+ upon Zn2+ binding. Crucially, the system maintains a strong response to Zn2+ binding in the presence of Human Serum Albumin, highlighting its potential for biological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Buffering Mechanism Enhances Stability and Water Oxidation Efficiency of CeO2@NiFe&#8208;LDH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide shows significant promise as an electrocatalyst in facilitating oxygen evolution reactions. But its development is hindered by low conductivity and insufficient cycling stability. Herein, the synthesis of a hierarchically structured heterostructure catalyst, CeO2@NiFe LDH, is reported through a straightforward two&#8208;step process involving hydrothermal treatment. The catalyst realizes a significant breakthrough in OER catalytic performance and stability. At a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2, the overpotentials amount to 255 mV in 1 M KOH, 263 mV in simulated seawater with alkaline conditions, and 346 mV in actual alkaline seawater. After 200 hours of continuous operation under high current density in simulated alkaline seawater, the morphology with no significant alterations observed, highlighting its high stability in complex seawater environments. Introducing CeO2 optimizes the binding energy of the OH intermediate, which facilitates the formation and dissociation of the OOH intermediate. In situ Raman analysis demonstrates the positive impact of CeO2 on the generation of active species. This research emphasizes the efficacy of CeO2 in improving the performance and durability of NiFe LDH for oxygen evolution reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Sheets Copper&#8208;Cobalt Graphitic Carbon Nitride Dual Single&#8208;Atom&#160;Catalysts for the Epoxidation of Styrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#160;single&#8208;atom catalysts have attracted considerable research interest due to their higher metal atom loading and more flexible active sites compared to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs).&#160;We pioneered the one&#8208;step synthesis of sheets copper&#8208;cobalt graphitic carbon nitride dual single&#8208;atom (S&#8208;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4) using folding fan&#8208;shaped aluminum foil as a template, and used them as catalysts in the epoxidation of styrene respectively. Through XAFS&#65288;X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure&#65289; and&#160;other characterizations, it is found that Cu and Co&#160;single atoms are stabilized separately on g&#8208;C3N4&#160;via coordination with nitrogen (N), hindered the ordered growth of sheets, and formed more pore structures, which not only increased more catalytically active sites, but also effectively prevented the flakes re&#8208;aggregate during the catalytic process. And the synergistic effect between Cu and Co changes the energy band structure of the material and facilitates electron transfer during catalysis, hence an excellent catalytic effect of 89% styrene conversion and 85% styrene oxide selectivity was achieved when S&#8208;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1:1 was applied in the epoxidation of styrene. Furthermore, the mechanisms&#160;of the epoxidation of styrene with S&#8208;Cu/Co&#8208;g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;1:1&#160;was&#160;probed by the density functional theory (DFT) based on the&#160;slab model.</dc:description>

         <title>PDA/PMMA blend membrane utilized for the selective adsorption and separation of heavy metal ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detrimental effects of heavy metal aqueous pollution are attracting people's attention increasingly. Membrane separation technology plays a pivotal role in the treatment of aqueous pollution due to its low energy consumption and excellent separation effect. Inspired by the strong adhesion of heavy metal ions by the dopamine in mussel protein, we have fabricated the 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% proportion of polydopamine (PDA)/Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blend membranes with dopamine structure by solvent&#8208;induced phase conversion. I&#8208;V current, UV titration and transmission tests examined the membrane's selective adsorption and retention capabilities for Fe3+, Cu2+ and Cr3+. These experiments indicated the different selectivity for Fe3+ of four blend membranes with varying PDA/PMMA fractions. Based on Langmuir's adsorption theory, the 10% blend membranes exhibited the most outstanding selective adsorption for Fe3+ with an LOD of 4.724&#215;10&#8208;9 M. Moreover, the ability to retain Fe3+ is still close to 100% after 48 h of transmission. This study manifested that the PDA/PMMA blend membrane is capable of adsorbing trace amounts of Fe3+ from water, thereby contributing to aqueous purification.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured Yb3+, Er3+ Codoped CeO2 with Upconverted Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upconverted circularly polarized luminescence (UC&#8208;CPL) active organic and organic&#8208;inorganic composite materials have garnered increasing attention due to their vast potential applications in areas such as 3D displays, encryptions, spintronics and optoelectronic devices. However, effective methods for fabricating chiral inorganic materials exhibiting UC&#8208;CPL remain a challenge. Herein, we propose an approach for the synthesis of UC&#8208;CPL active chiral mesostructured CeO2 powders (CMCs) via a hydrothermal growth method, using L/D&#8208;aspartic acid as symmetry&#8208;breaking and structure&#8208;directing agents. Two levels of chirality exist in CMCs: primary nanoplates constructed from nanoparticles and the helical stacking of these nanoplates to form a twisting nanofusiform. Yb3+ and Er3+ ions can be codoped into the CMCs through a one&#8208;step synthesis to achieve UC&#8208;CPL. The 1% Yb3+, 1% Er3+ codoped CMCs exhibited absorption&#8208;based optical activities in the range of 350&#8208;500 nm, similar to undoped CMCs, and displayed circularly polarized luminescence in the range of 520&#8208;610 nm under the excitation by a 980 nm laser. This luminescence is attributable to the energy transfer process between Yb3+ and Er3+. This work may provide new insights into designing chiral photon upconversion inorganic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Modulation of Bridged Single&#8208;Benzene&#8208;Based Fluorophores for Materials Science</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, researchers studying fluorogenic samples have steadily shifted from using large, expensive, poorly soluble fluorophores with complex synthetic sequences to smaller, simpler p scaffolds with low molecular weight. This research article presents an in&#8208;depth study of the photophysical properties of five bridged single&#8208;benzene&#8208;based fluorophores (SBBFs) investigated for their solution and solid&#8208;state emission (SSSE) properties. The compounds O4, N1O3, N2O2, N3O1, and N4 are derived from a central terephthalonitrile core and vary in the amount of oxygen and nitrogen bridging atoms. These minimalized emitters show full&#8208;color tunable emission properties and exhibit moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield values reaching up to 0.78 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). In addition to demonstrating excellent compatibility in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films and additive manufacturing using stereolithography (SLA), white light emission was achieved in both solution and 3D&#8208;printed materials by controlling the mixing ratio of the compounds. Employing density&#8208;functional theory (DFT), well&#8208;correlating theoretical absorption and emission wavelengths were calculated as average values of the different possible conformers. Furthermore, cellular internalization of the substances was accomplished using Pluronic&#174; F&#8208;127 nanoparticles. Overall, this study emphasizes the remarkable properties of single&#8208;benzene&#8208;based emitters, showcasing their accessibility and potential applications in biomedical fields and materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Supramolecular Polymers Formed via Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Host&#8208;Guest Complexation of Chiral Bisporphyrin Monomers with Trinitrofluorenone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intermolecular host&#8208;guest complexation of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers consisting of cleft&#8208;shaped bisporphyrin and trinitrofluorenone units connected by a chiral binaphthyl linker was employed to construct helically twisted supramolecular polymers. Results from 1H NMR, diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy, and viscometry experiments revealed that the supramolecular polymerization of these monomers follows a ring&#8208;chain competition mechanism. The introduction of bulky substituents at the linker significantly suppressed the formation of macrocyclic oligomers, whereas smaller alkyl chains facilitated the formation of the cyclic form. The chirally twisted structures of the supramolecular polymers were confirmed using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;configurations of the binaphthyl linkers induced right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical structures, respectively, in the supramolecular polymer chains. The absence of cooperativity in the supramolecular copolymerization of (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;1a resulted in the formation of stereo&#8208;random supramolecular copolymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Fisetin as a Blueprint for Senotherapeutic Agents &#8212; Elucidating Geroprotective and Senolytic Properties with Molecular Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting senescent cells and the factors that accelerate this pathological state has recently emerged as a novel field in medicinal chemistry. As attention shifts to synthetic substances, studies on natural agents are often overlooked. In this paper, we present a detailed computational modeling study that encompasses quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics to elucidate the senotherapeutic activity of fisetin. The mitochondrial environment, serving as a proxy for senescence, received special attention. Throughout the study, fisetin&#8217;s outstanding geroprotective properties&#8212;exhibiting significant potential against&#160;&#8226;OOH, O2&#8226;&#8211;, and&#160;&#8226;OH radicals, surpassing those of Trolox or ascorbate&#8212;were identified. Furthermore, fisetin demonstrated a high capacity to restore oxidatively damaged biomolecules to their pristine forms, thereby renewing the functionality of proteins and amino acids. The senolytic properties were examined in terms of Bcl&#8211;2 and Bcl&#8211;xL inhibition. The results indicated that fisetin not only binds effectively to these proteins but also, with appropriate modifications, may exhibit specific selectivity toward either target. This study highlights fisetin&#8217;s remarkable activity in these areas and provides a molecular description of the underlying processes, paving the way for future research.</dc:description>
