This noncovalent functionalization enables the implementation of a wide array of amphiphiles and results in a polarity umpolung of the initial core&#8211;shell nanomaterial. The resulting double&#8211;layer architecture facilitates a confined space that can be utilized for the encapsulation of nonpolar water contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). For more details see the Review by A. Hirsch et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;8483&#8197;ff.

      <title>The Earlier the Better: Structural Analysis and Separation of Lanthanides with Pyrroloquinoline Quinone</title>
      <dc:description>
Lanthanides can be separated by precipitation using the naturally occurring redox cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ). Complexes with early lanthanides are preferentially formed and rapidly precipitate out of aqueous solutions in the reported separation method. In addition, the first molecular structure of a PQQ complex with a biologically relevant metal ion outside a protein environment is reported and shows a Eu2PQQ2 dimer. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L.&#8197;J. Daumann et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202002653).

Generation of novel responsive fluorescent sensors requires synthetically versatile fluorophore cores.

      <title>Recent advances in heterogeneous catalytic system containing metal ions for phosphate ester hydrolysis</title>
      <dc:description>Organophosphates are a class of organic compounds important for living organisms, forming the building blocks for DNA, RNA and some essential cofactors. Furthermore, non&#8208;natural organophosphates are widely used in industrial applications, including as pesticides, in laundry detergents, and, unfortunately, as chemical weapons agents. In some cases, the natural degradation of organophosphates can take thousands of years; this longevity creates problems associated with handling, and especially with the storage of the waste generated by such phosphate esters. Efforts to develop new catalysts for the cleavage of phosphate esters have progressed in recent decades, mainly in the area of homogeneous catalysis. In contrast, the development of heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrolysis of organophosphates has not been as prominent. In this review, we describe examples of heterogeneous systems and highlight the importance of the development of heterogeneous catalysts applicable to organophosphate hydrolysis, shedding light into recent advances related to the different solid matrices that have been employed.</dc:description>

      <title>The Butterfly Complex [{Cp*Cr(CO)3}2(&#956;,&#951;1:1&#8208;P4)] as a versatile Ligand and its unexpected P1/P3 Fragmentation</title>
      <dc:description>The  versatile coordination behavior of the P 4  butterfly complex [{Cp*Cr(CO) 3  } 2  (&#956;,&#951; 1:1  &#8208;P 4  )] ( 1  ) towards Lewis acidic pentacarbonyl compounds of Cr, Mo and W is reported. The reaction of 1  with [W(CO) 4  (nbd)] (nbd = norbornadiene) yields the complex [{Cp*Cr(CO) 3  } 2  (&#181; 3  ,&#951; 1:1:1:1  &#8208;P 4  ){W(CO) 4  }] ( 2  ) in which 1  serves as a chelating P 4  butterfly ligand. In contrast, reactions of 1  with [M(CO) 4  (nbd)] (M = Cr ( a  ), Mo ( b  )) result in the step&#8208;wise formation of [{Cp*Cr(CO) 2  } 2  (&#956; 3  ,&#951; 3:1:1  &#8209;P 4  ){M(CO) 5  }] (  3a,b   ) and [{Cp*Cr(CO) 2  } 2  &#8208;(&#956; 4  ,&#951; 3:1:1:1  &#8209;P 4  ){M(CO) 5  } 2  ] (  4a,b   ) which contain a folded cyclo&#8208;P 4  unit.  4a   undergoes an unprecedented P 1  /P 3  &#8208;fragmentation  yielding the cyclo&#8208;P 3  complex  [Cp*Cr(CO) 2  (&#951; 3  &#8208;P 3  )] ( 5  )  and the as yet unknown phosphinidene complex [Cp*Cr(CO) 2  (Cr(CO) 5  ) 2  (&#181; 3  &#8208;P)] ( 6  ). The identity of 6  is confirmed by spectroscopic methods and by the in situ formation of [{Cp*Cr(CO) 2  ( t  BuNC)}P{Cr(CO) 5  } 2  ( t  BuNC)] ( 7  ).

In contrast, reactions of 1  with [M(CO) 4  (nbd)] (M = Cr ( a  ), Mo ( b  )) result in the step&#8208;wise formation of [{Cp*Cr(CO) 2  } 2  (&#956; 3  ,&#951; 3:1:1  &#8209;P 4  ){M(CO) 5  }] (  3a,b   ) and [{Cp*Cr(CO) 2  } 2  &#8208;(&#956; 4  ,&#951; 3:1:1:1  &#8209;P 4  ){M(CO) 5  } 2  ] (  4a,b   ) which contain a folded cyclo&#8208;P 4  unit.  4a   undergoes an unprecedented P 1  /P 3  &#8208;fragmentation  yielding the cyclo&#8208;P 3  complex  [Cp*Cr(CO) 2  (&#951; 3  &#8208;P 3  )] ( 5  )  and the as yet unknown phosphinidene complex [Cp*Cr(CO) 2  (Cr(CO) 5  ) 2  (&#181; 3  &#8208;P)] ( 6  ). The identity of 6  is confirmed by spectroscopic methods and by the in situ formation of [{Cp*Cr(CO) 2  ( t  BuNC)}P{Cr(CO) 5  } 2  ( t  BuNC)] ( 7  ).  DFT calculations throw light on the bonding situation of the reported products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Copper Based Hybrid Polyion Complexes for Fenton like Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>An innovative strategy allowing the development of a new generation of easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use nano&#8208;sized catalysts with high tenability is presented. This strategy is based on the formation of hybrid polyion complexes based on the complexation of copper with a block copolymer consisting of an ionizable complexing block and a neutral stabilizer block. These complexes have a well&#8208;defined structure and size with a hydrodynamic diameter around 29 nm. They are stable in aqueous solution over a pH range from 4 to 8 and are not sensitive to NaCl salt addition or dilution effects. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept the degradation of naphthol blue black in water through the use of Fenton or photo&#8212;Fenton reaction is studied. Their performances are comparable to a classical homogeneous reaction, while HPICs are easily recyclable by a simple dialysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Photophysical properties of DCM revisited: fluorescence vs. photoisomerization</title>

Especially, the light&#8208;induced E&#8208;Z isomerization plays a great role on the overall photophysical properties of DCM. Here we report the full description of a photoswitchable DCM derivative by a combination of structural, theoretical and spectroscopic methods. The main s&#8208;trans&#8208;(E) isomer is responsible for most of the fluorescence features, whereas the s&#8208;cis&#8208;(E) conformer only contributes marginally. The non&#8208;emitting (Z) isomers are generated in large conversion yields upon visible (e.g., 485 nm or 514 nm) light&#8208;illumination and converted back to the (E) forms under UV irradiation (e.g., 365 nm). Such a photoswitching is efficient, reversible, with high fatigue&#8208;resistance. The E&#8594;Z and Z&#8594;E photoisomerization quantum yields are determined in different solvents and at different irradiation wavelengths. Interestingly, the fluorescence and photoisomerization properties are strongly influenced by the solvent polarity: the fluorescence is predominant at higher polarity, whereas the photoisomerization becomes more efficient at lower polarity. Intermediate medium (THF) represents an optimized situation with a good balance between these two features.</dc:description>

      <title>Fragmentation Mechanism of White Phosphorus: A Theoretical Insight into Multiple Cleavage/Formation of P&#8210;P and P&#8210;C Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular&#8208;level understanding of metal&#8208;mediated white phosphorus (P 4 ) activation is meaningful but challenging because of its direct relevance to conversion of P 4 into useful organophosphorus compounds as well as the complicated and unforeseeable cleavage process of P&#8210;P bonds. The related study, however, has still rarely been achieved to date. We reported here a theoretical insight into step&#8208;by&#8208;step process of three P&#8210;P bond cleavage/four P&#8210;C bond formation for [P 3 +P 1 ]&#8208;fragmentation of P 4 mediated by lutetacyclopentadienes. The unique charge&#8208;separated intermediate and the intermolecular cooperation between two lutetacyclopentadienes play a vital role in the subsequent P&#8210;P/P&#8210;C bond breaking/forming. It is found that, although the first P&#8210;C formation is involved in the assembly of cyclo &#8208;P 3 [R 4 C 4 P 3 ] &#8210; unit, the construction of the aromatic five&#8208;membered P 1 &#8208;heterocycle [R 4 C 4 P] &#8210; is completed prior to the cyclo &#8208;P 3 formation. The reaction mechanism has been carefully elucidated by the analyses of geometric structure, frontier molecular orbital, bond index, and natural charge, which greatly broaden and enrich general knowledge on the direct functionalization of P 4 .</dc:description>

This behaviour originates from the close proximity (&#8776; 550 cm  &#8211;1  ) of the intermediate&#8208;spin  S  = 3/2 excited states to the high&#8208;spin  S  = 5/2 ground state. More quantitatively, although the ground state is mostly  S  = 5/2, a spin&#8208;admixture model evidences a sizable contribution (&#8776; 15%) of  S  = 3/2 to the ground state, which as a consequence experiences large and positive axial anisotropy (  D =  +19.2 cm  &#8722;1  ). Frequency&#8208;domain EPR allowed us to directly access the  m  S  = |&#177;1/2&#12297; &#8594; |&#177;3/2&#12297; transitions, thus unambiguously measuring the very large zero&#8208;field splitting (ZFS) in this 3d  5  system. Other experimental results including magnetization, M&#246;ssbauer, and field&#8208;domain EPR (HFEPR) studies are consistent with this model, which is also supported by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Expansion of the Na3MIII(Ln/An)6F30&#160;Series: Incorporation of Plutonium into a Highly Robust and Stable Framework</title>

This extreme robustness can potentially be exploited for the sequestration of Pu in a stable matrix; however, no Na  n  MPu  6  F  30  &#160;compounds have been reported so far. Herein, we present four new plutonium fluorides that have been prepared as single crystals via mild hydrothermal synthesis methods. Structural characterizations revealed their compositions to be Na  3  AlPu  6  F  30  , Na  3  FePu  6  F  30  , Na  3  CoPu  6  F  30  , and Na  2.4  Mn  1.6  Pu  6  F  30  . Surprisingly, in the plutonium series it was found that Co  2+  &#160;and Mn  2+  &#160;precursors oxidized to form Na  3  Co  III  Pu  6  F  30  &#160;and Na  2.4  Mn  II/III  1.6  Pu  6  F  30  , whereas the analogous reactions for cerium result in reduction of the transition metal, even when beginning with a M  3+  &#160;precursor. While cerium is often used as a surrogate for plutonium, this work serves as an example that deviations between their chemistries do occur.</dc:description>

      <title>Novel reversibly switchable fluorescent molecular systems based on metallacarborane&#8208;perylenediimide conjugates</title>
      <dc:description>Icosahedral metallacarboranes are &#952;&#8208;shaped anionic molecules in which two icosahedra share one vertex that is a metal center. The most remarkable of these compounds is the anionic cobalt&#8208;based metallacarborane [Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8208;  , whose oxidation&#8208;reduction processes occur via an outer sphere electron process. This, along with its low density negative charge, makes [Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8208;  very appealing to participate in electron&#8208;transfer processes. In this work, [Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8208; is tethered to a perylenediimide dye to produce the first examples of switchable luminescent molecules and materials based on metallacarboranes. In particular, the electronic communication of [Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8208;  with the appended chromophore unit in these compounds can be regulated upon application of redox stimuli, which allows the reversible modulation of the emitted fluorescence. As such, they behave as electrochemically&#8208;controlled fluorescent molecular switches in solution, which surpass the performance of previous systems based on conjugates of perylendiimides with ferrocene. Remarkably, they can form gels by treatment with appropriate mixtures of organic solvents, which result from the self&#8208;assembly of the cobaltabisdicarbollide&#8208;perylendiimide conjugates into 1D nanostructures. The interplay between dye &#960;&#8208;stacking and metallacarborane electronic and steric interactions ultimately governs the supramolecular arrangement in these materials, which for one of the compounds prepared allows preserving the luminescent behavior in the gel state.</dc:description>

      <title>Magnetic Correlation Engineering in Spin&#8208;Sandwiched Layered Magnetic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>The insertion of &#8220;sandwiched spin&#8221; between magnetic layers could efficiently affect interlayer magnetic correlations, but doing so increases the complexity in the interlayer spin alignment because of competition between the inserted spin&#8211;layer interaction (  J  NNI  ) and the interlayer through&#8208;space interaction (  J  NNNI  ) if the magnitude of  J  NNI  is of the same degree as  J  NNNI  with reciprocal signs of the respective interactions. Here, we demonstrate the magnetic phase variations systematically tuned by  J  NNI  and  J  NNNI  in two kinds of metal&#8208;variable isostructural series of supramolecular pillared layer magnets, [  M  Cp*  2  ][{Ru  2  II,II  (2,3,5,6&#8208;F  4  CO  2  )  4  }  2  (TCNQ)]&#8901;2DCE (  M  = Co, Fe, Cr; 2,3,5,6&#8208;F  4  PhCO  2  &#8211;  = 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoate; TCNQ = 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;  p  &#8208;quinodimethane; DCE = 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane), and their DCE&#8208;free series, where the [  M  Cp*  2  ]  +  species with  S  = 0, 1/2, and 3/2 for  M  = Co, Fe, Cr, respectively, were sandwiched between ferrimagnetic layers of [{Ru  2  }  2  (TCNQ)]  &#8211;  . The results showed that the flexible magnetic natures of these magnets were changeable depending on  J  NNI  and  J  NNNI  , as well as on interlayer inserted spins  M  .</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Diphenylberyllium has been known for almost a century. However, neither its structure was known nor its reactivity had been studied systematically. Therefore, an in&#8208;depth investigation of the structure of BePh2 in solution, the solid state, as well as of its reactivity was conducted. This enabled, for the first time, a classification of organoberyllium compounds in comparison to the other (pseudo) main group organyles. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. M&#252;ller and M.&#8197;R. Buchner. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000259).

      <title>Long&#8208;Lived Photocharges in Supramolecular Polymers of Low&#8208;Band&#8208;Gap Chromophores</title>
      <dc:description>
1D helical nanowires from &#8220;supramolecular low&#8208;bandgap polymers&#8221; facilitate the formation of photocharges induced with a low&#8208;power white&#8208;light source. The photocharges in this nanoscopic confinement exhibit extraordinarily long lifetimes in the order of many hours, which gives rise to delocalized and mobile charges at high concentrations close to the metal insulator threshold.

      <title>The application of Y modified Lanthanum Zirconate flexible thin film for high&#8208;performance flexible supercapacitor</title>
      <dc:description>With the rapid development of the wearable electronics devices, the increasing demand for developing new flexible energy storage devices with high security has become a hot research. Although the flexible supercapacitors is considered to be an extra performance energy store equipment because of the fast charging/discharging ability, long cycle life, good reliability, wide operating temperature range and et al, there are still many defects need to be improved. Herein, we have successfully synthesized the La  2  Zr  2  O  7  (LZO) thin film as a new energy store material by using a facile electrospinning method and calcination at low temperature. In addition, we have determined the mechanism of producing flexibility of this film by TG, IR and XRD analysis. As the previous studies suggest that charge storage of LZO film can be attributed to the mechanism of oxygen intercalation, we dope the Y element into LZO film to increase the concentration of oxygen vacancies. To obtain the best doping sample, the changes of structures and electrochemical properties of La  2  Y  x  Zr  2&#8208;x  O  3  (0&#8804;x&#8804;0.5) nano&#64257;bers (LNF&#8208;x) with increase of Y content are studied carefully. Since the LNF&#8208;0.1 sample show the highest areal capacitance of 605.3 mF&#183;cm  &#8208;2  at 2 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  , a symmetrical flexible device has been fabricated by LNF&#8208;0.1 electrodes.

      <title>Competing Roles of Two Kinds of Ligand during Nonclassical Crystallization of Pillared&#8208;Layer Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Elucidated Using Microfluidic Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Microfluidic systems are efficient tools for elucidating the non&#8208;equilibrium state on the crystallization of multi&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). The understanding of the crystallization mechanism makes it possible to predict the synthesis conditions. Based on the experimental analysis using microflow reactors, nonclassical crystallization processes are proposed, involving two kinds of intermediate states and the competing roles of two kinds of ligand which promote or suppress nucleation.

      <dc:description>
Getting in flow: Time&#8208;consuming trial&#8208;and&#8208;error investigations are required to diversify metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and predicting the synthesis conditions for such MOFs requires an understanding of the crystallization mechanism. The use of a microflow system, which efficiently captures non&#8208;equilibrium states, led to the proposal of a three&#8208;step nonclassical nucleation mechanism involving two kinds of intermediate.







Abstract
To diversify metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), multi&#8208;component MOFs constructed from more than two kinds of bridging ligand have been actively investigated due to the high degree of design freedom afforded by the combination of multiple ligands. Predicting the synthesis conditions for such MOFs requires an understanding of the crystallization mechanism, which has so far remained elusive. In this context, microflow systems are efficient tools for capturing non&#8208;equilibrium states as they facilitate precise and efficient mixing with reaction times that correspond to the distance from the mixing point, thus enabling reliable control of non&#8208;equilibrium crystallization processes. Herein, we prepared coordination polymers with pillared&#8208;layer structures and observed the intermediates in the syntheses with an in&#8208;situ measurement system that combines microflow reaction with UV/Vis and X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure spectroscopies, thereby enabling their rapid nucleation to be monitored. Based on the results, a three&#8208;step nonclassical nucleation mechanism involving two kinds of intermediate is proposed.

      <title>Linear Hydroaminoalkylation Products from Alkyl&#8208;Substituted Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>The regioselective conversion of alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes into linear hydroaminoalkylation products represents a strongly desirable synthetic transformation. In particular, such conversions of N&#8208;methylamine derivatives are of great scientific interest, because they would give direct access to important amines with unbranched alkyl chains.

For that purpose, new titanium catalysts have been developed, which are able to activate the &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H bond of more challenging &#945;&#8208;silylated amine substrates.

      <title>Efficient Deep Blue Platinum Acetylide Phosphors with Acyclic Diaminocarbene Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report five blue&#8208;phosphorescent platinum bis&#8208;phenylacetylide complexes with an investigation of their photophysical and electrochemical attributes. Three of the complexes (  1  &#8211;  3  ) are of the general formula  cis  &#8208;Pt(CNR)  2  (C&#8801;CPh)  2  , where CNR is a variably substituted isocyanide and C&#8801;CPh is phenylacetylide. These isocyanide complexes serve as precursors for complexes of the general formula  cis  &#8208;Pt(CNR)(ADC)(C&#8801;CPh)  2  (  4  and  5  ), where ADC is an acyclic diaminocarbene installed by amine nucleophilic addition to one of the isocyanides. All of the complexes exhibit deep blue phosphorescence with &#955;  max  ~430 nm in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin films. Whereas isocyanide complexes  1  &#8211;  3  exhibit modest photoluminescence quantum yields (  &#934;  PL  ), incorporation of one acyclic diaminocarbene ligand results in a three&#8208;fold to 16&#8208;fold increase in  &#934;  PL  while still maintaining an identical deep blue color profile.</dc:description>

      <title>Ru/CdS quantum dots templated on clay nanotubes as visible light active photocatalysts: optimization of S/Cd ratio and Ru content</title>
      <dc:description>Nanoarchitectual approach based on in situ quantum dots formation within/outside clay nanotubes was developed. The efficient and stable photocatalysts active under visible light were achieved with ruthenium doped cadmium sulfide quantum dots templated on the surface of azine modified halloysite nanotubes.

Ru doping enhanced the photocatalytic activity of CdS quantum dots thanks to better light adsorption and electron&#8208;hole pair separation due to formation of metal&#8208;semiconductor heterojunction. We found that sulfur to cadmium ratio (S/Cd) was the major factor for stable nanoparticles formation on the surface of the azine modified clay. The quantum yield of 9.3% was reached using Ru/CdS/Halloysite containing 5.2 wt. % of Cd doped with 0.1 wt. % of Ru and S/Cd ratio equaling one.

      <title>N&#8208;aryl amides as chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI has recently emerged as a versatile molecular imaging approach in which diamagnetic compounds can be utilized to generate MRI signal. To expand the scope of CEST MRI applications, herein, we systematically investigated the CEST properties of N&#8208;aryl amides with different N&#8208;aromatic substitution, revealing their chemical shifts (4.6&#8208;5.8 ppm) and exchange rates (up to thousands s  &#8208;1  ) are favorable to be used as CEST agents as compared to alkyl amide. As the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we used CEST MRI to detect the enzymatic metabolism of the drug acebutolol directly by its intrinsic CEST signal without any chemical labeling. Our study implies that N&#8208;acryl amides may enable the label&#8208;free CEST MRI detection of the metabolism of many N&#8208;aryl amide&#8208;containing drugs and a variety of enzymes that act on N&#8208;aryl amide, greatly expanding the scope of CEST MR molecular imaging.</dc:description>

      <title>New Organometallic Ruthenium(II) Compounds Synergistically Show Cytotoxic, Antimetastatic and Antiangiogenic Activities for the Treatment of Metastatic Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we newly designed and synthesized a small library of ten structurally related C,N&#8208;cyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes containing various pyridine&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand and chelating bipyridyl ligands (e.g., 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, 5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen)). The complexes were well characterized by NMR, electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses. Among the new ruthenium(II) derivatives, we identified that the complex  Ru8  bearing bulky moieties (i.e., phen and pentamethyl benzene) had the most potent cytotoxicity against all tested cancer cell lines, generating dose&#8208; and cell line&#8208;dependent IC  50  values at the range of 3.3&#8208;15.0 &#956;M. More significantly,  Ru8  not only efficiently inhibited the antimetastasis process against invasion and migration of tumor cells but also exhibited potent antivascular effects by suppressing HUVEC cells migration and tube formation  in vitro  and blocking vessel generation  in vivo  (chicken chorioallantoic membrane model). In a metastatic A2780 tumor xenograft&#8208;bearing mouse model, administration of  Ru8  outperformed antimetastatic agent NAMI&#8208;A and clinically approved cisplatin in terms of antitumor efficacy and inhibition of metastases to other organs. Overall, these data provided compelling evidence that the new cyclometalated ruthenium complex  Ru  8  is an attractive agent because of synergistically suppressing bulky tumors and metastasized tumor nudes. Therefore, the complex  Ru  8  deserves further investigations.</dc:description>

      <title>What is best strategy for water soluble fluorescence dyes? &#8211; A case study using long fluorescence lifetime DAOTA dyes</title>
      <dc:description>The lipophilic nature of organic dyes complicates their effectiveness in aqueous solutions. In this work we investigate three different strategies for achieving water&#8208;solubility of the diazaoxatriangulenium (DAOTA  +  ) chromophore: hydrophilic counter ions, aromatic sulfonation of the chromophore, and attachment of charged side chains.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The lipophilic nature of organic dyes complicates their effectiveness in aqueous solutions. In this work we investigate three different strategies for achieving water&#8208;solubility of the diazaoxatriangulenium (DAOTA  +  ) chromophore: hydrophilic counter ions, aromatic sulfonation of the chromophore, and attachment of charged side chains. The long fluorescence lifetime (FLT, &#964;  f  = 20 ns) of DAOTA  +  makes it a sensitive probe to analyze solvation and aggregation effects. Direct sulfonation of the chromophore was found to increase solubility drastically, but at the cost of greatly reduced quantum yields (QYs) due to enhanced non&#8208;radiative deactivation processes. The introduction of either cationic (4) or zwitterionic side chains (5), however, brings the FLT (&#964;  f  = 18 ns) and QY (&#966;  f  = 0.56) of the dye to the same level as the parent chromophore in acetonitrile.

      <title>Assembly of a Ternary Metallopeptide Complex at Specific DNA Sites Mediated by an AT&#8208;Hook Adaptor</title>
      <dc:description>
The selective recognition of specific DNA sequences is demonstrated by a supramolecular peptide assembly involving three peptide units. Metal coordination plays a dual role, bringing together the peptides as well as nucleating the DNA&#8208;binding &#945;&#8208;helices.







Abstract
The nickel(II)&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly of a multimeric DNA binder is described. The binder is composed of two metal&#8208;chelating peptides derived from a bZIP transcription factor (brHis2) and one short AT&#8208;hook domain equipped with two bipyridine ligands (HkBpy2). These peptides reversibly assemble in the presence of NiII ions at selected DNA sequences of 13 base pairs.

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Synergism by Hydrophobic&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of Amphiphilic Oligonucleotides</title>
      <dc:description>
Supersensitive! Herein, an efficient aggregation&#8208;induced synergism through the hydrophobic&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic oligonucleotides to generate high local concentration whereas retaining high reaction efficiency through hydrophobic&#8208;based aggregation is proposed, which is important for constructing efficient DNA nanomachines for ultrasensitive bioanalysis and clinical diagnosis.







Abstract
The evident contradiction between high local&#8208;concentration&#8208;based substrate reactivity and free&#8208;diffusion&#8208;based high reaction efficiency remains one of the important challenges in chemistry. Herein, we propose an efficient aggregation&#8208;induced synergism through the hydrophobic&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic oligonucleotides to generate high local concentration whereas retaining high reaction efficiency through hydrophobic&#8208;based aggregation, which is important for constructing efficient DNA nanomachines for ultrasensitive applications. MicroRNA&#8208;155, used as a model, triggered strand displacement amplification of the DNA monomers on the periphery of the 3D DNA nanomachine and generated an amplified fluorescent response for its sensitive assay. The local concentration of substrates was increased by a factor of at least 9.0&#215;105 through hydrophobic&#8208;interaction&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly in comparison with the traditional homogeneous reaction system, achieving high local&#8208;concentration&#8208;based reactivity and free&#8208;diffusion&#8208;based enhanced reaction efficiency. As expected, the aggregation&#8208;induced synergism by hydrophobic&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic oligonucleotides created excellent properties to generate a 3D DNA nanomachine with potential as an assay for microRNA&#8208;155 in cells. Most importantly, this approach can be easily expanded for the bioassay of various biomarkers, such as nucleotides, proteins, and cells, offering a new avenue for simple and efficient applications in bioanalysis and clinical diagnosis.

      <title>Re&#8208;Evaluation of a Fulvene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Replicating Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction System</title>
      <dc:description>
Analytical analysis: The previous claim of high diastereoselectivity for the endo isomers of a self&#8208;replicating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction has to be redrawn. We show that the claim is erroneous due to an incorrect assignment of NMR signals. We ask for a re&#8208;evaluation of computational studies that supported the claim (see figure).







Abstract
We re&#8208;evaluate our claim of a high diastereoselectivity in the self&#8208;relicating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between maleimide 1 and fulvene 3. It was shown that the system has a diastereoselectivity of 1.8:1 for NN&#8208;4:NX&#8208;4, which is contrary to the 16:1 ratio claimed by Dieckmann et&#8197;al. The analysis of 1H&#8197;NMR monitoring of the reaction revealed that both replicators show sigmoidal growth which is typical for auto&#8208;catalytic systems.

      <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Bromotryptophan Derivatives at Ambient Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>Mild reaction conditions are highly desirable for bio&#8208;orthogonal side chain derivatizations of amino acids, peptides or proteins due to the sensitivity of these substrates. Transition metal catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions are highly versatile, but usually require unfavourable reaction conditions, in particular, when applied with aryl bromides. Ligand&#8208;free solvent&#8208;stabilized Pd&#8208;nanoparticles represent an efficient and sustainable alternative to conventional phosphine&#8208;based catalysts, because the cross&#8208;coupling can be performed at considerably lower temperature. We report on the application of such a highly reactive heterogeneous catalyst for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of brominated tryptophan derivatives. The solvent&#8208;stabilized Pd&#8208;nanoparticles are even more efficient than the literature&#8208;known ADHP&#8208;Pd precatalyst. Interestingly, the latter also leads to the formation of quasi&#8208;homogeneous Pd&#8208;nanoparticles as the catalytic species. One advantage of our approach is the compatibility with aqueous and aerobic conditions at near&#8208;ambient temperatures and short reaction times of only 2 hours. The influence of different N &#945; &#8208;protecting groups, boronic acids as well as the impact of different amino acid side chains in bromotryptophan&#8208;containing peptides has been studied. Notably, a surprising acceleration of the catalysis was observed when palladium&#8208;coordinating side chains were present in proximal positions.</dc:description>

This provides evidence that a fine balance of the softness at W is important for acetylene coordination. Upon dissolving complex 8 in acetonitrile complex 13 is reconstituted in contrast to 9. All complexes exhibit the desired stability towards water and the observed effective coordination of the scorpionate ligand avoids decomposition to disulfide, an often&#8208;occurring reaction in sulfur ligand chemistry.

      <title>Shifting Towards &#945;V&#946;6 Integrin Ligands Using Novel Aminoproline&#8208;Based Cyclic Peptidomimetics</title>
      <dc:description>In recognition of the key role exerted by integrins in several life&#8208;threatening dysfunctions, the search for novel small&#8208;molecule probes that selectively recognize these surface receptors is still open and widely pursued. Inspired by previously established aminoproline (Amp)&#8208;RGD based cyclopeptidomimetics with attracting &#945;  V  &#946;  3  integrin affinity and selectivity, the design and straightforward synthesis of eighteen new AmpRGD chemotypes bearing additional structural variants were herein implemented, to shift toward peptide&#8208;like &#945;  V  &#946;  6  integrin targeted binders. Hence, the ligand competence of the synthesized products toward &#945;  V  &#946;  6  was evaluated in competitive binding assays on isolated receptors, and &#945;  V  &#946;  6  /&#945;  V  &#946;  3  selectivity determined for a subgroup of compounds, resulting in the identification of four very promising candidates.

      <title>Theoretical Study on Photoisomerization Mechanisms of Diphenyl Substituted N,C&#8208;chelate Organoboron Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>N, C&#8208;chelate organoboron compounds are widely employed as photo&#8208;responsive and optoelectronic materials due to their efficient photochromic reactivity. It was found in experiments that two diphenyl substituted organoboron compounds, B(ppy)Ph  2  (ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridyl) and B(iba)Ph  2  (iba=N&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;amine), display distinct photochemical reactivity. B(ppy)Ph  2  is inert upon irradiation while B(iba)Ph  2  undergoes photo&#8208;induced transformations, yielding BN&#8208;cyclohepta&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triene via a borirane intermediate. In this work, the complete active space self&#8208;consistent field and its second&#8208;order perturbation (CASPT2//CASSCF) methods were used to investigate the photo&#8208;induced reaction mechanisms of B(ppy)Ph  2  and B(iba)Ph  2  . Our calculations showed that the two compounds isomerize to borirane in the same way bypassing a transition state in S  1  state and a conical intersection between S  1  state and S  0  state. The energy barriers in S  1  state are 0.54 eV and 0.26 eV for B(ppy)Ph  2  and B(iba)Ph  2  , which were explained by analyzing the charge distributions of minima in S  0  and S  1  states. Our results provide helpful insights into the excited state dynamics of organoboron compounds, which could assist in rational design of boron&#8208;based photo&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular Sensor for Astringent Procyanidin C1: Fluorescent Artificial Tongue for Wine Components</title>
      <dc:description>An artificial tongue which detects astringent components for comprehensive evaluation of taste has not been established to date. Herein, we first propose fluorescent polythiophene (PT) derivatives (  S1  &#8208;  S3  ) modified with 3&#8208;pyridinum boronic acid as supramolecular chemosensors for wine components including astringent procyanidin C1. After numerous attempts for the synthetic conditions, more than 95 mol% of the PT unit was modified with the pyridinium boronic acid moiety. To evaluate the PT derivatives as chemosensors of the artificial tongue, qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed with four types of wine components (  i.e.  sweet, sour, bitter, and astringent tastes) in combination with pattern recognition models. Notably, procyanidin C1 in actual wine sample was successfully detected in a quantitative manner. In other words, we have established the authentic artificial tongue by the PT based supramolecular chemosensors.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The supramolecular esterase activatable synthetic M  +  /Cl  &#8210;  ion channel is reported which can form self&#8208;assembled rosette ion channel in the bilayer membrane by the action of esterase enzymes. The channel formation switches the cancer cells to apoptosis via an intrinsic pathway. The more interesting feature is that along with apoptosis this system disrupts autophagy in cancer cells via alkalization of lysosomes, which was confirmed through cell imaging and western blot analysis.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The supramolecular esterase activatable synthetic M  +  /Cl  &#8210;  ion channel is reported which can form self&#8208;assembled rosette ion channel in the bilayer membrane by the action of esterase enzymes. The channel formation switches the cancer cells to apoptosis via an intrinsic pathway. The more interesting feature is that along with apoptosis this system disrupts autophagy in cancer cells via alkalization of lysosomes, which was confirmed through cell imaging and western blot analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Effect of Site&#8208;specific O&#8208;Glycosylation on the Structural Behavior of NOTCH1 Receptor Extracellular EGF&#8208;like Domains 11 and 10</title>
      <dc:description>Human NOTCH1 receptor contains 36 epidermal growth factor (EGF)&#8208;like repeating domains, in which O&#8208;glycosylation status of EGF12 domain regulates the interaction with Notch ligands. Our interest is focused on the effect of specific O&#8208;glycosylation states on the structural behavior of EGF11 and EGF10, because they appeared to affect molecular mechanism in receptor&#8208;ligand interactions by inducing some conformational alterations in these domains and/or the regions connecting two domains. To understand the structural impact of various O&#8208;glycosylation patterns on the pivotal EGF&#8208;like repeats 10, 11, and 12, we performed chemical synthesis and NMR studies of site&#8208;specifically O&#8208;glycosylated EGF11 and EGF10. Our strategy enabled to synthesize four EGF11 and five EGF10 modules. The specific O&#8208;glycosylation states affected in vitro folding of EGF10 more than EGF11, while calcium ion had a larger effect on EGF11 folding. Comprehensive NMR studies shed light on the new type &#8220;sugar bridges&#8221; crosslinking Thr&#8208;O&#8208;GlcNAc in the consensus sequence C5&#8208;X&#8208;X&#8208;G&#8208;X&#8208;(T/S)&#8208;G&#8208;X&#8208;X&#8208;C6 and an amino acid in the hinge region between the domains, 445Thr&#8208;O&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;IIe451 in domain 11 and 405Thr&#8208;O&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Gln411 in domain 10, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>In situ growth of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles onto hierarchical Co3O4 nanosheet&#8208;assembled microflowers for efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution</title>
      <dc:description>The development of Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high Pt utilization efficiency toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of great significance for the future sustainable hydrogen economy. For rational design of high&#8208;performance HER electrocatalyst, the simultaneous consideration of both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects remains greatly challenging. Herein, a simple template&#8208;derived strategy is demonstrated for the in&#8208;situ growth of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles onto Co3O4 nanosheet&#8208;assembled microflowers (abbreviated as Pt/Co3O4 microflowers hereafter) by using the pre&#8208;fabricated PtCo&#8208;based Hofmann coordination polymer as reactive templates. The elaborate preparation of such intriguing hierarchical architecture with well&#8208;dispersed tiny Pt nanoparticles, abundant metal/oxide heterointerfaces and open configuration endows the formed Pt/Co3O4 microflowers with high Pt utilization efficiency, rich active sites, lowered energy barrier for water dissociation and expedited reaction kinetics. Consequently, the Pt/Co3O4 microflowers exhibit superior HER activity with a relatively low overpotential of 34 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, small Tafel slope (34 mV dec&#8208;1) and outstanding electrochemical stability, representing an attractive electrocatalyst for practical water splitting.

      <title>Symmetry Effects in Photoinduced Electron Transfer in Chlorin&#8208;Quinone Dyads: Adiabatic Suppression in the Marcus Inverted Region</title>
      <dc:description>In donor acceptor dyads undergoing photoinduced electron transfer (PET), a direction or pathway for electron movement is usually dictated by the redox properties and the separation distance between the donor and acceptor subunits, while the effect of symmetry is less recognized. We have designed and synthesized two isomeric donor&#8208;acceptor assemblies in which electronic coupling between donor and acceptor is switched on/off by the orbital symmetry control with the reorganization energy and charge transfer exothermicity being kept unchanged. Analysis of the optical absorption and luminescence spectra, supported by the DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, showed that PET in these assemblies corresponds to the Marcus inverted region (MIR) and has larger rate for isomer with weaker electronic coupling.

      <title>Functionalization of N2&#160;via Formal 1,3&#8208;Haloboration of a Tungsten(0) &#963;&#8208;Dinitrogen Complex</title>
      <dc:description>Boron tribromide and aryldihaloboranes were found to undergo 1,3&#8208;haloboration across one W&#8211;N&#8801;N moiety of a group 6 end&#8208;on dinitrogen complex (  i.e. trans  &#8208;[W(N2)2(dppe)2]).

Both the terminal N atom and boron center in the W&#8211;N=N&#8211;BXAr unit can be further derivatized using electrophiles and nucleophiles/Lewis bases, respectively.

      <title>Highlights on the binding of cobalta&#8208;bis&#8208;(dicarbollide) with glucose units</title>

For this purpose, we studied the interactions of COSAN with carbohydrate moieties that are ubiquitous in biological processes in bulk media and at interfaces. Octyl&#8208;glucopyranoside surfactant (C8G1) has been chosen as a sugar based model that self&#8208;assembles into micelles creating a glucose covered interface with water. COSAN was found to adsorb onto C8G1 micelles at low COSAN contents and to disrupt C8G1 micelles into mixed COSAN&#8208;C8G1 aggregates at high COSAN contents. COSAN interact mainly through (i) the hydrophobic effect with C8G1 monomers and (ii) the superchaotropic effect, i.e. with a thermodynamically favorable dehydration of the sugar moieties and of the COSAN, with sugars in a collective manner at the micellar surface and with linear&#8208;oligosaccharides with possible di&#8208;hydrogen bond formation.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Boron Hot Spots for the Site&#8208;Selective Installation of Iminoboronates on Peptide Chains</title>
      <dc:description>Boronic acids (BAs) are a promising bioconjugation function to design dynamic materials as they can establish reversible covalent bonds with oxygen/nitrogen nucleophiles that respond to different pH, ROS, carbohydrates and glutathione levels. However, the dynamic nature of these bonds also limits the control over the stability and site&#8208;selectivity of the bioconjugation, which ultimately leads to heterogeneous conjugates with poor stability under physiological conditions. Here we disclose a new strategy to install BAs on peptide chains. In this study, a &#8220;Boron Hot Spot&#8221; based on the 3&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one scaffold was developed and upon installation on a peptide N&#8208;terminal cysteine, enables the site&#8208;selective formation of iminoboronates with 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;phenyl boronic acids (Ka of 58128 &#177; 2 M&#8208;1). The reaction is selective in the presence of competing lysine &#949;&#8208;amino groups, and the resulting iminoboronates, displayed improved stability in buffers solutions and a cleavable profile in the presence of glutathione. Once developed, the methodology was used to prepare cleavable fluorescent conjugates with a laminin fragment, which enabled the validation of the 67LR receptor as a target to deliver cargo to cancer HT29 cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Carnoquinolines Target Copper Dyshomeostasis, Aberrant Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions, and Oxidative Stress</title>
      <dc:description>Metal dysregulation, oxidative stress, protein modification, and aggregation are factors strictly interrelated and associated with neurodegenerative pathologies. As such, all these aspects represent valid targets to counteract neurodegeneration and, therefore, the development of metal&#8208;binding compounds with other properties to combat multifactorial disorders is definitely on the rise. Here, we report the synthesis and in&#8208;depth analysis of the first hybrids of carnosine and 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline, Carnoquinolines (CarHQs), that combine the properties of the dipeptide with those of 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. CarHQs and their copper complexes were characterized through several techniques such as ESI&#8208;MS, NMR, UV&#8208;vis, and CD spectroscopy. CarHQs can modulate self&#8208; and copper&#8208;induced amyloid&#8208;&#946; aggregation. These hybrids combine the antioxidant activity of their parent compounds. Therefore, they can simultaneously scavenge free radicals and reactive carbonyl species thanks to the phenolic group and imidazole ring. These results indicate that CarHQs are promising multifunctional candidates for neurodegenerative disorders and, they are worthy of further studies.</dc:description>

These results indicate that CarHQs are promising multifunctional candidates for neurodegenerative disorders and, they are worthy of further studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In 6PP and  7D  6PP, the Ag  I  ion can coordinate to the nucleobase via the endocyclic N1 nitrogen atom, i.e. via the Watson&#8208;Crick edge. In contrast, this nitrogen atom is not available in  1D  6PP and  1,7D  6PP, so that in  1D  6PP an Ag  I  coordination is only possible via the Hoogsteen edge (N7). Reference duplexes with either adenine:adenine mispairs or canonical adenine:thymine base pairs were used to investigate the impact of the pyrazolyl moiety on the Ag  I  &#8208;binding properties. To determine the thermal and structural duplex stabilities in the absence or presence of Ag  I  , all duplexes were examined by UV and circular dichroism spectroscopic studies.

Nanoparticulate CMP (N&#8208;CMP) with an average diameter of 41 &#177; 4 nm was prepared through kinetic growth control in the Sonogashira coupling of 1,3,5&#8208;triethynylbenzene with 1,4&#8208;diiodobzene.

      <title>Charge&#8208;Separated and Lewis Paired Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Anion Exchange and CO2 Chemical Fixation</title>
      <dc:description>Charge&#8208;separated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a unique class of MOFs that can possess added properties originating from the exposed ionic species. We report a new charge&#8208;separated MOF, namely UNM&#8208;6, synthesized from a tetrahedral borate ligand and Co 2+ cation. UNM&#8208;6 crystalizes into the highly symmetric P&#8208;43n space group with four&#8208;fold interpenetration, despite the stoichiometric imbalance between the B and Co atoms, which also leads to loosely bound NO 3 &#8722; anions within the crystal structure. These NO 3 &#8722; ions can be quantitatively exchanged with various other anions, leading to Lewis acid (Co 2+ ) and Lewis base (anions) pairs within the pores and potentially cooperative catalytic activities. For example, UNM&#8208;6&#8208;Br, the MOF after anion exchange with Br &#8722; anions, displays high catalytic activity and stability in reactions of CO 2 chemical fixation into cyclic carbonates.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Charge&#8208;separated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a unique class of MOFs that can possess added properties originating from the exposed ionic species. We report a new charge&#8208;separated MOF, namely UNM&#8208;6, synthesized from a tetrahedral borate ligand and Co 2+ cation. UNM&#8208;6 crystalizes into the highly symmetric P&#8208;43n space group with four&#8208;fold interpenetration, despite the stoichiometric imbalance between the B and Co atoms, which also leads to loosely bound NO 3 &#8722; anions within the crystal structure. These NO 3 &#8722; ions can be quantitatively exchanged with various other anions, leading to Lewis acid (Co 2+ ) and Lewis base (anions) pairs within the pores and potentially cooperative catalytic activities. For example, UNM&#8208;6&#8208;Br, the MOF after anion exchange with Br &#8722; anions, displays high catalytic activity and stability in reactions of CO 2 chemical fixation into cyclic carbonates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Exceptionally Plastic/Elastic Organic Crystals of a Naphthalidenimine&#8208;Boron Complex Show Flexible Optical Waveguide Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Design of molecular compounds exhibiting flexibility is an emerging area of research. Although a fair amount of success has been achieved in the design of plastic or elastic crystals, realizing multi&#8208;dimensional plastic and elastic bending remains challenging. We report herein a naphthalidenimine&#8208;boron complex that showed size&#8208;dependent dual mechanical bending behavior whereas its parent Schiff base was observed to be brittle. Detailed crystallographic and spectroscopic analysis revealed the importance of boron in imparting the interesting mechanical properties. Further, the luminescence of the molecule was turned&#8208;on subsequent to boron complexation thereby allowing it to be explored for multi&#8208;mode optical waveguide applications. Our in&#8208;depth study of the size&#8208;dependent plastic and elastic bending of the crystals thus provides important insights in molecular engineering and could act as a platform for the development of future smart flexible materials for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>
