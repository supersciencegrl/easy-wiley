         <title>A Novel Thermocell System Using Proton Solvation Entropy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large redox entropy of proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction was utilized for thermoelectric energy conversion.







Abstract
The entropy change associated with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions significantly enhance the Seebeck coefficient (Se) of thermocells. A redox pair of [Ru(Hxim)6]2+/3+ (Him=imidazole, x=0&#8776;1) releases three protons in their one&#8208;electron redox reactions in thermocells, which gave a remarkably high Se of &#8722;3.7&#8197;mV&#8201;K&#8722;1 as confirmed by temperature&#8208;dependent square wave voltammetry. The value of Se is proportional to the redox reaction entropy (&#916;Src), which increased with the number of dissociating protons. This result demonstrates the utility of PCET reaction toward efficient thermoelectric conversion.

         <title>Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 at Coinage Metal Nanodendrites in Aqueous Ethanolamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrites to the front: Cu, Ag, and Au nanodendrites are directly grown on a glassy&#8208;carbon substrate via a facile galvanic replacement reaction. They can be used as effective electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 in an ethanolamine solution.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into usable chemicals is a promising path to address climate change and energy challenges. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of unique coinage metal (Cu, Ag, and Au) nanodendrites (NDs) via a facile galvanic replacement reaction (GRR), which can be effective electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 in an ethanolamine (EA) solution. Each metal ND surface was directly grown on glassy&#8208;carbon (GC) substrates from a mixture of Zn dust and the respective precursor solution. The electrocatalytic activities of the synthesized ND surfaces were optimized for CO2 reduction in EA solution by varying their composition. It was determined that a 0.05&#8197;mol fraction of EA exhibited the highest catalytic activity for all metal NDs. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques showed that metal&#8208;ND electrodes possessed higher current densities, lower onset potentials and lower charge&#8208;transfer resistances for CO2 reduction than their smooth polycrystalline electrode counterparts, indicating improved CO2 reduction catalytic activity. It was determined, using FTIR and NMR spectroscopy, that formate was produced as a result of the CO2 reduction.

         <title>A Straightforward Synthesis of Polyketides via Ester Dienolate Matteson Homologation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of ester dienolates as nucleophiles in Matteson homologations allows for the stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8208;hydroxy carboxyl acids, structural motifs widespread found in polyketide natural products.

The protocol is rather flexible and permits the introduction of substituents and functionalities also at those positions which are not accessible by the commonly used aldol reaction. Therefore, this ester dienolate Matteson approach is an interesting alternative to the &#8220;classical&#8221; polyketide syntheses.

         <title>Controlling the Surface Functionalization of Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles by Sequence&#8208;Defined Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (diameter about 2&#8197;nm) were surface&#8208;functionalized with cysteine&#8208;carrying precision macromolecules. These consisted of sequence&#8208;defined oligo(amidoamine)s (OAAs) with either two or six cysteine molecules for binding to the gold surface and either with or without a PEG chain (3400&#8197;Da). The presence of the PEG chain considerably increased the hydrodynamic diameter of both dissolved macromolecules and macromolecule&#8208;conjugated gold nanoparticles.

These consisted of sequence&#8208;defined oligo(amidoamine)s (OAAs) with either two or six cysteine molecules for binding to the gold surface and either with or without a PEG chain (3400&#8197;Da). They were characterized by 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, 1H&#8197;NMR diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy (DOSY), small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), and high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. The number of precision macromolecules per nanoparticle was determined after fluorescent labeling by UV spectroscopy and also by quantitative 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. Each nanoparticle carried between 40 and 100 OAA ligands, depending on the number of cysteine units per OAA. The footprint of each ligand was about 0.074&#8197;nm2 per cysteine molecule. OAAs are well suited to stabilize ultrasmall gold nanoparticles by selective surface conjugation and can be used to selectively cover their surface. The presence of the PEG chain considerably increased the hydrodynamic diameter of both dissolved macromolecules and macromolecule&#8208;conjugated gold nanoparticles.

         <title>What's in an Atom? A Comparison of Carbon and Silicon&#8208;Centred Amidinium&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Carboxylate Frameworks**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One atom makes all the difference: Changing the central atom from carbon to silicon in a tetraamidinium building block causes a dramatic change in the resulting hydrogen bonded amidinium/carboxylate frameworks. Generally, the silicon&#8208;containing systems are less likely to form predictable materials. DFT calculations and CSD searches reveal that tetraarylsilanes have a more stringently tetrahedral geometry than tetraarylmethanes.







Abstract
Despite their apparent similarity, framework materials based on tetraphenylmethane and tetraphenylsilane building blocks often have quite different structures and topologies. Herein, we describe a new silicon tetraamidinium compound and use it to prepare crystalline hydrogen bonded frameworks with carboxylate anions in water. The silicon&#8208;containing frameworks are compared with those prepared from the analogous carbon tetraamidinium: when biphenyldicarboxylate or tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)methane anions were used similar channel&#8208;containing networks are observed for both the silicon and carbon tetraamidinium. When terephthalate or bicarbonate anions were used, different products form. Insights into possible reasons for the different products are provided by a survey of the Cambridge Structural Database and quantum chemical calculations, both of which indicate that, contrary to expectations, tetraphenylsilane derivatives have less geometrical flexibility than tetraphenylmethane derivatives, that is, they are less able to distort away from ideal tetrahedral bond angles.

         <title>Dual Crosslinking Photo&#8208;Switches for Orthogonal Photo&#8208;Control of Hybridization Between Serinol Nucleic Acid and RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual wavelength&#8208;selective photo&#8208;regulation system was achieved. Novel 8&#8208;naphthylvinyladenine (NVA) and previously described 8&#8208;pyrenylvinyladenine (PVA) were incorporated into serinol nucleic acid (SNA). SNA containing NVA/NVA pair and NVA/PVA pair was orthogonally photo&#8208;regulated, establishing photo&#8208;control of four hybridization states of two SNA/RNA duplexes by irradiation with a suitable wavelength of light.







Abstract
Wavelength&#8208;selective photo&#8208;regulation by multiple chromophores responding to different wavelengths can expand the variation of photo&#8208;manipulating systems. Herein, we report the orthogonal photo&#8208;regulation of duplex formation between serinol nucleic acid (SNA) and RNA using light&#8208;induced crosslinking reactions mediated by a new photo&#8208;reactive nucleobase 8&#8208;naphthylvinyladenine (NVA) and previously described 8&#8208;pyrenylvinyladenine (PVA). An intrastrand crosslink was induced in an SNA strand containing two adjacent NVA residues by irradiation with 340&#8211;405&#8197;nm light; the crosslink was reversed by irradiation with &#8804;300&#8197;nm light. In an SNA strand with adjacent NVA and PVA residues, an intrastrand crosslink resulted from irradiation with 405&#8211;465&#8197;nm light that was reversed by irradiation with &#8804;340&#8197;nm light. Intrastrand photo&#8208;crosslinking caused severe destabilization of an SNA/RNA duplex, resulting in dissociation to single strands. Cycloreversion resulted in duplex formation. With these NVA/NVA and NVA/PVA photo&#8208;switches, four hybridization states of two SNA/RNA duplexes could be orthogonally photo&#8208;controlled by irradiation with a suitable wavelength of light.

         <title>Boronic Acid&#8208;Mediated Activity Control of Split 10&#8211;23 DNAzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Split, join, activate: Split DNAzymes made of two or more short nucleic acid strands are emerging as novel tools for biosensing applications. Herein, it is reported that the activity of 10&#8211;23 DNAzyme that was split into two nonfunctional fragments can be restored by formation of a boronate internucleoside linkage.







Abstract
The 10&#8211;23 DNAzyme is an artificially developed Mg2+&#8208;dependent catalytic oligonucleotide that can cleave an RNA substrate in a sequence&#8208;specific fashion. In this study, new split 10&#8211;23 DNAzymes made of two nonfunctional fragments, one of which carries a boronic acid group at its 5&#8242; end, while the other has a ribonucleotide at its 3&#8242; end, were designed. Herein it is demonstrated that the addition of Mg2+ ions leads to assembly of the fragments, which in turn induces the formation of a new boronate internucleoside linkage that restores the DNAzyme activity. A systematic evaluation identified the best&#8208;performing system. The results highlight key features for efficient control of DNAzyme activity through the formation of boronate linkages.

High&#8208;Z nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) have attracted attention in oncology as X&#8208;ray contrast agents and radiosensitizers that enhance the effect of radiation therapy.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray radiation is commonly employed in clinical practice for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Over the past decade, developments in nanotechnology have led to the use of high&#8208;Z elements as the basis for innovative new treatment platforms that enhance the clinical efficacy of X&#8208;ray radiation. Nanoscale metal&#8211;frameworks (nMOFs) are coordination networks containing organic ligands that have attracted attention as therapeutic platforms in oncology and other areas of medicine. In cancer therapy, X&#8208;ray activated, high&#8208;Z nMOFs have demonstrated potential as radiosensitizers that increase local radiation dose deposition and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This minireview summarizes current research on high&#8208;Z nMOFs in cancer theranostics and discusses factors that may influence future clinical application.

         <title>Simple Synthesis of a Heterocyclophane Exhibiting Anti&#8208;c&#8208;Met Activity by Acting as a Hatch Blocking Access to the Active Site**

Anti&#8208;c&#8208;Met activity using cyclophane framework: Bithiazolophane 1, which was conveniently prepared under reflux for only 15&#8197;min by Hantzsch thiazoles synthesis, exhibited anti&#8208;activity (IC50=603&#8197;nm) against c&#8208;Met. The computational site identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS&#8208;MC) showed 1 blocked access to the active site of c&#8208;Met by acting as a hatch.







Abstract
A simple approach to the synthesis of heterocyclophane consisting of two 4,4&#8217;&#8208;bithiazoles has been developed in mild conditions. The heterocyclophane with two short chains was conveniently prepared by Hantzsch thiazoles synthesis using the reaction of 3&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl&#8208;3&#8208;azapentanethiocarboxamide with 1,4&#8208;dibromobutane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione in methanol under reflux for only 15&#8197;min. Amino groups at the linkers of this heterocyclophane can be functionalized to give acylated and carbamate derivatives. Their properties as protein kinase inhibitors were investigated, and one of the heterocyclophanes exhibited specific anti&#8208;activity for c&#8208;mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (IC50=603&#8197;nm), among seven types of protein kinases investigated. The computational site identification by ligand competitive saturation method was used to determine why the one heterocyclophane exhibited strong anti&#8208;activity for c&#8208;mesenchymal epithelial transition factor.

Abstract
An unprecedented bird&#8208;nest high&#8208;nuclear molybdenum(V) cobalto&#8208;phosphate nanosized wheel modified by imidazole (im) and pyridine (py), {[H55(Mo24O48)(Co4O)2Co16(PO4)42(py)6(EtOH)2(H2O)11]&#8208; @[(Him)2(Hpy)]}(N&#8208;Et&#8208;py)(H2PO4)(py)7(EtOH)&#8901;12&#8201;H2O (1), has been successfully synthesized by self&#8208;assembly. The anionic huge wheel consists of two rare {Co4O} squares, four {Co4} tetramers, four {Mo4} tetramers and four {Mo2} dimers, linked by bridging oxygen atoms and [PO4] groups and encloses two imidazolium cations and a protonated pyridium for charge balance. Surprisingly, 1 represents the first twisted wheel&#8208;shaped cluster with a record high&#8208;nuclear molybdenum(V) cobalto&#8208;phosphate. The delocalized electron effects of the cluster are enhanced with the help of coordinated py ligands, which endows 1 with an excellent third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) response. Additionally, 1 also shows a better photocatalytic water oxidation activity than Co(NO3)2 with the O2 production of 205&#8197;&#956;mol during 6&#8197;h in the absence of the [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photosensitizer.

The anionic huge wheel consists of two rare {Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O} squares, four {Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} tetramers, four {Mo&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} tetramers and four {Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;} dimers, linked by bridging oxygen atoms and [PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] groups and encloses two imidazolium cations and a protonated pyridium for charge balance. Surprisingly, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; represents the first twisted wheel&#8208;shaped cluster with a record high&#8208;nuclear molybdenum(V) cobalto&#8208;phosphate.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Europium Complexes that Switch on Luminescence in Lysosomes of Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Watching lysosomes age with a &#8216;switch&#8208;on&#8217; optical sensor is shown to be possible by using four europium complexes with extended aryl&#8208;alkylnyl pyridine antennae that show very different pH&#8208;dependent behaviour. A &#8216;switch&#8208;on&#8217; of europium luminescence occurs at low pH, allowing confocal microscopy to reveal increases in image brightness of ageing lysosomes in live&#8208;cell imaging studies.







Abstract
A set of four luminescent EuIII complexes bearing an extended aryl&#8208;alkynylpyridine chromophore has been studied, showing very different pH&#8208;dependent behaviour in their absorption and emission spectral response. For two complexes with pKa values of 6.45 and 6.20 in protein&#8208;containing solution, the emission lifetime increases very significantly following protonation. By varying the gate time during signal acquisition, the &#8216;switch&#8208;on&#8217; intensity ratio could be optimised, and enhancement factors of between 250 to 1330 were measured between pH&#8197;8 and 4. The best&#8208;behaved probe showed no significant emission dependence on the concentration of endogenous cations, reductants, and serum albumin. It was examined in live&#8208;cell imaging studies to monitor time&#8208;dependent lysosomal acidification, for which the increase in observed image brightness due to acidification was a factor of 50 in NIH&#8208;3T3 cells.

         <title>Asymmetric Acceptor&#8211;Donor&#8211;Acceptor Polymers with Fast Charge Carrier Transfer for Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous conjugated polymers featuring asymmetric ternary acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A1&#8208;D&#8208;A2) electronic architecture has been designed through the gradual replacement of C atoms with N atoms in the skeletons. These polymers were investigated to determine an effective means for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution by modulating their interface charge transfer.







Abstract
Construction of local donor&#8211;acceptor architecture is one of the valid means for facilitating the intramolecular charge transfer in organic semiconductors. To further accelerate the interface charge transfer, a ternary acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A1&#8208;D&#8208;A2) molecular junction is established via gradient nitrogen substituting into the polymer skeleton. Accordingly, the exciton splitting and interface charge transfer could be promptly liberated because of the strong attracting ability of the two different electron acceptors. Both DFT calculations and photoluminescence spectra elucidate the swift charge transfer at the donor&#8208;acceptor interface. Consequently, the optimum polymer, N3&#8208;CP, undergoes a remarkable photocatalytic property in terms of hydrogen production with AQY405&#8197;nm=26.6&#8201;% by the rational design of asymmetric molecular junctions on organic semiconductors.

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Silicon in Organic Molecules As Carbenoid&#8208;Type Amphoteric Centers: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Planar tetracoordinate silicon: A group of stable tetracoordinate silicon (ptSi) molecules, which are stabilized by &#960;*&#8594;p donation, are reported. Interestingly, this donation also brings an unusual carbenoid&#8208;type behavior to Si.







Abstract
Designing and synthesizing a stable compound with a planar tetracoordinate silicon (ptSi) center is a challenging goal for chemists. Here, a series of potential aromatic ptSi compounds composed of four conjugated rings shared by a centrally embedded Si atom are theoretically designed and computationally verified. Both Born&#8211;Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations and potential energy surface scannings verify the high stability and likely existence of these compounds, particularly Si&#8208;16&#8208;5555 (SiN4C8H8) with 16&#8201;&#960; electrons, under standard ambient temperature and pressure. Notably, the H&#252;ckel aromaticity rule, which works well for single rings, is inconsistent with the high stability of Si&#8208;16&#8208;5555 where the 16&#8201;p electrons are spread over four five&#8208;membered rings fused together. Bonding analyses show that the strong electron donation from the peripheral 12&#8208;membered conjugated ring with 16&#8201;&#960; electrons to the vacant central atomic orbital Si&#8201;3pz leads to the stabilization for both the ptSi coordination and planar aromaticity. The partial occupation of Si&#8201;3pz results in the peculiar carbenoid&#8208;type behaviors for the amphoteric center. By modulating the electron density on the ring with substituent groups, we can regulate the nucleophilic and electrophilic properties of the central Si.

         <title>Generation of Oxidoreductases with Dual Alcohol Dehydrogenase and Amine Dehydrogenase Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic promiscuity of LysEDH&#8212;which naturally catalyzes the oxidative deamination of l&#8208;lysine at the &#1013;&#8208;amino group&#8212;was harnessed to create variants that exhibited alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) activities. These ADH and AmDH activities could be switched by changing the reaction conditions. The dual ADH&#8208;AmDH activity (i.e., alcohol aminase) was applied to convert benzyl alcohol to benzylamine using a single enzyme. The artwork illustrates a &#8220;water lever&#8221; that represents the switch of the enzyme's activity from an AmDH to an ADH and vice versa.

         <title>Metastability and seeding effects in the mechanochemical hybrid lead(II) iodide formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the mechanism for the mechanochemical synthesis of (C(NH  2  )  3  )  3  PbI  5  3  and (C(NH  2  )  3  )  4  PbI  6  4  and their conversion into each other. We investigated the syntheses of  3  at different frequencies and energies using in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. By splitting the reaction into single parts we could prove that the formation of  3  is simply dependent on the energy and mixing speed. The nucleation of  4  instead is slightly negative dependent on the energy but dependent on the mixing speed, while its growth is mostly independent of any influence. We were able to influence the reaction pathways by seeding the mixture with a small amount of powdery  4  . The formation of  4  is very likely an auto&#8208;catalytic process.  3  instead is metastable. It can be stabilized by energy, which beside mechanochemistry can also be achieved by temperature. The results showcases the complex nature of mechanochemical reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the self&#8208;assembly of a unique molecular container: hybrid hydrogen&#8208;bonded/metal&#8208;coordinated cage where both hydrogen&#8208;bonding and metal&#8208;coordination form the crucial part of the topology. The hybrid cage was prepared combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded rosette motif and palladium(II)/platinum(II) coordination to a pyridine ligand. We also show that the hybrid cage can be prepared by integrative self&#8208;sorting from simple components. We further manifest for the first time the genuine dual character of the hybrid cage as both self&#8208;assembling parts response selectively to different stimuli (such as phosphine and cyanurate), which results in the disassembly of the cage.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni2P interlayer and Mn doping synergistically expedite the HER kinetics of Co2P</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal phosphide is regarded as one of the most promising candidates to replace noble&#8208;metal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts. Nevertheless, the controllable design and synthesis of transition metal phosphide electrocatalyst with efficient and stable electrochemical performance are still very challenging. Herein, we report a novel hierarchical HER electrocatalyst consisting of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) coral&#8208;like Mn&#8208;doped Co  2  P @ an intermediate layer of Ni  2  P generated in&#8208;situ via phosphorization on Ni foam (MnCoP/NiP/NF). Notably, both the incorporation of Mn and introduction of the Ni  2  P interlayer promote Co atoms to carry more electrons, which is beneficial to reduce the force of the Co&#8208;H bond and optimize the adsorption energy of hydrogen intermediate (&#9474;&#8710;G  H*  &#9474;), thereby making MnCoP/NiP/NF exhibit outstanding HER performance with onset overpotential and Tafel slope as low as 31.2 mV and 61 mV dec  &#8208;1  , respectively in 1 M KOH electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Amino&#8208;Functionalization of Vinyl&#8208;Substituted Aromatic Diimides by Quantitative and Catalyst&#8208;Free Hydroamination**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Without a catalyst! Catalyst&#8208;free hydroamination reactions of a series of aromatic diimide compounds having vinyl groups proceeded quantitatively to afford simple but hitherto unexplored amino&#8208;group appended &#960;&#8208;systems. This hydroamination reaction offers a versatile platform to create amino&#8208;functionalized &#960;&#8208;electron materials.







Abstract
Development of facile and versatile synthetic tools for decorating &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules has attracted considerable interest because of their potential application in creating novel functional &#960;&#8208;systems. Reported herein are quantitative catalyst&#8208;free hydroamination reactions of a series of aromatic diimide compounds having vinyl groups at the &#960;&#8208;core, which have been confirmed by NMR, UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy, mass analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis. Kinetic studies revealed that the hydroamination reaction of a vinyl&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide with an aliphatic amine proceeded rapidly under benign conditions. Similarly, the two vinyl groups attached to aromatic diimides reacted with amines simultaneously, resulting in the formation of amine bisadducts and macromolecules. An amino group appended perylenediimide through an ethylene spacer at the &#960;&#8208;core exhibited distinct fluorescence switching in response to acid and base.

         <title>The Synthesis and Bioactivity of the Marine Macrolide Callyspongiolide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Callyspongiolide, a marine macrolide natural product, has garnered significant attention since its isolation in 2013. The synthetic endeavors to date towards this molecule are reviewed, which have established the absolute stereochemistry of this molecule and allowed further investigation into its bioactivity, while also contributing to the wider field of macrolide synthesis.







Abstract
Callyspongiolide, a macrolide natural product with a conjugated diene&#8208;ynic side chain, has garnered significant attention from the synthetic community since its isolation from a sea sponge in 2013. Herein, the approaches that have been applied to this bioactive natural product to date are reviewed. These synthetic endeavors have established the absolute stereochemistry of this molecule and allowed further investigation into its promising caspase&#8208;independent bioactivity, while also contributing to the wider field of macrolide synthesis.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Dependent Interactions of Amphiphilic PiB Derivative Metal Complexes with Amyloid Peptides A&#946; and Amylin**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid&#8208;targeted, amphiphilic metal chelates can form different micelles in aqueous solution and this influences their affinity to amyloid peptide aggregates. The separation of the targeting PiB unit from the metal binding macrocycle by a long hydrophobic chain allows for obtaining nanomolar affinities to both A&#946;1&#8208;40 and amylin aggregates. The GdL complexes also affect the aggregation rate of A&#946;1&#8208;40.







Abstract
Metal chelates targeted to amyloid peptides are widely explored as diagnostic tools or therapeutic agents. The attachment of a metal complex to amyloid recognition units typically leads to a decrease in peptide affinity. We show here that by separating a macrocyclic GdL chelate and a PiB targeting unit with a long hydrophobic C10 linker, it is possible to attain nanomolar affinities for both A&#946;1&#8208;40 (Kd=4.4&#8197;nm) and amylin (Kd=4.5&#8197;nm), implicated, respectively in Alzheimer's disease and diabetes. The Scatchard analysis of surface plasmon resonance data obtained for a series of amphiphilic, PiB derivative GdL complexes indicate that their A&#946;1&#8208;40 or amylin binding affinity varies with their concentration, thus micellar aggregation state. The GdL chelates also affect peptide aggregation kinetics, as probed by thioflavin&#8208;T fluorescence assays. A 2D NMR study allowed identifying that the hydrophilic region of A&#946;1&#8208;40 is involved in the interaction between the monomer peptide and the Gd3+ complex. Finally, ex vivo biodistribution experiments were conducted in healthy mice by using 111In labeled analogues. Their pancreatic uptake, &#8764;3&#8201;%ID&#8201;g&#8722;1, is promising to envisage amylin imaging in diabetic animals.

         <title>DpgC&#8208;Catalyzed Peroxidation of 3,5&#8208;Dihydroxyphenylacetyl&#8208;CoA (DPA&#8208;CoA): Insights into the Spin&#8208;Forbidden Transition and Charge Transfer Mechanisms**

Understanding oxygenases: The mechanism for the enzymatic cofactor&#8208;independent oxidation of 3,5&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetyl&#8208;CoA (DPA&#8208;CoA) is studied by combining multireference calculations on a model system with QM/MM calculations. The results reveal that intersystem crossing takes place without requiring the previous protonation of molecular oxygen.







Abstract
Despite being a very strong oxidizing agent, most organic molecules are not oxidized in the presence of O2 at room temperature because O2 is a diradical whereas most organic molecules are closed&#8208;shell. Oxidation then requires a change in the spin state of the system, which is forbidden according to non&#8208;relativistic quantum theory. To overcome this limitation, oxygenases usually rely on metal or redox cofactors to catalyze the incorporation of, at least, one oxygen atom into an organic substrate. However, some oxygenases do not require any cofactor, and the detailed mechanism followed by these enzymes remains elusive. To fill this gap, here the mechanism for the enzymatic cofactor&#8208;independent oxidation of 3,5&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetyl&#8208;CoA (DPA&#8208;CoA) is studied by combining multireference calculations on a model system with QM/MM calculations. Our results reveal that intersystem crossing takes place without requiring the previous protonation of molecular oxygen. The characterization of the electronic states reveals that electron transfer is concomitant with the triplet&#8211;singlet transition. The enzyme plays a passive role in promoting the intersystem crossing, although spontaneous reorganization of the water wire connecting the active site with the bulk presets the substrate for subsequent chemical transformations. The results show that the stabilization of the singlet radical&#8208;pair between dioxygen and enolate is enough to promote spin&#8208;forbidden reaction without the need for neither metal cofactors nor basic residues in the active site.

         <title>Crystal Structure and Non&#8208;Hydrostatic Stress&#8208;Induced Phase Transition of Urotropine Under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under pressure: High&#8208;pressure structural behavior of urotropine is studied using X&#8208;ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy, revealing a phase transition dependent on pressure transmitting medium hydrostaticity. The first successful Hirshfeld atom refinement on high&#8208;pressure diffraction data is also reported.







Abstract
High&#8208;pressure behavior of hexamethylenetetramine (urotropine) was studied in&#8197;situ using angle&#8208;dispersive single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared absorption (FTIR) spectroscopy. Experiments were conducted in various pressure&#8208;transmitting media to study the effect of deviatoric stress on phase transformations. Up to 4&#8197;GPa significant damping of molecular librations and atomic thermal motion was observed. A first&#8208;order phase transition to a tetragonal structure was observed with an onset at approximately 12.5&#8197;GPa and characterized by sluggish kinetics and considerable hysteresis upon decompression. However, it occurs only in non&#8208;hydrostatic conditions, induced by deviatoric or uniaxial stress in the sample. This behavior finds analogies in similar cubic crystals built of highly symmetric cage&#8208;like molecules and may be considered a common feature of such systems. DFT computations were performed to model urotropine equation of state and pressure dependence of vibrational modes. The first successful Hirshfeld atom refinements carried out for high&#8208;pressure diffraction data are reported. The refinements yielded more realistic C&#8722;H bond lengths than the independent atom model even though the high&#8208;pressure diffraction data are incomplete.

         <title>Impact of N&#8208;Truncated A&#946; Peptides on Cu&#8208; and Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Generated ROS: CuI Matters!</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Truncated but important: The ability of N&#8208;truncated amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides to either contribute to or prevent the production of deleterious reactive oxygen species by Cu or Cu(amyloid&#8208;&#946;) is examined, and evidence for the key role of copper(I) is presented.







Abstract
In vitro Cu(A&#946;1&#8211;x)&#8208;induced ROS production has been extensively studied. Conversely, the ability of N&#8208;truncated isoforms of A&#946; to alter the Cu&#8208;induced ROS production has been overlooked, even though they are main constituents of amyloid plaques found in the human brain. N&#8208;Truncated peptides at the positions 4 and 11 (A&#946;4&#8211;x and A&#946;11&#8211;x) contain an amino&#8208;terminal copper and nickel (ATCUN) binding motif (H2N&#8208;Xxx&#8208;Zzz&#8208;His) that confer them different coordination sites and higher affinities for CuII compared to the A&#946;1&#8211;x peptide. It has further been proposed that the role of A&#946;4&#8211;x peptide is to quench CuII toxicity in the brain. However, the role of CuI coordination has not been investigated to date. In contrast to CuII, CuI coordination is expected to be the same for N&#8208;truncated and N&#8208;intact peptides. Herein, we report in&#8208;depth characterizations and ROS production studies of Cu (CuI and CuII) complexes of the A&#946;4&#8211;16 and A&#946;11&#8211;16 N&#8208;truncated peptides. Our findings show that the N&#8208;truncated peptides do produce ROS when CuI is present in the medium, albeit to a lesser extent than the unmodified counterpart. In addition, when used as competitor ligands (i.e., in the presence of A&#946;1&#8211;16), the N&#8208;truncated peptides are not able to fully preclude Cu(A&#946;1&#8211;16)&#8208;induced ROS production.

         <title>Non&#8208;Planar Structures of Sterically Overcrowded Trialkylamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even record&#8208;breaking steric stress cannot enforce complete planarization of the nitrogen atom in trialkylamines as shown, for example, for di&#8208;1&#8208;adamantyl&#8208;exo&#8208;2&#8208;norbornylamine with the help of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and quantum chemical calculations in the solid phase as well as in the gas phase.







Abstract
Several amines with three bulky alkyl groups at the nitrogen atom, which exceed the steric crowding of triisopropylamine significantly, were synthesized, mainly by treating N&#8208;chlorodialkylamines with Grignard reagents. In six cases, namely tert&#8208;butyldiisopropylamine, 1&#8208;adamantyl&#8208;tert&#8208;butylisopropylamine, di&#8208;1&#8208;adamantylamines with an additional N&#8208;cyclohexyl or N&#8208;exo&#8208;2&#8208;norbonyl substituent, as well as 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine derivatives with N&#8208;cyclohexyl or N&#8208;neopentyl groups, appropriate single crystals were generated that enabled X&#8208;ray diffraction studies and analysis of the molecular structures. The four noncyclic amines adopt triskele&#8208;like conformations, and the sum of the three C&#8722;N&#8722;C angles is always in the range of 351.1&#176; to 352.4&#176;. Consequently, these amines proved to be structurally significantly flatter than trialkylamines without steric congestion, which is also signalized by the smaller heights of the NC3 pyramids (0.241&#8211;0.259&#8197;&#197;). There is no clear correlation between the heights of these pyramids and the degree of the steric crowding in the new amines, presumably because steric repulsion is partly compensated by dispersion interaction. In the cases of the two heterocyclic amines, the steric stress is smaller, and the molecular structures include quite different conformations. Quantum chemical calculations led to precise gas&#8208;phase structures of the sterically overcrowded trialkylamines exhibiting heights of the NC3 pyramids and preferred molecular conformers which are similar to those resulting from the X&#8208;ray studies.

         <title>Doubly Protective MOF&#8208;Photo&#8208;Fabrics: Facile Template&#8208;Free Synthesis of PCN&#8208;222&#8208;Textiles Enables Rapid Hydrolysis, Photo&#8208;Hydrolysis and Selective Oxidation of Multiple Chemical Warfare Agents and Simulants</title>

         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) PCN&#8208;222 has demonstrated the capacity to rapidly and catalytically hydrolyze nerve agents while simultaneously photo&#8208;oxidizing blister agents. Here, conformal PCN&#8208;222&#8208;fabric composites were synthesized without the need for fiber pretreatment. Besides hydrolysis and photo&#8208;oxidation of chemical warfare agents and simulants, photo&#8208;hydrolysis of nerve agents and simulants by a MOF is demonstrated for the first time.







Abstract
New materials and chemical knowledge for improved personal protection are among the most pressing needs in the international community. Reported attacks using chemical warfare agents (CWAs,) including organophosphate soman (GD) and thioether mustard gas (HD) are driving research in field&#8208;deployable catalytic composites for rapid toxin degradation. In this work, we report simple template&#8208;free low temperature synthesis that enables for the first time, a deployable&#8208;structured catalytic metal&#8208;organic framework/polymer textile composite &#8220;MOF&#8208;fabric&#8221; showing rapid hydrolysis and oxidation of multiple active chemical warfare agents, GD and HD, respectively, and their simulants. Our method yields new zirconium&#8211;porphyrin based nano&#8208;crystalline PCN&#8208;222 MOF&#8208;fabrics with adjustable MOF loading and robust mechanical adhesion on low&#8208;cost nonwoven polypropylene fibers. Importantly, we describe quantitative kinetic analysis confirming that our MOF&#8208;fabrics are as effective as or better than analogous MOF powders for agent degradation, especially for oxidation. Faster oxidation using the MOF&#8208;fabrics is ascribed to the composite geometry, where active MOF catalysts are uniformly displayed on the MOF&#8208;textile enabling better reactant transport and reactive oxidant generation. Furthermore, we note the discovery of visible photo&#8208;activation of GD hydrolysis by a MOF&#8208;fabric, which is ascribed to oxidation at the active metal node site, significantly increasing the rate over that observed without illumination. These results provide important new insights into the design of future materials and chemical systems to protect military, first&#8208;responders, and civilians upon exposure to complex chemical toxins.

         <title>Increasing the Complexity in the MIL&#8208;53 Structure: The Combination of the Mixed&#8208;Metal and the Mixed&#8208;Linker Concepts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different metal combinations and different linker ratios have been used to synthesize isoreticular mixed&#8208;metal/mixed&#8208;linker MIL&#8208;53 materials. The direct synthesis procedure at ambient pressure resulted in a statistical distribution of all components within the framework structure. The material properties, particularly the breathing behavior, can be tailored by the selection of suitable combinations and ratios of the components.







Abstract
The isoreticular mixed&#8208;component concept is a promising approach to tailor the material properties of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. While isoreticular mixed&#8208;metal or mixed&#8208;linker materials are commonly synthesized, the combination of both concepts for the development of isoreticular materials featuring both two metals and two linkers is still rarely investigated. Herein, we present the development of mixed&#8208;metal/mixed&#8208;linker MIL&#8208;53 materials that contain different metal combinations (Al/Sc, Al/V, Al/Cr, Al/Fe) and different linker ratios (terephthalate/2&#8208;aminoterephthalate). The possibility of changing the metal combination and the linker ratio independently from each other enables a large variety of modifications. A thorough characterization (PXRD, ATR&#8208;IR, TGA, 1H&#8197;NMR, ICP&#8208;OES) confirmed that all components were incorporated into the framework structure with a statistical distribution. Nitrogen physisorption measurements showed that the breathing behavior can be tailored by adjusting the linker ratio for all metal combinations. All materials were successfully used for post&#8208;synthetic modification reactions with maleic anhydride.

         <title>Synthesis and Coordination Behavior of a New Hybrid Bidentate Ligand with Phosphine and Silylene Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand with different Lewis base donor sites of phosphorus(III) and silicon(II). The ligands are arranged in 1,2&#8208;position at the benzene ring to generate mainly five&#8208;membered ring compounds containing a metal atom. The exceptions of the compounds show clearly that the metal is preferentially coordinated to the silylene atom rather than to the phosphane site of the ligand.







Abstract
This work describes the synthesis and coordination behavior of a new mixed&#8208;donor ligand PhC(NtBu)2SiC6H4PPh2 (1) containing both silylene and phosphine donor sites. Ligand 1 was synthesized from a reaction of ortho&#8208;lithiated diphenylphosphinobenzene (LiC6H4PPh2) with chlorosilylene (PhC(NtBu)2SiCl). Treatment of 1 with Se and GeCl2 resulted in SiIV compounds 2 and 3 by selective oxidation of the silylene donor. This strong &#963;&#8208;donor ligand induces dissociation of CuCl and PhBCl2 leading to formation of ionic complexes 4 and 5 respectively. The reaction of 1 with ZnCl2 and AlCl3 resulted in the formation of chelate complexes 5 and 7, respectively, while treatment with EtAlCl2 and GaCl3 forms monodentate complexes 8 and 9. X&#8208;ray analysis of 4 showed that the copper is in the spiro center of the two five&#8208;membered rings. Moreover, the copper(I)chloride has not been oxidized but dissociates to Cu+ and [CuCl2]&#8722;. All the compounds are well characterized by mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, NMR spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

         <title>Coordination Behavior of a P4&#8208;Butterfly Complex towards Transition Metal Lewis Acids &#8211; Preservation versus Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of the P4 butterfly complex [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2}2(&#181;,&#951;1:1&#8208;P4)] (1, Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; = &#951;5&#8208;C5H2tBu3) towards divalent Co, Ni and Zn salts is investigated. The reaction with the bromide salts leads to [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2}2(&#181;3,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4){MBr2}] (M = Co (2Co), Ni (2Ni), Zn (2Zn)) where the P4 butterfly scaffold is preserved. The use of the weakly ligated Co complex [Co(NCCH3)6][SbF6]2, results in the formation of [{(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2)2(&#181;3,&#951;4:1:1&#8208;P4)}2Co][SbF6]3 (3), representing the second example of a homoleptic&#8208;like octaphospha&#8208;metalla&#8208;sandwich complex. The formation of the threefold positively charged complex 3 occurs via redox processes, which among others also enables the formation of [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2}4(&#181;5,&#951;4:1:1:1:1&#8208;P8){Co(CO)2}][SbF6] (4), bearing a rare octaphosphabicyclo[3.3.0]octane unit as a ligand. On the other hand, the reaction with [Zn(NCCH3)4][PF6]2 yields the spiro complex [{(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2)2(&#181;3,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4)}2Zn][PF6]2 (5) under preservation of the initial structural motif.</dc:description>

The use of the weakly ligated Co complex [Co(NCCH3)6][SbF6]2, results in the formation of [{(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2)2(&#181;3,&#951;4:1:1&#8208;P4)}2Co][SbF6]3 (3), representing the second example of a homoleptic&#8208;like octaphospha&#8208;metalla&#8208;sandwich complex. The formation of the threefold positively charged complex 3 occurs via redox processes, which among others also enables the formation of [{Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2}4(&#181;5,&#951;4:1:1:1:1&#8208;P8){Co(CO)2}][SbF6] (4), bearing a rare octaphosphabicyclo[3.3.0]octane unit as a ligand. On the other hand, the reaction with [Zn(NCCH3)4][PF6]2 yields the spiro complex [{(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Fe(CO)2)2(&#181;3,&#951;2:1:1&#8208;P4)}2Zn][PF6]2 (5) under preservation of the initial structural motif.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The introduction of non&#8208;conventional elements into &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems has been studied to manipulate the electronic states and properties of compounds.&#160; In this work, we synthesized boron and germanium&#8208;containing hybrid macrocycles as a new class of element&#8208;hybrid conjugated systems.&#160; The palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille cross coupling of bis(bromothienyl)borane and bis(trimethylstannylthienyl)&#8208; or bis(trimethylstannylphenyl)&#8208;substituted dithienogermoles as the boron and germanium&#8208;containing building block, respectively, produced a mixture of several macrocyclic compounds. &#160;Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of the 2:2 coupling product revealed a planar structure with a cavity inside the macrocycle.&#160; The optical properties of the macrocyclic products indicated rather small electronic interactions between the building units.&#160; However, intramolecular photo energy transfer from the dithienogermole unit to the boron unit was clearly observed with respect to the fluorescence spectra.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Shigella sonnei  surface polysaccharides are well&#8208;established protective antigens against this major cause of diarrhoeal disease.

Herein, the stereoselective synthesis of  S. sonnei  oligosaccharides comprising two and three repeating units is reported for the first time. Several sets of up to seven protecting groups were explored, shedding light on the singular conformational behavior of protected altrosamine and altruronic residues. A disaccharide building block equipped with three distinct  N  &#8208;protecting groups and featuring the uronate moiety already in place was designed to accomplish the iterative high yielding glycosylation at the axial 4&#8208;OH of the altruronate component and achieve the challenging full deprotection step.

         <title>A series of bisamide&#8208;substituted diacetylenes exhibiting terminal alkyl odd&#8208;even parity effect on mechano&#8208;activation for the subsequent photopolymerization property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diacetylene derivatives exhibit solid&#8208;state polymerization to polydiacetylene initiated by UV light or &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation. The activation of the photopolymerization highly relies on the monomer diynes arrangement. Recently, we have demonstrated the first mechanoresponsive bisamide substituted diacetylenes (DAs) showing dramatic switching from light&#8208;inert to light&#8208;reactive state upon a given pressure. The origin of this unique phenomenon was apparently related to the pressure&#8208;sensitive crystalline transition in DAs, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. To obtain the insight, we herein present a series of DAs with varying terminal alkyl spacer length, and their molecular structural effect on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding and steric repulsion. In pristine states, even&#8208;parity DAs were inactive upon UV irradiation (&#955;=254 nm) unless external pressure was given. By contrast, odd&#8208;parity DAs were easily polymerized upon UV irradiation without pressure application. However, the pressure&#8208;induced crystalline phase transition exhibiting photopolymerization was valid for all DAs regardless of their alkyl spacer length. A systematic investigation revealed that the terminal alkyl spacer length, especially its odd&#8208;even parity plays a key role to determine the intrinsic intermolecular hydrogen bonding nature of DA crystals and resultant molecular packing. In addition, the relevant thermochromic behaviour was also observed from photopolymerized polydiacetylenes.</dc:description>

The synthesis of a large range of 5,15&#8208;bis(4&#8208;ethoxycarbonylphenyl)porphyrin derivatives, through Suzuki and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions of an easily accessible corresponding meso&#8208;dibrominated trans&#8208;A2B2&#8208;porphyrin with commercially available boronic acids or terminal alkynes is reported.







Abstract
Differently functionalized porphyrin linkers represent the key compounds for the syntheses of new porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which have gathered great interest within the last two decades. Herein we report the synthesis of a large range of 5,15&#8208;bis(4&#8208;ethoxycarbonylphenyl)porphyrin derivatives, through Suzuki and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions of an easily accessible corresponding meso&#8208;dibrominated trans&#8208;A2B2&#8208;porphyrin with commercially available boronic acids or terminal alkynes. The resulting porphyrins were fully characterized through NMR, MS, and IR spectroscopy and systematically investigated through UV/Vis absorption. Finally, selected structures were saponified to the corresponding carboxylic acids and subsequently proven to be suitable for the synthesis of surface&#8208;anchored MOF thin films.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The synthesis&lt;/b&gt; of a large range of 5,15&#8208;bis(4&#8208;ethoxycarbonylphenyl)porphyrin derivatives, through Suzuki and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions of an easily accessible corresponding &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;dibrominated trans&#8208;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;porphyrin with commercially available boronic acids or terminal alkynes is reported.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differently functionalized porphyrin linkers represent the key compounds for the syntheses of new porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which have gathered great interest within the last two decades. Herein we report the synthesis of a large range of 5,15&#8208;bis(4&#8208;ethoxycarbonylphenyl)porphyrin derivatives, through Suzuki and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions of an easily accessible corresponding &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;dibrominated &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;porphyrin with commercially available boronic acids or terminal alkynes. The resulting porphyrins were fully characterized through NMR, MS, and IR spectroscopy and systematically investigated through UV/Vis absorption. Finally, selected structures were saponified to the corresponding carboxylic acids and subsequently proven to be suitable for the synthesis of surface&#8208;anchored MOF thin films.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Activation of Molecular Oxygen by a Cobalt(II) Tetra&#8208;NHC Complex**

Hydrogen peroxide from air: Upon reaction of O2 from air with a cobalt(II) tetra N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex at ambient conditions, the first reported dicobalt(III) &#956;2&#8208;peroxo NHC is formed (see scheme). The reaction proceeds by an elusive end&#8208;on superoxo species, as demonstrated by EPR and DFT. The &#956;2&#8208;peroxo complex is applied to obtain hydrogen peroxide from air, when reacted with Br&#248;nsted acids.







Abstract
The first dicobalt(III) &#956;2&#8208;peroxo N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex is reported. It can be quantitatively generated from a cobalt(II) compound bearing a 16&#8208;membered macrocyclic tetra&#8208;NHC ligand via facile activation of dioxygen from air at ambient conditions. The reaction proceeds via an end&#8208;on superoxo intermediate as demonstrated by EPR studies and DFT. The peroxo moiety can be cleaved upon addition of acetic acid, yielding the corresponding CoIII acetate complex going along with H2O2 formation. In contrast, both CoII and CoIII complexes are also studied as catalysts to utilize air for olefin and alkane oxidation reactions; however, not resulting in product formation. The observations are rationalized by DFT&#8208;calculations, suggesting a nucleophilic nature of the dicobalt(III) &#956;2&#8208;peroxo complex. All isolated compounds are characterized by NMR, ESI&#8208;MS, elemental analysis, EPR and SC&#8208;XRD.

         <title>Heterogeneous Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of Diethyl Ether for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nuclear spin hyperpolarization of gases allows to boost the resolution of pulmonary MRI. Up to 1.3&#8201;% 1H polarization of diethyl ether anesthetic vapor was obtained using pairwise addition of parahydrogen to ethyl vinyl ether over Rh/TiO2 catalyst. The lifetime of diethyl ether hyperpolarization can be prolonged by its liquefaction. MRI visualization of hyperpolarized diethyl ether was demonstrated with high spatial and temporal resolution.







Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of hyperpolarized gases as contrast agents provides valuable information on lungs structure and function. While the technology of 129Xe hyperpolarization for clinical MRI research is well developed, it requires the expensive equipment for production and detection of hyperpolarized 129Xe. Herein we present the 1H hyperpolarization of diethyl ether vapor that can be imaged on any clinical MRI scanner. 1H nuclear spin polarization of up to 1.3&#8201;% was achieved using heterogeneous hydrogenation of ethyl vinyl ether with parahydrogen over Rh/TiO2 catalyst. Liquefaction of diethyl ether vapor proceeds with partial preservation of hyperpolarization and prolongs its lifetime by &#8776;10 times. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle 2D 1H MRI of hyperpolarized diethyl ether was demonstrated with 0.1&#215;1.1 mm2 spatial and 120&#8197;ms temporal resolution. The long history of use of diethyl ether for anesthesia is expected to facilitate the clinical translation of the presented approach.

         <title>An Antimony(III) Fluoride Oxalate With Large Birefringence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent materials play a key role in modulating the polarization of light and thus in optical communication as well as the laser techniques and science. Designing new, excellent birefringent materials remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and synthesized the first antimony(III) fluoride oxalate birefringent material, KSb  2  C  2  O  4  F  5  , by a combination of delocalized  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated [C  2  O  4  ]  2&#8208;  groups, stereochemical active Sb  3+  cations, and the most electronegative F element. The [C  2  O  4  ]  2&#8208;  groups are not in an optimal arrangement in the crystal structure of KSb  2  C  2  O  4  F  5  . Remarkably, KSb  2  C  2  O  4  F  5  exhibits a large birefringence (&#916;  n  = 0.170 @546 nm) that is even better than the well&#8208;known commercial birefringent material  &#945;  &#8208;BaB  2  O  4  , whereas the latter features an optimal arrangement of  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated [B  3  O  6  ]  3&#8208;  groups. Based on the first&#8208;principles calculations, this prominent birefringence should be attributed to the alliance of planar  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated [C  2  O  4  ]  2&#8208;  anions, highly distorted SbO  2  F  2  and SbOF  3  polyhedra with stereochemical activity lone pair. Combination of lone pair electrons and  &#960;  &#8208;conjugated systems enables to boost the birefringence to a large extent and will help to develop high&#8208;performance birefringent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical modulation of the solid&#8208;state luminescence of tricarbonyl rhenium(I) complexes through the interplay between two triplet excited states</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanoresponsive luminescence (MRL) active materials promise smart devices for sensing, optoelectronics, and security. Herein is the first report on the MRL&#8208;activity of two Re(I) complexes, opening up new opportunities for applications in this field. Both complexes exhibit marked solid&#8208;state luminescence enhancement (SLE) effect. Pristine microcrystalline powders emit in the yellow&#8208;green region, grinding led to an amorphous phase with concomitant emission red&#8208;shift and shrinking of photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields and lifetimes. Quantum chemical calculations revealed the existence of two low&#8208;lying triplet excited states of very close energy levels, i.e. 3IL and 3MLCT, having respectively almost pure intraligand and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer character. Transition between these states could be promoted by rotation around the pyridyltriazole&#8208;phenylbenzoxazole (pyta&#8208;PBO) bond. In microcrystals, where rotations are hindered, the 3IL state induces prominent PL emission at short wavelengths. Upon grinding, rotation is facilitated and the transition to the 3MLCT state results in a larger proportion of long&#8208;wavelength PL. FTIR spectroscopic analyses and variable temperature PL spectroscopy showed that the opening of vibrational modes favours non&#8208;radiative deactivation of the triplet states in the amorphous phase. In solutions, PL only arises from the 3MLCT state. The same mechanism accounts for the spectroscopic differences observed when passing from crystals to amorphous powders, and then to solutions, clarifying the link between SLE and MRL for these complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybridorubrins A&#8211;D: Azaphilone Heterodimers from Stromata of Hypoxylon fragiforme and Insights into the Biosynthetic Machinery for Azaphilone Diversification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two become one! Hybridorubrins A&#8211;D, unprecedented bis&#8208;azaphilones isolated from the stromata of the ascomycete Hypoxylon fragiforme, are composed of mitorubrin&#8208; and fragirubrin&#8208;type moieties. As revealed by genome analysis, two distantly located biosynthetic gene clusters work together to form these precursors. In contrast to their building blocks, the hybridorubrins exhibit strong inhibitory activity against biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus.







Abstract
The diversity of azaphilones in stromatal extracts of the fungus Hypoxylon fragiforme was investigated and linked to their biosynthetic machineries by using bioinformatics. Nineteen azaphilone&#8208;type compounds were isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, and their absolute stereoconfigurations were assigned by using Mosher ester analysis and electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy. Four unprecedented bis&#8208;azaphilones, named hybridorubrins A&#8211;D, were elucidated, in addition to new fragirubrins F and G and various known mitorubrin derivatives. Only the hybridorubrins, which are composed of mitorubrin and fragirubrin moieties, exhibited strong inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation. Analysis of the genome of H.&#8197;fragiforme revealed the presence of two separate biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) hfaza1 and hfaza2 responsible for azaphilone formation. While the hfaza1 BGC likely encodes the assembly of the backbone and addition of fatty acid moieties to yield the (R)&#8208;configured series of fragirubrins, the hfaza2 BGC contains the necessary genes to synthesise the widely distributed (S)&#8208;mitorubrins. This study is the first example of two distant cross&#8208;acting fungal BGCs collaborating to produce two families of azaphilones and bis&#8208;azaphilones derived therefrom.

         <title>Regulating Mitochondrial pH with Light and Implications for Chemoresistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria pH regulation: A BODIPY&#8208;based photoacid generator (BD&#8208;PAG) exhibited mitochondria&#8208;selective targeting. Under red&#8208;light irradiation, BD&#8208;PAG can release protons to decrease mitochondria pH and reduce membrane potential, which consequently promotes permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane. Based on these properties, a combination therapy with chlorambucil indicates the potential application of BD&#8208;PAG in anti&#8208;chemoresistance (see figure).







Abstract
Chemoresistance is one of the major challenges for cancer treatment, more recently ascribed to defective mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), significantly diminishing chemotherapeutic agent&#8208;induced apoptosis. A boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore&#8208;based triarylsulfonium photoacid generator (BD&#8208;PAG) was used to target mitochondria with the aim to regulate mitochondrial pH and further depolarize the mitochondrial membrane. Cell viability assays demonstrated the relative biocompatibility of BD&#8208;PAG in the dark while live cell imaging suggested high accumulation in mitochondria. Specific assays indicated that BD&#8208;PAG is capable of regulating mitochondrial pH with significant effects on mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Therapeutic tests using chlorambucil in combination with BD&#8208;PAG revealed a new strategy in chemoresistance suppression.

         <title>3D&#8208;Non&#8208;Destructive Imaging through Heavy Metal&#8208;Eosin Salt Contrast Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional histology is a destructive technique based on the evaluation of 2D slices of a 3D biopsy. By using 3D X&#8208;ray histology these obstacles can be overcome, but their application is still restricted due to the inherently low attenuation properties of soft tissue. In order to solve this problem, the tissue can be stained before X&#8208;ray computed tomography (CT) imaging to enhance the soft tissue X&#8208;ray contrast. Evaluation of brominated fluorescein salts revealed a mutual influence of the number of bromine atoms and the cations applied on the achieved contrast enhancement. The dibromo fluorescein barium salt turned out to be the ideal X&#8208;ray contrast agent, allowing for 3D imaging and subsequent complementing counterstaining applying standard histological techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Enthalpically and Entropically Favorable Self&#8208;Assembly: Synthesis of&#160;C4h&#8208;Symmetric Tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes by Regioselective Introduction of Pyridine Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in solution generally occurs due to either an enthalpic or an entropic gain; however, designing &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems that simultaneously exhibit enthalpically and entropically favorable self&#8208;assembly behavior is challenging. Herein, we disclose the self&#8208;assembly behavior of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes, which is driven by both enthalpy and entropy. A single&#8208;crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction analysis demonstrated that molecules of these tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes form face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked dimers&#160; with a 1D columnar structure due to the circularly arranged dipole moments. Importantly, concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent&#160;  1  H NMR spectra revealed that the formation of self&#8208;assemblies of tetraazatetrathia[8]circulenes in chloroform and methanol is favored by both enthalpic and entropic factors. The unique association behavior is due to the presence of sp  2  &#8208;hybridized nitrogen atoms, which weakly coordinate to the hydrogen atoms of these solvents and reduce the&#160; &#960; &#8208;electron density of the circulene cores.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Fluorinated Cellodextrins Identifies a New Allomorph for Cellulose&#8208;Like Materials**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generating glycomaterials: Enzymatic incorporation of singly and multiply fluorinated glucose residues into cellodextrin chains produces selectively fluorinated cellodextrins that self&#8208;assemble into crystalline materials. Multiply 6&#8208;fluorinated cellodextrin gave rise to an allomorph not previously reported for celluloses or cellulose&#8208;like materials. Our findings highlight the potential of chemoenzymatic synthesis for generating novel glycomaterials of controlled molecular structure and morphology.







Abstract
Understanding the fine details of the self&#8208;assembly of building blocks into complex hierarchical structures represents a major challenge en route to the design and preparation of soft&#8208;matter materials with specific properties. Enzymatically synthesised cellodextrins are known to have limited water solubility beyond DP9, a point at which they self&#8208;assemble into particles resembling the antiparallel cellulose&#8197;II crystalline packing. We have prepared and characterised a series of site&#8208;selectively fluorinated cellodextrins with different degrees of fluorination and substitution patterns by chemoenzymatic synthesis. Bearing in mind the potential disruption of the hydrogen&#8208;bond network of cellulose&#8197;II, we have prepared and characterised a multiply 6&#8208;fluorinated cellodextrin. In addition, a series of single site&#8208;selectively fluorinated cellodextrins was synthesised to assess the structural impact upon the addition of one fluorine atom per chain. The structural characterisation of these materials at different length scales, combining advanced NMR spectroscopy and microscopy methods, showed that a 6&#8208;fluorinated donor substrate yielded multiply 6&#8208;fluorinated cellodextrin chains that assembled into particles presenting morphological and crystallinity features, and intermolecular interactions, that are unprecedented for cellulose&#8208;like materials.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Ligand Cooperation: The Concept and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The term boron&#8208;ligand cooperation was introduced to describe a specific mode of action by which certain metal&#8208;free systems activate chemical bonds. The main characteristic of this mode of action is that one covalently bound substituent at the boron is actively involved in the bond activation process and changes to a datively bound ligand in the course of the bond activation. Within this review, we reflect on how the term boron&#8208;ligand cooperation evolved and discuss examples of bond activation by boron&#8208;ligand cooperation. We furthermore show that systems that operate via boron&#8208;ligand cooperation can complement the reactivity of classic intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs and summarize applications of this new concept for metal&#8208;free catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and electronic control of 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole bidentate ligand in copper chemistry with application to catalysis in the A3 coupling reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce the hybrid bidentate 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole (pyb) ligand in well&#8208;characterized 3d&#8208;transition metal catalysis. Specifically, [Cu(II)(OTf)  2  (pyb)  2  ]2(CH  3  CN) (  1  ) enables the synthesis of a wide range of propargylamines, via the A  3  coupling reaction, at room temperature, in the absence of additives. Experimental and high&#8208;level theoretical calculations suggest that the bridging N atom of the ligand imposes exclusive  trans  &#8208;coordination at Cu and allows ligand rotation, while the N atom of the pyridine group modulates charge distribution and flux, thus orchestrating structural and electronic pre&#8208;catalyst control permitting alkyne binding with simultaneous activation of the C&#8211;H bond via a transient Cu(I) species.</dc:description>

Six new SbBr3&#8208;Py crystalline complexes were obtained and structurally characterized. In all complexes Sb atoms display pseudo&#8208;octahedral coordination geometry where the coordination number of Sb center are increased to six due to pnictogen bonds. Non&#8208;covalence criterion NCC is proposed for the qualitative estimation of the bonding situation.







Abstract
Weakly or &#8220;partially&#8221; bonded molecules are an important link between the chemical and van der Waals interactions. Molecular structures of six new SbBr3&#8208;Py complexes in the solid state have been determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In all complexes all Sb atoms adopt a pseudo&#8208;octahedral coordination geometry which is completed by additional Sb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br contacts shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii, with Br&#8722;Sb&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br angles close to 180&#176;. To reveal the nature of Sb&#8211;Br and Sb&#8211;N interactions, the DFT calculations were performed followed by the analysis of the electrostatic potentials, the orbital interactions and the topological analysis. Based on Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis, the Sb&#8211;Br interactions range from the covalent bonds to the pnictogen bonds. A simple structural parameter, non&#8208;covalence criterion (NCC) is defined as a ratio of the atom&#8208;atom distance to the linear combination of sums of covalent and van der Waals radii. NCC correlates with E(2) values for Sb&#8722;N, Sb&#8722;Cl and Sb&#8722;Br bonds, and appears to be useful criterion for a preliminary evaluation of the bonding situation.

         <title>Noncovalent Intermolecular Interaction in Cofacially Stacked 24&#960; Antiaromatic Hexaphyrin Dimer</title>

Unprecedented phenomenon of dimerization via &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between two antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules was precisely examined through a wide selection of spectroscopic techniques, as well as theoretical calculations with controlling the interplanar distance.







Abstract
&#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking is omnipresent not only in nature but in a wide variety of practical fields applied to our lives. Because of its importance in a performance of natural and artificial systems, such as light harvesting system and working layer in device, many researchers have put intensive effort into identifying its underlying nature. However, for the case of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked systems composed of antiaromatic units, the understanding of the fundamental mechanisms is still unclear. Herein, we synthesized a new type of planar &#946;,&#946;&#8217;&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged hexaphyrin (1.0.1.0.1.0), referred as naphthorosarin which possesses the 24&#960;&#8208;electron conjugated pathway. Especially, the corresponding antiaromatic porphyrinoid shows the unique property to form dimeric species adopting the face&#8208;to&#8208;face geometry which is unprecedented in cases of known annulated naphthorosarins. In order to elucidate the intriguing properties derived from the stacked dimer, the current study focuses on the experimental support to rationalize the observed &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the two subunits.

         <title>Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Bromotryptophan Derivatives at Ambient Temperature</title>

Gentle conditions: Ligand&#8208;free solvent&#8208;stabilised Pd&#8208;nanoparticles serve as a highly efficient catalyst at ambient temperature for a sustainable and biocompatible Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling between aryl bromides and boronic acids under mild, aerobic and aqueous conditions.







Abstract
Mild reaction conditions are highly desirable for bio&#8208;orthogonal side chain derivatizations of amino acids, peptides or proteins due to the sensitivity of these substrates. Transition metal catalysed cross&#8208;couplings such as Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions are highly versatile, but usually require unfavourable reaction conditions, in particular, when applied with aryl bromides. Ligand&#8208;free solvent&#8208;stabilised Pd&#8208;nanoparticles represent an efficient and sustainable alternative to conventional phosphine&#8208;based catalysts, because the cross&#8208;coupling can be performed at considerably lower temperature. We report on the application of such a highly reactive heterogeneous catalyst for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of brominated tryptophan derivatives. The solvent&#8208;stabilised Pd&#8208;nanoparticles are even more efficient than the literature&#8208;known ADHP&#8208;Pd precatalyst. Interestingly, the latter also leads to the formation of quasi&#8208;homogeneous Pd&#8208;nanoparticles as the catalytic species. One advantage of our approach is the compatibility with aqueous and aerobic conditions at near&#8208;ambient temperatures and short reaction times of only 2&#8197;h. The influence of different N&#945;&#8208;protecting groups, boronic acids as well as the impact of different amino acid side chains in bromotryptophan&#8208;containing peptides has been studied. Notably, a surprising acceleration of the catalysis was observed when palladium&#8208;coordinating side chains were present in proximal positions.

         <title>Versatile Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Synthesis of Asymmetrical Phosphines and Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, Page 16374-16382, December 9, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Driven by light: A mild and facile photoredox approach towards asymmetrically substituted phosphines and phosphonium salts is reported. Blue&#8208;light irradiation of mono&#8208; and diphenylphosphine with various aryl and alkyl iodides, diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), and the organic photocatalyst 3DPAFIPN affords the desired products in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. In addition, the same method transforms white phosphorus (P4) directly into symmetrical aryl phosphines and phosphonium salts.







Abstract
Asymmetrically substituted tertiary phosphines and quaternary phosphonium salts are used extensively in applications throughout industry and academia. Despite their significance, classical methods to synthesize such compounds often demand either harsh reaction conditions, prefunctionalization of starting materials, highly sensitive organometallic reagents, or expensive transition&#8208;metal catalysts. Mild, practical methods thus remain elusive, despite being of great current interest. Herein, we describe a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven method to form these products from secondary and primary phosphines. Using an inexpensive organic photocatalyst and blue&#8208;light irradiation, arylphosphines can be both alkylated and arylated using commercially available organohalides. In addition, the same organocatalyst can be used to transform white phosphorus (P4) directly into symmetrical aryl phosphines and phosphonium salts in a single reaction step, which has previously only been possible using precious metal catalysis.

Bis&#8208;anthracene fused porphyrin is synthesized in a high yield by a facile protocol. When serving as a photocatalyst, the new molecule exhibits excellent catalytic performance for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced aerobic oxidation of amines to imines at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Development of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for the conversion of amines is of great importance, but has remained a challenging task. Here, a bis&#8208;anthracene fused porphyrin (AFP) was synthesized in a high yield by a facile synthetic protocol, which involves a Suzuki coupling for the conjugation of two anthracene groups with a porphyrin ring, followed by oxidative cyclodehydrogenation. When serving as a photocatalyst, AFP exhibits an outstanding photocatalytic performance for the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced aerobic oxidation of amines to imines at ambient conditions. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the low energy band gap, caused by the large planar and &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrin structure of AFP, contributed to its high photocatalytic performance.

Ligand design and application: The synthesis of electron&#8208;poor imidazolium substituted Cp&#8208;ylides is presented. Their electronic properties are elucidated based on NMR spectroscopy, DFT and reactivity studies. The first &#951;5&#8208;Cp coordination of electron&#8208;poor cationic ylides is confirmed by X&#8208;ray structure analyses and an equilibrium for the coordination of a Cp ligand is observed. Electrochemical investigations of the ligands and of the ruthenocenes quantify the decreasing donor properties with increasing number of imidazolium substituents.







Abstract
The synthesis of electron&#8208;poor mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri(imidazolium)&#8208;substituted Cp&#8208;ylides is presented and their electronic properties are discussed based on NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray structure analyses, electrochemical investigations and DFT calculations as well as by their reactivity toward [Ru(CH3CN)3Cp*](PF6). With mono&#8208; and di(imidazolium)&#8208;substituted cyclopentadienides the respective monocationic and dicationic ruthenocences are formed (X&#8208;ray), whereas tri(imidazolium) cyclopentadienides are too electron&#8208;poor to form the ruthenocenes. Cyclic voltammetric analysis of the ruthenocenes shows reversible oxidation at a potential that increases with every additional electron&#8208;withdrawing imidazolium substituent at the Cp ligand by 0.53&#8211;0.55&#8197;V in an electrolyte based on a weakly coordinating anion. A reversible oxidation can be observed for the free 1,3&#8208;disubstituted ligand as well.

Electrochemical investigations of the ligands and of the ruthenocenes quantify the decreasing donor properties with increasing number of imidazolium substituents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of electron&#8208;poor mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tri(imidazolium)&#8208;substituted Cp&#8208;ylides is presented and their electronic properties are discussed based on NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray structure analyses, electrochemical investigations and DFT calculations as well as by their reactivity toward [Ru(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cp*](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). With mono&#8208; and di(imidazolium)&#8208;substituted cyclopentadienides the respective monocationic and dicationic ruthenocences are formed (X&#8208;ray), whereas tri(imidazolium) cyclopentadienides are too electron&#8208;poor to form the ruthenocenes. Cyclic voltammetric analysis of the ruthenocenes shows reversible oxidation at a potential that increases with every additional electron&#8208;withdrawing imidazolium substituent at the Cp ligand by 0.53&#8211;0.55&#8197;V in an electrolyte based on a weakly coordinating anion. A reversible oxidation can be observed for the free 1,3&#8208;disubstituted ligand as well.&lt;/p&gt;

High&#8208;resolution study: A new synthetic approach is introduced for the complete isomeric family of dicarba&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecaboranes which serve as highly potent inhibitors of tumor&#8208;associated carbonic anhydrase IX.







Abstract
Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), a tumor&#8208;associated metalloenzyme, represents a validated target for cancer therapy and diagnostics. Herein, we report the inhibition properties of isomeric families of sulfonamidopropyl&#8208;dicarba&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecaboranes group(s) prepared using a new direct five&#8208;step synthesis from the corresponding parent cages. The protocol offers a reliable solution for synthesis of singly and doubly substituted dicarba&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecaboranes with a different geometric position of carbon atoms. The closo&#8208;compounds from the ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;series were then degraded to corresponding 11&#8208;vertex dicarba&#8208;nido&#8208;undecaborate(1&#8722;) anions. All compounds show in vitro enzymatic activity against CA IX in the low nanomolar or subnanomolar range. This is accompanied by clear isomer dependence of the inhibition constant (Ki) and selectivity towards CA IX. Decreasing trends in Ki and selectivity index (SI) values are observed with increasing separation of the cage carbon atoms. Interactions of compounds with the active sites of CA IX were explored with X&#8208;ray crystallography, and eight high&#8208;resolution crystal structures uncovered the structural basis of inhibition potency and selectivity.

In for a Schrock: The synthesis and characterization of five&#8208;membered cyclic Schrock&#8208;carbene&#8208;like bis&#8208;alkylidenes of titanium and zirconium are realized. These Schrock&#8208;carbene&#8208;like bis&#8208;alkylidenes show unique reactivity toward N,N&#8242;&#8208;diisopropylcarbodiimide, CO, cyclooctatetraene, and azobenzene.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal alkylidenes have exhibited wide applications in organometallic chemistry and synthetic organic chemistry, however, cyclic Schrock&#8208;carbene&#8208;like bis&#8208;alkylidenes of group 4 metals with a four&#8208;electron donor from an alkylidene have not been reported. Herein, the synthesis and characterization of five&#8208;membered cyclic bis&#8208;alkylidenes of titanium (4&#8201;a,b) and zirconium (5&#8201;a,b) are reported, as the first well&#8208;defined group 4 metallacyclopentatrienes, by two&#8208;electron reduction of their corresponding titana&#8208; and zirconacyclopentadienes. DFT analyses of 4&#8201;a show a four&#8208;electron donor (&#963;&#8208;donation and &#960;&#8208;donation) from an alkylidene carbon to the metal center. The reaction of 4&#8201;a with N,N&#8242;&#8208;diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) leads to the [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition product&#8197;6. Compound 4&#8201;a reacted with CO, affording the oxycyclopentadienyl titanium complex&#8197;7. These reactivities demonstrate the multiple metal&#8211;carbon bond character. The reactions of 4&#8201;a or 5&#8201;a with cyclooctatetraene (COT) or azobenzene afforded sandwich titanium complex&#8197;8 or diphenylhydrazine&#8208;coordinated zirconacyclopentadiene 9, respectively, which exhibit two&#8208;electron reductive ability.

         <title>A Molecular Capsule with Revolving Doors Partitioning Its Inner Space</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, Page 16480-16485, December 9, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly designed covalent capsule incorporates three revolving pyridine &#8220;doors&#8221; splitting its inner space into two chambers that may coalesce into one. The chambers accommodate up to two haloalkanes in the allosteric fashion therefore opening a way for studying the effect of host internal dynamics on reactivity, noncovalent interaction or trafficking of guests residing in such unique environment.







Abstract
Covalent capsule 1 was designed to include two molecular baskets linked with three mobile pyridines tucked into its inner space. On the basis of both theory (DFT) and experiments (NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography), we found that the pyridine &#8220;doors&#8221; split the chamber (380&#8197;&#197;3) of 1 so that two equally sizeable compartments (190&#8197;&#197;3) became joined through a conformationally flexible aromatic barrier. The compartments of such unique host could be populated with CCl4 (88&#8197;&#197;3; PC=46&#8201;%), CBr4 (106&#8197;&#197;3; 56&#8201;%) or their combination CCl4/CBr4 (PC=51&#8201;%), with thermodynamic stabilities &#916;G&#176; tracking the values of packing coefficients (PC). Halogen (C&#8722;X&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;) and hydrogen bonding (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X) contacts held the haloalkane guests in the cavities of 1. The consecutive complexations were found to occur in a negative allosteric manner, which we propose to result from the induced&#8208;fit mode of complexation. Newly designed 1 opens a way for probing the effects of inner conformational dynamics on noncovalent interactions, reactivity and intramolecular translation in confined spaces of hollow molecules.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Enabled C&#8722;H Functionalization by a Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer Uranyl Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, Page 16521-16529, December 9, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranyl photocatalysis: An efficient and convenient C&#8722;H activation strategy by a direct hydrogen atom transfer process for the synthesis of high&#8208;value&#8208;added diarylmethane derivatives from p&#8208;quinone methides has been developed by combining a uranyl photocatalyst with visible&#8208;light irradiation (see scheme). EPR experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the formation of UV&#8722;O&#8901; species by the reduction of UVI=O under visible light is responsible for the initial step of the photoinduced reaction.







Abstract
The development of the uranyl cation as a powerful photocatalyst is seriously delayed in comparison with the advances in its fundamental and structural chemistry. However, its characteristic high oxidative capability in the excited state ([UO2]2+* (+2.6&#8197;V vs. SHE; SHE=standard hydrogen electrode) combined with blue&#8208;light absorption (hv=380&#8211;500&#8197;nm) and a long&#8208;lived fluorescence lifetime up to microseconds have reveals that the uranyl cation approaches an ideal photocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organic transformations. Described herein is the successful use of uranyl nitrate as a photocatalyst to enable C(sp3)&#8722;H activation and C&#8722;C bond formation through hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) under blue&#8208;light irradiation. In particular, this operationally simple strategy provides an appropriate approach to the synthesis of diverse and valuable diarylmethane motifs. Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations have provided insights into the detailed mechanism of the photoinduced HAT pathway. This research suggests a general platform that could popularize promising uranyl photocatalytic performance.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uranyl photocatalysis&lt;/b&gt;: An efficient and convenient C&#8722;H activation strategy by a direct hydrogen atom transfer process for the synthesis of high&#8208;value&#8208;added diarylmethane derivatives from &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;quinone methides has been developed by combining a uranyl photocatalyst with visible&#8208;light irradiation (see scheme). EPR experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the formation of U&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sup&gt;

&lt;/sup&gt; species by the reduction of U&lt;sup&gt;VI&lt;/sup&gt;=O under visible light is responsible for the initial step of the photoinduced reaction.

Synthesis of mallotusinin: The total synthesis of mallotusinin via the second&#8208;generation synthesis of corilagin is described. The key steps are as follows: 1)&#8197;oxidative phenol coupling of 1,2,4&#8208;orthoacetyl&#8208;3,6&#8208;di&#8208;(4&#8208;O&#8208;benzylgalloyl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranose; 2)&#8197;orthoester cleavage along with thioglycosylation followed by &#946;&#8208;selective glycosyl esterification; and 3)&#8197;two&#8208;step bislactonization to construct a 2,4&#8208;O&#8208;tetrahydroxydibenzofuranoyl bridge on corilagin.







Abstract
The total synthesis of mallotusinin, which bears a tetrahydroxydibenzofuranoyl (THDBF) bridge between the 2&#8208;oxygen and 4&#8208;oxygen of glucose on corilagin with a 3,6&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208;hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) bridge, is described. The key features of the total synthesis are: 1)&#8197;improvements of our previously reported method to synthesize corilagin; 2)&#8197;establishment of the THDBF skeleton via an unusual intramolecular SNAr reaction of an HHDP analogue, and 3)&#8197;the application of a two&#8208;step bislactonization strategy for a HHDP bridge construction into the 2,4&#8208;O&#8208;THDBF bridge. Oxidative phenol coupling of 1,2,4&#8208;orthoacetyl&#8208;3,6&#8208;di&#8208;(4&#8208;O&#8208;benzylgalloyl)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranose and the orthoester cleavage of the coupling product without the pyranose&#8208;furanose ring transformation are key reactions for the improved synthesis of corilagin, which enabled the adequate supply of a corilagin precursor that was required to develop the mallotusinin synthesis. These established methods are expected to help develop the synthesis of other ellagitannins with a bridge between the two oxygens of corilagin.

         <title>Cationic FeII Triplex&#8208;Forming Metallohelices as DNA Bulge Binders</title>

Preferred binding partners: Cationic FeII triplex&#8208;forming metallohelices prefer binding to bulged DNA, rather than double&#8208;stranded DNA. Their binding affinities towards bulges strongly depend on the bulge size and the base composition of the bulge loop.







Abstract
Bulges are essential structural elements in nucleic acids. The detection and targeting of bulged DNA sequences are highly important. Small molecules capable of targeting DNA bulges have attracted considerable attention because they cannot only be used as reagents for bulge recognition, but also as potential therapeutic drugs. Herein, the interactions of DNA duplexes, containing bulges of various sizes and base compositions, with a series of FeII triplex&#8208;forming metallohelices are reported. The results obtained, with the aid of molecular biophysics methods, show that the investigated metallohelices prefer to bind to bulged DNA, rather than double&#8208;stranded DNA, and that their binding affinities towards bulges differ among individual metallohelices. Moreover, their binding affinities towards bulges strongly depend on the bulge size and the base composition of the bulge loop. The investigated metallohelices can enter eukaryotic cells and accumulate in the cell nucleus, allowing them to interact with nucleic acids. Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that the interaction of metallohelices with nucleic acid bulges might contribute to the mechanism of their biological activity.

Mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with navitoclax and the Mcl&#8208;1 inhibitor S63845, and capped with a MUC1&#8208;targeting aptamer are presented as effective nanodevices for navitoclax resistance overcoming targeted to triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell lines.







Abstract
Triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. In the last years, navitoclax has emerged as a possible treatment for TNBC. Nevertheless, rapid navitoclax resistance onset has been observed thorough Mcl&#8208;1 overexpression. As a strategy to overcome Mcl&#8208;1&#8208;mediated resistance, herein we present a controlled drug co&#8208;delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) targeted to TNBC cells. The nanocarrier is loaded with navitoclax and the Mcl&#8208;1 inhibitor S63845 and capped with a MUC1&#8208;targeting aptamer (apMUC1&#8208;MSNs(Nav/S63845)). The apMUC1&#8208;capped nanoparticles effectively target TNBC cell lines and successfully induce apoptosis, overcoming navitoclax resistance. Moreover, navitoclax encapsulation protects platelets against apoptosis. These results point apMUC1&#8208;gated MSNs as suitable BH3 mimetics nanocarriers in the targeted treatment of MUC1&#8208;expressing TNBC.

         <title>A Barrel&#8208;Shaped Metal&#8211;Organic Blue&#8208;Box Analogue with Photo&#8208;/Redox&#8208;Switchable Behavior</title>

Lock, stock, and blue&#8208;box&#8208;like barrel: A unique self&#8208;assembled metal&#8211;organic nanobarrel is achieved by using electron&#8208;deficient viologen&#8208;based linkers and lanthanide ions. The resulting capsule encloses chloride anions and exhibits photo&#8208;/redox&#8208;responsive behavior, enabled by nearby electron donors.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor interactions are ubiquitous in the design and understanding of host&#8211;guest complexes. Despite their non&#8208;covalent nature, they can readily dictate the self&#8208;assembly of complex architectures. Here, a photo&#8208;/redox&#8208;switchable metal&#8211;organic nanocapsule is presented, which was assembled by using lanthanide ions and viologen building blocks, by relying on such donor&#8211;acceptor interactions. The potential of this unique barrel&#8208;shaped structure is highlighted for the encapsulation of suitable electron donors, akin to the well&#8208;investigated &#8220;blue&#8208;box&#8221; macrocycles. The light&#8208;triggered reduction of the viologen units has been investigated by single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, complemented by magnetic, optical, and solid&#8208;state electrochemical characterizations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to suggest the most likely electron donor in the light&#8208;triggered reduction of the viologen&#8208;based ligand.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lock, stock, and blue&#8208;box&#8208;like barrel&lt;/b&gt;: A unique self&#8208;assembled metal&#8211;organic nanobarrel is achieved by using electron&#8208;deficient viologen&#8208;based linkers and lanthanide ions. The resulting capsule encloses chloride anions and exhibits photo&#8208;/redox&#8208;responsive behavior, enabled by nearby electron donors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donor&#8211;acceptor interactions are ubiquitous in the design and understanding of host&#8211;guest complexes. Despite their non&#8208;covalent nature, they can readily dictate the self&#8208;assembly of complex architectures. Here, a photo&#8208;/redox&#8208;switchable metal&#8211;organic nanocapsule is presented, which was assembled by using lanthanide ions and viologen building blocks, by relying on such donor&#8211;acceptor interactions. The potential of this unique barrel&#8208;shaped structure is highlighted for the encapsulation of suitable electron donors, akin to the well&#8208;investigated &#8220;blue&#8208;box&#8221; macrocycles. The light&#8208;triggered reduction of the viologen units has been investigated by single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments, complemented by magnetic, optical, and solid&#8208;state electrochemical characterizations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to suggest the most likely electron donor in the light&#8208;triggered reduction of the viologen&#8208;based ligand.&lt;/p&gt;

Bipolar host: A high efficiency and long lifetime of blue TADF&#8208;OLEDs is achieved by synthesizing pCzBzbCz and pCzPybCz host materials. The pCzPybCz&#8208;based devices exhibit a high EQE of 22.7&#8201;% and an operational lifetime of 24&#8197;h (LT90) at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
In this study, two host materials, pCzBzbCz and pCzPybCz, are synthesized to achieve a high efficiency and long lifetime of blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (TADF&#8208;OLEDs). The molecular design strategy involves the introduction of a pyridine group into the core structure of pCzPybCz as an electron&#8208;withdrawing unit, and an electron&#8208;donating phenyl group into the structure of pCzBzbCz. These host materials demonstrate good thermal stability and high triplet energy (T1=3.07&#8197;eV for pCzBzbCz and 3.06&#8197;eV for pCzPybCz) for the fabrication of blue TADF&#8208;OLEDs. In particular, pCzPybCz&#8208;based OLED devices demonstrate an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.7&#8201;% and an operational lifetime of 24&#8197;h (LT90, time to attain 90&#8201;% of initial luminance) at an initial luminance of 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This superior lifetime could be explained by the C&#8722;N bond dissociation energy (BDE) in the host molecular structure. Furthermore, a mixed&#8208;host system using the electron&#8208;deficient 2,4&#8208;bis(dibenzo[b,d]furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (DDBFT) is proposed to inhibit the formation of the anion state of our host materials. In short, the device operational lifetime is further improved by applying DDBFT. The carbazole&#8208;based asymmetric host molecule containing a pyridine core realizes a high&#8208;efficiency blue TADF&#8208;OLED showing a positive effect on the operating lifetime, and can provide useful strategies for designing new host materials.

Supercapacitive nanoarchitectures: A rationally designed 3D hierarchical carbon cloth/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanowires/Ni@MnO2 (CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO2) nanocomposite was prepared by electrodeposition and used as a supercapacitor cathode exhibiting high surface area, outstanding electrical conductivity, and excellent performance in supercapacitors.







Abstract
A 3D hierarchical carbon cloth/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanowires/Ni@MnO2 (CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO2) nanocomposite electrode was rationally designed and prepared by electrodeposition. The N&#8208;CNWs derived from polypyrrole (PPy) nanowires on the carbon cloth have an open framework structure, which greatly increases the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte and provides short diffusion paths. The incorporation of the Ni layer between the N&#8208;CNWs and MnO2 is beneficial for significantly enhancing the electrical conductivity and boosting fast charge transfer as well as improving the charge&#8208;collection capacity. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared 3D hierarchical CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO2 electrode exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 571.4&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 compared with those of CC/N&#8208;CNWs@MnO2 (311&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1), CC/Ni@MnO2 (196.6&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1), and CC@MnO2 (186.1&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1) at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and remarkable rate capability (367.5&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, asymmetric supercapacitors constructed with CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO2 as cathode material and activated carbon as anode material deliver an impressive energy density of 36.4&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 900&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and a good cycling life (72.8&#8201;% capacitance retention after 3500 cycles). This study paves a low&#8208;cost and simple way to design a hierarchical nanocomposite electrode with large surface area and superior electrical conductivity, which has wide application prospects in high&#8208;performance supercapacitors.

Round 1! Fluorophores bearing carborane clusters often display remarkably different cell incomes, with recurrent higher permeabilities for meta&#8208;carboranes compared to the ortho isomers. Here, we study a set of BODIPY&#8208;carborane dyads to provide an explanation for these differences, which originate from important variations in their partition coefficients and static dipole moments.







Abstract
A set of BODIPY&#8208;carboranyl dyads synthesized by a Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction, where different C&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;carboranyl fragments have been linked to a BODIPY fluorophore is described. Chemical, photophysical and physicochemical analyses are presented, including NMR and single XRD experiments, optical absorption/emission studies and partition coefficient (log&#8201;P) measurements. These studies, supported by DFT computations (M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;31G**), provide an explanation to the largely divergent cell income that these fluorescent carboranyl&#8208;based fluorophores display, for which a structural or physicochemical explanation remains elusive. By studying the cell uptake efficiency and subcellular localization for our set of dyads on living HeLa cells, we tracked the origins of these differences to significant variations in their static dipole moments and partition coefficients, which tune their ability to interact with lipophilic microenvironments in cells. Remarkably, m&#8208;carboranyl&#8208;BODIPY derivatives with a higher lipophilicity are much better internalised by cells than their homologous with o&#8208;carborane, suggesting that m&#8208;isomers are potentially better theranostic agents for in vitro bioimaging and boron carriers for boron neutron capture therapy.

On the TAB: The effect of incorporating electron&#8208;deficient triarylboron (TAB) units on the optical properties of anils and boranils was rationalized for a series of TAB&#8208;coupled anils and boranils. The nature of the spacer and the position of the TAB affect the properties of these compounds. All the compounds are emissive in the solid state and boranils exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanofluorochromism and low&#8208;temperature phosphorescence.







Abstract
Herein, the design, synthesis, optical properties, and mechanofluorochromism characteristics of a series of conjugates having covalently linked triarylborane (TAB) and anil/boranil units (TAB&#8208;anil: 1&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;a and TAB&#8208;boranil: 1&#8211;3) are reported. The electronic interactions between TAB and anil/boranil in 1&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;a and 1&#8211;3 were fine&#8208;tuned by changing the boryl moiety's position on the phenyl spacer connecting the BMes2 (Mes=mesityl) and anil/boranil units. A boryl moiety at the meta position (1&#8201;a) of the phenyl spacer stabilizes the enolic form (E&#8208;OH), whereas a boryl moiety at the para position (2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a) stabilizes the keto form (Z&#8208;NH) in the solid state. However, in solution 1&#8201;a, 2&#8201;a, and 3&#8201;a exhibit keto&#8211;enol tautomerism in both ground and excited states. Compounds&#8197;1&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;a and 1&#8211;3 show red&#8208;shifted absorption compared with 4&#8201;a and 4, which are devoid of TAB moieties, which indicate effective participation of an empty p orbital on the boron center in 1&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;a and 1&#8211;3. Compounds&#8197;1 and 2 showed fluorescence variations in response to external stimuli such as mechanical grinding. Long phosphorescence lifetimes of 18&#8211;46&#8197;ms were observed for compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3. The observed optical properties of 1&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;a and 1&#8211;3 are rationalized in the context of quantum mechanical calculations.

Make to measure: A series of ZIF&#8208;8 has been synthesized and carbonized to prepare porous carbons for use in supercapacitors. An optimal particle size of ZIF&#8208;8 for the best capacitive performance was obtained. This can serve as a relative normative reference to guide ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based supercapacitors to achieve superior performance in the future.







Abstract
Carbon materials derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) and composites thereof have been intensively investigated in supercapacitors. The particle size of the used ZIF&#8208;8 ranges from dozens of nanometers to several microns. However, the influence of the particle size of ZIF&#8208;8 on the capacitive performances is still not clear. A series of ZIF&#8208;8 with different particle sizes (from 25 to 296&#8197;nm) has been synthesized and carbonized for supercapacitors. Based on TEM, EDX mapping, XRD, Raman, nitrogen adsorption&#8211;desorption, XPS, and the results of electrochemical tests, the optimal particle size (&#8776;70&#8197;nm) for superior supercapacitor performances in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes has been obtained. This important result provides a significant reference to guide future ZIF&#8208;8 related research to achieve the best electrochemical performance.

There's a good PECT! Redox&#8208;active guanidines are used in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions that involve C&#8722;H bond cleavage. The study reveals the scope and the mechanism of PCET reactions with and without addition of a strong acid. Substrates with potentials of up to 1.2&#8197;V versus ferrocenium/ferrocene could be oxidized in stepwise PCET processes initiated by electron transfer. Experiments with guanidine derivatives show the possibility of tuning the PCET reactivity.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is currently intensively studied because of its importance in synthetic chemistry and biology. In recent years it was shown that redox&#8208;active guanidines are capable PCET reagents for the selective oxidation of organic molecules. In this work, the scope of their PCET reactivity regarding reactions that involve C&#8722;H activation is explored and kinetic studies carried out to disclose the reaction mechanisms. Organic molecules with potential up to 1.2&#8197;V vs. ferrocenium/ferrocene are efficiently oxidized. Reactions are initiated by electron transfer, followed by slow proton transfer from an electron&#8208;transfer equilibrium.

The Zn porphyrin and Re complex dyad acted as a good photocatalyst in photocatalytic CO2 reduction using both triethylamine and 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) as an electron donor. The central Zn ion of the porphyrin played an important role in high durability. The effect of acids on the photocatalytic CO2 reduction was investigated with BIH, showing proper weak Br&#248;nsted acids enhanced the CO2 reduction.







Abstract
We have prepared Zn and free&#8208;base porphyrins appended with a fac&#8208;Re(phen)(CO)3Br (where phen is 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) at the meso position of the porphyrin, and performed photocatalytic CO2 reduction using porphyrin&#8211;Re dyads in the presence of either triethylamine (TEA) or 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) as an electron donor. The Zn porphyrin dyad showed a high turnover number for CO production compared with the free&#8208;base porphyrin dyad, suggesting that the central Zn ion of porphyrin plays an important role in suppressing electron accumulation on the porphyrin part and achieving high durability of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction using both TEA and BIH. The effect of acids on the CO2 reduction was investigated using the Zn porphyrin&#8211;Re dyad and BIH. Acetic acid, a relatively strong Br&#248;nsted acid, rapidly causes the porphyrin's color to fade upon irradiation and dramatically decreases CO production, whereas proper weak Br&#248;nsted acids such as 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol and phenol enhance the CO2 reduction.

Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated push&#8211;pull molecules based on triphenylamine and 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) have been functionalized with different terminal arene units. In solution, these highly TCBD&#8208;twisted systems showed a strong internal charge transfer band in the visible spectrum and no detectable photoluminescence (PL). Photophysical and theoretical investigations revealed very short singlet excited state deactivation time of &#8776;10&#8197;ps resulting from significant conformational changes of the TCBD&#8208;arene moiety upon photoexcitation, opening a pathway for non&#8208;radiative decay. The PL was recovered in vacuum&#8208;processed films or when the molecules were dispersed in a PMMA matrix leading to a significant increase of the excited state deactivation time. As shown by cyclic voltammetry, these molecules can act as electron donors compared to C60. Hence, vacuum&#8208;processed planar heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated leading to a maximum power conversion efficiency of ca. 1.9&#8201;% which decreases with the increase of the arene size.

         <title>Pitch&#8208;Based Laminated Carbon Formed by Pressure Driving at Low Temperature as High&#8208;Capacity Anodes for Lithium Energy Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, Page 16514-16520, December 9, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the pitch: Pitch&#8208;based laminated carbon materials have been prepared at low temperature with the additional help of pressure. The prepared carbon materials can act as the anode in lithium&#8208;ion batteries and the lithium storage mechanism has been elaborated. A high stable capacity of approximately 550&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 is obtained. Meanwhile, the lithium&#8208;ion capacitor based on the prepared carbon material has been assembled and it also exhibits a high performance.







Abstract
Pitch has been used to prepare electrodes by high&#8208;temperature heat treatments for supercapacitors, lithium&#8208;ion batteries, on account of its rich aromatic ring structure. Here, the toluene&#8208;soluble component of pitch is used to prepare a kind of laminated carbon. This was realized by a template&#8208;free synthesis at low temperature with the addition of pressure. The toluene&#8208;soluble component has a small molecular weight, which makes the thermal deformation ability stronger and then enhances the orientation of the carbon layer with the help of pressure. The prepared anode exhibits a splendid electrochemical performance compared with the traditional graphite anode. A high stable capacity of approximately 550&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is much higher than graphite (372&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), is obtained. Also, when the current density is up to 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the capacity is about 150&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Surprisingly, it also delivers a superior cycling performance. And when used as the anode/cathode electrode for lithium&#8208;ion capacitors, a high energy density can be obtained. The present work offers an opportunity to utilize the pitch source in lithium energy storage with promising cycle life, high energy/power density, and low cost.

         <title>Selective Hydrolysis of Terminal Glycosidic Bond in &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;Acid Glycoprotein Promoted by Keggin and Wells&#8211;Dawson Type Heteropolyacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, Page 16463-16471, December 9, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of Keggin and Wells&#8211;Dawson type heteropolyacids have been shown to selectively hydrolyze terminal glycosidic bond in heavily glycosylated &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;acid glycoprotein, resulting in the removal of sialic acids with no observed destruction of the protein core or the residual glycan chains.







Abstract
The reactivity of a range of Keggin and Wells&#8211;Dawson type heteropolyacids (HPAs): H3PW12O40 H4SiW12O40, H3PMo12O40, K6P2W18O62, and NaH2W12O4, towards the heavily glycosylated &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;acid glycoprotein (AGP) is reported. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS&#8208;PAGE) and high&#8208;performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC&#8208;PAD) show that after incubation of the protein with HPAs at 80&#8201;&#176;C and pH&#8197;2.8 complete hydrolysis of terminal glycosidic bond has been achieved, resulting in the removal of sialic acids with no observed destruction of the protein core or the residual glycan chains. The 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy confirmed that the released sialic acids preserve intact structure upon their excision from the protein, which makes the reported method suitable for the analysis of sialic acid modifications which play an important role in numerous biological processes. The presence of other sugars was not detected by 1H&#8197;NMR and HPAEC&#8208;PAD, suggesting that HPAs hydrolyze only the terminal glycosidic bond in the glycoprotein, resulting in the selective release of sialic acid from AGP. The kinetic results have shown that under equal temperature and pH conditions, the hydrolysis of the terminal glucosidic bond occurred faster in the presence of HPAs compared to conventional mineral acids. The observed rate constants were in the range 6,7&#215;10&#8722;2 &#8722;11,9&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;min&#8722;1 and the complete and selective excision of sialic acids could be achieved within 60&#8197;min of incubation. The Trp fluorescence and CD spectroscopy show that non&#8208;covalent interaction between HPA and protein takes place in solution which could lead to stabilization of the sialosyl cation that is formed during the glycosidic bond hydrolysis by anionic HPA cluster.

C&#8722;H hydroxylation of aryl acetamides and alkyl phenylacetyl esters is achieved via a challenging distal weak O&#8208;coordination by a ruthenium(II/IV) catalyst.

Abstract
C&#8722;H hydroxylation of aryl acetamides and alkyl phenylacetyl esters was accomplished via challenging distal weak O&#8208;coordination by versatile ruthenium(II/IV) catalysis. The ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxygenation of aryl acetamides proceeded through C&#8722;H activation, ruthenium(II/IV) oxidation and reductive elimination, thus providing step&#8208;economical access to valuable phenols. The p&#8208;cymene&#8208;ruthenium(II/IV) manifold was established by detailed experimental and DFT&#8208;computational studies.

&lt;p&gt;C&#8722;H hydroxylation of aryl acetamides and alkyl phenylacetyl esters was accomplished &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; challenging distal weak &lt;i&gt;O&#8208;&lt;/i&gt;coordination by versatile ruthenium(II/IV) catalysis. The ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H oxygenation of aryl acetamides proceeded through C&#8722;H activation, ruthenium(II/IV) oxidation and reductive elimination, thus providing step&#8208;economical access to valuable phenols. The &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;cymene&#8208;ruthenium(II/IV) manifold was established by detailed experimental and DFT&#8208;computational studies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Naphthoquinone&#8211;Dopamine Hybrids Inhibit &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation, Disrupt Preformed Fibrils, and Attenuate Aggregate&#8208;Induced Toxicity</title>

Break fibrils apart: Naphthoquinone&#8211;dopamine hybrid molecules (NQDA and Cl&#8208;NQDA) inhibit the aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and disaggregate its preformed fibrils into non&#8208;toxic species. NQDA was found to cross a human blood&#8211;brain barrier model efficiently. These hybrid molecules can be an attractive scaffold for therapeutic design towards Parkinson's disease.







Abstract
Accumulation and aggregation of the intrinsically disordered protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) into amyloid fibrils are hallmarks of a series of heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders, known as synucleinopathies and most notably Parkinson's disease (PD). The crucial role of &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation in PD makes it an attractive target for the development of disease&#8208;modifying therapeutics that would inhibit &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation or disrupt its preformed fibrillar assemblies. To this end, we have designed and synthesized two naphthoquinone&#8211;dopamine&#8208;based hybrid small molecules, NQDA and Cl&#8208;NQDA, and demonstrated their ability to inhibit in vitro amyloid formation by &#945;&#8208;Syn using ThT assay, CD, TEM, and Congo red birefringence. Moreover, these hybrid molecules efficiently disassembled preformed fibrils of &#945;&#8208;Syn into nontoxic species, as evident from LUV leakage assay. NQDA and Cl&#8208;NQDA were found to have low cytotoxicity and they attenuated the toxicity induced by &#945;&#8208;Syn towards SH&#8208;SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. NQDA was found to efficiently cross an in vitro human blood&#8211;brain barrier model. These naphthoquinone&#8211;dopamine based derivatives can be an attractive scaffold for therapeutic design towards PD.

Multimodal imaging: Different PESIN&#8208;homodimers, suited for positron emission tomography and optical imaging, were synthesized. Special focus was set on the influence of different dyes on biomedical&#8208;related properties.







Abstract
We describe multimodal imaging probes for gastrin&#8208;releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)&#8208;specific targeting suited for positron emission tomography and optical imaging (PET/OI), consisting of PESIN (PEG3&#8208;BBN7&#8208;14) dimers connected to multimodal imaging subunits. These multimodal agents comprise a fluorescent dye for OI and the chelator ((1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;4,7&#8208;diyl)diacetic acid&#8208;1&#8208;glutaric acid) (NODA&#8208;GA) for PET radiometal isotope labelling. Special focus was put on the influence of the used dyes on the properties of the whole bioconjugates. For this, several compounds with different fluorescent dyes and non&#8208;dye carrying subunits were synthesized and investigated. As fluorescent dyes, dansyl, NBD, derivatives of fluorescein, coumarin and rhodamine as well as three pyrilium&#8208;based dyes were employed. Considerable influence of the charge of the colored unit on hydrophilicity as well as in vitro target receptor binding was observed and classified. High radiochemical yields and purities were found during radiolabeling of the multimodal imaging subunits as well as their GRPR&#8208;specific bioconjugates with 68Ga. Examinations of the photophysical properties of both molecule species displayed no loss or alteration of fluorescence characteristics.

         <title>Chiral Chalcogenyl&#8208;Substituted Naphthyl&#8208; and Acenaphthyl&#8208;Silanes and Their Cations</title>

The Corey reaction of acenaphthyl&#8208; and naphthyl&#8208;based chiral silanes allows the synthesis of silylchalconium ions with control of the stereochemistry at the chalcogen atom (shown here for the sulfonium ion). The chalcogen neighboring group effect on the silyl cation is sufficiently strong to conserve the stereochemistry in a consecutive nucleophilic attack.







Abstract
Cyclic silylated chalconium borates 13[B(C6F5)4] and 14[B(C6F5)4] with peri&#8208;acenaphthyl and peri&#8208;naphthyl skeletons were synthesized from unsymmetrically substituted silanes 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10 using the standard Corey protocol (Chalcogen Ch=O, S, Se, Te). The configuration at the chalcogen atom is trigonal pyramidal for Ch=S, Se, Te, leading to the formation of cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers in the case of phenylmethylsilyl cations. With the bulkier tert&#8208;butyl group at silicon, the configuration at the chalcogen atoms is predetermined to give almost exclusively the trans&#8208;configurated cyclic silylchalconium ions. The barriers for the inversion of the configuration at the sulfur atoms of sulfonium ions 13&#8201;c and 14&#8201;a are substantial (72&#8211;74&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) as shown by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. The neighboring group effect of the thiophenyl substituent is sufficiently strong to preserve chiral information at the silicon atom at low temperatures.

         <title>New Supercage Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Based on Allopurinol Ligands Showing Acetylene Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, Page 16402-16407, December 9, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare adsorptive material based on three types of MOF cages was successfully constructed through the medicinal molecule allopurinol and a dicarboxylate linker, displaying selective adsorption for C2H2 over CO2 and C2H2 over CH4. The multiple binding sites in the frameworks for guest molecules were also confirmed by simulations.







Abstract
To develop efficient adsorbent materials for storage and separation of C2H2, an unprecedented supercage MOF, [Me2NH2]&#8901;[Zn3(ALP)(TDC)2.5]&#8901;3.5DMF&#8901;2&#8201;H2O (1) was constructed through medicinal molecule allopurinol (ALP) and S&#8208;containing 2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxylic acid (H2TDC). 1 contains a novel linear trinuclear cluster that is composed by ALP and carboxylates and forms a final uncommon 5&#8208;connected yfy topological framework. The framework possesses three types of interlinked cages decorated by rich functional sites, and reveals not only high adsorption capacity for C2H2 but also excellent selective separation for C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 at 298&#8197;K. Dynamic breakthrough experiments on C2H2/CO2 (1:1) mixture and C2H2/CH4 (1:1) mixture also demonstrated the potential of the material to separate C2H2 from CO2 or CH4 mixtures. Molecular simulations were also studied to identify the different CO2&#8208; and C2H2&#8208; binding sites in 1, such as carboxylate groups, S atoms and carbonyl groups.

&lt;p&gt;To develop efficient adsorbent materials for storage and separation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, an unprecedented supercage MOF, [Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;[Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(ALP)(TDC)&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8901;3.5DMF&#8901;2&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) was constructed through medicinal molecule allopurinol (ALP) and S&#8208;containing 2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxylic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TDC). &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; contains a novel linear trinuclear cluster that is composed by ALP and carboxylates and forms a final uncommon 5&#8208;connected &lt;b&gt;yfy&lt;/b&gt; topological framework. The framework possesses three types of interlinked cages decorated by rich functional sites, and reveals not only high adsorption capacity for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but also excellent selective separation for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at 298&#8197;K. Dynamic breakthrough experiments on C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1:1) mixture and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (1:1) mixture also demonstrated the potential of the material to separate C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures. Molecular simulations were also studied to identify the different CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208; binding sites in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, such as carboxylate groups, S atoms and carbonyl groups.&lt;/p&gt;

Guanine crystals are widely found in a variety of organisms for achieving diverse optical effects, including the silvery reflection from the tropical fish shown in the background. This work reports a synthetic method to fabricate guanine microplatelets with facile control in morphological and crystallographic characteristics. These bio&#8208;inspired guanine crystals exhibit (100) exposing planes in &#946;&#8208;phase, similar to biological guanine crystals, which results in pearly lusters due to their high reflectivity when dispersed in water. More information can be found in the Communication by L. Li, L. Qi, Y. Ma, et&#8197;al. on page 16228.

         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;poor cyclopentadienide ligands based on neutral, cationic and dicationic imidazolium Cp ylides were prepared. The donating properties of these colorful compounds were analyzed by their oxidation potentials as well as that of their respective ruthenocene complexes. Each substitution by an imidazolium moiety increases the oxidation potential of about 500&#8197;mV. In addition, fixing the imidazolium moieties in the Cp plane by annellation also induces a withdrawing effect. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D. Kunz et&#8197;al. on page 16291.

Pyridinium boronic acid&#8208;attached polythiophene derivatives (depicted as grape leaves in the cover image) as chemosensors for the comprehensive taste evaluation of wine are reported in this work. The fluorescence chemosensor array (barrels in the cover image) exhibited turn&#8208;off responses to the major types of taste components of wine. Furthermore, quantitative analysis for the wine components was successfully carried out in a real red wine. This study proposes a unique &#8220;chemosommelier&#8221; system for the accurate prediction of taste. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Minami et&#8197;al. on page 16236.

Alloy nanoclusters (NCs) have become a hot topic in the study of metal NCs and the number of publications on alloy NCs has increased explosively in recent years. Such publications have provided much insight into the effects of alloying on the electronic structure and function of alloy NCs. Here, the obtained knowledge for Aun&#8722;xMx(SR)m, Agn&#8722;xMx(SR)m, Aun&#8722;xMx(PR3)l(SR)m, and Agn&#8722;xMx(PR3)l(SR)m (Au=gold, Ag=silver, M=heteroatom, PR3=phosphine, and SR=thiolate) NCs is summarized. For more details see the Review by Y. Negishi et&#8197;al. on page 16150.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, December 9, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic properties of conjugated polymers are strongly affected by the conformation of the polymer backbone. A rigid coplanar conformation could significantly improve the intrachain and interchain charge transport. Three types of conjugated polymers with rigid coplanar conformations are introduced. Complete conformation control strategies of conjugated polymers are summarized in this Minireview by J. Pei et al. on page 16194.

         <title>Frontispiece: Insights into the Mechanism of Gold(I) Oxidation with Aryldiazonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, December 9, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryldiazonium salts have emerged as efficient electrophiles for the oxidative addition of gold. In this minireview we enclose the mechanistic evidences gained so far by different authors concerning the mechanism. It is of common acceptance that aryladicals are crucial intermediates in these processes. Interestingly, it has been manifested that there are various successful ways to activate aryldiazonium salts for the generation of the desired arylgold(III) species. Generally speaking, these methods can be encompassed in: photoredox activation, photo activation and chemical activation. For more information see the Minireview by I. Medina&#8208;Mercado and S. Porcel on page 16206. The frontispiece graphic was designed by Hortensia Segura Silva.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, December 9, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive photolabile protecting groups based on low&#8208;molecular weight COUPY fluorophores, which expand the current photochemical toolbox, is described. Besides being efficiently photoactivated with yellow and red light under physiological&#8208;like conditions, COUPY photocages exhibit excellent cellular uptake and accumulate selectively in mitochondria, opening the door to the delivery of caged analogues of biologically active compounds into these organelles. For more details see the Communication by V. March&#225;n et&#8197;al. on page 16222.

Under control: Conformation control strategies from the molecular level for conjugated polymers in the past several decades are summarized, with a focus on their influence on device performance and challenges in synthesis, characterization and subsequent processing.







Abstract
In the past few decades, conjugated polymers have aroused extensive interest in organic electronic applications. The electrical performance of conjugated polymers has a close relationship with their backbone conformation. The conformation of the polymer backbone strongly affects the &#960;electron delocalization along polymer chains, the energy band gap, interchain interactions, and further affects charge transport properties. To realize a rigid coplanar backbone that usually possesses efficient intrachain charge transport properties and enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stackings, such conformation control becomes a useful strategy to achieve high&#8208;performance (semi)conducting polymers. This minireview summarizes the most important polymer structures through conformation control at the molecular level, and then divides these rigid coplanar conjugated polymers into three categories: 1)&#8197;noncovalent interactions locked conjugated polymers; 2)&#8197;double&#8208;bond linked conjugated polymers; 3)&#8197;ladder conjugated polymers. The effect of the conformation control on physical nature, optoelectronic properties, and their device performance is also discussed, as well as the challenges of chemical synthesis and structural characterization.

         <title>Insights into the Mechanism of Gold(I) Oxidation with Aryldiazonium Salts</title>

A dose of salt: Aryldiazonium salts are able to oxidize gold(I) in combination with a photocatalyst and light irradiation or simply by irradiation, heating, or the addition of certain bases and/or nucleophiles. The specific steps underlying the oxidation depend upon the activation mode of the aryldiazonium salt.







Abstract
In the last decade, aryldiazonium salts have attracted interest as coupling partners in cross&#8208;coupling reactions mediated by gold. Initially, the presence of a photocatalyst and a light source was needed to achieve gold oxidation with these electrophiles. However, recently, it has been shown that in some instances just heating, light irradiation, or the addition of certain bases and/or nucleophiles is enough. In this review, the transformations developed so far using aryldiazonium salts as electrophiles are summarized with special emphasis on mechanistic studies. The information gained by different authors, indicates that the specific steps of gold oxidation with aryldiazonium salts depends upon the activation mode of the diazonium salt.

Various electronic and geometrical structures and functions can be obtained by alloying metal nanoclusters (NCs). This review summarizes the chemical composition, geometrical structure, electronic structure, and physical and chemical properties of alloy NCs reported to date. This summary will help researchers to understand the characteristics of alloy NCs, which should lead to design guidelines to develop alloy NCs with intended functions.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (NCs) have a particle size of about one nanometer, which makes them the smallest unit that can give a function to a substance. In addition, metal NCs possess physical and chemical properties that are different from those of the corresponding bulk metals. Metal NCs with such characteristics are expected to be important for use in nanotechnology. Research on the precise synthesis of metal NCs and elucidation of their physical/chemical properties and functions is being actively conducted. When metal NCs are alloyed, it is possible to obtain further various electronic and geometrical structures and functions. Thus, research on alloy NCs has become a hot topic in the study of metal NCs and the number of publications on alloy NCs has increased explosively in recent years. Such publications have provided much insight into the effects of alloying on the electronic structure and function of metal NCs. However, the rapid increase in knowledge has made it difficult for researchers (especially those new to the field) to grasp all of it. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the reported chemical composition, geometrical structure, electronic structure, and physical and chemical properties of Aun&#8722;xMx(SR)m, Agn&#8722;xMx(SR)m, Aun&#8722;xMx(PR3)l(SR)m, and Agn&#8722;xMx(PR3)l(SR)m (Au=gold, Ag=silver, M=heteroatom, PR3=phosphine, and SR=thiolate) NCs. This review is expected to help researchers understand the characteristics of alloy NCs and lead to clear design guidelines to develop new alloy NCs with intended functions.

Therefore, in this review, we summarize the reported chemical composition, geometrical structure, electronic structure, and physical and chemical properties of Au&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, Ag&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, Au&lt;sub&gt;

&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(SR)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ag&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>Supramolecular Sensor for Astringent Procyanidin C1: Fluorescent Artificial Tongue for Wine Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, Page 16236-16240, December 9, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent polythiophene derivatives for comprehensive taste evaluation of wine are reported. In particular, the first detection of astringent procyanidin C1 by chemosensors has been achieved at a practical concentration range in real wine. Furthermore, the regression analysis for the astringent was successfully carried out in real red wine. Our strategy leads to &#8220;the chemosommelier&#8221; for the accurate prediction of taste.







Abstract
An artificial tongue that detects astringent components for a comprehensive evaluation of taste has not been established to date. Herein, we first propose fluorescent polythiophene (PT) derivatives (S1&#8211;S3) modified with 3&#8208;pyridinium boronic acid as supramolecular chemosensors for wine components including astringent procyanidin C1. After numerous attempts for the synthetic conditions, more than 95&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the PT unit was modified with the pyridinium boronic acid moiety. To evaluate the PT derivatives as chemosensors of the artificial tongue, qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed with four types of wine components (i.e., sweet, sour, bitter, and astringent tastes) in combination with pattern recognition models. Notably, procyanidin C1 in the actual wine sample was successfully detected in a quantitative manner. In other words, we have established an authentic artificial tongue using PT based supramolecular chemosensors.

         <title>NHCs as Neutral Donors towards Polyphosphorus Complexes</title>

Access to polyphosphorus complexes: A dynamic behavior between [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] and NHCs in solution is reported. NMR investigations showed a bond formation and bond breaking process between [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] and the NHCs. Despite this dynamic behavior in solution, adducts of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] and NHCs can be isolated as solids. The tantalum complex [Cp&#8242;&#8242;Ta(CO)2(&#951;4&#8208;P4)] reacts with the NHC via a phosphorus atom abstraction and a ring contraction to a novel anionic cyclo&#8208;P3 complex.







Abstract
The first adducts of NHCs (=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes) with aromatic polyphosphorus complexes are reported. The reactions of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (1) (Cp*=pentamethyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) with IMe (=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), IMes (=1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and IDipp (=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) led to the corresponding neutral adducts which can be isolated in the solid state. However, in solution, they quickly undergo a dissociative equilibrium between the adduct and 1 including the corresponding NHC. The equilibrium is influenced by the bulkiness of the NHC. [Cp&#8242;&#8242;Ta(CO)2(&#951;4&#8208;P4)] (Cp&#8242;&#8242;=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcyclopentadienyl) reacts with IMe under P atom abstraction to give an unprecedented cyclo&#8208;P3&#8208;containing anionic tantalum complex. DFT calculations shed light onto the energetics of the reaction pathways.

         <title>Synthesis of Bio&#8208;Inspired Guanine Microplatelets: Morphological and Crystallographic Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, Page 16228-16235, December 9, 2020. </description>

Guanine crystals are widely observed in a variety of organisms for achieving diverse optical effects, such as broadband reflection, photonic coloration, and vision. Chen et al. report a facile synthesis method to fabricate guanine microplatelets with controlled morphological and crystallographic characteristics similar to biological guanine crystals (see figure).







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Phase anhydrous guanine (&#946;&#8208;AG) crystals are one of the most widespread organic crystals to construct optical structures in organisms. Currently, no synthetic method is available that allows for producing guanine crystals with similar control in size, morphology, and crystallography as in biological ones. Herein, a facile one&#8208;step synthesis route to fabricate bio&#8208;inspired guanine microplatelets with (100) exposing planes in almost pure &#946;&#8208;phase is reported. The synthesis is based on a precipitation process of a guanine sodium hydroxide solution in formamide with poly(1&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone&#8208;co&#8208;vinyl acetate) as a morphological additive. Due to their uniform size (ca. 20&#8197;&#956;m) and thickness (ca. 110&#8197;nm), the crystals represent the first synthetic guanine microplatelets that exhibit strong structural coloration and pearlescent lusters. Moreover, this synthesis route was utilized as a model system to investigate the effects of guanine analogues, including uric acid, hypoxanthine, xanthine, adenine, and guanosine, during the crystallization process. Our results indicate that the introduction of guanine analogues not only can reduce the required synthesis temperature but also provide a versatile control in crystal morphology and polymorph selection between the &#945;&#8208;phase AG (&#945;&#8208;AG) and &#946;&#8208;AG. Turbidity experiments show that the &#946;&#8208;AG microplatelets are formed with a fast precipitation rate in comparison to &#945;&#8208;AG, suggesting that the formation of &#946;&#8208;AG crystals follows a kinetically driven process.

Asymmetric addition: The first protocol for catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition of Grignard reagents to various vinylogous imines, generated in situ from sulfonyl indoles have been developed by using catalyst system based on copper(I) salt and chiral phosphoramidite ligand.







Abstract
Chiral indole derivatives are ubiquitous motifs in pharmaceuticals and alkaloids. Herein, the first protocol for catalytic asymmetric conjugate addition of Grignard reagents to various sulfonyl indoles, offering a straightforward approach for the synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;sec&#8208;alkyl&#8208;substituted indoles in high yields and enantiomeric ratios is presented. This methodology makes use of a chiral catalyst based on copper phosphoramidite complexes and in situ formation of vinylogous imine intermediates.

New thailandepsin&#8197;B pseudo&#8208;natural products have been prepared applying rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrooxycarbonylation. This strategy gives access to the asymmetric branched allylic ester moiety in a highly diastereoselective manner. Varying warheads have been introduced via late stage modification. The newly developed compounds are extremely potent and selective HDAC inhibitors







Abstract
New Thailandepsin&#8197;B pseudo&#8208;natural products have been prepared. Our synthetic strategy offers the possibility to introduce varying warheads via late stage modification. Additionally, it gives access to the asymmetric branched allylic ester moiety of the natural product in a highly diastereoselective manner applying rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydrooxycarbonylation. The newly developed pseudo&#8208;natural products are extremely potent and selective HDAC inhibitors. The non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acid d&#8208;norleucine was obtained enantioselectively by a recently developed method of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination.

One small step: An innovative and robust template&#8208;free continuous process allows the synthesis of nanoparticles of a switchable coordination polymer, including the use of supercritical CO2 and aiming at both quenching the particle growth and drying the powder.







Abstract
Switchable materials are increasingly considered for implementation in devices or multifunctional composites leading to a strong need in terms of reliable synthetic productions of well&#8208;defined objects. Here, an innovative and robust template&#8208;free continuous process was developed to synthesize nanoparticles of a switchable coordination polymer, including the use of supercritical CO2, aiming at both quenching the particle growth and drying the powder. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one process offers a 12&#8208;fold size reduction in a few minutes while maintaining the switching properties of the selected spin crossover coordination polymer.

         <title>Asymmetric Biocatalytic Synthesis of 1&#8208;Aryltetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines Enabled by &#8220;Substrate Walking&#8221;</title>

Walking to new frontiers: Taking the challenge that not a single biocatalyst was available for the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction with benzaldehyde derivatives, modern tools of enzyme engineering were applied in a joined forces approach. Thus, a catalyst displaying the desired activity was created, giving optically enriched products with up to 99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Stereoselective catalysts for the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction of tryptamines and aldehydes may allow a simple and fast approach to chiral 1&#8208;substituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines. Although biocatalysts have previously been employed for the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, not a single one accepts benzaldehyde and its substituted derivatives. To address this challenge, a combination of substrate walking and transfer of beneficial mutations between different wild&#8208;type backbones was used to develop a strictosidine synthase from Rauvolfia serpentina (RsSTR) into a suitable enzyme for the asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler condensation of tryptamine and benzaldehyde derivatives. The double variant RsSTR V176L/V208A accepted various ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; and para&#8208;substituted benzaldehydes and produced the corresponding chiral 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines with up to 99&#8201;% enantiomeric excess.

         <title>Electrophilicity Scale of Activated Amides: 17O&#8197;NMR and 15N&#8197;NMR Chemical Shifts of Acyclic Twisted Amides in N&#8722;C(O) Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, Page 16246-16250, December 9, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrophilicity scale is herein reported by exploiting 17O&#8197;NMR and 15N&#8197;NMR chemical shifts of acyclic twisted and destabilized acyclic amides that have recently received major attention as precursors in N&#8208;C(O) cross&#8208;coupling and electrophilic activation. Most crucially, acyclic twisted amides feature electrophilicity of the carbonyl group that ranges between that of acid anhydrides and acid chlorides.







Abstract
The structure and properties of amides are of tremendous interest in organic synthesis and biochemistry. Traditional amides are planar and the carbonyl group non&#8208;electrophilic due to nN&#8594;&#960;*C=O conjugation. In this study, we report electrophilicity scale by exploiting 17O&#8197;NMR and 15N&#8197;NMR chemical shifts of acyclic twisted and destabilized acyclic amides that have recently received major attention as precursors in N&#8208;C(O) cross&#8208;coupling by selective oxidative addition as well as precursors in electrophilic activation of N&#8208;C(O) bonds. Most crucially, we demonstrate that acyclic twisted amides feature electrophilicity of the carbonyl group that ranges between that of acid anhydrides and acid chlorides. Furthermore, a wide range of electrophilic amides is possible with gradually varying carbonyl electrophilicity by steric and electronic tuning of amide bond properties. Overall, the study quantifies for the first time that steric and electronic destabilization of the amide bond in common acyclic amides renders the amide bond as electrophilic as acid anhydrides and chlorides. These findings should have major implications on the fundamental properties of amide bonds.

         <title>Improvement of Molecular Diagnosis Using Domain&#8208;Level Single&#8208;Nucleotide Variants by Eliminating Unexpected Secondary Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, Page 16256-16260, December 9, 2020. </description>

By eliminating the unexpected secondary structure of oligonucleotides, this work reports the realization of domain&#8208;level SNV molecular diagnoses and identifies four highly homologous strands.







Abstract
Identification of single&#8208;nucleotide variants (SNVs) is of great significance in molecular diagnosis. The problem that should not be ignored in the identification process is that the unexpected secondary structure of the target nucleic acid may greatly affect the detection accuracy. Herein, we proposed a conditional domain&#8208;level SNV diagnosis strategy, in which the subsequent SNV detection can only be carried out after eliminating the unexpected secondary structure of target DNA. Specifically, the target DNA is assembled into a rigid double strand, which makes folding the target DNA difficult and the unexpected secondary structure is eliminated. Based on this double&#8208;stranded structure, specially designed probes are used to detect double&#8208;stranded properties and report abundant domain&#8208;level oligonucleotide information to improve the effective information in the detection results and complete domain&#8208;level SNV diagnosis. If the unexpected secondary structure is not eliminated, the detector will first detect it and feed back to us, ensuring the accuracy of the subsequent detection results. With the occurrence (or not) of SNV and the change of the SNV site, in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, we successfully identified the four homologous sequences to be tested related to BRAF gene.

Specifically, the target DNA is assembled into a rigid double strand, which makes folding the target DNA difficult and the unexpected secondary structure is eliminated. Based on this double&#8208;stranded structure, specially designed probes are used to detect double&#8208;stranded properties and report abundant domain&#8208;level oligonucleotide information to improve the effective information in the detection results and complete domain&#8208;level SNV diagnosis. If the unexpected secondary structure is not eliminated, the detector will first detect it and feed back to us, ensuring the accuracy of the subsequent detection results. With the occurrence (or not) of SNV and the change of the SNV site, in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment, we successfully identified the four homologous sequences to be tested related to BRAF gene.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cycloisomerization of Arylalkynes</title>

Chiral N&#8208;triflyl phosphoramides catalyze the asymmetric carbocyclization of alkynyl aryl substrates. The introduction of a 2&#8208;naphtolyl substituent on the alkyne enables the chemo&#8208; and regioselective protonation of alkynes and delivers atropisomeric phenanthrenes and dihydronaphtalenes enantioselectively.







Abstract
The first example of an enantioselective carbocyclization of an alkyne&#8208;containing substrate catalyzed by chiral Br&#248;nsted acids was achieved. The use of the 2&#8208;hydroxynaphthyl substituent on the alkyne as a directing group constituted the key parameter enabling both efficient regioselective protonation of the carbon&#8211;carbon triple bond and chiral induction. The key cationic intermediate could be depicted either as a cationic vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide or a stabilized vinyl cation. Atropoisomeric phenanthrenes derivatives were produced in high yields and good enantioselectivities under mild, metal&#8208;free reaction conditions in the presence of chiral N&#8208;triflylphosphoramide catalysts. The carbenic nature of the cationic intermediate was also exploited to describe an example of alkyne/alkane cycloisomerization.

         <title>Transformation of COUPY Fluorophores into a Novel Class of Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Cleavable Photolabile Protecting Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 26, Issue 69, Page 16222-16227, December 9, 2020. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of coumarin&#8208;based COUPY fluorophores into a new class of visible light&#8208;sensitive photolabile protecting groups, which expand the current photochemical toolbox, is reported. Besides exhibiting an excellent cellular uptake, COUPY photocages accumulate selectively in mitochondria, thereby offering the possibility of delivering biologically active compounds within this organelle in a selective manner.







Abstract
Although photolabile protecting groups (PPGs) have found widespread applications in several fields of chemistry, biology and materials science, there is a growing interest in expanding the photochemical toolbox to overcome some of the limitations of classical caging groups. In this work, the synthesis of a new class of visible&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive PPGs based on low&#8208;molecular weight COUPY fluorophores with several attractive properties, including long&#8208;wavelength absorption, is reported. Besides being stable to spontaneous hydrolysis in the dark, COUPY&#8208;based PPGs can be efficiently photoactivated with yellow (560&#8197;nm) and red light (620&#8197;nm) under physiological&#8208;like conditions, thereby offering the possibility of unmasking functional groups from COUPY photocages under irradiation conditions in which other PPGs remain stable. Additionally, COUPY photocages exhibit excellent cellular uptake and accumulate selectively in mitochondria, opening the door to the delivery of caged analogues of biologically active compounds into these organelles.

New topology: Extended tetratopic benzoic acid ligands with &#8220;orthogonal&#8208;twisted&#8208;arms&#8221; conformations were designed and synthesized for the construction of new MOF structures (OTA&#8208;MOF). X&#8208;ray single crystal structures were successfully obtained, demonstrating the formation of a new topology (4,4,4&#8208;c). The OTA2&#8208;MOF&#8208;Cu gave moderate stability in organic solvents and good gas&#8208;sorption ability towards CO2.







Abstract
Extended tetratopic benzoic acid ligands with &#8220;orthogonal&#8208;twisted&#8208;arms&#8221; conformations were designed and synthesized for the construction of new MOF structures (OTA&#8208;MOF). Upon coordination with Cd2+ and Cu2+ cations, two well&#8208;defined new MOFs were prepared. X&#8208;ray single crystal structures were successfully obtained, demonstrating the formation of a new topology (4,4,4&#8208;c). The OTA2&#8208;MOF&#8208;Cu gave moderate stability in organic solvents and good gas sorption ability toward CO2. This new MOF showed superior catalytic reactivity toward the epoxide&#8208;CO2 cycloaddition, giving &gt;50 folds yield enhancement over the controlled reaction without MOF. It is expected that this new ligand design, porous structure, and excellent CO2 catalytic reactivity will make OTA&#8208;MOF promising new materials for applications in catalysis and separation.

Amine&#8208;triggered deoxyfluorination of carboxylic acids with CF3SO2OCF3 is described. The reaction proceeds rapidly at room temperature under metal&#8208;free conditions to form various acyl fluorides in up to 97&#8201;% yield. This protocol represents the first utilization of trifluoromethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate as a convenient and efficient fluorination reagent.







Abstract
A convenient method for deoxyfluorination of aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids with CF3SO2OCF3 in the presence of a suitable base at room temperature has been developed. The reaction allows a straightforward access to a variety of acyl fluorides and proves that CF3SO2OCF3 is an effective deoxyfluorination reagent for carboxylic acids. The method features simplicity, expeditiousness, high efficiency, ease of handling, good functional group tolerance, a wide range of substrates, excellent yields of products, compatibility of many amine initiators, use of environmentally friendly reagents, and effortless removal of byproducts. This reaction represents the first utilization of trifluoromethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate as a fluorination reagent.

Ultrathin films: Comparison of silica and germania thin films to understand the crucial role of the metal support for the pathway from crystalline to amorphous structures.







Abstract
The present review reports on the preparation and atomic&#8208;scale characterization of the thinnest possible films of the glass&#8208;forming materials silica and germania. To this end state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art surface science techniques, in particular scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory calculations have been employed. The investigated films range from monolayer to bilayer coverage where both, the crystalline and the amorphous films, contain characteristic XO4 (X=Si,Ge) building blocks. A side&#8208;by&#8208;side comparison of silica and germania monolayer, zigzag phase and bilayer films supported on Mo(112), Ru(0001), Pt(111), and Au(111) leads to a more general comprehension of the network structure of glass former materials. This allows us to understand the crucial role of the metal support for the pathway from crystalline to amorphous ultrathin film growth.

         <title>Influence of Metal&#8208;Alkyls on Early&#8208;Stage Ethylene Polymerization over a Cr/SiO2 Phillips Catalyst: A Bulk Characterization and X&#8208;ray Chemical Imaging Study</title>

Tailoring polymerization processes: The addition of the proper type and amount of co&#8208;catalyst in a Cr/SiO2 Phillips&#8208;type ethylene polymerization system tailors the molecular weight distribution and degree of short chain branching. We have now used scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy for investigating how these properties affect the polyethylene crystallinity in the early stages of ethylene polymerization.







Abstract
The Cr/SiO2 Phillips catalyst has taken a central role in ethylene polymerization since its invention in 1953. The uniqueness of this catalyst is related to its ability to produce broad molecular weight distribution (MWD) PE materials as well as that no co&#8208;catalysts are required to attain activity. Nonetheless, co&#8208;catalysts in the form of metal&#8208;alkyls can be added for scavenging poisons, enhancing catalyst activity, reducing the induction period, and tailoring polymer characteristics. The activation mechanism and related polymerization mechanism remain elusive, despite extensive industrial and academic research. Here, we show that by varying the type and amount of metal&#8208;alkyl co&#8208;catalyst, we can tailor polymer properties around a single Cr/SiO2 Phillips catalyst formulation. Furthermore, we show that these different polymer properties exist in the early stages of polymerization. We have used conventional polymer characterization techniques, such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and 13C&#8197;NMR, for studying the metal&#8208;alkyl co&#8208;catalyst effect on short&#8208;chain branching (SCB), long&#8208;chain branching (LCB) and molecular weight distribution (MWD) at the bulk scale. In addition, scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM) was used as a synchrotron technique to study the PE formation in the early stages: allowing us to investigate the produced type of early&#8208;stage PE within one particle cross&#8208;section with high energy resolution and nanometer scale spatial resolution.

         <title>Generation of Oxidoreductases with Dual Alcohol Dehydrogenase and Amine Dehydrogenase Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lend me your hydrogen: Starting from an &#1013;&#8208;deaminating l&#8208;lysine dehydrogenase, we created new variants that perform the reduction of aldehydes to alcohols and the reductive amination of aldehydes and ketones to amines. The reductive amination of ketones proceeded with excellent stereoselectivity. This dual AmDH/ADH activity was applied for the one&#8208;enzyme hydrogen&#8208;borrowing amination of benzylic alcohol, thus providing the first example of an &#8220;alcohol aminase&#8221; activity.







Abstract
The l&#8208;lysine&#8208;&#1013;&#8208;dehydrogenase (LysEDH) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus naturally catalyzes the oxidative deamination of the &#1013;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine. We previously engineered this enzyme to create amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) variants that possess a new hydrophobic cavity in their active site such that aromatic ketones can bind and be converted into &#945;&#8208;chiral amines with excellent enantioselectivity. We also recently observed that LysEDH was capable of reducing aromatic aldehydes into primary alcohols. Herein, we harnessed the promiscuous alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity of LysEDH to create new variants that exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for the reduction of substituted benzaldehydes and arylaliphatic aldehydes to primary alcohols. Notably, these novel engineered dehydrogenases also catalyzed the reductive amination of a variety of aldehydes and ketones with excellent enantioselectivity, thus exhibiting a dual AmDH/ADH activity. We envisioned that the catalytic bi&#8208;functionality of these enzymes could be applied for the direct conversion of alcohols into amines. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, we performed an unprecedented one&#8208;pot &#8220;hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8221; cascade to convert benzyl alcohol to benzylamine using a single enzyme. Conducting the same biocatalytic cascade in the presence of cofactor recycling enzymes (i.e., NADH&#8208;oxidase and formate dehydrogenase) increased the reaction yields. In summary, this work provides the first examples of enzymes showing &#8220;alcohol aminase&#8221; activity.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Iridium Photocatalyst for Chemical Modification of Dehydroalanines in Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;orthogonal modification of dehydroalanine residues in peptides and proteins is achieved by photoredox catalysis with a newly designed water&#8208;soluble IrIII complex in aqueous media and a variety of zinc benzylsulfinates as reagents.







Abstract
Dehydroalanine (Dha) residues are attractive noncanonical amino acids that occur naturally in ribosomally synthesised and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). Dha residues are attractive targets for selective late&#8208;stage modification of these complex biomolecules. In this work, we show the selective photocatalytic modification of dehydroalanine residues in the antimicrobial peptide nisin and in the proteins small ubiquitin&#8208;like modifier (SUMO) and superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP). For this purpose, a new water&#8208;soluble iridium(III) photoredox catalyst was used. The design and synthesis of this new photocatalyst, [Ir(dF(CF3)ppy)2(dNMe3bpy)]Cl3, is presented. In contrast to commonly used iridium photocatalysts, this complex is highly water soluble and allows peptides and proteins to be modified in water and aqueous solvents under physiologically relevant conditions, with short reaction times and with low reagent and catalyst loadings. This work suggests that photoredox catalysis using this newly designed catalyst is a promising strategy to modify dehydroalanine&#8208;containing natural products and thus could have great potential for novel bioconjugation strategies.

Mesoporous ceria catalysts: A high&#8208;surface&#8208;area mesoporous CeO2 catalyst prepared by an organic&#8208;template&#8208;induced homogeneous precipitation method shows exceptional redox properties and can boost imine formation by direct oxidative coupling of primary alcohols and anilines in air atmosphere at low temperature.







Abstract
High&#8208;surface&#8208;area mesoporous CeO2 (hsmCeO2) was prepared by a facile organic&#8208;template&#8208;induced homogeneous precipitation process and showed excellent catalytic activity in imine synthesis in the absence of base from primary alcohols and amines in air atmosphere at low temperature. For comparison, ordinary CeO2 and hsmCeO2 after different thermal treatments were also investigated. XRD, N2 physisorption, UV&#8208;Raman, H2 temperature&#8208;programmed reduction, O2 temperature&#8208;programmed desorption, EPR spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to unravel the structural and redox properties. The hsmCeO2 calcined at 400&#8201;&#176;C shows the highest specific surface area (158&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), the highest fraction of surface coordinatively unsaturated Ce3+ ions (18.2&#8201;%), and the highest concentration of reactive oxygen vacancies (2.4&#215;1015&#8197;spins&#8201;g&#8722;1). In the model reaction of oxidative coupling of benzyl alcohol and aniline, such an exceptional redox property of the hsmCeO2 catalyst can boost benzylideneaniline formation (2.75 and 5.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;
&#8201;h&#8722;1 based on &gt;99&#8201;% yield at 60 and 80&#8201;&#176;C, respectively) in air with no base additives. It can also work effectively at a temperature of 30&#8201;&#176;C and in gram&#8208;scale synthesis. These are among the best results for all benchmark ceria catalysts in the literature. Moreover, the hsmCeO2 catalyst shows a wide scope towards primary alcohols and amines with good to excellent yield of imines. The influence of reaction parameters, the reusability of the catalyst, and the reaction mechanism were investigated.

         <title>A Photoclick&#8208;Based High&#8208;Throughput Screening for the Directed Evolution of Decarboxylase OleT</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic decarboxylation is synthetically important, but so far, directed evolution of decarboxylases was impeded by the lack of a high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS). Here, a simple photoclick&#8208;based HTS was developed and used to evolve the decarboxylase OleT toward the acceptance of small aromatic substrates. The improved enzyme variants efficiently convert small aromatic substrates while the parent enzyme favors long&#8208;chain fatty acids.







Abstract
Enzymatic oxidative decarboxylation is an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming reaction yet lacking efficient screening methods for the directed evolution of decarboxylases. Here, we describe a simple photoclick assay for the detection of decarboxylation products and its application in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle directed evolution study on the decarboxylase OleT. The assay was compatible with two frequently used OleT operation modes (directly using hydrogen peroxide as the enzyme's co&#8208;substrate or using a reductase partner) and the screening of saturation mutagenesis libraries identified two enzyme variants shifting the enzyme's substrate preference from long chain fatty acids toward styrene derivatives. Overall, this photoclick assay holds promise to speed&#8208;up the directed evolution of OleT and other decarboxylases.

         <title>Preparation of a Lanthanide&#8211;Titanium Oxo Cluster&#8211;Polymer Composite by CuI&#8208;Catalyzed Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click reactions: Reaction of an azide&#8208;containing lanthanide&#8211;titanium oxo cluster of Eu8Ti10&#8208;N3 (1) with PEG through CuI&#8208;catalyzed click chemistry generates a lanthanide&#8211;polymer composite of Eu8Ti10&#8208;N3@PEG (2), which exhibits excellent film&#8208;forming and adhesion to the substrate, while the luminescent property of 1 itself basically keeps unchanged in 2 (see figure).







Abstract
Incorporating metal clusters within the skeleton of the organic polymers through a click reaction cannot only effectively prepare cluster&#8211;polymer composites, but also effectively avoid the cluster aggregation. Herein, an azide&#8208;containing lanthanide&#8211;titanium oxo cluster of Eu8Ti10&#8208;N3 (Eu8Ti10&#8208;N3=[Eu8Ti10(&#956;3&#8208;O)14(H2O)4(OAc)2(tbba)30(paza)4(THF)2]&#8901;4&#8201;THF&#8901;8&#8201;H2O (1), Htbba=4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzoic acid, Hpaza=4&#8208;azidobenzoate, HOAc=acetic acid, THF=tetrahydrofuran) through an in situ solvothermal reaction of 4&#8208;azidobenzoic acid and 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzoic acid. Reaction of 1 with PEG (PEG=methoxypoly(ethyleneglycol)alkyne, 2000&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1) through CuI&#8208;catalyzed click chemistry generates a lanthanide&#8211;polymer composite of Eu8Ti10&#8208;N3@PEG (2). Investigation with IR, 1H&#8197;NMR and ICP&#8208;OES of 2 indicates that the structural integrity of 1 is maintained in 2. Study of the luminescent properties of 1 and 2 reveals that the quantum yield of 1 itself basically remains unchanged in 2. Significantly, the formation of 2 cannot only effectively prevent the cluster 1 from aggregation, but also greatly enhance its solubility and adhesion to the substrate. Owing to the solubility and adhesion of luminescent materials being the key to their practical application, present work is thus of great significance for the development of metal cluster&#8211;polymer composite luminescent materials.

         <title>Organocatalytic Cascade Reactions for the Diversification of Thiopyrano&#8208;Piperidone Fused Rings Utilizing Trienamine Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective thio&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder/nucleophilic ring&#8208;closing cascade reaction utilizing trienamine catalysis with dithioamides is presented. Notably, by linking an indole moiety on the dithioamide, a Pictet&#8211;Spengler type reaction can be also promoted, leading to more complex frameworks in a one&#8208;pot process. Additionally, a super cascade sequence to assemble nine fused rings can be achieved by employing a bis&#8208;dithioamide (see scheme).







Abstract
An aminocatalytic privileged diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis (ApDOS) strategy utilizing trienamine catalysis for the construction of diverse and complex thiopyrans&#8208;piperidone fused rings through a thia&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder/nucleophilic ring&#8208;closing sequence by using dithioamides as activated heterodienophiles is reported. Following this strategy, a super cascade reaction to assemble nine fused rings can be achieved by employing a bis&#8208;dithioamide. Additionally, by linking an indole moiety on the dithioamide, a Pictet&#8211;Spengler type reaction can be promoted once the cascade sequence has been achieved, leading to more complex penta&#8208; hexa&#8208; and heptacyclic fused ring derivatives in a one&#8208;pot process. This investigation opens new perspectives for the synthesis of a new class of complex and diverse thiopyrans that contribute to populate new relevant regions in the chemical space.

         <title>Single&#8208;Electron Transfer Reactions Enabled by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Organocatalysis</title>

NHC organocatalysis: The development of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis presents new opportunities in radical reactions. The Breslow intermediate&#8208;based radical cations, which could be generated through single&#8208;electron oxidation or reduction, enabled a series of novel radical transformations. These advancements greatly extend the synthetic potential of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis.







Abstract
Over the past decades, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis has undergone a flourish of development on the basis of closed&#8208;shell reaction paths. By contrast, the emerging area of single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions enabled by NHC catalysis still remain underdeveloped, but offer plenty of opportunities to develop new catalytic modes and useful synthetic methods. A number of interesting transformations were triggered by the SET process from the electron&#8208;rich Breslow intermediates to various single&#8208;electron acceptors. In additions, recent studies revealed that the Breslow radical cations could also be generated by single&#8208;electron reduction of the electron&#8208;deficient acyl azolium intermediates. These discoveries open a new avenue for NHC organocatalysis to harness radical reactions. The present review will focus on the exciting advancements in the dynamic area of radical NHC organocatalysis.

         <title>Exciton Transport in Molecular Semiconductor Crystals for Spin&#8208;Optoelectronics Paradigm</title>

Crystal matter: The estimated singlet exciton diffusion length is 124&#8197;nm in 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene crystals for advanced optoelectronics. The crystals show parallelogram morphology, a non&#8208;radiation rate constant of 0.26&#8197;ns&#8208;1, good field&#8208;effect transistor hole mobility, and strong electronic couplings. These advantages allow excitons to rapidly diffuse to the crystal surface for charge separation and bimolecular recombination in photoconductivity experiments.







Abstract
Organic semiconductors with long&#8208;range exciton diffusion length are highly desirable for optoelectronics but currently remain rare. Here, the estimated diffusion length of singlet excitons (LD) in 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA) crystals grown by solvent evaporation was shown to be up to approximately 124&#8197;nm. These crystals showed a previously unseen parallelogram morphology with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer edge&#8208;on molecular stacking, isotropic optical waveguiding, radiation rate and non&#8208;radiation rate constants of 0.15 and 0.26&#8197;ns&#8722;1 respectively, as well as good field&#8208;effect transistor hole mobility and theoretically computed strong electronic couplings as high as 109&#8197;meV. Photoresponse experiments revealed that the photoconductivity of DPA crystals is surprisingly not related to the radiative pathway but associated with rapid exciton diffusion to the crystal surface for charge separation and carrier bimolecular recombination. Taken together, DPA was shown to be a promising semiconducting material for a new organic optoelectronics paradigm.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions are an integral part of the modern catalysis toolbox. While stronger non&#8208;covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding are commonly the main driving force of catalysis, &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions typically provide smaller additional stabilizations, e.g. to afford selectivity enhancements. Here, we show computationally that pristine graphene flakes may efficiently catalyze the skeletal inversions of various benzannulated cyclooctatetraene derivatives, providing an example of a catalytic process solely driven by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Hereby, the catalytic effect results from disproportionate shape complementarity between catalyst and transition structure compared to catalyst and reactant. An energy decomposition analysis reveals electrostatic and, especially with increasing system size, to a larger extent dispersion interactions as the origin of stabilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [c2]Daisy Chain Rotaxane Insulating Two Diarylacetylene Cores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A [c2]daisy chain rotaxane, in which two independent diarylacetylene cores are insulated by two permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (PM &#945;&#8208;CDs), is efficiently synthesized using the Janus [2]rotaxane strategy. The observation of both monomer and excimer emission in various solvents reveals that frequent shuttling of the rotaxane subunits occurs in solution.







Abstract
A [c2]daisy chain rotaxane with two diarylacetylene cores was efficiently synthesized in 53&#8201;% yield by capping a C2&#8208;symmetric pseudo[2]rotaxane composed of two diarylacetylene&#8208;substituted permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (PM &#945;&#8208;CDs) with aniline stoppers. The maximum absorption wavelength of the [c2]daisy chain rotaxane remained almost unchanged in various solvents, unlike that of the stoppered monomer, indicating that the two independent diarylacetylene cores were insulated from the external environment by the PM &#945;&#8208;CDs. Furthermore, the [c2]daisy chain rotaxane exhibited fluorescence emission derived from both diarylacetylene monomers and the excimer, which implies that the [c2]daisy chain structure can undergo contraction and extension. This is the first demonstration of a system in which excimer formation between two &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules within an isolated space can be controlled by the unique motion of a [c2]daisy chain rotaxane.

         <dc:description>We report the design and synthesis of air&#8208;stable and conveniently crystallizable Rh(III)cyclopentadienyl catalysts substituted with a urea moiety which are able to accelerate the C&#8211;H olefination of benzoic acid derivatives. Through kinetic studies and NMR titration experiments, we identified the catalysts&#8217; substrate recognition ability mediated by hydrogen bonding to be the reason for this effect. Introduction of pyridone&#8208;phosphine ligands capable of forming additional H&#8208;bond interactions increased the catalytic performance even further. By unveiling a proportionality between reaction rate and relative complex formation enthalpy we were able to support our hypothesis of a supramolecular catalyst preformation. Its application to a variety of substrates proved the catalyst system&#8217;s advantages, generally increasing the yields when compared to the results obtained with widely used [RhCp*Cl2]2.</dc:description>

         <title>From Carbohydrates to Complex Organofluorines: Synthesis, Conformation, and Lipophilicity of Multi&#8208;Vicinal Fluorine&#8208;Containing Hexitol Analogues</title>

         <dc:description>There is growing interest in the preparation of fluorine&#8208;containing organic molecules. Multi&#8208;vicinal fluorine analogues are among the most intriguing and promising compounds but their physical and biological investigations suffer from challenging syntheses. Hence, we report on the synthesis of a large set of novel polyfluorohexitols. The determination of the dominant solution&#8208;state conformation of all trifluorohexitol was achieved, along with the comparison of solid&#8208;state conformation of some analogues. Finally, the lipophilicity of a large set of polyfluorinated hexopyranose and hexitol analogues was attributed using a log  P  determination method based on  19  F NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

Doubling up: Six pyrimidine&#8208;based push&#8211;pull systems substituted at positions C2 and C4/6 with phenylacridan and styryl moieties, employing methoxy or N,N&#8208;diphenylamino donors, are investigated. These chromophores show aggregation&#8208;induced emission, as well as dual emission in polar solvents and in thin films, leading to white&#8208;light emission.







Abstract
Six pyrimidine&#8208;based push&#8211;pull systems substituted at positions C2 and C4/6 with phenylacridan and styryl moieties, employing methoxy or N,N&#8208;diphenylamino donors, have been designed and synthesized through cross&#8208;coupling and Knoevenagel reactions. X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed that the molecular structure featured the acridan moiety arranged perpendicularly to the residual &#960; system. Photophysical studies revealed significant differences between the methoxy and N,N&#8208;diphenylamino chromophores. Solvatochromic studies revealed that the methoxy derivatives showed dual emission in polar solvents. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy revealed that the higher energy band involved very fast (&lt;80&#8197;ps) fluorescence, whereas the lower energy one included long components (&#8776;30&#8197;ns) due to long&#8208;lived intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer fluorescence. In contrast to N,N&#8208;diphenylamino chromophores, the methoxy derivatives also showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission in mixtures of THF/water, as well as dual emission in thin films, covering almost the whole visible spectrum with corresponding chromaticity coordinates not far from that of pure white light. These properties render the methoxy derivatives as very promising organic materials for white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Methylene Bridging Effect on the Structures, Lewis Acidities and Optical Properties of Semi&#8208;planar Triarylboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of semi&#8208;planar triarylboranes were obtained by three procedures. The effects of the planarization induced by the methylene bridge on their steric shielding, Lewis acidities and optical properties were investigated by experiments and quantum chemical calculations. These methods can be extended to the preparation of functionalized spirocyclic amine&#8208;boranes and unsymmetrical triarylboranes, which might be used in frustrated Lewis pair chemistry or as pH and photo&#8208;responsive boron Lewis acids.







Abstract
Three synthetic methods towards semi&#8208;planar triarylboranes with two aryl rings connected by a methylene bridge have been developed. The fine&#8208;tuning of their stereoelectronic properties and Lewis acidities was achieved by introducing fluorine, methyl, methoxy, n&#8208;butyl and phenyl groups either at their exocyclic or bridged aryl rings. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provided quantitative information on the structural distortion experienced by the near planar hydro&#8208;boraanthracene skeleton during the association with Lewis bases such as NH3 and F&#8722;. Though the methylene bridge between the ortho&#8208;positions of two aryl rings of triarylboranes decreased the Gibbs free energies of complexation with small Lewis bases by less than 5&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 relative to the classical Lewis acid BAr3, the steric shielding of the CH2 bridge is sufficient to avoid the formation of Lewis adducts with larger Lewis bases such as triarylphosphines. A newly synthesized spirocyclic amino&#8208;borane with a long intramolecular B&#8722;N bond that could be dissociated under thermal process, UV&#8208;irradiation, or acidic conditions might be a potential candidate in Lewis pairs catalysis.

         <title>Intermolecular C&#8722;H Activation at the Allylic/Benzylic and Homoallylic/Homobenzylic Positions of Cyclic Hydrocarbons by a Stable Divalent Silicon Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activating C&#8722;H bonds with Si: Intermolecular allylic/benzylic and homoallylic/homobenzylic C&#8722;H activations by a divalent silicon species were accomplished by the treatment of a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene with cyclohexene or 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalene in neat conditions. The reaction of the silylene and cyclohexene is likely initiated by allylic dehydrogenation to generate a silyl radical and cyclohexyl radical, which are responsible for the homoallylic C&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
Direct activation of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds by main group element species is yet a formidable challenge. Herein, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydronaphthalene through the allylic/benzylic and homoallylic/homobenzylic C&#8722;H bond activation by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)silylene 1 in neat conditions is reported to yield the corresponding aromatic compounds. As for the reaction of cyclohexene, allylsilane 3 and 7&#8208;silanorbornene 4 were also observed, which could be interpreted as a direct dehydrogenative silylation reaction of monoalkenes at the allylic positions. Experimental and computational studies suggest that the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene at the homoallylic position was accomplished by a combination of silylene 1 and radical intermediates such as hydrosilyl radical INT1 or cyclohexenyl radical H, which are generated in the initial step of the reaction.

Ligands can prevent peptides binding by direct competition for the binding site (orthosteric inhibition) or by inducing conformational changes (allosteric inhibition).







Abstract
Stabilizing the DNA and RNA structures known as G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) using specific ligands is a strategy that has been proposed to fight cancer. However, although G&#8208;quadruplex:ligand (G4:L) interactions have often been investigated, whether or not ligands are able to disrupt G&#8208;quadruplex:protein (G4:P) interactions remains poorly studied. In this study, using native mass spectrometry, we have investigated ternary G4:L:P complexes formed by G4s, some of the highest affinity ligands, and the binding domain of the RHAU helicase. Our results suggest that RHAU binds not only preferentially to parallel G4s, but also to free external G&#8208;quartets. We also found that, depending on the G4, ligands could prevent the binding of the peptide, either by direct competition for the binding sites (orthosteric inhibition) or by inducing conformational changes (allosteric inhibition). Notably, the ligand Cu&#8211;ttpy (ttpy=4&#8242;&#8208;tolyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine) induced a conformational change that increased the binding of the peptide. This study illustrates that it is important to not only characterize drug&#8211;target interactions, but also how the binding to other partners is affected.

         <title>Divergent Asymmetric Reactions of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides with &#945;&#8208;Thiocyanato Indanones for the Synthesis of Spiro&#8208; and Fused&#8208;Indanones</title>

Asymmetric catalysis: Highly efficient asymmetric reactions for the divergent synthesis of spiro&#8208; and fused&#8208;indanone scaffolds triggered by interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bonding are reported.







Abstract
Reported in this work is a water triggered chemo&#8208;divergent enantioselective spiro&#8208;annulation and cascade reaction of ortho&#8208;quinone methides (o&#8208;QMs) with &#945;&#8208;thiocyanato indanones catalyzed by a chiral organic base. In the case of spiro&#8208;annulation, the use of trace amount of water as additive is critical to achieve high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% ee). We found that a cascade reaction was enabled by just tuning the ratio of water in solvent. Accordingly, two new highly efficient asymmetric reactions for the divergent synthesis of spiro&#8208; and fused&#8208;indanone scaffolds with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) were developed. Mechanistic investigations suggest that interfacial hydrogen bonding may play an important role in achieving the switchable reaction pathways.

         <title>Linker Hydrophilicity Modulates the Anticancer Activity of RGD&#8211;Cryptophycin Conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweet specificity: A &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase&#8208;responsive linker was chosen to minimize the hydrophobicity and connect the potent antimitotic agent cryptophycin&#8208;55 glycinate to the &#945;v&#946;3 integrin ligand c(RGDfK). The presence of a hydrophilic carbohydrate linker significantly decreased the cytotoxicity of RGD&#8211;cryptophycin conjugates relative to the free drug. The conjugate efficiently releases the drug upon linker cleavage by &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase.







Abstract
Most anticancer agents are hydrophobic and can easily penetrate the tumor cell membrane by passive diffusion. This may impede the development of highly effective and tumor&#8208;selective treatment options. A hydrophilic &#946;&#8208;glucuronidase&#8208;cleavable linker was used to connect the highly potent antimitotic agent cryptophycin&#8208;55 glycinate with the &#945;v&#946;3 integrin ligand c(RGDfK). Incorporation of the self&#8208;immolative linker containing glucuronic acid results in lower cytotoxicity than that of the free payload, suggesting that hydrophilic sugar linkers can preclude passive cellular uptake. In&#8197;vitro drug&#8208;release studies and cytotoxicity assays demonstrated the potential of this small molecule&#8211;drug conjugate, providing guidance for the development of therapeutics containing hydrophobic anticancer drugs.

         <title>Tunable Synthesis of Hierarchical Yolk/Double&#8208;Shelled SiOx@TiO2@C Nanospheres for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiOx@TiO2@C nanospheres with different voids were successfully prepared, and the regulation of SiOx yolk was achieved by changing the etching time. The etching time of SiOx yolk affects the morphology and electrochemical performance of SiOx@TiO2@C. The dial represents the etching time of SiOx yolk in NaOH solution and the brightness of the Chinese red lantern represents the electrochemical performance of the composites. When the etching time is 60&#8197;min, SiOx@TiO2@C with 30&#8197;nm void exhibits remarkable performance as an anode for lithium&#8211;ion batteries.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Dependent Interactions of Amphiphilic PiB Derivative Metal Complexes with Amyloid Peptides A&#946; and Amylin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal chelates targeted to amyloid peptides are widely explored as diagnostic tools or therapeutic agents. Such amphiphilic chelates form pre&#8208;micelles and micelles in aqueous solution. This work shows that the aggregation state strongly affects their affinity for A&#946;1&#8208;40 or amylin amyloid fibrils, present in the brain and in the pancreas, and implicated in Alzheimer's disease or diabetes, respectively.

This work shows that the aggregation state strongly affects their affinity for A&#946;&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;40&lt;/sub&gt; or amylin amyloid fibrils, present in the brain and in the pancreas, and implicated in Alzheimer's disease or diabetes, respectively. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8208;F.&#8197;Morfin, &#201;.&#8197;T&#243;th et&#8197;al.

         <title>In Situ Corrosion Fabrication of NaNbO3/Nb3O7F Heterojunctions with Optimized Band Realignment for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterostructured photocatalysis is a significant issue&#160;due to the unique band alignment, improved spectrum absorption and enhanced photocatalytic activity. However, constructing uniform, controllable and effective heterojunctions still keeps a huge challenge&#160;up to now. Herein, NaNbO3/Nb3O7F&#160;heterojunctions were fabricated by an  in situ  &#160;corrosion technique for the first time. The influence of phase transformation on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity was investigated systematically&#160;  via  &#160;the photocatalytic water splitting for H2  production. Interestingly, the band realignment and good interfacial contact endowed NaNbO3/Nb3O7F&#160;heterojunctions with higher HER activity (43.3 mmol&#8226;g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  ), about 2.4 times of pure Nb3O7F&#160;(mmol&#8226;g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  ) and 1.36 times of pure NaNbO3  (mmol&#8226;g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  ). The results&#160;may provide some new insights into the corrosion&#160;technique and HER activity&#160;of novel heterostructured&#160;catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Systematic structural characterization of chitooligosaccharides enabled by Automated Glycan Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chitin, a polymer composed of &#946;(1&#8208;4)&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;glucosamine monomers, and its partially deacetylated analogue chitosan, are abundant biopolymers with outstanding mechanical as well as elastic properties. Their degradation products, chitooligosaccharides (COS), can trigger the innate immune response in humans and plants. Both material and biological properties are dependent on polymer length, acetylation, as well as the pH. Without well&#8208;defined samples, a complete molecular description of these factors is still missing. Automated Glycan Assembly (AGA) enabled rapid access to synthetic well&#8208;defined COS. Chitin&#8208;cellulose hybrid oligomers were prepared as important tools for a systematic structural analysis. Intramolecular interactions, identified by molecular dynamics simulations and NMR analysis, underscore the importance of the chitosan amino group for the stabilization of specific geometries.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Study on the Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydrofunctionalization of Olefins Using Glycine&#8208;Extended AQ&#8208;Auxiliaries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two similar tridentate directing groups derived from glycine and 8&#8208;aminoquinoline were shown to enable the palladium&#8208;catalyzed anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of 4&#8208;pentenylamine with drastically different efficiencies. Computational investigation into the origin of the reactivity difference between these isomeric, carbonyl&#8208;transposed auxiliaries suggests that protonation state, thus charge of the substrate&#8208;metal complex prior to nucleopalladation is key. These investigations have culminated in a directing group design that can undergo Pd&#8208;catalysed hydrofunctionalization under relatively mild conditions, as low as room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine Compounds as Biocompatible Organic Photosensitizers that Generate Singlet Oxygen: A Potential Tool for Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases, however there is a continuous search for new biocompatible photosensitizers. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidine compounds are able to generate singlet oxygen species, and can act as photosensitizers in the intracellular environment. Our results show that this class of compounds absorbs and emits in the 400&#8208;500 nm region, presents low cytotoxicity in the dark, is efficiently uptaken by cells, is fluorescent in the intracellular medium, and generates singlet oxygen upon irradiation killing cancer cells within 2 h at low concentration (2.0 &#181;M). The imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrimidine compounds are a potential new tool for phototheranostics because they can be simultaneously used for fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Personalized Reusable Face Masks with Smart Nano&#8208;Assisted Destruction of Pathogens for COVID&#8208;19: a Visionary Road</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) emergency has demonstrated that the utilization of face masks plays a critical role in limiting the outbreaks. Healthcare professionals utilize masks all day long without replacing them very frequently, thus representing a source of cross&#8208;infection for patients and themselves. Nanotechnology is a powerful tool with the capability to produce nanomaterials with unique physicochemical and anti&#8208;pathogen properties. Here, we outline how to realize non&#8208;disposable and highly comfortable respirators with light&#8208;triggered self&#8208;disinfection ability by bridging bioactive nanofiber properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomaterials. The visionary road highlighted in this Concept is based on the possibility to develop a new generation of masks based on multifunctional membranes where the presence of nanoclusters and plasmonic nanoparticles arranged in a hierarchical structure enables the realization of a chemically&#8208;driven and on&#8208;demand anti&#8208;pathogen activities. Multilayer electrospun membranes have the ability to dissipate humidity present within the mask, enhancing the wearability and usability. The photo&#8208;thermal disinfected membrane is the core of these 3D printed and reusable masks with moisture pump capability. Personalized face masks with smart nano&#8208;assisted destruction of pathogens will bring enormous advantages to the entire global community, especially for front&#8208;line personnel, and will open up great opportunities for innovative medical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ditopic Chelators of Dicopper Centers for an Enhancement of Tyrosinases Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tyrosinase enzymes (Tys) are involved in the key steps of melanin (protective pigments) biosynthesis and molecules targeting the binuclear copper active site on tyrosinases represent a relevant strategy to regulate enzyme activities. In this work, we studied the possible synergic effect generated by combination of known inhibitors. For this, derivatives containing kojic acid (KA) and 2&#8208;Hydroxypyridine&#8208;  N  &#8208;oxide (HOPNO) combined with a thiosemicarbazone (TSC) moiety were synthetized. Their inhibition activities were evaluated on purified tyrosinases from different sources (mushroom, bacterial and human) as well as on melanin production by lysats from human melanoma MNT&#8208;1 cell line. Results showed significant enhancement of the inhibitory effects compared to the parent compounds, in particular for HOPNO&#8208;TSC. In order to elucidate the interaction mode with the dicopper(II) active site, we investigated the binding studies towards a tyrosinase bio&#8208;inspired model of the dicopper(II) center. The structure of the isolated adduct between one ditopic inhibitor (KA&#8208;TSC) and the model complex reveals that the binding to a dicopper center can occur with both chelating sites. Computational studies on model complexes and docking studies on enzymes led to the identification of KA and HOPNO moieties as interacting groups with the dicopper active site.</dc:description>

In cellulo click chemistry to generate highly fluorescent COX&#8208;2 imaging probes in living cells is reported in this work.







Abstract
Live&#8208;cell imaging with fluorescent probes is an essential tool in chemical biology to visualize the dynamics of biological processes in real&#8208;time. Intracellular disease biomarker imaging remains a formidable challenge due to the intrinsic limitations of conventional fluorescent probes and the complex nature of cells. This work reports the in cellulo assembly of a fluorescent probe to image cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2). We developed celecoxib&#8208;azide derivative 14, possessing favorable biophysical properties and excellent COX&#8208;2 selectivity profile. In cellulo strain&#8208;promoted fluorogenic click chemistry of COX&#8208;2&#8208;engaged compound&#8197;14 with non/weakly&#8208;fluorescent compounds&#8197;11 and 17 formed fluorescent probes&#8197;15 and 18 for the detection of COX&#8208;2 in living cells. Competitive binding studies, biophysical, and comprehensive computational analyses were used to describe protein&#8208;ligand interactions. The reported new chemical toolbox enables precise visualization and tracking of COX&#8208;2 in live cells with superior sensitivity in the visible range.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxygenation Coupling of Lignin&#8208;Derived Alcohols for Functionalized Bibenzyl Chemicals</title>

A potential new way is presented to transform abundant biomass resources into important functionalized aromatic chemicals through a short Mo&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenation coupling procedure.







Abstract
With the growing demand for sustainability and reducing CO2 footprint, lignocellulosic biomass has attracted much attention as a renewable, carbon&#8208;neutral and low&#8208;cost feedstock for the production of chemicals and fuels. To realize efficient utilization of biomass resource, it is essential to selectively alter the high degree of oxygen functionality of biomass&#8208;derivates. Herein, we introduced a novel procedure to transform renewable lignin&#8208;derived alcohols to various functionalized bibenzyl chemicals. This strategy relied on a short deoxygenation coupling pathway with economical molybdenum catalyst. A well&#8208;designed H&#8208;donor experiment was performed to investigate the mechanism of this Mo&#8208;catalyzed process. It was proven that benzyl carbon&#8208;radical was the most possible intermediate to form the bibenzyl products. It was also discovered that the para methoxy and phenolic hydroxyl groups could stabilize the corresponding radical intermediates and then facilitate to selectively obtain bibenzyl products. Our research provides a promising application to produce functionalized aromatics from biomass&#8208;derived materials.

         <title>Control of Intermolecular Photoinduced Electron Transfer in Deoxyadenosine&#8208;Based Fluorescent Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Yin and yang PET: intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET) is often responsible for fluorescence quenching of many dyes. Herein, a different scenario has emerged for our push&#8208;pull nucleosides. These fluorophores preform a ground&#8208;state complex with a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangement evidencing an intermolecularly controllable process. Ultimately, these results could help reconsider several useful dyes as well as guide the development of advanced adenine&#8208;based probes.







Abstract
In this work, we report on the Photoinduced Electron Transfer (PET) reaction between a donor (adenine analogue) and an acceptor (3&#8208;methoxychromone dye, 3MC) in the context of designing efficient fluorescent probes as DNA sensors. Firstly, Gibbs energy was investigated in disconnected donor&#8211;acceptor systems by Rehm&#8208;Weller equation. The oxidation potential of the adenine derivative was responsible for exergonicity of the PET reaction in separated combinations. Then, the PET reaction in donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor conjugates was investigated using steady&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, acid&#8208;mediated PET inhibition and transient absorption techniques. In conjugated systems, PET is a favorable pathway of fluorescent quenching when an electron&#8208;rich adenine analogue (d7A) was connected to the fluorophore (3MC). We found that formation of ground&#8208;state complexes even at nm concentration range dominated the dye photophysics and generated poorly emissive species likely through intermolecular PET from d7A to 3MC. On the other hand, solution acidification disrupts complexation and turns on the dye emission. Bridging an electron&#8208;poor adenine analogue with high oxidation potential (8&#8201;d7A) to 3MC presenting low reduction potential is another alternative to prevent complex formation and produce highly emissive monomer conjugates.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Non&#8208;Hydrolyzable Phospho&#8208;Lysine Peptide Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable mimic: This work introduces a phosphonate amino acid as a stable non&#8208;hydrolyzable mimic of phospho&#8208;lysine (pLys), which can be readily incorporated into peptides by Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis.







Abstract
The intrinsic lability of the phosphoramidate P&#8722;N bond in phosphorylated histidine (pHis), arginine (pHis) and lysine (pLys) residues is a significant challenge for the investigation of these post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), which gained attention rather recently. While stable mimics of pHis and pArg have contributed to study protein substrate interactions or to generate antibodies for enrichment as well as detection, no such analogue has been reported yet for pLys. This work reports the synthesis and evaluation of two pLys mimics, a phosphonate and a phosphate derivative, which can easily be incorporated into peptides using standard fluorenyl&#8208;methyloxycarbonyl&#8208; (Fmoc&#8208;)based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). In order to compare the biophysical properties of natural pLys with our synthetic mimics, the pKa values of pLys and analogues were determined in titration experiments applying nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in small model peptides. These results were used to compute electrostatic potential (ESP) surfaces obtained after molecular geometry optimization. These findings indicate the potential of the designed non&#8208;hydrolyzable, phosphonate&#8208;based mimic for pLys in various proteomic approaches.

         <title>The Influence of Weakly Coordinating Cations on the O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O&#8722; Hydrogen Bond of Silanol&#8208;Silanolate Anions</title>

         <dc:description>
Silanol&#8208;silanolate anions: The reactions of hydroxide salts featuring weakly coordinating cations with cyclic dimethylsiloxanes were investigated and afforded salts of the corresponding silanol&#8208;silanolate anions. The formed hydrogen bonds are strongly affected by the size and coordination ability of the cation. While cyclic [D3OH]&#8722; anions evolve in the presence of phosphazenium cations, linear polyanionic silanol&#8208;silanolate strands are formed with [NMe4]+.







Abstract
The reaction of a saline phosphazenium hydroxide hydrate with siloxanes led to a novel kind of silanol&#8208;silanolate anions. The weakly coordinating behavior of the cation renders the formation of silanol&#8208;silanolate hydrogen bonds possible, which otherwise suffer from detrimental silanolate&#8211;oxygen cation interactions. We investigated the influence of various weakly coordinating cations on silanol&#8208;silanolate motifs, particularly with regard to different cation sizes. While large cations favor the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds resulting in cyclic structures, the less bulky tetramethyl ammonium cation encourages the formation of polyanionic silanol&#8208;silanolate chains in the solid state.

A fine line: A combination of soft lithographic methods and soft templating was used to fabricate high&#8208;resolution micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSC). Surfactant&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly produces high surface area ordered mesoporous carbons. For the first time, such precursors can be printed by nano&#8208;imprint lithography as microdevices with a line width of only 250&#8197;nm and a spacing of only 1&#8197;&#956;m.







Abstract
A combination of soft lithographic printing and soft templating has been used to fabricate high&#8208;resolution interdigitated micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSC). Surfactant&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly produces high surface area ordered mesoporous carbons (490&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1). For the first time, such precursors have been printed by nano&#8208;imprint lithography as microdevices with a line width of only 250&#8197;nm and a spacing of only 1&#8197;&#956;m. The devices are crack&#8208;free with low specific resistance (1.2&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;&#937;m) and show good device capacitance up to 0.21&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3.

         <title>Advances in Electrochemical Decarboxylative Transformation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical decarboxylation of carboxylic acids has become a significant method in electro&#8208;organic synthesis which allows a one&#8208;step carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation as well as other heteroatom bond formation such as C&#8722;N, C&#8722;O, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;halogen under mild conditions. This Minireview discusses the current progress in electrochemical decarboxylation reactions and gives a detailed overview of useful organic transformations of various carboxylic acids with excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Owing to their non&#8208;toxic, stable, inexpensive properties, carboxylic acids are considered as environmentally benign alternatives as coupling partners in various organic transformations. Electrochemical mediated decarboxylation of carboxylic acid has emerged as a new and efficient methodology for the construction of carbon&#8208;carbon or carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds. Compared with transition&#8208;metal catalysis and photoredox catalysis, electro&#8208;organic decarboxylative transformations are considered as a green and sustainable protocol due to the absence of chemical oxidants and strong bases. Further, it exhibits good tolerance with various functional groups. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent advances and discoveries on the electrochemical decarboxylative transformations on C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatoms bond formations.

         <title>Controlled Shape&#8211;Evolution of Pure&#8208;MOF 1D&#8208;Microcrystals towards Efficient Waveguide and Laser Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MOF&#8208;based one&#8208;dimensional materials have received increasing attention in nanophotonics field, but it is still diffcult in the flexible shape&#8211;evolution of MOF micro/nanocrystals for desired optical functionalities due to the susceptible solvothermal growth process. Herein, we report on the well&#8208;controlled shape&#8211;evolution of pure&#8208;MOF microcrystals with optical waveguide and lasing performances based on a bottom&#8208;up &amp; top&#8208;down synergistic method. The MOF microcrystals from solvethermol synthesis (bottom&#8208;up) enable to evolve from microrods via microtubes to nanowires through a chelating agent&#8208;assisted etching process (top&#8208;down). The three types of MOF 1D&#8208;microstructures with high crystallinity and smooth surfaces all exhibit efficient optical waveguide performance. Furthermore, MOF nanowire with lowest propagation loss served as low&#8208;threshold pure&#8208;MOF nanolasers with Fabry&#8722;P&#233;rot resonance. These results advance the fundamental understanding on the controlled MOF evolution mechanism, and offer a valuable route for the development of pure&#8208;MOF&#8208;based photonic components with desired functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Photo&#8208;electrochemical Performance of RuII&#8208;Sensitized Two&#8208;Dimensional MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Change function: Dye&#8208;sensitized two&#8208;dimensional MoS2 was assembled for light&#8208;driven hydrogen production. The photovoltage generation and catalytic activity of these systems can be systematically tuned through modulating the structure of dye and the degree of covalent functionalization.







Abstract
Covalently tethering photosensitizers to catalytically active 1T&#8208;MoS2 surfaces holds great promise for the solar&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report the preparation of two new RuII&#8208;complex&#8208;functionalized MoS2 hybrids [RuII(bpy)2(phen)]&#8208;MoS2 and [RuII(bpy)2(py)Cl]&#8208;MoS2. The influence of covalent functionalization of chemically exfoliated 1T&#8208;MoS2 with coordinating ligands and RuII complexes on the HER activity and photo&#8208;electrochemical performance of this dye&#8208;sensitized system was studied systematically. We find that the photo&#8208;electrochemical performance of this RuII&#8208;complex&#8208;sensitized MoS2 system is highly dependent on the surface extent of photosensitizers and the catalytic activity of functionalized MoS2. The latter was strongly affected by the number and the kind of functional groups. Our results underline the tunability of the photovoltage generation in this dye&#8208;sensitized MoS2 system by manipulation of the surface functionalities, which provides a practical guidance for smart design of future dye&#8208;sensitized MoS2 hydrogen production devices towards improved the photofuel conversion efficiency.

         <title>How Oriented External Electric Fields Modulate Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A judiciously oriented external electric field (OEEF) can catalyze a wide range of reactions and can even induce&#160;endo/exostereoselectivity of cycloaddition reactions. We study the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride using quantitative activation strain and Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory to pinpoint the origin of these catalytic and stereoselective effects. Our quantitative model reveals that an OEEF along the reaction axis induces an enhanced electrostatic and orbital interaction between the reactants, which in turn lowers the reaction barrier. The stronger electrostatic interaction originates from an increased electron density difference between the reactants at the reactive center, while the enhanced orbital interaction arises from the promoted normal electron demand donor&#8211;acceptor interaction driven by the OEEF. An OEEF perpendicular to the plane of the reaction axis solely stabilizes the&#160;exo&#160;pathway of this reaction while the&#160;endo&#160;pathway remains unaltered and efficiently steers the&#160;endo/exo&#160;stereoselectivity. Furthermore, we have also investigated the influence of OEEFs on the inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, which, unexpectedly, inhibits the reaction, as the electric field now suppresses the critical inverse electron demand donor&#8211;acceptor interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Reactivity of a Frustrated Sn/P Lewis Pair: the Highly Selective Complexation of the cis&#8208;Azobenzene Photoisomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of the geminal frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) (F  5  C  2  )  3  Sn&#173;CH  2  &#173;P(tBu)  2  &#160;(  1  ) was explored by reacting it with a variety of small molecules (PhOCN, PhNCS, PhCCH, tBuCCH, H  3  CC(O)&#173;CH=CH  2  , Ph[C(O)]  2  Ph, PhN=NPh and Me  3  SiCHN  2  ), featuring polar or non&#8208;polar multiple bonds and/or represent &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated systems. While most adducts are formed readily, the binding of azobenzene requires UV&#8208;induced photoisomerization, which results in the highly selective complexation of cis&#8208;azobenzene. In case of benzil, the reac&#173;tion does not lead to the expected 1,2&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;addition products, but to the non&#8208;stereoselective (tBu)  2  PCH  2  &#8208;transfer to a prochiral keto func&#173;tion of benzil. All adducts of  1  were characterised by means of multi&#173;nuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analyses and X&#8209;ray diffraction experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni2P Nanoalloy as an Air&#8208;Stable and Versatile Hydrogenation Catalyst in Water: P&#8208;Alloying Strategy for Designing Smart Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based hydrogenation catalysts have limited practical applications because they exhibit low activity, require harsh reaction conditions, and are unstable in air. To overcome these limitations, herein we propose the alloying of non&#8208;noble metal nanoparticles with phosphorus as a promising strategy for developing smart catalysts that exhibit both excellent activity and air stability. We synthesized a novel nickel phosphide nanoalloy (nano&#8208;Ni2P) with coordinatively unsaturated Ni active sites. Unlike conventional air&#8208;unstable non&#8208;noble metal catalysts, nano&#8208;Ni2P retained its metallic nature in air, and exhibited a high activity for the hydrogenation of various substrates with polar functional groups, such as aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, and nitroarenes to the desired products in excellent yields in water. Furthermore, the used nano&#8208;Ni2P catalyst was easy to handle in air and could be reused without pretreatment, providing a simple and clean catalyst system for general hydrogenation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalency in Actinide Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalency in actinides has emerged as a resounding research topic on account of the technological importance in separating minor actinides from lanthanides for spent nuclear fuel processing, and utilization of their distinct bonding properties has been realized as a route towards overcoming this challenge. Because of the&#160; limited radial extent of the 4  f  orbitals , there is almost no 4  f  &#160;electron participation in bonding in lanthanides; this is not the case for the actinides, which have extended 5  f  &#160;orbitals that are capable of overlapping with ligand orbitals, although not to the degree of overlap as in the&#160;  d  &#160;orbitals of transition metals. In this concept paper, we provide a general description of covalency in actinide compounds. After introducing two main approaches to enhance covalency, either by exploiting increased orbital overlap or decreasing energy differences between the orbitals causing orbital energy degeneracy, we show the current state of the field using several examples from the recent literature. We will conclude by proposing the use of actinide chalcogenides as a convenient auxiliary tool to study covalency in actinide compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Electro&#8208;oxidative selective esterification of methylarenes and benzaldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mild and green electro&#8208;oxidative protocol to construct aromatic esters from methylarenes and alcohols is herein reported. Importantly, the reaction is free of metals, chemical oxidants, bases, acids, and operates at room temperature. Moreover, the design of the electrolyte was found critical for the oxidation state and structure of the coupling products, a rarely documented effect. This electro&#8208;oxidative coupling process also displays exceptional tolerance of many fragile easily oxidized functional groups such as hydroxyl, aldehyde, olefin, alkyne, as well as neighboring benzylic positions. The enantiomeric enrichment of some chiral alcohols is moreover preserved during this electro&#8208;oxidative coupling reaction, making it overall a promising synthetic tool.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the multi C&#8208;H functionalization reaction of carbazole heterocycles with diazoalkanes. We show that gold catalysts play a distinct role in enabling a multiple CH functionalization reaction to introduce up to six carbene fragments onto molecules containing multiple carbazole units or to link multiple carbazole units in one molecule. A one&#8208;pot, stepwise approach enables the introduction of two different carbene fragments to allow for orthogonal deprotection and straightforward derivatization.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Propionate&#8208;Derived&#160;Trisubstituted Alkene Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new method for constructing propionate&#8208;derived trisubstituted alkene motifs in a stereoselective manner. 1&#8208;Substituted 1,1&#8208;di(pinacolatoboryl)&#8208;(E)&#8208;alk&#8208;2&#8208;enes are in situ generated from 1&#8208;substituted 1,1&#8208;di(pinacolatoboryl)alk&#8208;3&#8208;enes through ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed double&#8208;bond transposition. These species undergo a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed allylation reaction of aldehydes to produce the E isomers of anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols. On the other hand, the corresponding Z isomers of anti&#8208;homoallylic alcohols are obtained when a dimeric palladium(I) complex is employed as the catalyst for this double&#8208;bond transposition. Thus, both E and Z isomers can be synthesized from the same starting materials. A B&#8211;C(sp2) bond remaining with the allylation product undergoes the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction to furnish a propionate&#8208;derived trisubstituted alkene motif in a stereo&#8208;defined form. The present method to construct the motifs with (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;alkenes are successfully applied to the syntheses of (+)&#8208;isotrichostatic acid, (&#8211;)&#8208;isotrichostatin RK, and (+)&#8208;trichostatic acid, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Based Pharmacophore Inhibits Intracellular MYC Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct targeting of intrinsically disordered proteins, including MYC by small&#8208;molecules for biomedical applications will resolve a longstanding issue in chemical biology and medicine. Thus, we developed gold&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule MYC reagents that engage MYC inside cells and modulate MYC transcriptional activity. Lead compounds comprise an affinity ligand and a gold(I) or gold(III) warhead capable of protein chemical modification. Cell&#8208;based MYC target engagement studies via CETSA and co&#8208;immunoprecipitation reveal specific interaction of compounds with MYC in cells. The lead gold(I) reagent,&#160;1, demonstrates superior cell&#8208;killing potential (up to 35&#8208;fold) in a MYC&#8208;dependent manner when compared to 10058&#8208;F4 in cells including, the TNBC, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231. Subsequently,&#160;1suppresses MYC transcription factor activity via functional colorimetric assays, and gene&#8208;profiling using whole&#8208;cell transcriptomics reveals significant modulation of MYC target genes by&#160;1. These findings point to metal&#8208;mediated ligand affinity chemistry (MLAC) based on gold as a promising strategy to develop chemical probes and anticancer therapeutics targeting MYC.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;mediated base pairs have widespread applications, such as in DNA&#8208;metal nanodevices and sensors. Here, we focused on their sugar conformation in duplexes and observed the crystallographic structure of the non&#8208;canonical DNA/DNA duplex containing 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;methylene bridged nucleic acid in the presence of AgI ions. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure was successfully obtained at a resolution of 1.5 &#197;. A novel type of AgI&#8208;mediated base pair between the N1 positions of  anti&#8208;conformation of adenines in the duplex was observed. In the central non&#8208;canonical region, a hexad nucleobase structure containing AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs between the N7 positions of guanines was formed. A highly bent non&#8208;canonical structure was formed at the origin of AgI&#8208;mediated base pairs in the central region. The bent duplex structure induced by the addition of AgI  ions might become a powerful tool for dynamic structural changes in DNA nanotechnology applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Promoted Fluorination Reactions of &#945;&#8208;Bromoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report silver&#8208;promoted C&#8211;F bond formation in  &#945;  &#8208;bromoamides by using Ag&#8211;F under mild conditions. This simple method enables access to tertiary, secondary, and primary alkyl fluorides involving biomolecular scaffolds. This transformation is available to primary and secondary amides and revealed a broad functional group tolerance. Kinetic experiments exhibited that the reaction rate increased in the order of 3&#176;&gt;2&#176;&gt;1&#176;  &#945;  &#8208;carbon. In addition, we found that the acidic amide proton has an important role to accelerate the reaction. Mechanistic studies suggested that the generation of an aziridinone intermediate that undergoes subsequent nucleophilic addition to form the C&#8211;F bond with the stereospecificity (i.e. retention of configuration). We also demonstrated the synthesis of hindered alcohols and ethers by using Ag(I). Examples of reacting of &#945;  &#8208;  bromoamides with  O  &#8208;nucleophiles were presented.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Strain relief of oxetanes offers a plethora of opportunities for the synthesis of chiral alcohols and ethers. In this context, enantioselective desymmetrization has been identified as a powerful tool to construct molecular complexity and this has led to the development of elegant strategies on the basis of transition metal, Lewis acid, and Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis. This review highlights recent examples that harness the inherent reactivity of prochiral oxetanes and offers an outlook on the immense possibilities for synthetic application.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Spin&#8208;Correlated Radical Pairs with Donor&#8722;Acceptor Dyads: A New Concept to Generate Reduced Metal Complexes for More Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;electron reduced metal complexes derived from photoactive ruthenium or iridium complexes are important intermediates for substrate activation steps in photoredox catalysis and for the photocatalytic generation of solar fuels. However, owing to the heavy atom effect, direct photochemical pathways to these key intermediates suffer from intrinsic efficiency problems resulting from rapid geminate recombination of radical pairs within the so&#8208;called solvent cage. In this study, we prepared and investigated molecular dyads capable of producing reduced metal complexes via an indirect pathway relying on a sequence of energy and electron transfer processes between a Ru complex and a covalently connected anthracene moiety. Our test reaction to establish the proof of concept is the photochemical reduction of ruthenium(tris)bipyridine by the ascorbate dianion as sacrificial donor in aqueous solution. The photochemical key step in the Ru&#8208;anthracene dyads is the reduction of a purely organic (anthracene) triplet excited state by the ascorbate dianion, yielding a spin&#8208;correlated radical pair whose (unproductive) recombination is strongly spin&#8208;forbidden. By carrying out detailed laser flash photolysis investigations, we provide clear evidence for the indirect reduced metal complex generation mechanism and show that this pathway can outperform the conventional direct metal complex photoreduction. The further optimization of our approach involving relatively simple molecular dyads might result in novel photocatalysts that convert substrates with unprecedented quantum yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Termination Layer Dominating the Moisture Degradation Pathway in CH3NH3PbI3 Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Theoretical studies have disclosed that the surface terminations such as MAI&#8208; or PbI&#8208;layers affect greatly on the environmental stability of organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite. However, until now, there have been rarely direct evidence trying to experimentally detect the existence of MAI or PbI terminations on MAPbI3  grains, let along disclosing their effects on the humidity degradation pathway of perovskite solar cell. Here, we successfully modified and detected the surface terminations of MAI and PbI species on the polycrystalline MAPbI3  films. For the MAI&#8208;terminated perovskite film, it followed the moisture degradation process from MAPbI3  to hydrate MAPbI3&#183;H2O and then into PbI2, penetration of water molecules was the main driving force to lead the degradation of MAPbI3  layer by layer. While, for the PbI&#8208;terminated perovskite film in humidity, a deprotonation degradation pathway was confirmed, in which it preferred to directly degrade from MAPbI3  into PbI2, while the iodine defects here played a key role in promoting the dissociation of water molecules into hydroxyl OH&#8208;  and further catalyzing the decomposition of perovskite.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of [UO2Cl2(THF)3] with 3 equiv of LiC6Cl5 in Et2O resulted in the formation of first uranyl aryl complex [Li(Et2O)2(THF)][UO2(C6Cl5)3] ([Li][1]) in good yields. Subsequent dissolution of [Li][1] in THF resulted in conversion to [Li(THF)4][UO2(C6Cl5)3(THF)] ([Li][2]), also in good yields. DFT calculations reveal that the U&#8208;C bonds in [Li][1] and [Li][2] exhibit appreciable covalency. Additionally, the 13C chemical shifts for their Cipso environments are strongly affected by spin&#8208;orbit coupling &#8722; a consequence of 5f orbital participation in the U&#8208;C bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Chemiluminescent Formaldehyde Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A first&#8208;generation pair of chemiluminescent formaldehyde (FA) probes&#160;(CFAP540 and CFAP700) was reported recently. CFAP540 and CFAP700 with high selectivity and sensitivity to FA, are respectively suitable in cell and in vivo. Experimentalists have confirmed that both probes utilize a general 2&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope FA&#8208;reactive trigger and a chemiluminogenic phenoxydioxetane scaffold. The mechanism and detailed process of CFAP chemiluminescence (CL) remain largely unknown. In the present paper, we performed (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations on the entire reaction process of CFAP540 with FA to produce CL. The calculations elucidated the CL producing process: FA initiates the decomposition of CFAP540 by dehydration condensation, and a phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane is formed through a series of reactions of aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, hydrolysis of imine, and &#946;&#8208;elimination of alkoxyl group. Afterwards, the produced phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane decomposes to produce m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative at the first singlet state (S1) via two crossings between potential energy surfaces of the ground state (S0) and S1 state. This m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative was assigned to the light emitter of the CFAP540 CL. The CL producing process and assignment of the light emitter of CFAP700 CL are similar with the corresponding ones of CFAP540. By analyzing the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture of the light emitters of CFAP540 and CFAP700, we theoretically designed a series of CFAPs and proposed a scheme to modulate their CL from visible to near&#8208;infrared region by adjusting the length and structure of the &#960;&#8208;bridge.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Unsymmetrical Dithioacetals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dithioacetals are a frequently used motif in synthetic organic chemistry and have recently seen increasing attention as structural motif in promising antiviral agents against plant pathogens. Most existing reports, however, only discuss symmetrical dithioacetals. Examples of mixed dithioacetals are scarce and no general method for the selective synthesis of these compounds exists. Herein, we present a synthetically simple general one&#8208;step protocol for the synthesis of a broad range of unsymmetrical dithioacetals consisting of one aromatic and one aliphatic thiol moiety from the corresponding aldehyde/thiol mixture. The mixed  S  ,  S  &#8208;acetals are obtained is high yields and a great variety of functional groups is tolerated. Kinetic control enables an excellent selectivity in regard to the unsymmetrical dithioacetal.</dc:description>

         <title>D&#8208;A Interactions Induced Interfacial Synthesis of Ultrathin Fluoric Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer via Photochemical [2 + 2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) have attracted much interest due to their unique 2D atomic&#8208;thick covalent network with periodically linked monomers. The preparation of mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layered 2DPs with highly ordered structures is still a big challenge. Here, we report a preparation of ultrathin 2DP film based on photo&#8208;triggered [2 + 2] cycloaddition at the air/water interface. The pre&#8208;assembly process induced by the D&#8208;A interactions before the polymerization plays a key role in constructing highly ordered structure. The precise structure and chemical compositions of the continuous 2DP films were proved by selected area electron diffraction (SAED), tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) and molecular&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based structural simulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Functionalized Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Efficient Metal&#8208;Free Disinfection of Escherichia Coli under Low&#8208;Power Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Universal&#160;access to clean water has been the global ambition over the years. Photocatalytic water disinfection via advanced oxidation processes has been regarded as one of the promising methods in breaking down microbials. The forefront of this research focuses on the application of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for disinfection to prevent secondary pollution. Graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) has achieved instant notoriety as a metal&#8208;free and visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalyst for various energy and environmental applications. However, the efficiency of g&#8208;C3N4  in photocatalysis is still affected by its rapid charge recombination and sluggish electron transfer kinetics. In this contribution, two&#8208;dimensional protonated g&#8208;C3N4  was employed as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for water treatment and demonstrated 100% disinfection of  Escherichia coli  within 4 h under 23 W light bulb irradiation. The introduction of protonation can modulate the surface charge of g&#8208;C3N4  which enhance its conductivity and provide a &#8220;highway&#8221; for the delocalization of electrons. This work highlights the potential of conjugated polymer in antibacterial application.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The control of C3/N1 chemo&#8208;selectivity with the same electrophiles is still challenging in the indole alkylation. A Rh/bisoxazolinephosphine&#8208;catalyzed chemodivergent regio&#8208; and enantioselective allylic alkylation of unbiased indoles has been developed. Chiral C3&#8208; and N1&#8208;allylindoles can be selectively obtained in high branch/linear ratio and up to 99% ee by changing the counter anions of Rh, allylic carbonates, reaction temperatures and ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Aerobic Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Salicylaldehydic Cformyl&#8211;H Arylations with Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a challenging copper&#8208;catalyzed Cformyl&#8722;H arylation of salicylaldehydes with arylboronic acids, which involves unique salicylaldehydic copper&#8208;species differing from reported salicylaldehydic rhodacycle and palladacycle. Also, this protocol has high chemoselectivity for the Cformyl&#8722;H bond compared to the phenolic O&#8722;H bond involving copper catalysis under high reaction temperature. This approach is compatible with a wide range of salicylaldehyde and arylboronic acid substrates, including estrone and carbazole derivatives, which leads to corresponding arylation products. Mechanistic studies show that 2&#8208;hydroxy group of salicylaldehyde substrate triggers the formation of salicylaldehydic copper complexes via Cu(I)/Cu(II)/Cu(III) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An effcient approach to the type III lepadin alkaloids (lepadins F and G) has been developed via a key Diels&#8722;Alder reaction, in which a novel ketolactone&#8208;type dienophile with chiral diol unit is employed to generate the desirable all&#8208;cis&#8208;trisubstituted cyclohexene in excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity control. The subsequent selective sulfonylation of the diol unit followed by S N  2 cyclization under hydrogenation conditions could construct the substituted piperidine ring.

         <title>Ferrous to ferric transition in Fe&#8208;phthalocyanine driven by NO2 exposure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to its unique magnetic properties offered by the open&#8208;shell electronic structure of the central metal ion, and for being an effective catalyst in a wide variety of reactions, iron phthalocyanine has drawn significant interest from the scientific community. Nevertheless, upon surface deposition, the magnetic properties of the molecular layer can be significantly affected by the coupling occurring at the interface, and the more reactive the surface, the stronger is the impact on the spin state. Here we show that on Cu(100), indeed, the strong hybridization between the Fe  d  &#8208;states of FePc and the  sp  band of the copper substrate modifies the charge distribution in the molecule, significantly influencing the magnetic properties of the iron ion. The Fe  II  ion is stabilized in the low singlet spin state (S=0), leading to the complete quenching of the molecule&#8217;s magnetic moment. By exploiting the FePc/Cu(100) interface, we demonstrate that NO  2  dissociation can be used to gradually change the magnetic properties of the iron ion, by trimming the gas dosage. For lower doses, the FePc film is decoupled from the copper substrate, restoring the gas phase triplet spin state (S=1). A higher dose induces the transition from ferrous to ferric phthalocyanine, in its intermediate spin state, with enhanced magnetic moment due to the interaction with the atomic ligands. Remarkably, in this way, three different spin configurations have been observed within the same metalorganic/metal interface by exposing it to different doses of NO  2  at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Easy Access to Enantiomerically Pure Heterocyclic Silicon&#8208;Chiral Phosphonium Cations and the Matched/Mismatched Case of Dihydrogen Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphonium ions are widely used in preparative organic synthesis and catalysis. The provision of new types of cations that contain both functional and chiral information is a major synthetic challenge and can open up new horizons in asymmetric cation&#8208;directed and Lewis acid catalysis. We discovered an efficient methodology towards new Si&#8208;chiral four&#8208;membered CPSSi* heterocyclic cations. Three synthetic approaches are presented. The stereochemical sequence of anchimerically assisted cation formation with B(C6F5)3 and subsequent hydride addition was fully elucidated and proceeds with excellent preservation of the chiral information at the stereogenic silicon atom. Also the mechanism of dihydrogen release from a protonated hydrosilane was studied in detail by the help of Si&#8208;centered chirality as stereochemical probe. Chemoselectivity switch (dihydrogen release vs. protodesilylation) can easily be achieved through slight modifications of the solvent. A matched/mismatched case was identified and the intermolecularity of this reaction supported by spectroscopic, kinetic, deuterium labeling experiments, and quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring expansion of thiolactams via imide intermediates: an amino acid insertion strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Ag(I)&#8208;promoted reaction of thiolactams with N&#8208;Boc amino acids yields an N&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;aminoacyl) lactam that can rearrange through an acyl transfer process. Boc&#8208;deprotection results in convergence to the ring&#8208;expanded adduct, thereby facilitating an overall insertion of an amino acid into the thioamide bond to generate medium&#8208;sized heterocycles. Application to the site&#8208;specific insertion of amino acids into cyclic peptides is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>seco&#8208;Labdanes: a Study of Terpenoid Structural Diversity Resulting from Biosynthetic C&#8211;C Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cleavage of a C&#8211;C bond is a complexity generating process which complements oxidation and cyclisation events in the biosynthesis of terpenoids.&#160;This process leads to increased structural diversity in a cluster of related secondary metabolites by modification of the parent carbocyclic core. In this review, we highlight the diversifying effect of C&#8211;C bond cleavage by examining the literature related to&#160;seco&#8208;labdanes&#8212;a class of diterpenoid arising from such C&#8211;C bond cleavage events.</dc:description>

         <title>Azolium/hydroquinone organo&#8208;radical co&#8208;catalysis: Aerobic C&#8210;C&#8208;bond cleavage in ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organo&#8208;radical catalysts have recently attracted great interest, and the development of this field can be expected to broaden the applications of organocatalysis. Herein, we report the first example of a radical&#8208;generating system that does not require any photoirradiation, radical initiators, or preactivated substrates. The oxidative C&#8211;C&#8208;bond cleavage of 2&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones was achieved using an azolium salt and a hydroquinone as co&#8208;catalysts. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on the results of diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements, as well as computational studies.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Bridge Substitution in DASAs: the Subtle Equilibrium Between Photochemical Improvements and Thermal Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) are playing an outstanding role as innovative and versatile photoswitches. Until now, all the efforts have been spent on modifying donor and acceptor moieties, to modulate the absorption energy and improve the cyclization and reversion kinetics. However, there is a strong dependence on specific structural modifications and a lack of predictive behavior, mostly due to the complex photoswitching mechanism. Here, by means of a combined experimental and theoretical study, we systematically explore the effect of chemical modification of the &#960;&#8208;bridge linking the donor and acceptor moieties, finding significant impact on the absorption, photocyclization and relative stability of the open form. Especially, a position along the &#960;&#8208;bridge is found to be the most suited to red&#8208;shift the absorption while preserving cyclization. However, thermal back&#8208;reaction to the initial isomer is blocked. These effects are explained in terms of an increased acceptor capability offered by the &#960;&#8208;bridge substituent that can be modulated. This strategy opens the path toward derivatives with infra&#8208;red absorption and a potential anchoring point for further functionalization.</dc:description>
