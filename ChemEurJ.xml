         <title>Nonbonding/Bonding Molecular Orbital Regulation of Nitrogen&#8211;Boron&#8211; Oxygen&#8208;embedded Blue/Green Multiresonant TADF Emitters with High Efficiency and Color Purity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we synthesized and characterized multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials embedded with nitrogen&#8211;boron&#8211;oxygen (N&#8211;B&#8211;O), exhibiting colortunability between blue and green, namely NBO , m&#8208;DiNBO , and p&#8208;DiNBO . The three emitter materials showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 96%/25 nm, 87%/17 nm, and 99%/19 nm, respectively. For m&#8208;DiNBO and p&#8208;DiNBO , the emission color could be tuned from blue to green by regulating the nonbonding/bonding molecular orbital characters. Owing to the expanded planar molecular structure, m&#8208;DiNBO and p&#8208;DiNBO showed high horizontal dipole ratio (&#920;) of 88% and 92%, respectively. OLEDs were prepared with NBO , m&#8208;DiNBO, and p&#8208;DiNBO , exhibiting high external quantum efficiencies of 16.8%, 24.2%, and 21.6%, respectively. NBO and m&#8208;DiNBO exhibited pure&#8208;blue emission with CIE coordinates of (0.137, 0.142) and (0.126, 0.098), respectively. p&#8208;DiNBO showed pure&#8208;green emission with a CIE coordinate of (0.258, 0.665).</dc:description>

         <title>Utility of 2&#8208;Diphenylphosphoryloxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;Dienes in Multicomponent Hetero&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions to Construct Functionalized Six&#8208;Membered Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>

2&#8208;Diphenylphosphoryloxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes participate in three&#8208;component, BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2&#8208;promoted hetero&#8208;Diels Alder reactions with aldehydes and protected amines to produce functionalized piperidenes. The advantages of this method include the stability of the enol phosphate functional group in both the 1,3&#8208;diene starting material and in the cycloaddition product, its ease of use as no special solvent or atmosphere manipulations are required, and the synthetic usefulness of the enol phosphate functional group as an electrophilic cross&#8208;coupling partner after the cycloaddition.







Abstract
The utility of 2&#8208;diphenylphosphoryloxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes for the construction of substituted six&#8208;membered nitrogen heterocycles is presented. These dienes undergo boron trifluoride&#8208;promoted aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reactions when reacted with imines or related species formed in&#8197;situ using aldehydes and amine derivatives. The stability of the dienes allows this three&#8208;component reaction to be carried out with no special precautions to eliminate water or air. Thirty&#8208;one examples of this process are presented. The usefulness of the enol phosphate functional group is highlighted in further reactions after the cycloaddition step to generate functionalized piperidenes or pyridines.

         <title>H2, B&#8211;H, and Si&#8211;H bond activation and facile protonolysis driven by Pt&#8722;base metal cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a series of heterobimetallic Pt/Zn and Pt/Ca complexes to study the effect of proximity of a dicationic base metal on the organometallic Pt species. Varying degrees of Pt&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Zn and Zn interaction with the bridging Me group are achieved, showcasing snapshots of a hypothetical process of retrotransmetalation from Pt to Zn. In contrast, only weak interactions were observed for Ca with a Pt&#8208;bound Me group. Activation of H 2  , B&#8211;H and Si&#8211;H bonds leads to the formation of hydride&#8208;bridged Pt&#8211;H&#8211;Zn complexes, which is not observed in the absence of Zn, pointing out the importance of metal&#8208;metal cooperation. Reactivity of PtMe 2  /M 2+  with terminal acetylene, water and methanol is also studied, leading to facile protonation of one of the Me group at the Pt center only when Zn is present. This study sheds light at various ways in which the presence of a 2+ metal cation significantly affects the reactivity of a common organoplatinum complex.</dc:description>

Small rings: The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from &#945;&#8208;substituted allyl sulfones is described. The methodology, using &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates or diacceptor diazo reagents, catalyzed by a chiral rhodium complex furnished the corresponding cyclopropanes in high yields with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enatioselectivities.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of highly functionalized cyclopropanes from &#945;&#8208;substituted allyl sulfones and silanes is reported. The reaction, using &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoacetates or diacceptor diazo reagents, catalyzed by a chiral rhodium complex (Rh2((S)&#8208;BTPCP)4), furnished the corresponding cyclopropanes in moderate to high yields (27&#8211;97&#8201;%), high diastereoselectivities (68&#8201;:&#8201;32 to 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 d.r.) and moderate to excellent ee (40&#8211;99&#8201;%). This methodology offers a privileged access to an underexplored class of enantioenriched cyclopropanes with a high level of functionality, an asset for further post&#8208;functionalization and their incorporation into more complex structure.

         <title>Binding of VIVO2+, VIVOL, VIVOL2 and VVO2L Moieties to Proteins: X&#8208;ray/Theoretical Characterization and Biological Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pharmacologically active VIVOL2 complexes (L=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, picolinato) undergo hydrolysis, exchange of ligands, and redox processes to form VIVOL2/VIVOL/VVO2L/VIVO2+&#8722;protein adducts with lysozyme and trypsin, with the binding of Asp, Asn, and Ser residues, that might contribute to their biological activity. X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational studies suggest the critical role of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and microsolvation in the stabilization of these structures.







Abstract
Vanadium compounds have frequently been proposed as therapeutics, but their application has been hampered by the lack of information on the different V&#8208;containing species that may form and how these interact with blood and cell proteins, and with enzymes. Herein, we report several resolved crystal structures of lysozyme with bound VIVO2+ and VIVOL2+, where L=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), and of trypsin with VIVO(picolinato)2 and VVO2(phen)+ moieties. Computational studies complete the refinement and shed light on the relevant role of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and microsolvation in stabilizating the structure. Noteworthy is that the trypsin&#8722;VVO2(phen) and trypsin&#8722;VIVO(OH)(phen) adducts correspond to similar energies, thus suggesting a possible interconversion under physiological/biological conditions. The obtained data support the relevance of hydrolysis of VIV and VV complexes in the several types of binding established with proteins and the formation of different adducts that might contribute to their pharmacological action, and significantly widen our knowledge of vanadium&#8211;protein interactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pharmacologically active&lt;/b&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;OL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complexes (L=2,2&#8217;-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline, picolinato) undergo hydrolysis, exchange of ligands, and redox processes to form V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;OL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;OL/V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L/V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;protein adducts with lysozyme and trypsin, with the binding of Asp, Asn, and Ser residues, that might contribute to their biological activity. X-ray diffraction and computational studies suggest the critical role of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and microsolvation in the stabilization of these structures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanadium compounds have frequently been proposed as therapeutics, but their application has been hampered by the lack of information on the different V-containing species that may form and how these interact with blood and cell proteins, and with enzymes. Herein, we report several resolved crystal structures of lysozyme with bound V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;OL&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, where L=2,2&#8217;-bipyridine or 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), and of trypsin with V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(picolinato)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(phen)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; moieties. Computational studies complete the refinement and shed light on the relevant role of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and microsolvation in stabilizating the structure. Noteworthy is that the trypsin&#8722;V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(phen) and trypsin&#8722;V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;O(OH)(phen) adducts correspond to similar energies, thus suggesting a possible interconversion under physiological/biological conditions. The obtained data support the relevance of hydrolysis of V&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; and V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; complexes in the several types of binding established with proteins and the formation of different adducts that might contribute to their pharmacological action, and significantly widen our knowledge of vanadium&#8211;protein interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Driving the Active Site Incorporation in Zeolitic Materials via the Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent Through Development of H&#8208;Bonds with Hydroxyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(1S,2S)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pseudoephedrine used as organic structure&#8208;directing agent for the synthesis of Mg&#8208;doped aluminophosphates is able to control the spatial distribution of low&#8208;valent dopants through the development of H&#8208;bonds with MgO4 tetrahedra, providing a new strategy for controlling the active site spatial distribution in zeolite catalysts.







Abstract
(1S,2S)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;pseudoephedrine (MPS) was used as organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) for the synthesis of Mg&#8208;doped nanoporous aluminophosphates. This molecule displays a particular conformational behavior, where the presence of H&#8208;bond donor and acceptor groups provide a rigid conformational space with one asymmetric conformation preferentially occurring. MPS drives the crystallization of Mg&#8208;containing AFI materials. Characterization of these materials shows that the OSDA incorporate as protonated species, arranged as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail monomers. Combination of three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction with high&#8208;resolution synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction allowed to locate both the Mg and the organic species. Interestingly, results showed that the spatial incorporation of Mg is driven by the hydroxyl groups of the organic cation through the development of H&#8208;bonds with negatively&#8208;charged MgO4 tetrahedra. This work demonstrates that H&#8208;bond forming groups can be used to drive the spatial incorporation of low&#8208;valent dopants within zeolitic frameworks, a highly desired aim in order to control their catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented method allows the preparation of ipso&#8208;phosphonodifluoromethylarenes utilizing a heterobimetallic catalytic system of nickel and copper. The protocol represents an advantage over traditional palladium catalysed Suzuki coupling due to the short reaction times and the use of earth&#8208;abundant metals.







Abstract
A convenient method for the direct ipso&#8208;phosphonodifluoromethylation of arylboronic acids via nickel&#8208;copper co&#8208;catalysis is disclosed. This work, which utilizes inexpensive first row transition metals, represents a facile alternative to the traditional palladium catalyzed approach. The method utilizes inexpensive commodity chemicals and substrates while tolerating a variety of biologically relevant functional groups. Structurally diverse phosphonodifluoromethylarenes are furnished in good yields under short reaction times. Control experiments to probe possible reaction pathways are also included.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of the Bioactive Fragment of Salbutamol and Derivatives in a Self&#8208;Optimizing Flow Chemistry Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a photochemical route towards an important &#946;&#8208;amino alcohol using a self&#8208;optimizing flow chemistry platform is reported in this work. The methodology enables rapid construction of 2&#8208;oxazolidinone. The key photochemical steps for the construction of the aryl vicinyl amino alcohol moiety consist of a C&#8722;C bond forming reaction followed by an unprecedented, high yielding (&gt;80&#8201;%), benzylic oxidative cyclization.







Abstract
The implementation of self&#8208;optimizing flow reactors has been mostly limited to model reactions or known synthesis routes. In this work, a self&#8208;optimizing flow photochemistry platform is used to develop an original synthesis of the bioactive fragment of Salbutamol and derivatives. The key photochemical steps for the construction of the aryl vicinyl amino alcohol moiety consist of a C&#8722;C bond forming reaction followed by an unprecedented, high yielding (&gt;80&#8201;%), benzylic oxidative cyclization.

         <title>Reactions of Mesityl Azide with Ferrocene&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Germylenes, Stannylenes and Plumbylenes, Including PPh2&#8208;Functionalised Congeners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The active PbII/P Lewis pair nature of a PPh2&#8208;functionalised ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic plumbylene is demonstrated by its reaction with mesityl azide to afford a phosphazide, which is in contrast to the inertness of the unfunctionalised congener. The lighter analogues most likely react with MesN3 at their respective tetrel atom EII, leading to the formation of N2 and an EIV=NMes unit, followed by NMes transfer from the EIV to the PIII atom.







Abstract
The reactivity of ferrocene&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic tetrylenes [{Fe(&#951;5&#8722;C5H4&#8722;NSitBuMe2)2}E] (E=Ge, Sn, Pb) towards mesityl azide (MesN3) is compared with that of PPh2&#8208;functionalised congeners exhibiting two possible reaction sites, namely the EII and PIII atom. For E=Ge and Sn the reaction occurs at the EII atom, leading to the formation of N2 and an EIV=NMes unit. The germanimines are sufficiently stable for isolation. The stannanimines furnish follow&#8208;up products, either by [2+3] cycloaddition with MesN3 or, in the PPh2&#8208;substituted case, by NMes transfer from the SnIV to the PIII atom. Whereas [{Fe(&#951;5&#8722;C5H4&#8722;NSitBuMe2)2}Pb] and other diaminoplumbylenes studied are inert even under forcing conditions, the PPh2&#8208;substituted congener forms an addition product with MesN3, thus showing a behaviour similar to that of frustrated Lewis pairs. The germylenes of this study afford copper(I) complexes with CuCl, including the first structurally characterised linear dicoordinate halogenido complex [CuX(L)] with a heavier tetrylene ligand L.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones and Secondary Amines: Breaking the Aliphatic Wall</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed methodology leads to fully aliphatic tertiary amines starting from readily available ketones and amines. This direct reductive amination transformation, fueled by hydrogen similar to a space rocket, enables access to an unprecedented chemical space with a functional group relevance compatible with active pharmaceutical ingredients. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Jouffroy, R. Gramage&#8208;Doria et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201078).

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution over Ce&#8722;Co9S8 Core&#8211;Shell Nanoneedle Arrays by Electronic and Architectural Dual Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 32, June 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based nanomaterials for catalysis: Ce&#8208;doped Co9S8 core&#8211;shell nanoneedle arrays, vertically aligned on carbon cloth (Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC) were prepared in&#8197;situ by calcining a Ce&#8722;Co(CO3)0.5OH@CC precursor. The Ce&#8208;incorporated Co9S8 active component and core&#8211;shell nanoneedle arrayed architecture give Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC a refigured electronic configuration, highly exposed active sites and multidimensional mass diffusion channels. Benefitting from these dual electronic and architectural advantages, Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity, stability and selectivity toward the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
An dual electronic and architectural engineering strategy is a good way to rationally design earth&#8208;abundant and highly efficient electrocatalysts of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for sustainable hydrogen&#8208;based energy devices. Here, a Ce&#8208;doped Co9S8 core&#8211;shell nanoneedle array (Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC) supported on a carbon cloth has been designed and developed to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the OER. Profiting from valance alternative Ce doping, a fine core&#8211;shell structure and vertically aligned nanoneedle arrayed architecture, Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC integrates modulated electronic structure, highly exposed active sites, and multidimensional mass diffusion channels; together, these afford a favorable catalyzed OER. Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC exhibits remarkable performance in the OER in an alkaline medium, where the overpotential requires only 242&#8197;mV to deliver a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the OER; this is 70&#8197;mV superior to that of Ce&#8208;free Co9S8 catalyst and other counterparts. Good stability and impressive selectivity (nearly 100&#8201;% Faradic efficiency) are also demonstrated. When integrated into a two&#8208;electrode OER//HER electrolyzer, the as&#8208;prepared Ce&#8722;Co9S8@CC displays a low operation potential of 1.54&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability, thus demonstrating great potential for economical water electrolysis.

         <title>Genuine Pores in a Stable Zinc Phosphite for High H2 Adsorption and CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 32, June 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of crystalline zinc phosphite incorporating thio&#8208;functionalized O&#8208;donor and tetradentate N&#8208;donor building blocks has been synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Interestingly, this compound possessed not only uncommon structural features but also good capture for H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, N2, and H2 gases. The possible adsorption sites are discussed, and CO2 gas selectivity at 298&#8197;K is reported.







Abstract
An uncommon example of stable mixed&#8208;ligand zinc phosphite with genuine pores has been synthesized by using zinc metal, inorganic phosphite acid, thio&#8208;functionalized O&#8208;donor (2,5&#8208;thiophenedicarboxylate, TPDC), and tetradentate N&#8208;donor [1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;ylmethyl)benzene, TIMB] units assembled into one crystalline structure according to a hydro(solvo)thermal method. This is a very rare case of a metal phosphite incorporating both N&#8208; and O&#8208;donor ligands. The tetradentate TIMB linker bound to zinc atoms of the isolated zincophosphite hexamers to form a 3D open&#8208;framework structure by crosslinking structural components of 1D chains and 2D layers. Here, the TPDC ligand acts as a monodentate binding model to functionalize its porous structure with the uncoordinated S atom and COO&#8722; group. Interestingly, this compound demonstrates the highest H2 storage capacity among organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal phosphates (and phosphites), and a good CO2 capture at 298&#8197;K compared with the majority of crystalline materials. The possible adsorption sites and selectivity for CO2 over H2, N2, and CO at 298&#8197;K were calculated by using density functional theory (DFT), the ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST), and fitting experimental pure&#8208;component adsorption data.

&lt;p&gt;An uncommon example of stable mixed-ligand zinc phosphite with genuine pores has been synthesized by using zinc metal, inorganic phosphite acid, thio-functionalized O-donor (2,5-thiophenedicarboxylate, TPDC), and tetradentate N-donor [1,2,4,5-tetrakis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene, TIMB] units assembled into one crystalline structure according to a hydro(solvo)thermal method.

         <title>First&#8208;Principles Design of Na&#8208;ion Superionic Conductors: Interstitial&#8208;Based Na Diffusion in NaCuZrS3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 32, June 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes are usually based on vacancies of diffusing ions to enhance diffusivity. NaCuZrS3 with a post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like structure exhibits an interstitial&#8208;based Na ion diffusion mechanism. The low diffusion barriers of the order of 0.22&#8197;eV in the two &#8208; dimensional interlayer channels suggest a new class of Na&#8208;ion superionic conductors for further exploration. Doping by trivalent ions (such as La) on Zr sites could help introduce Na interstitials.







Abstract
In recent years all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SS&#8208;SIBs) have drawn significant attention due to their potential to be safer and lower cost than lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the lack of sodium solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high ionic conductivity has become one of the major challenges. Here, with first&#8208;principles computation we took NaCuZrS3, consisting of earth&#8208;abundant and environmentally benign elements only, as an example to study Na&#8208;ion transport in the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like structure and used computation&#8208;guided design to improve its potential as a solid&#8208;state electrolyte. With ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and nudged elastic band calculation, we studied possible diffusion mechanisms in this material and found that Na ion interstitials have a favorable migration barrier of 0.22&#8197;eV, which is among the smallest in the literature reported values. Considering the large formation energy of Frenkel defects, we proposed doping strategy to introduce extra Na interstitials in the material. Our study suggests that the post&#8208;perovskite&#8208;like sulfides are worth of exploration for applications in SS&#8208;SIBs.

         <title>Reactions of a Four&#8208;Membered Borete with Carbon, Silicon, and Gallium Donor Ligands: Fused and Spiro&#8208;Type Boracycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 32, June 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;membered naphthalene&#8208;supported borete is investigated as a masked 1,4&#8208;dipolar donor&#8208;acceptor cyclobutane. Ring expansion reactions confirm such type of reactivity and afford complex cyclic structures including fused and spiro&#8208;type polycyclics.







Abstract
Donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes or cyclobutanes are dipolar reagents, which are widely used in the synthesis of complex organic (hetero)cycles in ring expansion reactions. Applying this concept to boron containing heterocycles, the four&#8208;membered borete cyclo&#8208;iPr2N&#8208;BC10H6 reacted with the carbon donor ligands 2,6&#8208;xylylisonitrile and the carbene IMes :C(NMesCH)2 with ring expansion and ring fusion, respectively. In particular, the tetracyclic structure formed with IMes displays zwitterionic character and absorption in the visible region. In contrast to the carbene IMes, the heavier carbenoids :Si(NDippCH)2 and :Ga(AmIm) with a two&#8208;coordinate donor atom afford spiro&#8208;type bicyclic compounds, which display four&#8208;coordinate geometry at silicon or gallium. (TD&#8208;)DFT calculations provide deeper insight into the mechanism of formation and the absorption properties of these new compounds.

         <title>A Mesoionic Diselenolene Anion and the Corresponding Radical Dianion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 32, June 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being mesoionic makes the difference: A diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties compared to a normal diselenolene is reported. Two stable redox states are accessible: a paramagnetic radical dianion and a diamagnetic monoanion. The ligand was used for the preparation of novel aluminum bis&#8208; and tris(diselenolene) complexes.







Abstract
Dichalcogenolenes are archetypal redox non&#8208;innocent ligands with numerous applications. Herein, a diselenolene ligand with fundamentally different electronic properties is described. A mesoionic diselenolene was prepared by selenation of a C2&#8208;protected imidazolium salt. This ligand is diamagnetic, which is in contrast to the paramagnetic nature of standard dichalcogenolene monoanions. The new ligand is also redox&#8208;active, as demonstrated by isolation of a stable diselenolene radical dianion. The unique electronic properties of the new ligand give rise to unusual coordination chemistry. Thus, preparation of a hexacoordinate aluminum tris(diselenolene) complex and a Lewis acidic aluminate complex with two ligand&#8208;centered unpaired electrons was achieved.

         <title>Halogenation of the Hexaphosphabenzene Complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)]: Snapshots on the Reaction Progress</title>

         <dc:description>
Snapshots on the halogenation of the hexaphosphabenzene complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] show the plethora of complexes that are formed, resulting from the initial halogenation of the P6 ligand. Among them, with iodine, a compound with six P atoms still present could be obtained, directly at room temperature. With the more aggressive bromine and chlorine, the P6 unit degrades to an allylic P3 unit but phosphorus rich compounds could also be isolated.







Abstract
The oxidation of [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] (1) with halogens or halogen sources was investigated. The iodination afforded the ionic complexes [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;P3I3)][X] (X=I3&#8722;, I&#8722;) (2) and [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;P4)(&#956;&#8208;PI2)][I3] (3), while the reaction with PBr5 led to the complexes [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;Br)2][Cp*MoBr4] (4) [(Cp*MoBr)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8208;P2Br3)] (5) and [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;&#8208;PBr2)(&#956;&#8208;PHBr)(&#956;&#8208;Br)2] (6). The reaction of 1 with the far stronger oxidizing agent PCl5 was followed via time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent 31P{1H} NMR spectroscopy. One of the first intermediates detected at 193&#8197;K was [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)2][PCl6] (8) which rearranges upon warming to [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2] (9), [(Cp*MoCl)2(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;P3)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)] (10) and [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;P4)(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)][Cp*MoCl4] (11), which could be isolated at room temperature. All complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and their electronic structures were elucidated by DFT calculations.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Star&#8208;Shaped Indoline Hole Transport Materials: The Influence of Planarity on the Hole Extraction and Transport Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 32, June 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The planarity of the side chain of star&#8208;shaped hole transport material (HTM) is systematically improved. Along with the improvement, the HOMO level of the HTM is increased, leading to enhanced hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48&#8201;%, providing us with a promising strategy for further optimization of efficient HTMs.







Abstract
As the key properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the hole extraction and transport capabilities of the hole transport material (HTM) affect the photovoltaic performance of PSCs to a considerable extent, while both capabilities can be adjusted by molecular planarity. Therefore, in this work, the molecular planarity of the HTM is systematically optimized to regulate the hole extraction and transport capabilities. Along with the improvement in planarity, the HTM&#8242;s HOMO level is increased, leading to the enhancement of hole extraction capability. Meanwhile, the hole transport capability can also be improved due to the intensification of molecular stacking during the film formation. As a result, the planar HTM achieves a relatively high efficiency of 18.48&#8201;%, which is higher than that of spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Accordingly, the molecular planarity presents an important impact on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, providing us with a promising strategy for further optimization of efficient HTMs.

         <title>Cobalt Complexes Supported by Phosphinoquinoline Ligands for the Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 32, June 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphinoquinoline cobalt(II) complexes were used for the hydrosilylation of ketones. The diisopropylphosphino containing bisliganded complex was the most efficient allowing the transformation of variously substituted aliphatic or aromatic ketones at low catalyst loading and under mild conditions. The involvement of a Co&#8722;H complex as the active species was experimentally ascertained.







Abstract
P,N phosphinoquinoline based ligands differing by the nature of the phosphorus substituent (iPr, Ph) were employed to synthesize a series of cobalt(II) complexes ([LCoBr2], [L2CoBr](PF6) and [L&#8217;2CoBr](PF6)). The latter were obtained in high yield and characterized among others by X&#8208;ray analysis and elemental analysis. Complex [L2CoBr](PF6) showed a very good catalytic activity for the hydrosilylation of various ketones. The catalysis proceeds at a low catalytic loading (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) with only 1 equivalent of Ph2SiH2 in mild conditions and was efficient with aliphatic or aromatic ketones giving moderate to excellent yields of the corresponding silylated ether.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropenes Leading to a Stereochemical Study of the Silylated gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes</title>

The copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes providing the chiral gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes is presented. The use of copper(I) chloride, chiral ligands including bidentate BINAPs and monodentate phosphoramidites, and silylborane Me2PhSi&#8208;Bpin accompanying NaOtBu in methanol was appropriate for the enantioselective hydrosilylation of the strained C=C double bond. Subsequent activation of the silyl groups in enantio&#8208;enriched gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes showed substantial reduction of the enantiopurity, indicating cleavage of the distal C&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
Optically active cyclopropanes have been widely investigated especially from the views of pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, and substituting one of the methylenes with the difluoromethylene unit should be promising for developing novel biologically relevant compounds and functional materials. In this paper, the copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes to provide the corresponding chiral gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes is presented. The use of copper(I) chloride, chiral ligands including bidentate BINAPs and monodentate phosphoramidites, and silylborane Me2PhSi&#8208;Bpin accompanying sodium tert&#8208;butoxide in methanol was appropriate for the enantioselective hydrosilylation of the strained C=C double bond, and the resultant chiral difluorinated three&#8208;membered ring was unambiguously characterized. Subsequent activation of the silyl groups in enantio&#8208;enriched gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes showed substantial reduction of the enantiopurity, indicating cleavage of the distal C&#8722;C bond leading to the transient acyclic intermediates.

         <title>Quantum Spin&#8208;1/2 Dimers in a Low&#8208;Dimensional Tetrabromocuprate Magnet</title>

Only one way: (3,4&#8208;lutH)2CuBr4 (3,4&#8208;lut=3,4&#8208;lutidine) is a homometallic spin&#8208;1/2
 tetrabromocuprate that adopts a bilayer structure with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between dimers across the bilayer and weaker intralayer ferromagnetic interactions. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this is consistent with a spin&#8208;ladder motif with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.







Abstract
This work describes a homometallic spin&#8208;
 tetrabromocuprate adopting a bilayer structure. Magnetic&#8208;susceptibility measurements show a broad maximum centred near 70&#8197;K, with fits to this data using a Heisenberg model consistent with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between neighbouring copper atoms in different layers of the bilayer. There are further weak intralayer ferromagnetic interactions between copper cations in neighbouring dimers. First&#8208;principles calculations are consistent with this, but suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this would suggest the presence of a spin ladder within the bilayer with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.

First-principles calculations suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this is consistent with a spin-ladder motif with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work describes a homometallic spin-
 tetrabromocuprate adopting a bilayer structure. Magnetic-susceptibility measurements show a broad maximum centred near 70&#8197;K, with fits to this data using a Heisenberg model consistent with strong antiferromagnetic coupling between neighbouring copper atoms in different layers of the bilayer. There are further weak intralayer ferromagnetic interactions between copper cations in neighbouring dimers. First-principles calculations are consistent with this, but suggest there is only significant magnetic coupling within one direction of a layer; this would suggest the presence of a spin ladder within the bilayer with antiferromagnetic rung and weaker ferromagnetic rail couplings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible and Stepwise Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation of a Platinum(II) Complex with Vapochromic Luminescence</title>

Out of the blue: The blue color of the luminescence of a PtII complex bearing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene changes in response to the vapor atmosphere, although the single crystallinity and luminescence intensity are maintained. The vapor&#8208;induced reversible and stepwise single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformations were elucidated by variable&#8208;temperature and continuous in&#8208;situ tracking of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements.







Abstract
The vapochromic single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation of a highly luminescent PtII complex bearing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene [Pt(CN)2(tBu&#8208;impy)] (tBu&#8208;impyH+=1&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazolium) is reported. The trihydrate form of the complex, which exhibits blue 3MMLCT emission owing to weak Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interactions, changed its luminescence color from blue to yellowish&#8208;green upon the desorption of water molecules while keeping the high emission quantum yield of more than 0.45. Variable&#8208;temperature and continuous in&#8208;situ tracking of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements revealed that the SCSC transformation proceeds reversibly by the release and reabsorption of water molecules, thereby changing the stacked structure slightly. As a result, the dynamics of vapor&#8208;induced SCSC transformation were elucidated: that the anhydrous form returned to the original trihydrate form in a two&#8208;step process under a water vapor atmosphere. In addition, the PtII complex exhibited a similar SCSC response accompanied by a luminescence color change in the presence of methanol vapor, while being inactive toward ethanol vapor.

         <title>1,2&#8208;Carboboration of Arylallenes by In Situ Generated Alkenylboranes for the Synthesis of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>

A chemo&#8208; and regioselective 1,2&#8208;carboboration of arylallenes by alkenylboranes, formed in&#8197;situ by hydroboration of alkynes with Piers&#8217; borane (HB(C6F5)2) is reported. This novel 1,2&#8208;carboboration and a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling were used for the synthesis of twenty new aryl substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes.







Abstract
We herein report a novel method for the coupling of unactivated alkynes and arylallenes, which relies on an unprecedented and regioselective 1,2&#8208;carboboration of the allene by an alkenylborane. The alkenylborane is conveniently prepared in&#8197;situ by hydroboration of an alkyne with Piers&#8217; borane, i.&#8201;e., HB(C6F5)2. The boryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes that are formed by this carboboration are well&#8208;suited for a subsequent Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling with aryl iodides. This allowed us to develop a three&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot protocol for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,4&#8208;dienes. The generality of the reaction was demonstrated by the synthesis of twenty dienes with modular variations of all three reaction partners. The mechanism of the new 1,2&#8208;carboboration was investigated using dispersion corrected double&#8208;hybrid DFT computations that allowed us to rationalize the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of this key step.

Abstract
Surface plasmon of coinage metal nanostructures has been employed as a powerful route in boosting the performances in heterogenous catalysis. Development of efficient plasmonic nanocatalysts with high catalytic performance and efficient light harvesting properties is of vital importance. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a plasmonic nanocatalyst composed of Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes by an Ag(I)&#8208;assisted seed&#8208;mediated growth method. In the synthesis, the incorporation of Ag(I) suppresses the reduction of Au on the {100} surface of cubic Pd seeds and leads to the formation of Au nanoframes on the Pd nanocubes. The unique Au&#8208;framed Pd nanocubes can integrate the superior electrocatalytic of Pd and the outstanding plasmonic properties of Au. Thus, these nanostructures were employed as plasmonic nanocatalysts for plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol with improved stability.

Myxocoumarin B from Stigmatella aurantiaca MYX&#8208;030 is shown to possess strong antibiotic activity against a range of clinically relevant pathogens. Synthesis of a diverse compound library of structural analogs enabled investigations into initial structure&#8208;activity relationships and revealed the potential of the myxocoumarin scaffold as lead structure for the development of new antibiotics. Myxocoumarin B and analogs show low toxicity in&#8197;vivo in a zebrafish infection model and were superior in clearing bacterial infections when compared to established antibiotics such as vancomycin.







Abstract
The increasing emergence of resistances against established antibiotics is a substantial threat to human health. The discovery of new compounds with potent antibiotic activity is thus of utmost importance. Within this work, we identify strong antibiotic activity of the natural product myxocoumarin B from Stigmatella aurantiaca MYX&#8208;030 against a range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, including clinical isolates of MRSA. A focused library of structural analogs was synthesized to explore initial structure&#8208;activity relationships and to identify equipotent myxocoumarin derivatives devoid of the natural nitro substituent to significantly streamline synthetic access. The cytotoxicity of the myxocoumarins as well as their potential to cure bacterial infections in vivo was established using a zebrafish model system. Our results reveal the exceptional antibiotic activity of the myxocoumarin scaffold and hence its potential for the development of novel antibiotics.

         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon polymerization is a powerful method for the fabrication of complex 3D structures in the micrometre scale range. In order to achieve a controlled local radical polymerization in the focal point of a laser beam, highly sensitive and two&#8208;photon active photo initiators are required. The review is dedicated to these key substances and sheds light on their different chemical structures and photo&#8208;physical properties as well as the resulting fabrication conditions. Although the process of two&#8208;photon polymerization is a well&#8208;established technique, the efficiencies of the photo initiators are different depending not only on their chromophore system but also depending on the used solvents, monomer systems and laser set&#8208;ups.

A blue&#8208;luminescent PtII complex bearing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene changes luminescence color in response to the vapor atmosphere while maintaining its single crystallinity and luminescence intensity. The vapor&#8208;induced reversible and stepwise single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformations were elucidated by variable&#8208;temperature and continuous in&#8208;situ tracking of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements.

Through the shattered glass is an amazing view of Keelung city where the National Taiwan Ocean University is located. Like breaking a hole in a vacuum box, a new stable mixed&#8208;ligand zinc phosphite (NTOU&#8208;9) presents interesting structural features and pore characteristics for gas adsorption. This material also showed good adsorption capacity for H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, N2, and H2, as well as selectivity for CO2 over CO, N2, and H2 at 298&#8197;K. The possible adsorption sites and selectivity were calculated by using density functional theory (DFT), the ideal adsorption solution theory (IAST), and fitting experimental pure&#8208;component adsorption data. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8208;M. Wang and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200732).

A new key: The incorporation of luminescence into surface&#8208;tethered polymer brushes is discussed in this review. It unlocks new characterization techniques and has been used for a wide range of applications including sensors, cellular labelling, optoelectronics and stenography. These materials can demonstrate enhanced stability compared to physisorbed polymer films or luminescent dyes, and offer improved control over both the composition of thin films and their spatial arrangement.







Abstract
Surface&#8208;tethered polymers are unique molecular architectures that have been recently used in advanced sensors, electronics and biomedical applications. However, techniques for characterizing these materials in their surface&#8208;tethered form remain limited. The incorporation of luminescent functionality into these materials has enabled new characterization methods, while also unlocking new applications in optoelectronics, stenography and sensing. Micron&#8208;scale photolithography techniques have recently enabled the preparation of high&#8208;resolution patterns, as well as architectures with unique photophysical properties. Herein, we provide an overview of the techniques used to prepare luminescent polymer brush materials and their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive sensors, cell adhesion materials, and optoelectronics. We also provide our perspective on the promising future uses of surface&#8208;tethered polymers, as well as the short&#8208;term challenges and opportunities in the field.

         <title>From Light to Structure: Photo Initiators for Radical Two&#8208;Photon Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 32, June 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon polymerization has established itself as one of the most important techniques for the fabrication of 3D structures in the micro to nanometer range. To ensure precise and rapid fabrication, photo initiators (PI) are used that have been specially developed for this purpose. In this review article, the PIs known to the literature are listed and compared in particular according to their structural elements, fabrication behavior and two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;section.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) represents a powerful technique for the fabrication of precise three&#8208;dimensional structures on a micro&#8208; and nanometer scale for various applications. While many review articles are focusing on the used polymeric materials and their application in 2PP, in this review the class of two&#8208;photon photo initiators (2PI) used for radical polymerization is discussed in detail. Because the demand for highly efficient 2PI has increased in the last decades, different approaches in designing new efficient 2PIs occurred. This review summarizes the 2PIs known in literature and discusses their absorption behavior under one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) conditions, their two&#8208;photon cross sections (&#963;TPA) as well as their efficiency under 2PP conditions. Here, the photo initiators are grouped depending on their chromophore system (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D, D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D, etc.). Their polymerization efficiencies are evaluated by fabrication windows (FW) depending on different laser intensities and writing speeds.

In this review article, the PIs known to the literature are listed and compared in particular according to their structural elements, fabrication behavior and two-photon cross-section.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-photon polymerization (2PP) represents a powerful technique for the fabrication of precise three-dimensional structures on a micro- and nanometer scale for various applications. While many review articles are focusing on the used polymeric materials and their application in 2PP, in this review the class of two-photon photo initiators (2PI) used for radical polymerization is discussed in detail. Because the demand for highly efficient 2PI has increased in the last decades, different approaches in designing new efficient 2PIs occurred. This review summarizes the 2PIs known in literature and discusses their absorption behavior under one- and two-photon absorption (2PA) conditions, their two-photon cross sections (&#963;&lt;sub&gt;TPA&lt;/sub&gt;) as well as their efficiency under 2PP conditions. Here, the photo initiators are grouped depending on their chromophore system (D-&#960;-A-&#960;-D, D-&#960;-D, etc.). Their polymerization efficiencies are evaluated by fabrication windows (FW) depending on different laser intensities and writing speeds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radical complexes of nickel(II)/copper(II) and redox non&#8208;innocent MB&#8208;DIPY ligands: unusual stability and strong near&#8208;infrared absorption at lmax ~1300 nm</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of radicals with intense and redox&#8208;switchable absorption beyond 1000 nm is a long&#8208;standing challenge in the chemistry of functional dyes. Here we report the preparation of a series of unprecedented stable neutral nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes of &#8220;Manitoba&#8208;dipyrromethenes&#8221; (MB&#8208;DIPYs) in which the organic chromophore is present in the anion&#8208;radical state. The new stable radicals have an intense absorption at l max ~ 1300 nm and can be either oxidized to a regular [M II (MB&#8208;DIPY)] + (M = Cu or Ni) or reduced to [M II (MB&#8208;DIPY)] &#8208; compounds. The radical nature of the stable [M II (MB&#8208;DIPY)] . radicals was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy with additional insight on their electronic structure obtained by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, electro&#8208; and spectroelectrochemistry, magnetic measurements, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electronic structures and spectroscopic properties of the radical&#8208;based chromophores were also probed by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. These nickel(II) and copper(II) complexes represent the first stable radical compounds with an MB&#8208;DIPY ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Mass and Charge Transfer Enhancement during Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction by Enhanced Surface Hydrophobicity without Barrier Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The CO2  reduction reaction (CRR) represents a promising route for the clean utilization of renewable resources. But mass transfer limitations hinder the step forward seriously. Enhancing the surface hydrophobicity by polymers has been proved to be one of the most efficient strategies. However, as macromolecular organics, polymers on the surface hinder the transfer of charge carriers from catalysts to reactants. Herein, we describe an in&#8208;situ surface fluorination strategy to enhance the surface hydrophobicity of TiO2&#160;  without organics barrier layer, facilitating the mass transfer of CO2  to catalysts and the charge transfer. With less charge transfer obstruction, higher CO2  , and lower H+  surface concentration, the photocatalytic CRR generation rate of methanol (CH3OH) is greatly enhanced up to 247.15 &#956;mol g&#8208;1  h&#8208;1  . Furthermore, we investigate the mechanism of fluorination by experiment and theoretical calculation. Overall, enhancing the surface hydrophobicity of catalysts provides a general and reliable method to improve the competitiveness of CRR.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Observation of Hot Carrier Transfer at Plasmonic Au/Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing heterostructures have been demonstrated as an ideal strategy for boosting charge separation on plasmonic photocatalysts, but the detailed interface charge transfer mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we fabricate plasmonic Au and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs, NH 2 &#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and MIL&#8208;125 used in this work) heterostructures and explore the interface charge transfer mechanism by in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements. The plasmon&#8208;excited hot electrons on Au can transfer across the Au/MOF interface and be captured by the coordinatively unsaturated sites of secondary building units (Ti 8 O 8 (OH) 4 cluster) of the MOF structure, and the plasmon&#8208;excited hot holes on Au tend to transfer to and be trapped at the functionalized organic ligand (1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate&#8208;NH 2 ). The spatially separated hot electrons and holes exhibit boosted the photocatalytic activity for chromium (VI) reduction and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation. This work illustrates the advantage of the versatile functionalization of MOF structures enabling molecular&#8208;level manipulation of interface charge transfer on plasmonic photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Convergent paired electrolysis combines both anodic and cathodic reactions simultaneously in an electrochemical transformation. It provides a highly energy&#8208;efficient approach to conventionally challenging and useful structures. However, the physical separation of the two half&#8208;electrode reactions makes it extremely difficult to couple the intermediates arising from the two electrodes. In this concept article, three strategies used in convergent paired electrolysis will be discussed from the perspective of the reaction mechanism, including:&#160;  a) metal cataly  z ed convergent paired electrolysis, b) convergent paired electrolysis enabled by persistent radical effects and, c) microfluidic chemistry applied to convergent paired electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Aggregation Modes of Chiral Diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole Dyes in Solution and Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chiroptical features of chiral diketopyrrolo[3,4&#8208;  c  ]pyrrole (DPP) derivatives have been only marginally investigated to date. In this regard, we have synthesized  ad hoc  four chiral DPP dyes, functionalized with enantiopure alkyl groups from natural sources either on the lactam moieties or on the terminal positions of &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, to promote an efficient self&#8208;assembly into chiral supramolecular structures. For each of them, the aggregation modes has been investigated by absorbance and ECD spectroscopies in conditions of solution aggregation and thin films, considering the effects of deposition technique (drop casting  vs.  spin coating) and post&#8208;deposition operations (solvent and thermal annealing). The effect of the structure of lateral &#960;&#8208;conjugated units attached to the central DPP scaffold, as well as that of the position of the alkyl chiral group, has been assessed. ECD revealed superior capability, compared to absorbance spectroscopy, to provide information on the aggregation modes and to detect the possible co&#8208;existence of multiple aggregation pathways.</dc:description>

For each of them, the aggregation modes has been investigated by absorbance and ECD spectroscopies in conditions of solution aggregation and thin films, considering the effects of deposition technique (drop casting  vs.  spin coating) and post-deposition operations (solvent and thermal annealing). The effect of the structure of lateral &#960;-conjugated units attached to the central DPP scaffold, as well as that of the position of the alkyl chiral group, has been assessed. ECD revealed superior capability, compared to absorbance spectroscopy, to provide information on the aggregation modes and to detect the possible co-existence of multiple aggregation pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diastereoselectivity is in the Details: Minor Changes Yield Major Improvements to the Synthesis of Bedaquiline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bedaquiline is a crucial medicine in the global fight against tuberculosis, yet its high price places it out of reach for many patients. Herein, we describe improvements to the key industrial lithiation&#8208;addition sequence that enable a higher yielding and therefore more economical synthesis of bedaquiline. Prioritization of mechanistic understanding and multi&#8208;lab reproducibility led to optimized reaction conditions that feature an unusual base&#8211;salt pairing and afford a doubling of the yield of racemic bedaquiline. We anticipate that implementation of these improvements on manufacturing scale will be facile, thereby substantially increasing the accessibility of this essential medication.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Installation of Dehydroamino Acid Motifs into Peptides Enabled by an N&#8208;Chloropeptide Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N&#8208;chloropeptide strategy enables the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The quinuclidine (ABCO)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N&#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into oligopeptides that have already been constructed, including into a macrocyclic peptide. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Nanjo, Y. Takemoto, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201120).

         <title>Do Antarafacial Cycloadditions Occur? Cycloaddition of Heptafulvalene with Tetracyanoethylene.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cycloaddition of heptafulvalene ( 1 ) with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) was previously described as an example of an antarafacial cycloaddition, a [&#960; 14 a +&#960; 2 s ] process that afforded only the trans &#8208;cycloadduct by virtue of an edge&#8208;to&#8208;face approach of TCNE, facilitated by the S&#8208;shape of 1 . The reaction has been investigated in depth and found not to be a concerted antarafacial process. At low temperature, the reaction is observed to give a mixture of cis &#8208; and trans &#8208;cycloadducts as well as a [4+2] cycloadduct. The mixture of products is converted to the trans &#8208;cycloadduct by equilibration upon warming to room temperature. Studies with diethyl 2,3&#8208;dicyanofumarate and &#8208;maleate confirmed the formation of cis &#8208;cycloadducts. DFT studies at the M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;311+G(2d,p),&#160;SCRF=acetone level of theory show that the originally proposed edge&#8208;to&#8208;face approach of TCNE to 1 is highly disfavored, while a stepwise mechanism involving addition of TCNE at C2 to form a zwitterion followed by collapse at either C2&#8217; or C7&#8217; is energetically accessible. The Diels&#8208;Alder adduct is also formed in a stepwise reaction by competitive addition of TCNE at C4 of 1 . These studies suggest that edge&#8208;to&#8208;face interactions are prohibitive in even the most favorable cases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Abstract : Reactions of PAr 3 /B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 (Ar = o &#8208;Tol, Mes, Ph) FLPs with diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) afford the corresponding FLP addition products 1&#8208;3 in which P&#8208;N and B&#8208;O linkages are formed. In contrast, the reaction of BPh 3 , PPh 3 and DEAD gave the product 4 where P&#8208;N and N&#8208;B binding was confirmed. In all cases, other binding modes were computed to be both higher in energy and readily distinguishable by 31 P and 11 B NMR parameters.

         <title>Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antidote Discovery by Untangling the Reactivation Mechanism of Nerve&#8208;Agent&#8208;Inhibited Acetylcholinesterase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of efficient antidotes to organophosphorus nerve agent (OPNA) intoxication needs to account for the complexity of the molecular system. A fragment with broad&#8208;spectrum binding profile was transformed into a multi&#8208;active reactivator of OPNAs&#8208;inhibited acetylcholinesterases. Reactivation and pre&#8208;reactivation kinetics, supplemented with structural data show that efficient reactivation is linked to longer residence time, and reveal that the OPNAs dictate both the initial binding and the structural prerequisites for the reactivation reaction.







Abstract
Reactivators are vital for the treatment of organophosphorus nerve agent (OPNA) intoxication but new alternatives are needed due to their limited clinical applicability. The toxicity of OPNAs stems from covalent inhibition of the essential enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which reactivators relieve via a chemical reaction with the inactivated enzyme. Here, we present new strategies and tools for developing reactivators. We discover suitable inhibitor scaffolds by using an activity&#8208;independent competition assay to study non&#8208;covalent interactions with OPNA&#8208;AChEs and transform these inhibitors into broad&#8208;spectrum reactivators. Moreover, we identify determinants of reactivation efficiency by analysing reactivation and pre&#8208;reactivation kinetics together with structural data. Our results show that new OPNA reactivators can be discovered rationally by exploiting detailed knowledge of the reactivation mechanism of OPNA&#8208;inhibited AChE.

         <title>ThioCORMates: Tunable and Cost&#8208;Effective Carbon Monoxide&#8208;Releasing Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;aryl thioformates, or thioCORMates, are versatile carbon monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) for a range of uses, from carbonylative cross coupling to protein binding. These molecules can be tuned to release CO at different rates (from &lt;1&#8197;min to &gt;1&#8197;h) at room temperature. Isotopically labeled 13CO can also be generated easily, since thioCORMates are made in one step from the corresponding thiophenol and formic acid.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide&#8208;releasing molecules (CORMs) can offer a safer alternative to CO delivery than the use of CO gas cylinders. Upon treatment with an amine base, S&#8208;aryl thioformates (&#8220;thioCORMates&#8221;) release CO nearly quantitatively at room temperature, a gas which can then be harnessed for carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling, biological study, or inorganic synthesis. These bench&#8208;stable molecules are easily synthesized from the corresponding thiophenol and can be electronically tuned to release CO at different rates&#8208;from less than 1&#8197;min to greater than 1&#8197;h&#8208;offering a practical alternative to existing CORM technology. Finally, isotopically labeled 13CO can be conveniently generated and used, with the thioCORMate synthesized from 13C&#8208;formic acid.

&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-aryl thioformates&lt;/b&gt;, or thioCORMates, are versatile carbon monoxide-releasing molecules (CORMs) for a range of uses, from carbonylative cross coupling to protein binding. These molecules can be tuned to release CO at different rates (from &amp;lt;1&#8197;min to &amp;gt;1&#8197;h) at room temperature. Isotopically labeled &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO can also be generated easily, since thioCORMates are made in one step from the corresponding thiophenol and formic acid.

         <title>The Pursuit of Perphenylterphenyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetradecaphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;terphenyl was prepared in low yield by two methods: (1) Ullmann coupling of pentaphenyliodobenzene and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene and (2) Diels&#8208;Alder addition of tetracyclone and 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraphenylbenzene. Its X&#8208;ray structure shows it to possess an unusual conformation with two boat&#8208;shaped benzene rings.







Abstract
Tetradecaphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;terphenyl (2) was synthesized from 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diiodobenzene (11) by two methods. Ullmann coupling of 11 with pentaphenyliodobenzene (9) gave compound 2 in 1.7&#8201;% yield, and Sonogashira coupling of 11 with phenylacetylene, followed by a double Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of the product diyne 12 with tetracyclone (6), gave 2 in 1.5&#8201;% overall yield. The latter reaction also gave the monoaddition product 4&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;,3,3&#8242;,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;nonaphenylbiphenyl (13) in 4&#8201;% overall yield. The X&#8208;ray structures of compounds 2 and 13 show them to possess core aromatic rings distorted into shallow boat conformations. Density functional calculations indicate that these unusual structures are not the lowest energy conformations in the gas phase and may be the result of packing forces in the crystal. In addition, while uncorrected DFT calculations indicate that the strain energy in compound 2 is approximately 50&#8197;kcal/mol, dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT calculations suggest that it is essentially unstrained, due to compensating, favorable, intramolecular interactions of its many phenyl rings. An attempted synthesis of tetradecaphenyl&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl (4) by reaction of diphenylhexatriyne (14) with three equivalents of tetracyclone at 350&#8201;&#176;C gave only the diadduct 2&#8208;(phenylethynyl)&#8208;2&#8242;,3,3&#8242;,4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;nonaphenylbiphenyl (15) in 17&#8201;% yield. Even higher temperatures failed to produce 4 and lowered the yield of 15, perhaps due to rapid decomposition of the starting materials. Ullmann coupling of 3,4,5,6&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diiodobenzene (16) and compound 9 also failed to give compound 4.

         <title>Para&#8208;Fluorination of Anilides Using Electrochemically Generated Hypervalent Iodoarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical transformation for the selective para&#8208;fluorination of anilides is presented. Herein, anodically generated ArIF2 mediates the conversion of a variety of 20 different anilides in up to 86&#8201;% yield. The sustainable and easy to conduct protocol in an ionic&#8208;liquid / dicholoromethane mixture represents a promising alternative to conventional reagent mediated synthesis protocol.







Abstract
The para&#8208;selective fluorination reaction of anilides using electrochemically generated hypervalent ArIF2 is reported, with Et3N&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;5HF serving as fluoride source and as supporting electrolyte. This electrochemical reaction is characterized by a simple set&#8208;up, easy scalability and affords a broad variety of fluorinated anilides from easily accessible anilides in good yields up to 86&#8201;%.

         <title>Noncovalent interactions involving group 6 in biological systems: The case of Molybdopterin and Tungstopterin cofactors.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we propose to coin the term Wolfium bond (WfB) to refer to a net attractive force (noncovalent interaction) between any element of group 6 and electron donor atoms (neutral molecules or anions) and to differentiate it from a coordination bond (metal&#8211;ligand interaction). We provide evidence of the existence of this interaction by inspecting the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of proteins containing Molybdopterin and Tungstopterin cofactors from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The plausible biological role of the interaction as well as its physical nature (antibonding Wf&#8211;Ligand orbital involved) are also analyzed by means of  ab initio  calculations (RI&#8208;MP2/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory), Atoms in Molecules (AIM), Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) and Noncovalent Interactions plot (NCIplot) analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>The mechanism of biochemical NO&#8208;sensing: insights from computational chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Binding of small gas molecules, such as NO and CO plays a major role in the signaling routes of the human body. The sole NO&#8208;receptor in humans is soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) &#8211; a histidine&#8208;ligated heme protein, which, upon NO binding, activates a downstream signaling cascade. Impairment of NO&#8208;signaling is linked, among others, to cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. In the present work, we use a combination of theoretical tools such as MD simulations, high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations and hybrid QM/MM methods to address various aspects of NO binding and to elucidate the most likely reaction paths and the potential intermediates of the reaction. As a model system, the H&#8208;NOX protein from  Shewanella oneidensis  (So H&#8208;NOX) homologous to the NO&#8208;binding domain of sGC is used. The signaling route is predicted to involve NO binding to form a six&#8208;coordinate intermediate heme&#8208;NO complex, followed by relatively facile His decoordination yielding a five&#8208;coordinate adduct with NO on the distal side with possible isomerization to the proximal side through binding of a second NO and release of the first one. MD simulations show that the His sidechain can quite easily rotate outward into solvent, with this motion being accompanied in our simulations by shifts in helix positions that are consistent with this decoordination leading to significant conformational change in the protein.</dc:description>

In the present work, we use a combination of theoretical tools such as MD simulations, high-level quantum chemical calculations and hybrid QM/MM methods to address various aspects of NO binding and to elucidate the most likely reaction paths and the potential intermediates of the reaction. As a model system, the H-NOX protein from  Shewanella oneidensis  (So H-NOX) homologous to the NO-binding domain of sGC is used. The signaling route is predicted to involve NO binding to form a six-coordinate intermediate heme-NO complex, followed by relatively facile His decoordination yielding a five-coordinate adduct with NO on the distal side with possible isomerization to the proximal side through binding of a second NO and release of the first one. MD simulations show that the His sidechain can quite easily rotate outward into solvent, with this motion being accompanied in our simulations by shifts in helix positions that are consistent with this decoordination leading to significant conformational change in the protein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Dots for Carbon Dummies: The Quantum and The Molecular Questions Among Some Others</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon Dots (CDs) are carbon nanoparticles which were discovered in 2004. Despite two decades of intensive work from the scientific community and a colossal amount of gathered experimental data, no definitive consensus exists to date on several key aspects such as the actual definition of CDs and the origin of their emissive properties. This review proposes a critical evaluation of these fundamental questions. Lay persons will also find here an alternative introduction to the CDs domain, including synthetic strategies, photophysical properties, as well as challenges and outlook of this exciting new area.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of A Stable Extra&#8208;Large&#8208;Pore Zeolite with 15&#215;12&#215;12 Member&#8208;Ring Channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore zeolites have great application potential in various industrial fields, such as oil refinery, fine chemicals and biomass processing. Herein, we report the synthesis of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore germanosilicate zeolite (named NUD&#8208;13) by using an easily obtained aromatic organic cation 1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;propyl&#8208;benzimidazolium as organic structure&#8208;directing agents.&#160;NUD&#8208;13 possesses a rare 15&#8208;member ring extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore channel intersecting with two elliptical 12&#8208;member ring channels, which is isostructural to germanosilicate zeolite GeZA synthesized by using triphenylsulfonium. The germanium in NUD&#8208;13 can be partially substituted by acid treatment to obtain stable high silica zeolite. In addition, aluminium is added into the framework of NUD&#8208;13 during the post&#8208;synthesis treatment process, which provides a foundation for catalytic application.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Water&#8208; and Air&#8208;Stable Iron&#8208;Containing MRI Contrast Agent Sensor for H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable Fe(II) complex with the quinol&#8208;containing macrocyclic ligand H  4  qp4 reacts with H  2  O  2  to yield Fe(III) complexes with less highly chelating forms of the ligand that have either one or two  para  &#8208;quinones. The reaction increases the  T  1  &#8208;weighted relaxivity over four&#8208;fold, enabling the complex to detect H  2  O  2  using clinical MRI technology. The iron&#8208;containing sensor differs from its recently characterized manganese analog, which also detects H  2  O  2  , in that it is the oxidation of the metal center, rather than the ligand, that primarily enhances the relaxivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic strategies in Aminocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synergistic catalysis offers the unique possibility of simultaneous activations of both the nucleophile and the electrophile in a reaction. A requirement for this strategy is the stability of the active species towards the reaction conditions and the two concerted catalytic cycles. Since the beginning of the century, aminocatalysis has been established as a platform for the stereoselective activation of carbonyl compounds  via  HOMO&#8208;raising or LUMO&#8208;lowering. The burgeoning era of aminocatalysis has been driven by the deep understanding of these activation and stereoinduction modes, thanks to the introduction of versatile and privileged chiral amines. The aim of the present review is to cover the recent developments of synergistic strategies involving aminocatalysis in combination with organo&#8208;, metal&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electro&#8208;catalysis, focusing on the evolution of privileged aminocatalysts architectures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and a series of related monorhodaporphyrins have been obtained via a tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange in a reaction of tetraaryl&#8208;21,23&#8208;ditelluraporphyrin with [RhCl(CO)  2  ]  2  . These organometallic metallaporphyrins contain rhodium(III) centers embedded in rhodacyclopentadiene rings, incorporated within the porphyrin frames. The skeletons of 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin and 21&#8208;rhoda&#8208;23&#8208;telluraporphyrin are strongly in&#8208;plane deformed from the rectangular shape typical for porphyrins, due to rhodium(III) coordination preferences, the large size of two core atoms, and the porphyrin skeleton constrains. These two metallaporphyrins exhibit fluxional behavior, studied by  1  H NMR and DFT, involving the in&#8208;plane motion and the switch of the rhodium center(s) between two nitrogen donors. A side&#8208;product detected in the reaction mixture, 21&#8208;oxa&#8208;23&#8208;rhodaporphyrin, results from tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen exchange, occurring parallelly to the tellurium&#8208;to&#8208;rhodium exchange. The reaction paths and mechanisms are analysed. The title 21,23&#8208;dirhodaporphyrin contains a bridged bimetallic unit, Rh  2  Cl  2  , in the center of the macrocycle, with two rhodium(III) ions, lying approximately in&#8208;plane of the porphyrinoid skeleton. The geometry of the implanted Rh  2  Cl  2  unit is affected by macrocyclic constrains.</dc:description>

         <title>Infrared spectroscopy elucidates the inhibitor binding sites in a metal&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological carbon dioxide (CO  2  ) reduction is an important step by which organisms form valuable energy&#8208;richer molecules required for further metabolic processes. The Mo&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from  Rhodobacter capsulatus  catalyzes reversible formate oxidation to CO  2  at a bis&#8208;molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (bis&#8208;MGD) cofactor. To elucidate potential substrate binding sites we studied herein the interaction with the inhibitory molecules azide and cyanate, which are isoelectronic to CO  2  and charged as formate. We employed infrared (IR) spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory (DFT) and inhibition kinetics. One distinct inhibitory molecule was found to bind to either a non&#8208;competitive or a competitive binding site in the secondary coordination sphere of the active site. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of key amino acid residues in the vicinity of the bis&#8208;MGD cofactor revealed changes in both non&#8208;competitive and competitive binding. The absence of the cofactor and the adjacent Arg587 hampers exclusively the competitive interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and ITC Characterization of Peptide&#8208;Protein Binding: Thermodynamic Consequences of Cyclization Constraints, a Case Study on Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclization constraints are widely used in the design of protein ligands to stabilize their bioactive conformation and increase their affinities. However, the resulting changes in binding entropy can be puzzling and uncorrelated to affinity gains. Here we report the thermodynamic (Isothermal Titration Calorimetry) and structural (X&#8208;ray, NMR and CD) analysis of a complete series of lactam&#8208;bridged peptide ligands of the vascular endothelial growth factor, and their unconstrained analogs. We show that differences in thermodynamics arise mainly from the folding energy of the peptide upon binding. The systematic reduction in conformational entropy penalty due to helix pre&#8208;organization can be counterbalanced by an unfavorable vibrational entropy change if the constraints are too rigid. The gain in configurational entropy partially escapes the enthalpy/entropy compensation and leads to an improvement in affinity. The precision of the analytical ITC method makes this study a possible benchmark for constrained peptides optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Substituted Triptycenes: Understanding the Exciton Coupling of Molecular Switches in Close Proximity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable host system: Azobenzenes have been attached to a triptycene scaffold in the meta position. Isomerization experiments revealed efficient switching of azobenzene moieties together with the build&#8208;up of a cavity in the all&#8208;Z conformation of the C3v&#8208;symmetric trisazobenzene&#8208;triptycene; this makes this molecule interesting as a switchable host system. Moreover, computational studies indicated excitonic coupling resulting in different transition probabilities of &#960;&#8211;&#960;* excitations.







Abstract
Herein, we report a series of azobenzene&#8208;substituted triptycenes. In their design, these switching units were placed in close proximity, but electronically separated by a sp3 center. The azobenzene switches were prepared by Baeyer&#8211;Mills coupling as key step. The isomerization behavior was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and HPLC. It was shown that all azobenzene moieties are efficiently switchable. Despite the geometric decoupling of the chromophores, computational studies revealed excitonic coupling effects between the individual azobenzene units depending on the connectivity pattern due to the different transition dipole moments of the &#960;&#8594;&#960;* excitations. Transition probabilities for those excitations are slightly altered, which is also revealed in their absorption spectra. These insights provide new design parameters for combining multiple photoswitches in one molecule, which have high potential as energy or information storage systems, or, among others, in molecular machines and supramolecular chemistry.

         <title>Understanding the reshaping of fluorinated polyester vitrimers by kinetic and DFT studies of the transesterification reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers are a third class of polymers gathering the mechanical properties and solvent resistance of 3D thermosets and the reprocessability of thermoplastics. This unique behaviour is due to the triggering of certain covalent exchange reactions that allow the network to rearrange upon application of a stimulus. The constitutive feature of vitrimers is the adoption of a glass&#8208;like viscosity during the rearrangement of the network, often due to an associative mechanism for the exchange reaction. Transesterification networks are one of the most studied type of vitrimers that usually require the incorporation of a catalyst, implying the associated drawbacks. Our group recently reported catalyst&#8208;free transesterification vitrimers in which the ester functions are particularly reactive thanks to the presence of fluorine atoms in a&#8208; or b&#8208;position. In the present contribution, we present parallel DFT calculations and an experimental kinetic study on model molecules in order to quantitatively assess the effect of neighbouring fluorinated groups on the transesterification reaction rate.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amaryllidaceae alkaloids appeal to organic chemists with their attractive structures and their impressive antitumor and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory properties. We demonstrate a highly versatile access to this family of natural products. A general protocol with high yields in a sustainable electro&#8208;organic key transformation on a metal&#8208;free anode to spirodienones facilitates functionalization to the alkaloids. The biomimetic syntheses start with the readily available, inexpensive biogenic starting materials methyl gallate, O&#8208;methyl tyramine, and vanillin derivatives. Through known dynamic resolutions, this technology provides access to both enantiomeric series of martidine, (epi&#8208;)crinine, siculine, and galantamine, clinically prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We use an on&#8208;surface synthesis approach to drive the homocoupling reaction of a simple dithiophenyl&#8208;functionalized precursor on Cu(111). The C&#8208;S activation reaction is initiated at low annealing temperature and yields unsaturated hydrocarbon chains interconnected in a fully conjugated reticulated network. High&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy imaging reveals the opening of the thiophenyl rings and the presence of trans &#8208; and cis &#8208;oligoacetylene chains as well as pentalene units. The chemical transformations were studied by C 1s and S 2p core level photoemission spectroscopy and supported by theoretical calculations. At higher annealing temperature, additional cyclization reactions take place, leading to the formation of small graphene flakes.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Look at Molecular and Electronic Structure of Homoleptic Diiron(II,II) Complexes with N,N&#8208;Bidentate Ligands: Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>

         <dc:description>
The new factors governing the molecular and electronic structures of Fe&#8722;Fe bonded diiron(II,II) complexes were revealed based on comprehensive experimental characterization along with high&#8208;level ab&#8208;intio calculations. We present the unprecedented non&#8208;centrosymmetric complex [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)], and the new electronic configuration of paddlewheel&#8208;type compound [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4].







Abstract
Paddlewheel&#8208;type binuclear complexes featuring metal&#8722;metal bonding have been the subject of widespread interest due to fundamental concern in their electronic structures and potential applications. Here, we explore the molecular and electronic structures of diiron(II,II) complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diarylformamidinate ligands. While a paddlewheel&#8208;type diiron(II,II) complex with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diphenylformamidinate ligands (DPhF) exhibits the centrosymmetric [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] structure, a minor alteration in the ligand system, i.&#8201;e., switching from phenyl to p&#8208;tolyl N&#8208;substituted formamidinate ligand (DTolF), resulted in the isolation of an unprecedented non&#8208;centrosymmetric [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)] complex. Both complexes were characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, magnetic measurements, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry along with high&#8208;level ab&#8208;initio calculations. The results provide a new view on a range of factors controlling the ground&#8208;state electronic configuration and structural diversity of homoleptic diiron(II,II) complexes. Model calculations determined that the Mayer bond orders for Fe&#8722;Fe interactions are significantly lower than 1 and equal to 0.15 and 0.28 for [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;DPhF)4] and [Fe(&#956;&#8208;DTolF)3Fe(&#954;2&#8208;DTolF)], respectively.

         <title>Barbier Hyperbranching Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission from AB Type Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent polymer materials have gained considerable research efforts in the past decades and are generally molecular designed by extending &#960; system of polymer main chain or by incorporating chromophores into polymer chain, which suffer from poor solubility, difficult synthesis, or multi&#8208;step procedure. Meanwhile, according to the step&#8208;growth polymerization theory, synthesis of hyperbranched polymers from AB type monomer is still challenging. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot synthesis of nonconjugated luminescent hyperbranched polymer material via Barbier hyperbranching polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) from AB type monomer. The key step in the realization of hyperbranched polymer is bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional group. Through Barbier reaction between organohalide and ester group in one pot, bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional ester is realized through two&#8208;step nucleophilic additions, resulting in hyperbranched polytriphenylmethanols (HPTPM). Attributed to through&#8208;space conjugation, nonconjugated HPTPMs are PIEgens and exhibit intriguing luminescent properties, which are tunable by monomer structure and polymerization time. When all phenyl groups are rotatable, HPTPM is aggregation&#8208;induced emission type PIEgen. While, it is aggregation&#8208;caused quenching type PIEgen, if some phenyl groups are rotation forbidden. Further potential applications of PIEgen in the fields of explosive detection and artificial light harvesting system are carried out. This work therefore expands the monomer library and molecular design library of hyperbranched polymer through &#8220;bi&#8208;functionalization of mono&#8208;functional group&#8221; strategy, which eventually expands the preparation library of nonconjugated luminescent polymer materials through one&#8208;pot PIE from nonemissive monomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Synthesized Cd&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5: Stable and Excitation&#8208;Wavelength Dependent Dual&#8208;Color Emission for Advanced Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the development of intellectual properties, concerning about advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting is accumulating, which conventional single&#8208;modal luminescence cannot realize. As one of rapidly developing 0D materials, copper&#8208;based perovskite is likely to realize multiple luminescent centers for complex emission. In this work, Cd was doped into Cs  3  Cu  2  I  5  and showed resultant emission at 560 nm which surprisingly showed a red&#8208;shifted excitation peak from that of intrinsic self&#8208;trapped emission, resulting in excitation&#8208;wavelength dependent emission. When the excitation wavelength increasing from 290 nm to 330 nm, the emission of Cd&#8208;doped Cs  3  Cu  2  I  5  changed from deep blue to cold white and finally yellow. Afterwards, Cd&#8208;doped Cs  3  Cu  2  I  5  was mixed with polystyrene to prepare anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink for silk&#8208;screen printing. Meanwhile, Cd&#8208;doped Cs  3  Cu  2  I  5  maintains outstanding stability after doping, no matter under ambient, continuous UV radiation or high&#8208;temperature environment. The intensity can be almost totally recovered after heating&#8208;and&#8208;cooling cycles. This study lays groundwork for future research into multiple luminescent center manipulation in 0D materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Effect of Annulation Mode of Twistarene on the Physical Property and Self&#8208;assembly Behavior of the Functionalized Curved Aromatic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four novel curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  3a  ,  5  ,  8  ,  15a  have been synthesized and characterized, where molecules  3a  and  15a  bear [5]carbohelicene units. X&#8208;ray single crystal analyses indicate that compound  3a  shows offset packing arrangements of (  P  5  )&#8208; and (  M  5  )&#8208;isomers, and  15a  has a symmetrical plane and looks like a butterfly. In comparison,  8  exhibits a slightly curved structure, in which the significant convex&#8208;to&#8208;convex &#960;&#8208;overlap with the shortest distance of 3.42 &#197; occurs. In addition, the effect of annulation mode of twistarenes on the physical properties, self&#8208;assembly behaviors, and switchable photoconductivity of the as&#8208;prepared curved aromatic compounds were further examined in a comparative manner.</dc:description>

         <title>New approaches toward building Csp&#8208;P bond, a two&#8208;decade overview</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the review of Savignac, the past 20 years have seen significant progresses on the synthesis of alkynylphosphorus compounds considerably expanding the original and rather limited organic toolbox. This comprehensive review explores the latest and potentially greener methodologies using sustainable catalysis or direct metal&#8208;free couplings from stable and easy to handle precursors. Recent progresses and mechanistic insights for metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions with a particular emphasis on copper, palladium, nickel and silver catalytic systems, photocatalytic and metal&#8208;free reactions are detailed covering most of the publications related to this field since 2000 until March 2022.</dc:description>

         <title>Recyclable Mn(I) Catalysts for Base&#8208;Free Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Mechaistic, DFT and Catalytic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here a mechanistic, DFT and catalytic study on a series of Mn(I) complexes 1 , 2 ( a&#8208;d ), 3 , 4 . The studies apprehended the requirements for Mn(I) complexes to be active in both asymmetric direct ( AH ) and transfer hydrogenations ( ATH ). The investigations disclosed 6 vital factors accelerating the formation of a resting species, which plays a significant role in lowering the activities of the Mn(I) complex 1 in ATH and AH , respectively. In addition, we also report here a base free Mn(I) catalyzed ATH of aryl alkyl ketones with high enantioselectivity (up to 98% ee) and improved activity. More significantly, a novel and simple single&#8208;step process for recycling the resting species from the catalytic leftover has been discovered. Notably, the studies provide evidence for the existence of two different temperature dependent mechanisms for AH and ATH , in contrast to previous studies on related systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The straightforward synthetic protocol leading to carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amido (CMA) complexes (metal = Au, Cu) using a mild base and an environmentally desirable solvent (EtOH) is explored, with a focus on complexes bearing backbone&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, including BIAN&#8208;NHCs (BIAN = bis(imino)acenaphthene). The novel CMAs are structurally characterized and the gold&#8208;based CMAs bearing diverse NHCs are screened as simple, Br&#248;nsted&#8208;basic pre&#8208;catalysts. The readily accessible complexes display high catalytic activity in the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrocarboxylation of internal alkynes and alkynoic acids respectively, while the screening reveals the ancillary ligand effect of NHCs in these catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of the Naked&#8208;eye and Fluorescence Color of a Protonated Boron&#8208;doped Thiazolothiazole by Anion&#8208;dependent Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of a cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized thiazaborolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazaborole (TzbTzb) with strong Br&#248;nsted acids, such as HCl, HOTf (Tf = O2SCF3) and [H(OEt2)2][BArF4] (ArF  = 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3), results in the protonation of both TzbTzb nitrogen atoms. In each case X&#8208;ray crystallographic data show coordination of the counteranions (Cl&#8211;, OTf&#8211;, BArF4&#8211;  ) or solvent molecules (OEt2) to the doubly protonated fused heterocycle via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, the strength of which strongly influences the  1H NMR shift of the NH  protons, enabling tuning of both the visible (yellow to red) and fluorescence (green to red) colors of these salts. DFT calculations reveal that the hydrogen bonding of the counteranion or solvent to the protonated nitrogen centers affects the intramolecular TzbTzb&#8208;to&#8208;CAAC charge transfer character involved in the S0  &#8594;S1  transition, ultimately enabling fine&#8208;tuning of their absorption and emission spectral features.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we disclosed the  contra  &#8208;thermodynamic  E  &#8594;  Z  isomerization of alkenyl silanes, according to the in situ formation of a chromophoric species, in the presence of  rac  &#8208;BINAP as the catalyst. The reaction carried out in DMSO or CH  3  CN under irradiation at 405 nm allowed the interconversion of the  E  &#8208;isomer into the Z&#8208;congeners in good to excellent yields and outstanding  Z  /  E  selectivities, on 18 examples. Finally, the mechanism of this  E  &#8594;  Z  isomerization was studied to get insight into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The silanide [Si4{N(SiMe3)Dipp}3]&#8210; 1 transforms into the anionic siliconoid cluster [Si7{N(SiMe3)Dipp}3]&#8210; 2 with four unsubstituted silicon atoms as a contact ion pair with [K([18]crown&#8208;6)] in C6D6 at room temperature within five weeks. Anion 2 was investigated via a natural population analysis and visualization of intrinsic atomic orbitals. Magnetically induced current density calculations of 2 revealed two distinct strong diatropic vortices that sum up in one direction and create a strongly shielded apical silicon atom in 2.</dc:description>

         <title>Inducing Curvature to Pyracylene upon &#960;&#8208;Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a successive &#960;&#8208;expansion of pyracylene towards boat&#8208;shaped polycyclic scaffolds. The unique structural features of the resulting compounds were revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Depending on the extent of &#960;&#8208;expansion the compounds display intense bathochromically shifted absorption bands in their UV/Vis spectra and are prone to several redox events as documented by cyclic voltammetry. The experimental observations are in line with the computational studies based on density functional theory, suggesting progressive narrowing of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and distinct evolution of the electronic structure and aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>DNA strand displacement is a technique to exchange one strand of a double stranded DNA by another strand (invader). It is an isothermal, enzyme free method driven by single stranded overhangs (toeholds) and is employed in DNA amplification, mismatch detection and nanotechnology. We discovered that anomeric (&#945;/&#946;) DNA can be used for heterochiral strand displacement. Homochiral DNA in &#946;&#8208;D configuration was transformed to heterochiral DNA in &#945;&#8208;D/&#946;&#8208;D configuration and further to homochiral DNA with both strands in &#945;&#8208;D configuration. Single stranded &#945;&#8208;D DNA acts as invader. New anomeric displacement systems with and without toeholds were designed. Due to their resistance against enzymatic degradation, the systems are applicable to living cells. The light&#8208;up intercalator ethidium bromide is used as fluorescence sensor to follow the progress of displacement. Anomeric DNA displacement shows benefits over canonical DNA in view of toehold free displacement and simple detection by ethidium bromide.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur and Azobenzenes, a Profitable Liaison: Straightforward Synthesis of Photoswitchable Thioglycosides with Tunable Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable properties: A direct thioarylation of azobenzenes allows to obtain symmetrical as well as challenging unsymmetrical conjugates in good yields. Importantly, photochromic and thermal relaxation properties can be easily tuned via oxidation of the sulfide linkage.







Abstract
Azobenzene photoswitches are valuable tools for controlling properties of molecular systems with light. We have been investigating azobenzene glycoconjugates to probe carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions and to design glycoazobenzene macrocycles with chiroptical and physicochemical properties modulated by light irradiation. To date, direct conjugation of glycosides to azobenzenes was performed by reactions providing target compounds in limited yields. We therefore sought a more effective and reliable coupling method. In this paper, we report on a straightforward thioarylation of azobenzene derivatives with glycosyl thiols as well as other thiols, thereby increasing the scope of azobenzene conjugation. Even challenging unsymmetrical conjugates can be achieved in good yields via sequential or one&#8208;pot procedures. Importantly, red&#8208;shifted azoswitches, which are addressed with visible light, were easily functionalized. Additionally, by oxidation of the sulfide bridge to the respective sulfones, both the photochromic and the thermal relaxation properties of the core azobenzene can be tuned. Utilizing this option, we realized orthogonal three&#8208;state photoswitching in mixtures containing two distinct azobenzene thioglycosides.

         <title>Teaching an Old Compound New Tricks: Reversible Transamidation in Maleamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible transamidation is described for different maleamic acids. Amide formation and exchange proceed to equilibrium at room temperature without external catalysts, and the equilibrium composition can be controlled using different stimuli. Thermodynamic and kinetic compositions can be accessed by amide libraries produced in this way. This new dynamic bond can be useful in dynamic combinatorial chemistry.







Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry is a method widely used for generating responsive libraries of compounds, with applications ranging from chemical biology to materials science. It relies on dynamic covalent bonds that are able to form in a reversible manner in mild conditions, and therefore requires the discovery of new types of these bonds in order to progress. Amides, due to their high stability, have been scarcely used in this field and typically require an external catalyst or harsh conditions for exchange. Compounds able to undergo uncatalysed transamidation at room temperature are still rare exceptions. In this work, we describe reversible amide formation and transamidation in a class of compounds known as maleamic acids. Due to the presence of a carboxylic acid in &#946;&#8208;position, these compounds are in equilibrium with their anhydride and amine precursors in organic solvents at room temperature. First, we show that this equilibrium is responsive to external stimuli: by alternating the additions of a Br&#248;nsted acid and a base, we can switch between amide and anhydride several times without side&#8208;reactions. Next, we prove that this equilibrium provides a pathway for reversible transamidation without any added catalyst, leading to thermodynamic distributions of amides at room temperature. Lastly, we use different preparation conditions and concentrations of Br&#248;nsted acid to access different library distributions, easily controlling the transition between kinetic and thermodynamic regimes. Our results show that maleamic acids can undergo transamidation in mild conditions in a reversible and tunable way, establishing them as a new addition to the toolbox of dynamic combinatorial chemistry.

         <title>Cesium&#8208;Fluoride&#8208;Promoted Synthesis of Stable Organocesium Reagents and Their Ambident Reactivities with Arynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different structurally unique thio&#8208;organocesium compounds have been synthesized through a mild, one&#8208;step reaction employing CsF as a cheap source of cesium. This article also highlights the importance of their ambident character to control the divergent synthesis of stable sulfonium ylides and c&#8208;arylation products. Furthermore, fine tuning of these substrates (lacking &#945;&#8208;CH protons) helped in the preparation of various ortho&#8208;bifunctional arenes. As an advantage, reactions in one pot helped to promote the reactions through insertion mechanism to ortho&#8208;functional arenes.







Abstract
Described are the diverse reactivities of novel, stable, ambident thio&#8208;organocesium reagents (bearing electron withdrawing groups) against benzynes. Reactions at reflux temperature predominantly led to the generation of various functionalized stable sulfonium ylides and at 40&#8201;&#176;C the same reaction underwent direct c&#8208;arylation. Furthermore, lack of internal hydrogen on the cesium reagent helped to produce different ortho&#8208;bifunctional arynes in both the reactions. Interestingly, depending on the reactivities of substrates, the one&#8208;pot tri&#8208;component procedure generated either ylides or &#963;&#8208;bond insertion products.

         <title>Engineering PdIr Nanostructures Synergistically Induced by Self&#8208;assembled Surfactants and Halide Ions for Alcohol Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced electrocatalyst engineering: Engineering PdIr nanostructures synergistically induced by self&#8208;assembled surfactants and halide ions were realized to prepare different architectures, including ultrathin nanodendrites (NDs), solid nanosheets (NSs), connected nanorings (NRs), nanoflowers (NFs), and multiply concave nanocubes (MCs). These highly anisotropic structures not only expose rich unsaturated sites, but also protect Pd sites from toxicity and electrical corrosion, which synergistically enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of metallic nanocatalysts with distinct nanostructures and composition is still a noteworthy topic in the electrochemistry field. In this work, we have realized the morphological evolution of PdIr nanostructures in aqueous solution through the synergistic effect of self&#8208;assembled functional surfactants and different halide ions, and achieved precise control of the kinetic and thermodynamic crystalline growth due to the different reduction potential between PdCl42&#8722;, PdBr42&#8722;, and PdI42&#8722;. The actual precursors of PdCl42&#8722; resulted in ultrathin nanodendrites, PdClxBr(4&#8722;x)2&#8722; for nanosheets and fewer branched nanodendrites, PdClxI(4&#8722;x)2&#8722; for nanorings, nanoflowers and multiply concave nanocubes. Owing to the synergistic advantages of structure and composition (alloyed Ir), PdIr nanodendrites exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity, anti&#8208;poisoning ability, and stability toward alcohols (including ethanol, methanol, and glycerol) electrooxidation reactions. The results would be helpful for thoroughly understanding how structure&#8208;directing surfactants and halide ions synergistically determine the production of advanced metallic nanocrystals.

         <title>Tricyanoborane&#8208;Functionalized Anionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Adjustment of Charge and Stereo&#8208;Electronic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tricyanoborane group is a highly promising substituent for the design of versatile building blocks. The introduction of one and two B(CN)3 groups at the N atoms of the N&#8208;heterocyclic core of NHC ligands results in a successive increase in &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability in conjunction with a tuning of the ditopic coordination properties.







Abstract
The 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate anion (2) was obtained in high yield by deprotonation of the B(CN)3&#8208;methylimidazole adduct 1. Regarding charge and stereo&#8208;electronic properties, anion 2 closes the gap between well&#8208;known neutral NHCs and the ditopic dianionic NHC, the 1,3&#8208;bis(tricyanoborane)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenate dianion (IIb). The influence of the number of N&#8208;bonded tricyanoborane moieties on the &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of NHCs was assessed by quantum chemical calculations and verified by experimental data on 2, IIb, and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMe, IIa). Therefore NHC 2, which acts as a ditopic ligand via the carbene center and the cyano groups, was reacted with alkyl iodides, selenium, and [Ni(CO)4] yielding alkylated imidazoles 3 and 4, the anionic selenium adduct 5, and the anionic nickel tricarbonyl complex 8, respectively. The results of this study prove that charge, number of coordination sites, buried volume (%Vbur) and &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor abilities of NHCs can be effectively fine&#8208;tuned via the number of tricyanoborane substituents.

         <title>Circular Polarized Luminescence in 1D Manganese(II) Chloride Hybrids Induced by Chiral Amino Acid Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circular polarized luminescence (CPL) materials attract great attentions owing to their extensive applications in 3D optical displays and encrypted transmission. Inspired by the strategies adopted in CPL materials of lead(II) perovskites, we have successfully attained CPL&#8208;active hybrids D&#8208; and L&#8208;( tert&#8208;butyl prolinate )MnCl 3 by assembling chiral D/L tert&#8208;butyl prolinate with manganese(II) chloride. As demonstrated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, the as&#8208;formed hybrids consist of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chains of face&#8208;sharing MnCl 6 octahedra, surrounded by prolinate cations. The 1D Mn(II) hybrids display strong red emission peaked at 646 nm with PLQY of 67.1 % for D&#8208;type and 57.2% for L&#8208;type, which are among the highest rank of PLQY in 1D Mn(II) hybrids. Interestingly, the 1D Mn(II) hybrids exhibit prominent circular dichroism (CD) signals and remarkable CPL activity with the dissymmetry factor g of 6.1&#180;10 &#8208;3 and &#8208;6.3&#180;10 &#8208;3 for D&#8208; and L&#8208;( tert&#8208;butyl prolinate )MnCl 3 , respectively. The obtained g represents the highest value for non&#8208;lead organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids.</dc:description>

         <title>Lanthanide SMMs based on Belt Macrocycles: Recent Advances and General Trends</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancement of axial magnetic anisotropy is the central objective to push forward the performance of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) complexes. In the case of mononuclear lanthanide complexes, the chemical environment around the paramagnetic ion must be tuned to place strongly interacting ligands along either the axial positions or the equatorial plane, depending on the oblate or prolate preference of the selected lanthanide. One classical strategy to achieve a precise chemical environment for a metal centre is using highly structured, chelating ligands. A natural approach for axial&#8208;equatorial control is the employment of macrocycles acting in a belt conformation, providing the equatorial coordination environment, and leaving room for axial ligands. In this review, we present a survey of SMMs based on the macrocycle belt motif. Literature systems are divided in three families (crown ether, Schiff&#8208;base and metallacrown) and their general properties in terms of structural stability and SMM performance are briefly discussed.</dc:description>

One classical strategy to achieve a precise chemical environment for a metal centre is using highly structured, chelating ligands. A natural approach for axial-equatorial control is the employment of macrocycles acting in a belt conformation, providing the equatorial coordination environment, and leaving room for axial ligands. In this review, we present a survey of SMMs based on the macrocycle belt motif. Literature systems are divided in three families (crown ether, Schiff-base and metallacrown) and their general properties in terms of structural stability and SMM performance are briefly discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids enabled by combining metabolic engineering and visible&#8208;light photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The diversification of natural products to expand biologically relevant chemical space for drug discovery can be achieved by combining complementary bioprocessing and chemical transformations. Herein, we combined genetically&#8208;engineered  Escherichia coli  fermentation to produce amorphadiene and valencene, and metal&#8208;free photocatalysis transformations to further access nootkatone,  cis  &#8208;nootkatol and two hydration derivatives. In fermentation, using a closed, anaerobic condition avoided the use of organic overlay, increased the productivity, and simplified the work&#8208;up process. Metal&#8208;free photocatalysis hydration and allylic C&#8208;H oxidation were designed and implemented to make the whole process greener. We also elucidated that the  anti  &#8208;Markovnikov selectivity of photocatalyzed alkene hydration could be reversed by stereoelectronic and steric effects existing in complex natural products. The combination of bioprocessing and photocatalysis may provide an efficient and greener way to expand the chemical space for pharmaceutical, flavor and fragrance industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Supported Potassium Hydride for Efficient Low&#8208;Temperature Desulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The industrial removal of organosulfur impurities from fossil fuels relies on transition metal&#8208;based catalysts in harsh conditions (ca. 400 &#176;C, up to 100 bar H  2  ), yet desulfurization (DS) of refractory alkyl dibenzothiophenes (DBTs) remains challenging. Here, we report that carbon&#8208;supported potassium hydride (KH/C) enables efficient DS of DBTs in mild conditions, viz. &gt;97% conversion of DBTs is achieved at 165 &#176;C in 3&#8208;6 h while the yields of respective biphenyls are 84&#8208;95% using only 15% excess of KH per a C&#8211;S bond. In addition, KH/C allows to lower the concentration of 4,6&#8208;Me  2  DBT in the mesitylene solution from 1000 ppm to &lt;3 ppm (165 &#176;C, 20 h) and provides deoxygenation, denitrogenation and catalytic aromatic hydrogenation reactions. DS of various sulfur heterocycles using KH/C, a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free material based on earth abundant elements, is viable at low temperature and has prospects for the further development towards decentralized removal of organosulfur species from fossil fuels.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich 3,4&#8208;Ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) Linkers in Tetracationic bis&#8208;Triarylborane Chromophores: Influence on Water&#8208;Stability, Bio&#8208;macromolecule Sensing, and Photoinduced Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three novel tetracationic bis&#8208;triarylboranes with 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) linkers, and their neutral precursors, showed significant red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission compared to their thiophene&#8208;containing analogues, with one of the EDOT&#8208;derivatives emitting in the NIR region. Only the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation was stable in aqueous solution, indicating that direct attachment of a thiophene or even 3&#8208;methylthiophene to the boron atom is insufficient to provide hydrolytic stability in aqueous solution. Further comparative analysis of the EDOT&#8208;linked trixylylborane tetracation and its bis&#8208;thiophene analogue revealed efficient photo&#8208;induced singlet oxygen production, with the consequent biological implications. Thus, both analogues bind strongly to ds&#8208;DNA and BSA, very efficiently enter living human cells, accumulate in several different cytoplasmic organelles with no toxic effect but, under intense visible light irradiation, they exhibit almost instantaneous and very strong cytotoxic effects, presumably attributed to singlet oxygen production. Thus, both compounds are intriguing theranostic agents, whose intracellular and probably intra&#8208;tissue location can be monitored by strong fluorescence, allowing switching on of the strong bioactivity by well&#8208;focused visible light.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the flexibility of MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) through synthetic optimisation and postsynthetic halogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Breathing behaviour in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the distinctive transformation between a porous phase and a less (or non) porous phase, often controls the uptake of guest molecules, endowing flexible MOFs with highly selective gas adsorptive properties  . In highly flexible topologies, breathing can be tuned by linker modification, which is typically achieved pre&#8208;synthetically by the use of functionalised linkers.  Herein, we show that MIL&#8208;88A(Sc) exhibits the characteristic flexibility of its topology, which can be tuned by (i) modifying synthetic conditions to yield a formate&#8208;buttressed analogue that is rigid and porous, and (ii) postsynthetic bromination across the alkene functionality of the fumarate ligand, generating a product that is rigid but non&#8208;porous. As well as providing different methodologies for tuning the flexibility and breathing behaviour of this archetypal MOF, we show that bromination of the formate&#8208;bridged analogue results in an identical material, representing a rare example of two different MOFs being postsynthetically converted to the same end product.</dc:description>

         <title>A Radical/Iminium Domino Strategy (RIDS) for Rapid Construction of Sterically Congested &#947;&#8208;Lactam&#8208;based Multiheterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a Cu&#8208;catalyzed radical/iminium domino strategy (RIDS) for the efficient synthesis of quaternary&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing &#947;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based multi&#8208;heterocyclic structures from &#945;&#8208;bromocarboxamides. This domino reaction strategy enables the construction of multi&#8208;heterocycles in one step. Mechanistic studies showed that two catalytically generated iminiums are likely to be key intermediates in the catalytic cycle. The developed method can be used in a chemoselective manner to produce multi&#8208;cyclic products in the reaction with ketones possessing two different carbonyls.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Linker Chemistry on the Photoinduced Charge&#8208;Transfer Dynamics of Hetero&#8208;dinuclear Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dinuclear, electrochemically twofold&#8208;reduced RuRh complexes differing only in the linker chemistry between the two metal spheres are compared. Whereas the alkyne linker offers a simple trail in a flat region between the metal centers for both electrons and protons, the triazole linker, represented by a large mountain, blocks the passage of electrons between Ru and Rh. However, even in case of the mountainous triazole trail, the holes find their way between Ru and Rh. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Dietzek&#8208;Ivan&#353;i&#263; and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200490).

         <dc:description>Carbamoyl fluoride is a fluorinated group which, to this date, remains underexplored, probably due to the lack of data concerning their properties. In this paper, a study of carbamoyl fluoride is proposed. Stability studies, in particular under physiological conditions, and lipophilicity measurement have been performed. A new easy, safe, inexpensive and metal&#8208;free synthesis method has also been described. Finally, a potential use in radiochemistry through a 18F/19F isotopic exchange has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Activated Liposomal Cell Delivery using a Boronate&#8208;Caged Guanidine Lipid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report boronate&#8208;caged guanidine&#8208;lipid  1  that activates liposomes for cellular delivery only upon uncaging of this compound by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to produce cationic lipid products. These liposomes are designed to mimic the exceptional cell delivery properties of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), while the inclusion of the boronate cage is designed to enhance selectivity such that cell entry will only be activated in the presence of ROS. Boronate uncaging by hydrogen peroxide was verified by mass spectrometry and zeta potential (ZP) measurements. A microplate&#8208;based fluorescence assay was developed to study the ROS&#8208;mediated vesicle interactions between  1  &#8208;liposomes and anionic membranes, which were further elucidated via dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. Cellular delivery studies utilizing fluorescence microscopy demonstrated significant enhancements in cellular delivery only when  1  &#8208;liposomes were incubated with hydrogen peroxide. Our results showcase that lipid  1  exhibits strong potential as an ROS&#8208;responsive liposomal platform for targeted drug delivery applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered as promising large&#8208;scale energy storage devices due to their high safety and low cost. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as the potential aqueous Zn&#8208;storage cathode materials are under the research spotlight because of their facile 2D ion&#8208;transport channels and weak electrostatic interactions with Zn2+. In this concept article, we summarize the intrinsic structural features and aqueous Zn&#8208;storage mechanisms of the TMDs&#8208;based electrodes. More significantly, the latest design concepts of TMDs materials for high&#8208;performance AZIBs are discussed in detail from three aspects of interlayer expansion engineering, phase transition engineering, and structure defects engineering. Finally, the current challenges facing TMDs cathodes and possible remedies are outlined for future developments towards efficient, rapid, and stable aqueous Zn&#8208;ion storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Homolytic X&#8208;H Bond Cleavage at a Gold(III) Hydroxide: Insights into One&#8208;Electron Events at Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of homolytic X&#8208;H bond cleavage by a Au(III)&#8208;OH complex was investigated computationally. Both C&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds are cleaved via a concerted proton coupled electron transfer mechanism (cPCET) rather than a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism (HAT). The results suggest that one&#8208;electron events at gold may be more accessible than anticipated.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8208;H and O&#8722;H bond breaking steps in the oxidation of 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene and phenol by a Au(III)&#8208;OH complex were studied computationally. The analysis reveals that for both types of bonds the initial X&#8722;H cleavage step proceeds via concerted proton coupled electron transfer (cPCET), reflecting electron transfer from the substrate directly to the Au(III) centre and proton transfer to the Au&#8208;bound oxygen. This mechanistic picture is distinct from the analogous formal Cu(III)&#8208;OH complexes studied by the Tolman group (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 17236&#8211;17244), which proceed via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) for C&#8722;H bonds and cPCET for O&#8722;H bonds. Hence, care should be taken when transferring concepts between Cu&#8722;OH and Au&#8722;OH species. Furthermore, the ability of Au&#8722;OH complexes to perform cPCET suggests further possibilities for one&#8208;electron chemistry at the Au centre, for which only limited examples exist.

         <title>Programming Rapid Functional Group Diversification into a Solid&#8208;State Reaction: Aryl Nitriles for Self&#8208;Assembly, Click Reactivity, and Discovery of Coexisting Supramolecular Synthons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting a handle on diversification: Aryl nitriles have been used to support hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly in the solid state to achieve an intermolecular photodimerization. The resulting tetrafunctionalized cyclobutane is amenable to rapid diversification as demonstrated by a post&#8208;click modification. The integration of aryl nitriles as supramolecular handles allows the self&#8208;assembly process to be programmed for post&#8208;modification and conversion of the product to a wide variety of molecules.







Abstract
A method to rapidly diversify the molecules formed in organic crystals is introduced, with aryl nitriles playing a novel dual role as both hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors and modifiable organic groups. The discovery of coexisting supramolecular synthons in the same crystal is also described. The general concept is demonstrated by using a bis(aryl nitrile) alkene that undergoes a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;directed intermolecular [2+2] photodimerization to form a tetra(aryl nitrile)cyclobutane. The product is readily converted by click reactivity to a tetra(aryl tetrazole) and by hydrolysis to a tetra(aryl carboxylic acid). The integration of aryl nitriles into solid&#8208;state reactions opens broad avenues to post&#8208;modify products formed in crystalline solids for rapid diversification.

         <title>Hydrogenative Catalysis with Three&#8208;Coordinate Zinc Complexes Supported with PN Ligands is Enhanced Compared to PNP Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic activity of bidentate three&#8208;coordinate Zn(II) complexes towards hydrogenation of model ketone and imine substrates is enhanced compared to the analogous tridentate PNP system. DFT calculations and experimental evidence point towards a sigma bond metathesis mechanism, instead of aromatization/dearomatization metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity, with the lack of trailing P&#8208;arm enabling the enhancement.







Abstract
This work details the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic activity of reactive low&#8208;coordinate organozinc complexes. The complexes activate hydrogen and they appear to be more active in hydrogenation of ketones and imines than their tridentate pincer analogs. This is thought, in part, to be due to the lack of trailing third phosphorus arm present in previous work. DFT computations reveal a sigma&#8208;bond metathesis mechanism is comparable to an alternative aromatization/dearomatization metal&#8208;ligand cooperative mechanism.

         <title>Measurements and Utilization of Consistent Gibbs Energies of Transfer of Single Ions: Towards a Unified Redox Potential Scale for All Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Consistency: 87 measurements across 10 independent junctions between four solvents and using the &#8220;ideal&#8221; ionic liquid salt bridge ILSB have furnished accurate silver ion Gibbs transfer energies between water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and dimethylformamide that are consistent within 0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. These form the basis for a coherent experimental thermodynamic framework of ion solvation chemistry.







Abstract
Utilizing the &#8220;ideal&#8221; ionic liquid salt bridge to measure Gibbs energies of transfer of silver ions between the solvents water, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate and dimethylformamide results in a consistent data set with a precision of 0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 over 87 measurements in 10 half&#8208;cells. This forms the basis for a coherent experimental thermodynamic framework of ion solvation chemistry. In addition, we define the solvent independent 
&#8208; and the 
 values that account for the electronating potential of any redox system similar to the 
 value of a medium that accounts for its protonating potential. This 
 scale is thermodynamically well&#8208;defined enabling a straightforward comparison of the redox potentials (reducities) of all media with respect to the aqueous redox potential scale, hence unifying all conventional solvents&#8242; redox potential scales. Thus, using the Gibbs energy of transfer of the silver ion published herein, one can convert and unify all hitherto published redox potentials measured, for example, against ferrocene, to the 
 scale.

         <title>Adaptable Optical Microwaveguides From Mechanically Flexible Crystalline Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bent waveguides, especially, singly and doubly bent waveguides are essential for the advancement of photonic technologies. Here, two chemically and optically different flexible organic crystals were fabricated into singly and doubly&#8208;bent shapes from straight geometry using micromechanical manipulation technique to demonstrate optical waveguiding behavior which is required for photonic circuit applications. (Atomic force microscopy cantilever tip abbreviated as AFM cantilever)







Abstract
Flexible organic crystals (elastic and plastic) are important materials for optical waveguides, tunable optoelectronic devices, and photonic integrated circuits. Here, we present highly elastic organic crystals of a Schiff base, 1&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,5&#8208;dichlorophenylimino)methyl)naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ol (1), and an azine molecule, 2,4&#8208;dibromo&#8208;6&#8208;((E)&#8208;((E)&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dichlorobenzylidene)hydrazono)methyl)phenol (2). These microcrystals are highly flexible under external mechanical force, both in the macroscopic and the microscopic regimes. The mechanical flexibility of these crystals arises as a result of weak and dispersive C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl, Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl, Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br, and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking interactions. Singly and doubly&#8208;bent geometries were achieved from their straight shape by a micromechanical approach using the AFM cantilever tip. Crystals of molecules 1 and 2 display a bright&#8208;green and red fluorescence (FL), respectively, and selective reabsorption of a part of their FL band. Crystals 1 and 2 exhibit optical&#8208;path&#8208;dependent low loss emissions at the termini of crystal in their straight and even in extremely bent geometries. Interestingly, the excitation position&#8208;dependent optical modes appear in both linear and bent waveguides of crystals 1 and 2, confirming their light&#8208;trapping ability.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril Inhibits Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Aggregation by Targeting N&#160;Terminus Hot Segments and Attenuates Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards diabetes therapeutic agents: Cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])&#8208;mediated supramolecular modulation of islet amyloid polypeptide aggregation is demonstrated. CB[7] efficiently interacts with different amino acid residues at the N&#8197;terminus &#8220;hot segments&#8221; and alters IAPP aggregation. This type of macrocycle&#8208;based approach has the potential for the development of type&#8197;2 diabetes therapeutic agents.







Abstract
Two &#8220;hot segments&#8221; within an islet amyloid polypeptide are responsible for its self&#8208;assembly, which in turn is linked to the decline of &#946;&#8208;cells in type&#8197;2 diabetes (T2D). A readily available water&#8208;soluble, macrocyclic host, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), effectively inhibits islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) aggregation through ion&#8211;dipole and hydrophobic interactions with different residues of the monomeric peptide in its random&#8208;coil conformation. A HSQC NMR study shows that CB[7] likely modulates IAPP self&#8208;assembly by interacting with and masking major residues present in the &#8220;hot segments&#8221; at the N&#8197;terminus. CB[7] also prevents the formation of toxic oligomers and inhibits seed&#8208;catalyzed fibril proliferation. Importantly, CB[7] recovers rat insulinoma cells (RIN&#8208;m) from IAPP&#8208;assembly associated cytotoxicity.

         <dc:description>Diclofenac sodium is a widely used nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID) as over&#8208;the&#8208;counter (OTC) medication for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Herein, we described the development of an intensified six&#8208;step continuous flow synthesis of diclofenac sodium from commercially available aniline and chloroacetic acid. A challenging and unprecedented etherification/Smiles rearrangement cascade of 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;phenylacetamide and 2,6&#8208;dichlorophenol into hydroxyacetyldiphenylamine operated with the precise control of reaction conditions in continuous flow was realized as key step in this multistep synthetic chemistry. The undesired amide hydrolysis in Smiles rearrangement was addressed and the extra installation of N&#8208;chloroacetyl group in current industrial batch mode was avoided. Diclofenac sodium was obtained in 63% isolated yield with an average yield of above 90% for each step in a total residence time of 205 min.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical exfoliation of two&#8208;dimensional phosphorene sheets and its Energy application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently,  single or few&#8208;layer phosphorene has aroused intense attention due to its exceptional physicochemical properties.  To this end, mass production of high&#8208;quality phosphorene nanosheets with specific functionalities represents a pivotal factor for the basic academic studies and practical applications.  Among the current synthetic methods, electrochemical exfoliation of black phosphorous is one of the most  hopeful ways for mass&#8208;production of phosphorene sheets owing to the uncomplicated apparatus, low cost as well as significant efficiency. Especially, regulating the electrochemical parameters not only induces adjustable phosphorene characteristics but also enables them a promising candidate in energy applications. In this review, a concise and crucial studies of the recent and most representative developments in this domain was introduced, including the relationship between exfoliation philosophy, internal mechanisms, processing techniques, and multiple applications of phosphorene. At the end, a summary discussion and future perspectives is also provided.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rationally Designed Bimetallic Platinum (II)&#8208;Ferrocene Antitumor Agent&#160;Induces Non&#8208;Apoptotic Cell Death and Exerts in Vivo Efficacy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite phenomenal clinical success, the efficacy of platinum anticancer drugs is often compromised due to inherent and acquired drug resistant phenotypes in cancers. To circumvent this issue, we designed two heterobimetallic platinum (II)&#8208;ferrocene hybrids that display multi&#8208;pronged anticancer action. In cancer cells, our best compound, 2, platinates DNA, produces reactive oxygen species, and has nucleus, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum as potential targets. The multi&#8208;modal mechanism of action of these hybrid agents lead to non&#8208;apoptotic cell death induction which enables circumventing apoptosis resistance and significant improvement in platinum cross resistance profile. Finally, in addition to describing detail mechanistic insights, we also assessed its stability in plasma and demonstrate anticancer efficacy in an in vivo A2780 xenograft model. Strikingly, compared to oxaliplatin, our compound displays better tolerability, safety profile and efficacy in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Positive Cooperativity Induced by Interstrand Interactions in Silver(I) Complexes with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;Diimine Ligands.</title>

         <dc:description>The allosteric positive cooperativity accompanying the formation of compact [Cu  I  (  &#945;  ,  &#945;&#8242;  &#8208;diimine)  2  ]  +  building blocks contributed to the historically efficient synthesis of metal&#8208;containing catenates and knotted assemblies. However, its limited magnitude can be easily overcome by the negative chelate cooperativity which controls the overall formation of related polymetallic multi&#8208;stranded helicates and grids. Despite the more abundant use of the analogous dioxygen&#8208;resistant [Ag  I  (  &#945;  ,  &#945;  '&#8208;diimine)  2  ]  +  units in modern entangled metallosupramolecular assemblies, a related thermodynamic justification was absent. Solid&#8208;state structural characterizations show the successive formation of [Ag  I  (  &#945;  ,  &#945;  '&#8208;diimine)(CH  3  CN)][X] and [Ag  I  (  &#945;  ,  &#945;  '&#8208;diimine)  2  ][X] upon the stepwise reactions of  &#945;  ,  &#945;  '&#8208;diimine = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (  bpy  ) or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (  phen  ) derivatives with AgX (X = BF  4  &#8211;  , ClO  4  &#8211;  , PF  6  &#8211;  ). In 5&#8211;10 mM room&#8208;temperature acetonitrile solutions, these cationic complexes exist as mixtures in fast exchange on the NMR time scale. Spectrophotometric titrations using the unsubstituted  bpy  and  phen  ligands point to the statistical (= non&#8208;cooperative) binding of two successive bidentate ligands around Ag(I), a mechanism probably driven by the formation of hydrophobic belts which overcomes the unfavorable decrease of the positive charge borne by the metallic cation. Surprisingly, the addition of methyl groups adjacent to the nitrogen donors (6,6' positions in  dmbpy  ; 2,9 positions in  dmphen  ) induces positive cooperativity for the formation of [Ag(  dmbpy  )  2  ]  +  and [Ag(  dmphen  )  2  ]  +  , a trend assigned to additional stabilizing interligand interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>The use of bridging ligand substituents to bias the population of localized and delocalized mixed&#8208;valence conformers in solution.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic structure and associated spectroscopic properties of ligand&#8208;bridged, bimetallic &#8216;mixed&#8208;valence&#8217; complexes of general form {M}(&#956;&#8208;B){M  +  } are dictated by the electronic couplings, and hence orbital overlaps, between the metal centers mediated by the bridge. In the case of complexes such as [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;&#8208;C&#8801;CC  6  H  4  C&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*}]  +  , the low barrier to rotation of the half&#8208;sandwich metal fragments and the arylene bridge around the acetylene moieties results in population of many energy minima across the conformational energy landscape. Since orbital overlap is also sensitive to the particular mutual orientations of the metal fragment(s) and arylene bridge through a Karplus&#8208;like relationship, the different members of the population range exemplify electronic structures ranging from strongly localized (weakly coupled Robin&#8208;Day Class II) to completely delocalized (Robin&#8208;Day Class III). Here we use electronic structure calculations using the hybrid density functional BLYP35&#8208;D3 and a continuum solvent model in combination with UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR and IR spectroelectrochemical studies to show that the conformational population in complexes [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;&#8208;C&#8801;CArC&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*]  +  , and hence the dominant electronic structure, can be biased through the steric and electronic properties of the diethynylarylene (Ar) moiety (Ar = 1,4&#8208;C  6  H  4  , 1,4&#8208;C  6  F  4  , 1,4&#8208;C  6  H  2  &#8208;2,5&#8208;Me  2  , 1,4&#8208;C  6  H  2  &#8208;2,5&#8208;(CF  3  )  2  , 1,4&#8208;C  6  H  2  &#8208;2,5&#8208;  i  Pr  2  ).</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The electronic structure and associated spectroscopic properties of ligand-bridged, bimetallic &#8216;mixed-valence&#8217; complexes of general form {M}(&#956;-B){M  +  } are dictated by the electronic couplings, and hence orbital overlaps, between the metal centers mediated by the bridge. In the case of complexes such as [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;-C&#8801;CC  6  H  4  C&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*}]  +  , the low barrier to rotation of the half-sandwich metal fragments and the arylene bridge around the acetylene moieties results in population of many energy minima across the conformational energy landscape. Since orbital overlap is also sensitive to the particular mutual orientations of the metal fragment(s) and arylene bridge through a Karplus-like relationship, the different members of the population range exemplify electronic structures ranging from strongly localized (weakly coupled Robin-Day Class II) to completely delocalized (Robin-Day Class III). Here we use electronic structure calculations using the hybrid density functional BLYP35-D3 and a continuum solvent model in combination with UV-vis-NIR and IR spectroelectrochemical studies to show that the conformational population in complexes [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;-C&#8801;CArC&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*]  +  , and hence the dominant electronic structure, can be biased through the steric and electronic properties of the diethynylarylene (Ar) moiety (Ar = 1,4-C  6  H  4  , 1,4-C  6  F  4  , 1,4-C  6  H  2  -2,5-Me  2  , 1,4-C  6  H  2  -2,5-(CF  3  )  2  , 1,4-C  6  H  2  -2,5-  i  Pr  2  ).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Syntheses of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds that permit a flexible introduction of various substitution patterns using inexpensive and diversely available starting materials are highly desirable. Easy to handle and reusable catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant metals are especially attractive for these syntheses. We report here on the synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrroles via the hydrogenation and cyclization of nitro ketones. The latter are easily accessible from three components: a ketone, an aldehyde and a nitroalkane. Our reaction has a broad scope and 23 of the 33 products synthesized are compounds which have not yet been reported. The key to the general hydrogenation/cyclization reaction is a highly active, selective and reusable nickel catalyst, which was identified from a library of 24 earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A High&#8208;valent Ru&#8208;PCP Pincer Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Carbonyl and Carboxyl Compounds under Molecular Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ABSTRACT. Low&#8208;valent metals traditionally dominate the domain of catalytic hydrogenation. However, metal&#8208;ligand cooperating (MLC) catalytic systems, operating via heterolytic H&#8208;H bond splitting by a Lewis acidic metal and a basic ligand site, do not require an electron&#8208;rich metal. On the contrary, high&#8208;valent metals that induce weaker back donation facilitate heterolytic bond activation. Here we report, for the first time, on the efficient hydrogenation of carbonyl and carboxyl compounds under molecular hydrogen catalyzed by a structurally well&#8208;defined Ru IV catalyst 2 bearing a bifunctional PCP pincer ligand. The catalyst exhibits superior reactivity toward molecular hydrogen than does the low&#8208;valent analog and allows hydrogen activation even at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Methyl Viologens of Bis&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;Pyridylethynyl)Arenes &#8211; Structures, Photophysical and Electrochemical Studies, and their Potential Application in Biology</title>

         <dc:description>
Methyl&#8208;viologens containing &#960;&#8208;extended bis(N&#8208;methylpyridiniumethynyl)arenes (arene=benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, anthracene) were crystallographically characterized and their electrochemical properties and one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured. With DNA/RNA, while the benzene and tetrafluorobenzene analogues bind in grooves, the anthracene analogue intercalates due to its large aromatic moiety, and aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. The latter compound localizes within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA, but exhibited cytotoxicity upon photoexcitation, due to 1O2 generation within cells.







Abstract
A series of bis&#8208;(4&#8217;&#8208;pyridylethynyl)arenes (arene=benzene, tetrafluorobenzene, and anthracene) were synthesized and their bis&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridinium compounds were investigated as a class of &#960;&#8208;extended methyl viologens. Their structures were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their photophysical and electrochemical properties (cyclic voltammetry), as well as their interactions with DNA/RNA were investigated. The dications showed bathochromic shifts in emission compared to the neutral compounds. The neutral compounds showed very small Stokes shifts, which are a little larger for the dications. All of the compounds showed very short fluorescence lifetimes (&lt;4&#8197;ns). The neutral compound with an anthracene core has a quantum yield of almost unity. With stronger acceptors, the analogous bis&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyridinium compound showed a larger two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section than its neutral precursor. All of the dicationic compounds interact with DNA/RNA; while the compounds with benzene and tetrafluorobenzene cores bind in the grooves, the one with an anthracene core intercalates as a consequence of its large, condensed aromatic linker moiety, and it aggregates within the polynucleotide when in excess over DNA/RNA. Moreover, all cationic compounds showed highly specific CD spectra upon binding to ds&#8208;DNA/RNA, attributed to the rare case of forcing the planar, achiral molecule into a chiral rotamer, and negligible toxicity toward human cell lines at &#8804;10&#8197;&#956;M concentrations. The anthracene&#8208;analogue exhibited intracellular accumulation within lysosomes, preventing its interaction with cellular DNA/RNA. However, cytotoxicity was evident at 1&#8197;&#956;M concentration upon exposure to light, due to singlet oxygen generation within cells. These multi&#8208;faceted features, in combination with its two&#8208;photon absorption properties, suggest it to be a promising lead compound for development of novel light&#8208;activated theranostic agents.

         <title>Molecular Bridging Enables Isolated Iron Atoms on Stereoassembled Carbon Framework To Boost Oxygen Reduction for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly dispersed Fe atoms on a porous carbon nanofiber framework (Fe&#8722;SA/NCF) are realized by a facile and scalable matrix&#8208;confined co&#8208;pyrolysis strategy based on molecular bridging. Benefitting from highly accessible Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C sites and well&#8208;tuned pore structures, Fe&#8722;SA/NCF delivers boosted oxygen reduction activity and stability via a near four&#8208;electron path, which further demonstrates potential application in zinc&#8208;air batteries, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst.







Abstract
Realizing the synergy between active site regulation and rational structural engineering is essential in the electrocatalysis community but still challenging. Here, a matrix&#8208;confined co&#8208;pyrolysis strategy based on molecular bridging is demonstrated to realize highly dispersed Fe atoms on stereoassembled carbon framework. Both polyacrylonitrile matrix and organic linker from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide sufficient N&#8208;anchoring sites for the generation of Fe&#8722;N4 moieties. A high Fe loading of 2.9&#8197;wt.% is readily achieved based on the scalable approach without post&#8208;treatment. Owing to the presence of highly exposed Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C sites and well&#8208;tuned pore structures, isolated Fe atoms on porous carbon nanofiber framework (Fe&#8722;SA/NCF) exhibits decent oxygen reduction activity and stability in alkaline conditions via a near four&#8208;electron path, demonstrating superior performance as air cathode for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) to commercial Pt/C catalyst.

         <title>Diverse Supports for Immobilization of Catalysts in Continuous Flow Reactors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supports for immobilization of catalysts in flow reactors are outlined, with emphases on sustainable binding with channel walls and catalysts, boosted catalysts loading and ability to maintain fine flow properties. Particularly, the synergy of supports and catalysts are discerned, as well as the specific designs. In addition, fabrication of array&#8208;like catalytic supports and application of advanced fluidic devices are included.







Abstract
The rapid development of continuous flow processes is driving innovations in various chemical syntheses and industrial productions. Immobilizing catalysts in flow reactors allows transformations with high&#8208;efficiency and excludes the subsequent separation procedures. This concept outlines the approaches to incorporate catalysts within flow reactors, with particular focus on the application of additional supports including inorganic materials like silica, zeolite and reduced graphene oxide, polymeric materials like polymer packings, monoliths, cross&#8208;linked gels and polymer brushes, and other materials for specific conditions like transparent glass fibers and glass beads. Furthermore, advanced methods to develop ordered micro&#8208;/nanoarrays from internal walls of flow channels for immobilization of catalysts as well as application of innovative vortex fluidic devices are discussed to inspire new designs of supports for novel fluidic reactors with broad applications.

         <title>Controllable Zeolite AST Crystallization: Between Classical and Reversed Crystal Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A truly reversed crystal growth mode in which the crystallization starts at the surface of a spherically amorphous aggregate and then proceeds towards its center is described. The fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) controlling the crystallization pathway has been uncovered. The crystallization pathway can be &#8220;switched&#8221; between classical and reversed crystal growth by tuning the concentration of the SDA. It follows the classical mechanism at a low ratio of SDA/framework elements, but turns to the reversed crystal growth at a high ratio. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Yue, M. Opanasenko and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200590).

         <title>Revisiting the Environment Effect on Mass Transfer for Heterogenized Pd6Ru8 Metal&#8208;Organic Cage Photocatalyst Confined within 3D Matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Water directly takes part in the formation of H2 catalyzed by MOC&#8208;16@UiO&#8208;66, evidenced by a kinetic isotope effect, in addition to the proton delivery thanks to the hydrophilic nature of UiO&#8208;66. The porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 is essential for the permeation of sacrificial reagent to serve as two&#8208;electron donor, in sharp contrast as one&#8208;electron donor in nonporous CZIF matrix.







Abstract
Artificial light&#8208;driven splitting of water into hydrogen involves multiple links to emulate natural photosynthesis, including light absorption, electron or energy transfer, surface catalysis et&#8197;al., in which, the mass transportation of sacrificial reagent and reactant is always ignored. Metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) of Pd6Ru8 (MOC&#8208;16), assembling multiple photosensitive Ru and catalytic Pd concomitant with directional electron transfer between them, provides an opportunity to explore the environmental effects from the view point of mass transportation without disturbance of other links. Zr&#8208;MOF of UiO&#8208;66 is used as a matrix to heterogenize MOC&#8208;16 and a series of characterizations are carried out to unravel the composition, structure and optical properties. The intact MOC&#8208;16 remains with long&#8208;term photo&#8208;stability and the outstanding photocatalytic activity is obtained by virtue of a long&#8208;lived triplet state. Three matrixes of ZIF&#8208;8, ZIF&#8208;8 derived carbonate CZIF, and UiO&#8208;66 are intercompared for mass transfer based on wettability and porous structure. Water molecule directly takes part in the formation of H2 catalyzed by MOC&#8208;16@UiO&#8208;66, evidenced by a kinetic isotope effect, in addition to the proton delivery thanks to the hydrophilic nature of UiO&#8208;66. The porous structure of UiO&#8208;66 is essential for the permeation of sacrificial reagent to serve as two&#8208;electron donor, in sharp contrast as one&#8208;electron donor in nonporous CZIF matrix. These results highlight the importance of microenviroment surrounding molecular catalysts in view of the heterogenization of molecular catalysts, meanwhile, providing a prominent guidance on how to choose 3D support to bridge the homogenous and heterogenous system.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Poly(ionic liquid) &#8211; Organic Cage Composite Membrane for Efficient Iodine Capture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically micro&#8208;meso&#8208;macroporous poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;organic cage composite membrane with a gradient content distribution of organic cage crystals throughout the membrane was prepared. The composite membrane allows for rapid diffusion of iodine vapor, leading to an outstanding iodine uptake capacity. Furthermore, such porous membrane can be processed into membrane modules for trace iodine vapor capture and interception, revealing its great potential for practical application.







Abstract
The effective capture of iodine with high volatility and poisonousness is significant for reprocessing the spent nuclear fuel. In this article, we report a hierarchically porous poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;organic cage composite membrane (PIL@CC3) possessing a gradient content distribution of CC3 cage crystals throughout the membrane to capture iodine vapor. The introduction of microporous CC3 can significantly enhance the uptake capacity of iodine up to 980&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is superior to that of a pristine PIL membrane carrying large meso&#8208; and macropores (99&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), and CC3 crystalline powder (662&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1). Such enhanced performance benefits from the micro&#8208;meso&#8208;macroporous structure of the PIL@CC3 membrane in which the large meso&#8208; and macropores facilitate the mass transfer of iodine molecules from the external environment into the surface of the CC3 crystal, followed by diffusion of iodine molecules from the CC3 surface into the interior and exterior pores of the CC3 crystal. In addition, the asymmetric distribution of CC3 crystals across the PIL@CC3 membrane also displays its advantage in intercepting trace iodine, revealing its great potential for practical application. This study provides an idea for constructing hierarchically porous membrane composites for the removal of toxic vapors.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Dielectric Responsive Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Material with Mid&#8208;Band Light Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite (HOIP) with two&#8208;step dielectric response, meanwhile, it emits charming green light under 365&#8197;nm lamp (Photoluminescence quantum yield is 9.52&#8201;%). The outstanding two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics of this compound might pave the way for the application of dielectric and ferroelectric functional materials in temperature sensors and mechanical switches.







Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite (HOIP) have received tremendous scientific attention because of the phase transition and photovoltaic properties. However, achieving the special perovskite structure with both two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics is rarely reported. Herein, we report an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite, [(BA)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PbI4] (Compound 1, BA=n&#8208;butylamine) by introducing flexible organic cations (HBA+), with direct mid&#8208;band gap as 2.28&#8197;eV. Interestingly, this material exhibits two&#8208;step reversible dielectric response at 350&#8197;K and 460&#8197;K (in heating process), respectively. Besides, the photoluminescence was found: it emits charming green light under 365&#8197;nm lamp (Photoluminescence quantum yield is 9.52&#8201;%). The outstanding two&#8208;step dielectric response and luminescence characteristics of this compound might pave the way for the application of dielectric and ferroelectric functional materials in temperature sensors and mechanical switches.

         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for ONOO&#8722; are summarized. The chemical structures, response mechanisms, and bioapplications of all the probes are presented. Further challenges and instructions for new ONOO&#8722;&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescent probes are also provided.







Abstract
Peroxynitrite (ONOO&#8722;) as a major reactive oxygen species plays important roles in cellular signal transduction and homeostatic regulation. Precise detection of ONOO&#8722; in biological systems is vital for exploring its physiological and pathological function. Among numerous detection methods, fluorescence imaging technology using fluorescent probes offers some advantages, including simple operation, high sensitivity and selectivity, as well as real&#8208;time and nondestructive detection. In particular, ratiometric fluorescent probes, in which the built&#8208;in calibration of the two emission bands prevents interference from the biological environment, have been extensively employed to monitor the fluctuation of bioactive species. In this review, we will discuss small&#8208;molecule ratiometric fluorescent probes for ONOO&#8722; in live cells or in&#8197;vivo, which involves chemical structures, response mechanisms, and biological applications. Moreover, the challenges and future prospects of ONOO&#8722;&#8208;responsive ratiometric fluorescent probe are also proposed.

A consolidated and detailed study of a library of N&#8208;doped ionic AIEgens along with thorough photophysical, computational, and crystallographic analysis has been conducted to uncover the prominent role of anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, in inhibiting the undesired ACQ effect.







Abstract
Recently, the concept of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions has witnessed unique applications in the field of AIEgen development. In this contribution, we disclose a consolidated study of a library of N&#8208;doped ionic AIEgens accessed through silver&#8208;mediated cyclization of pyridino&#8208;alkynes. A thorough photophysical, computational and crystallographic study has been conducted to rationalize the observed substituent&#8208; and counterion&#8208;dependent fluorescence properties of these luminogens. We further elucidate the prominent role of anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions, &#960;+&#8208;&#960;+ interactions and other non&#8208;covalent interactions, in inhibiting the undesired ACQ effect. Finally, we have also demonstrated the application of selected AIEgens for imaging of mitochondria in live cells.

         <title>2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold Complexes: The Putative Intermediate in Au&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroamination of Alkenes Does Not Protodemetalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Aminoalkylgold(I) complexes, the putative intermediates of Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of alkenes, were isolated and characterized. Upon titration with different acids, the complexes underwent elimination to alkenes. This behavior was further observed in the gas phase following protonation. Together with CID experiments, the results indicate that the origin of the poor reactivity of alkenes in hydroamination reactions, lies in the uncompetitive protodeauration step.







Abstract
Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination proceeds well for alkynes but not alkenes. We report gas&#8208;phase binding energies of alkenes and alkynes to a cationic Au center, which indicate that differences in binding are not the origin of the disparate chemical behavior. We further report the synthesis and characterization of 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes, which would be the intermediates in a hypothetical Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of styrene. The reactivity of the well&#8208;characterized and isolable complexes reveals that protonation or alkylation of the 2&#8208;aminoalkylgold complexes results in amine elimination in solution, and in the gas phase, indicating that the failure of Au&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydroamination derives from a non&#8208;competitive protodeauration step. We analyze possible transition states for the protodeauration, and identify an insufficiently strong Au&#8208;proton interaction as the reason that the transition states lie too high in energy to compete.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Flavonoid&#8208;Cinnamic Acid Amide Hybrids with Distinct Activity against Neurodegeneration in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flavonoid&#8208;cinnamic acid amides were synthesized and evaluated in phenotypic screening assays related to neurodegeneration. The compounds prevent cell death in models of oxidative stress and energy breakdown. The introduction of an amide yielded higher stability towards hydrolysis and altering the flavonoid core structure showed that the quercetin&#8208;cinnamic acid amide hybrid was the most potent compound, and its in&#8197;vitro properties could be translated into high activity in an in&#8197;vivo AD mouse model.







Abstract
Flavonoids are polyphenolic natural products and have shown significant potential as disease&#8208;modifying agents against neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD), with activities even in&#8197;vivo. Hybridization of the natural products taxifolin and silibinin with cinnamic acid led to an overadditive effect of these compounds in several phenotypic screening assays related to neurodegeneration and AD. Therefore, we have exchanged the flavonoid part of the hybrids with different flavonoids, which show higher efficacy than taxifolin or silibinin, to improve the activity of the respective hybrids. Chemical connection between the flavonoid and cinnamic acid was realized by an amide instead of a labile ester bond to improve stability towards hydrolysis. To investigate the influence of a double bond at the C&#8208;ring of the flavonoid, the dehydro analogues of the respective hybrids were also synthesized. All compounds obtained show neuroprotection against oxytosis, ferroptosis and ATP&#8208;depletion, respectively, in the murine hippocampal cell line HT22. Interestingly, the taxifolin and the quercetin derivatives are the most active compounds, whereby the quercetin derivate shows even more pronounced activity than the taxifolin one in all assays applied. As aimed for, no hydrolysis product was found in cellular uptake experiments after 4&#8197;h whereas different metabolites were detected. Furthermore, the quercetin&#8208;cinnamic acid amide showed pronounced activity in an in&#8197;vivo AD mouse model at a remarkably low dose of 0.3&#8197;mg/kg.

A frustrated Lewis pair reminds us of a dog trying to lick a tail wound but being unable to do so because the bulky protective collar prevents this. Note the cute carborane&#8208;shaped dog toy to relieve frustration until the wound is fully healed. More information can be found in the Research Article by E.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocyclic Cyclobutenes through Desulfinative Spirocyclisation of gem&#8208;Bis(triflyl)cyclobutenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective two&#8208;step synthesis for spiro[cyclobutene&#8208;1,9&#8242;&#8208;fluorene] has been developed that allows the arrangement of substituents on three mutually orthogonal axes (triaxes), represented as the right/left hand of Fleming's rules. This unique molecular scaffold leads to new designs of functional small molecules and macromolecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Hoshikawa, H. Yanai and T. Matsumoto (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200704).

Enantiomerically pure anti N&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;azidoacetyl thioimides are efficiently prepared through a direct aldol reaction from N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione and a wide array of aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by 2&#8211;6&#8197;mol% [Tol&#8208;BINAP]Ni(II) complexes. The straightforward removal of the heterocyclic scaffold facilitates their conversion into a variety of chiral intermediates. Indeed, treatment of the resultant thioimides with &#945;&#8208;amino ester hydrochlorides gives access to the corresponding dipeptides as well as the appropriate manipulation of the azido group yields peptidic fragments of kasumigamide and atrutamycin.







Abstract
A direct and asymmetric triisopropylsilyltrifluoromethanesulfonate (TIPSOTf) mediated aldol reaction of N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione with aromatic aldehydes catalyzed by a chiral nickel(II)&#8208;Tol&#8208;BINAP complex has been developed (BINAP=2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;binaphthyl). The catalytic protocol gives the corresponding anti &#945;&#8208;azido&#8208;&#946;&#8208;silyloxy adducts with outstanding stereocontrol and in high yields. Theoretical calculations account for the stereochemical outcome of the reaction and lay the foundations for a mechanistic model. In turn, the easy removal of the thiazolidinethione yields a wide array of enantiomerically pure derivatives in a straightforward and efficient manner. Such a noteworthy character of the heterocyclic scaffold together with the appropriate manipulation of the azido group open a new route to the synthesis of di&#8208; and tripeptide blocks containing a &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acid.

2,3&#8208;Disubstituted fluorene platforms for the construction of high&#8208;efficiency host materials for green phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Fluorene is a classic three&#8208;membered polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and it has been widely used in optoelectronic devices. Here we explore a simple and efficient strategy for the derivatization at the 2&#8208; and 3&#8208; positions in fluorene unit. By introducing different types of substituents, we design two pairs of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene isomers and use them as host materials for phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PHOLEDs). The green PHOLEDs hosted by these fluorene derivatives realize high external quantum efficiencies (EQE) over 20&#8201;% with low efficiency roll&#8208;off. Particularly, the devices hosted by 2TRz3TPA and 2TPA3TRz achieve nearly 24&#8201;% EQE and 104&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 power efficiency. These results clearly demonstrate that the 2,3&#8208;disubstituted fluorene platforms are potentially useful for constructing host materials.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Installation of Dehydroamino Acid Motifs into Peptides Enabled by an N&#8208;Chloropeptide Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report and demonstrate the practical utility of an N&#8208;chloropeptide strategy for the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The quinuclidine (ABCO)&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N&#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into already&#8208;constructed oligopeptides, including a macrocyclic peptide.







Abstract
Conventional methods for the construction of dehydroamino acids (&#916;AAs), which are a unique class of non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids, require the pre&#8208;installation of special amino acids. Herein, we report and demonstrate the practical utility of an N&#8208;chloropeptide strategy for the rapid construction of &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides. The electrophilic N&#8208;chlorination of peptide bonds is drastically accelerated by a catalytic amount of quinuclidine (ABCO), and the subsequent &#946;&#8208;elimination of N&#8208;chloroamide efficiently provides &#916;AA&#8208;containing peptides in high yield. The strategy enables, for the first time, the construction of a wide variety of &#916;AA residues in peptides without any pre&#8208;functionalized side chains and facilitates the late&#8208;stage installation of &#916;AA motifs into already&#8208;constructed oligopeptides, including a medicinally important macrocyclic peptide.

         <title>Sequential Nucleophilic Substitution of Phosphorus Trichloride with Alcohols in a Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor and Consideration of a Mechanism for Reduced Over&#8208;reaction through the Addition of Imidazole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8208;flow technology enables a sequential nucleophilic substitution of highly electrophilic and inexpensive phosphorus trichloride with three different alcohols including ones that contain acid&#8208; and/or basic&#8208;labile functionalities, and various asymmetric phosphotriesters were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields (53&#8211;83&#8201;%). Mechanistic study suggested that Berry pseudorotation was a rate&#8208;limiting step in the nucleophilic substitution of phosphorus trichloride with alcohol.







Abstract
We demonstrate a sequential nucleophilic substitution of highly electrophilic and inexpensive phosphorus trichloride with three different alcohols in a continuous&#8208;flow reactor. A variety of alcohols including ones that contained acid&#8208; and/or basic&#8208;labile functionalities were rapidly reacted. A over nucleophilic substitution that occurred during reaction of the second alcohol was suppressed by the addition of imidazole. Density functional theory calculations of the sequential nucleophilic substitutions of alcohols were performed both with and without imidazole, and Berry pseudorotation was suggested as a rate&#8208;limiting step in both cases. Herein, we discuss the reasons for the decreased selectivity in the absence of imidazole as well as those for improved selectivity in the presence of imidazole during the second nucleophilic substitution.

         <title>Planarized Phenyldithienylboranes: Effects of the Bridging Moieties and &#960;&#8208;Extension on the Photophysical Properties and Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenyldithienylboranes planarized with (CH3)2C&#8208; or CH2&#8208;bridges, which furnish S&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;&#8201;&#8208;S intramolecular interaction, are produced as a core unit for boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials. Slight difference in the bridging moieties has impacts on the packing structures and relaxation behavior in the excited state. &#960;&#8208;Extension at the thiophene rings enables tuning photophysical properties and Lewis acidity of the boron center.







Abstract
Two kinds of planarized phenyldithienylboranes, which contain (CH3)2C&#8208; or CH2&#8208;bridging moieties, were synthesized. The difference of the bridging moieties affects their packing structures and photophysical properties. In particular, the (CH3)2C&#8208;bridged derivative exhibits a large Stokes shift, unusual for such planarized compounds, that results from a large structural relaxation in the excited state. A series of &#960;&#8208;extended derivatives was synthesized, among which a p&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl&#8208;substituted derivative shows large solvatochromism in the fluorescence spectra, while maintaining high quantum yields even in polar solvents. The Lewis acidity of the phenyldithienylborane derivatives was also assessed by titration with pyridine. The Lewis acidity of the boron center is affected not only by the difference in the steric bulk of the bridging moieties, but also by the electronic effect of the substituents introduced at remote positions relative to the boron atom. These results demonstrate the characteristic features of planarized phenyldithienylboranes as building blocks for boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Modification via Deaminative Photochemical Csp3&#8208;Csp3 Bond Formation Using Katritzky Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method was developed to convert lysine residues on peptides to Katritzky salts directly on solid support. These salts can then be used for a photochemical deaminative Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond forming Giese reaction. The applicability of the reaction was demonstrated with various resins, all proteinogenic amino acids, and a variety of substrates.







Abstract
Introduction of unnatural amino acids can significantly improve the binding affinity and stability of peptides. Commercial availability of such amino acids is limited, and their synthesis is a long and tedious process. We here describe a method that allows the functionalization of peptides directly on solid&#8208;support by converting lysine residues to Katritzky salts, and subjecting them to a photochemical Giese reaction under mild reaction conditions. The method avoids the need for amino acid synthesis and instead offers a late&#8208;stage modification route for rapid peptide diversification. While numerous modification approaches at the lysine amine have been described, this work provides the first example of deaminative functionalization of peptides at lysine. The two&#8208;step protocol is compatible with various substrates, lysine analogues, resins, and all proteinogenic amino acids. Finally, by leveraging solid&#8208;phase modification, this protocol facilitates the functionalization of longer peptides as was demonstrated using biologically relevant peptides of up to 15 amino acids.

         <title>Chlorine&#8208;Substituted N&#8208;Heteroacene Analogues Acting as Organic Semiconductors for Solution&#8208;Processed n&#8208;type Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

Organic semiconductors: Chlorine&#8208;substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues are synthesized and the field&#8208;effect transistors based on these compounds show high electron&#8208;transport mobility of up to 0.04&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
High performance solution processable n&#8208;type organic semiconductor is an essential element to realize low&#8208;cost, all organic and flexible composite logic circuits. In the design of n&#8208;type semiconducting materials, tuning the LUMO level of compounds is a key point. As a strong electron withdrawing unit, the introduction of chlorine atom into the chemical structure can increase the electron affinity of the material and reduce the LUMO energy level. Here, a series chlorine substituted N&#8208;heteroacene analogues of 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (O4Cl), 6,7,8,9&#8208;tetrachloro&#8208;4,11&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thio)phenyl)&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;b]phenazine (S4Cl), 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11&#8208;octachloro&#8208;6,13&#8208;bis(4&#8208;((2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)quinoxalino[2,3&#8208;b]phenazine (8Cl) and 12Cl have been synthesized and characterized. Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on these four compounds exhibit good electron mobilities of 0.04&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, 0.01&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, 2&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 3&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, under ambient conditions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organic semiconductors&lt;/b&gt;: Chlorine-substituted N-heteroacene analogues are synthesized and the field-effect transistors based on these compounds show high electron-transport mobility of up to 0.04&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performance solution processable n-type organic semiconductor is an essential element to realize low-cost, all organic and flexible composite logic circuits. In the design of n-type semiconducting materials, tuning the LUMO level of compounds is a key point. As a strong electron withdrawing unit, the introduction of chlorine atom into the chemical structure can increase the electron affinity of the material and reduce the LUMO energy level. Here, a series chlorine substituted N-heteroacene analogues of 6,7,8,9-tetrachloro-4,11-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-b]phenazine (O4Cl), 6,7,8,9-tetrachloro-4,11-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)thio)phenyl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-b]phenazine (S4Cl), 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11-octachloro-6,13-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)phenyl)quinoxalino[2,3-b]phenazine (8Cl) and 12Cl have been synthesized and characterized. Solution-processed organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on these four compounds exhibit good electron mobilities of 0.04&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.01&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, under ambient conditions. The results suggest that these chlorine substituted &#960;-conjugated N-heteroacene analogues are promising n-type semiconductors in OFET applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Effects of Ring Strain on Cyclic Tetraaryl[5]cumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes has been synthesized. In the smallest of the cycles, the bond angles of the cumulene are distorted to as little as 172&#8211;174&#176; based on crystallographic and computational analyses. Spectroscopic and physical properties as a function of ring size show small but consistent trends as ring strain increases.







Abstract
Cyclic tetraaryl[5]cumulenes (1&#8201;a&#8211;f) have been synthesized and studied as a function of increasing ring strain. The magnitude of ring strain is approximated by the extent of bending of the cumulenic core as assessed by a combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and DFT calculations. Trends are observed in 13C NMR, UV&#8208;vis, and Raman spectra associated with ring strain, but the effects are small. In particular, the experimental HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap is not appreciably affected by bending of the [5]cumulene framework from ca. 174&#176; (&#955;max=504&#8197;nm) in 1&#8201;a to ca. 178&#176; (&#955;max=494&#8197;nm) in 1&#8201;f.

         <title>Chiral Hemilabile P,N&#8208;Ligand&#8208;Assisted Gold Redox Catalysis for Enantioselective Alkene Aminoarylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective gold redox catalysis was achieved with newly designed chiral hemilabile P,N ligands (shown as a heavy load in the truck). We reveal a new strategy through a two&#8208;step sequence: A)&#8197;Apply a chiral hemilabile P,N ligand at the AuI stage to promote AuI oxidative addition toward aryl iodide; B)&#8197;nucleophilic addition to a chiral AuIII intermediate formed in&#8197;situ as a stereodetermining step (SDS). This strategy presents a new opportunity to enrich the versatile reactivity of gold catalysis in an enantioselective fashion. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Li, X. Shi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201018).

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled [3+2] Annulation of Aromatic Acids with Maleimides by C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H Bond Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;enabled palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of substituted aromatic carboxylic acids with maleimides without incorporating any exogenous directing group has been developed. The annulation reaction proceeds via double C&#8722;H bond activation such as C(sp3)&#8722;H and C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation. An external ligand (MPAA) is crucial for the success of the present protocol. A plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed to account for the present [3+2] cyclization reaction.







Abstract
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of substituted benzoic acids with maleimides leading to tricyclic heterocyclic molecules having a free carboxylic group in a high atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical manner is described. The reaction proceeds via a dual C&#8722;H bond activation such as C(sp3)&#8722;H at the benzylic position and C(sp2)&#8722;H bond activation at the meta position of substituted aromatics. An external ligand (MPAA) is crucial for the success of present protocol. Further, the decarboxylation and esterification of the free carboxylic acid group of observed products were carried out.

         <title>A Shared Prebiotic Formation of Neopterins and Guanine Nucleosides from Pyrimidine Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plausible prebiotic availability of 6&#8208;aminopyrimidines makes the formation of purine nucleosides by Traube reaction an interesting pathway to explore. However, the formation of a pterin ring is the preferred outcome relative to purine nucleoside synthesis, which requires a high sugar excess to be significant. We show that a urea&#8208;based solvent is a suitable medium for the formylation, synthesis of purine/pterin ring and subsequent phosphorylation.







Abstract
The prebiotic origins of biopolymers and metabolic co&#8208;factors are key questions in Origins of Life studies. In a simple warm&#8208;little&#8208;pond model, using a drying phase to produce a urea&#8208;enriched solution, we present a prebiotic synthetic path for the simultaneous formation of neopterins and tetrahydroneopterins, along with purine nucleosides. We show that, in the presence of ribose and in a formylating environment consisting of urea, ammonium formate, and water (UAFW), the formation of neopterins from pyrimidine precursors is robust, while the simultaneous formation of guanosine requires a significantly higher ribose concentration. Furthermore, these reactions provide a tetrahydropterin&#8211;pterin redox pair. This model suggests a prebiotic link in the origin of purine nucleosides and pterin cofactors that provides a possible deep prebiotic temporal connection for the emergence of nucleic acids and metabolic cofactors.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;matching between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedges and hydrocarbon solvent molecules regulates supramolecular polymerization and gelation. Such non&#8208;trivial solvent effect strongly evokes the possibility of direct participation of solvent molecules in the nucleation by shape&#8208;matching dependent van der Waals interaction and presence of a closely associates solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers similar to first layer of water molecules around the protein surface.







Abstract
This article reports supramolecular polymerization of two bis&#8208;amide functionalized naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) building blocks (NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C) in two solvents, namely n&#8208;heptane (Hep) and methylcyclohexane (MCH). NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C differ only by the peripheral hydrocarbon wedges, consisting of linear C7 chains or cyclic methylcyclohexane rings, respectively. UV/Vis and FTIR spectroscopy studies reveal distinct internal order and H&#8208;bonding pattern for NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C aggregates irrespective of the solvent system, indicating the dominant role of the intrinsic packing parameters of the individual building block, possibly influenced by the peripheral steric crowding. However, NDI&#8722;L produces a significantly stronger gel in Hep compared to MCH as evident from the rheological and thermal properties. In contrast, NDI&#8722;C exhibits a clear preference for MCH, producing gel with moderate strength but in Hep it fails to produce 1D morphology or gelation. All&#8208;atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies corroborate with the experimental observation and provide the rationale for the observed solvent&#8208;shape effect by revealing a quantitative estimate regarding the thermodynamics of self&#8208;assembly in these four combinations. Such clear&#8208;cut shape&#8208;matching effect (between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedge and the solvent system) unambiguously support a direct participation of the solvent molecules during supramolecular polymerization and presence of a closely&#8208;adhered solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers, similar to the first layer of water molecules around the protein surface. Solvent induced CD experiments support this hypothesis as induced CD band was observed only from a chiral co&#8208;solvent of matching shape. This is reconfirmed by the higher de&#8208;solvation temperature of the shape&#8208;matching NDI/solvent system combination compared to the shape mis&#8208;match combination in variable temperature UV/Vis experiments, revealing transformation to a different aggregate at higher temperatures rather than disassembly to the monomer for all four combinations.

&lt;p&gt;This article reports supramolecular polymerization of two bis-amide functionalized naphthalene-diimide (NDI) building blocks (NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C) in two solvents, namely &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-heptane (Hep) and methylcyclohexane (MCH). NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C differ only by the peripheral hydrocarbon wedges, consisting of linear C7 chains or cyclic methylcyclohexane rings, respectively. UV/Vis and FTIR spectroscopy studies reveal distinct internal order and H-bonding pattern for NDI&#8722;L and NDI&#8722;C aggregates irrespective of the solvent system, indicating the dominant role of the intrinsic packing parameters of the individual building block, possibly influenced by the peripheral steric crowding. However, NDI&#8722;L produces a significantly stronger gel in Hep compared to MCH as evident from the rheological and thermal properties. In contrast, NDI&#8722;C exhibits a clear preference for MCH, producing gel with moderate strength but in Hep it fails to produce 1D morphology or gelation. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies corroborate with the experimental observation and provide the rationale for the observed solvent-shape effect by revealing a quantitative estimate regarding the thermodynamics of self-assembly in these four combinations. Such clear-cut shape-matching effect (between the peripheral hydrocarbon wedge and the solvent system) unambiguously support a direct participation of the solvent molecules during supramolecular polymerization and presence of a closely-adhered solvent shell around the supramolecular polymers, similar to the first layer of water molecules around the protein surface.

         <title>Luminescent Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Metal Halides: An Emerging Class of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIMHs) are ideal as luminescent materials for stimuli&#8208;responsive technology due to their soft crystal lattice and high chemical activity. In this review, the stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors of luminescent OIMHs based on Sb3+, Bi3+, Pb2+, Mn2+ and so on under different stimuli, including contact, pressure, mechanical force, light, heat, and gas molecules, as well as the applications of the stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors are summarized.







Abstract
Luminescent organic&#8208;inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) are well known as a new materials family in recent years. Novel materials and applications of luminescent OIMHs have been explored by changing either the organic component or the metal halide species. Thereinto, the stimuli&#8208;responsive (SR) phenomena in OIMHs have drawn much attention recently, for not only their attractive application potential but also the helpfulness in understanding the stability of OIMHs to the external environment. Herein, the luminescent OIMHs that are sensitive to external stimuli including contact, pressure, mechanical grinding, light, heat, and gas molecules, are reviewed, with an emphasis on analyses of the structural change during the SR process. The applications of SR luminescent OIMHs in widespread fields, including gas sensing, information encryption, and rewritable luminescent paper are summarized. Finally, the challenges that deserve to be further explored in this research field are discussed, which provides certain guidance for the future study of SR luminescent OIMHs.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Copper Phthalocyanine Nanoparticles as Highly Sensitive Sensor for Colorimetric Detection of Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs) have been successfully synthesized and applied to detect various biomarkers. The colorimetric results of Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs demonstrate their excellent peroxidase&#8208;like detecting activity, substrate selectivity and catalytic stability compared to most of the reported enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors. Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs not only overcome the current limitation of polymeric material&#8208;based sensors but also provide a new direction for designing next&#8208;generation enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors.







Abstract
Though numerous nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities have been utilized as probes and sensors for detecting biological molecules, it is still challenging to construct highly sensitive detectors for biomarkers using polymeric materials. Benefiting from the &#960;&#8208;d delocalization e&#64256;ect of electrons, excellent metal&#8208;chelating property, high electron transferability, and good chemical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated phthalocyanine, the design of the copper phthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs) as a colorimetric sensor for a variety of biomarkers is reported. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs are synthesized through a simple microwave&#8208;assisted polymerization, and their chemical structures are thoroughly characterized. The colorimetric results of Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs demonstrate excellent peroxidase&#8208;like detecting activity and also great substrate selectivity than most of the reported Cu&#8208;based nanomaterials. The Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs can achieve a detection limit of 4.88&#8197;&#956;M for the H2O2, 4.27&#8197;&#956;M for the L&#8208;cysteine, and 21.10&#8197;&#956;M for the glucose via a cascade catalytic system, which shows comparable detecting sensitivity as that of many earlier reported enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials. Moreover, Cu&#8208;PcCP NPs present remarkable resistance to harsh conditions, including high temperature, low pH, and excessive salts. These highly specific &#960;&#8208;conjugated copper&#8208;phthalocyanine nanoparticles not only overcome the current limitation of polymeric material&#8208;based sensors but also provide a new direction for designing next&#8208;generation enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterial&#8208;based colorimetric biosensors.

         <title>Revealing the Influence of Diverse Secondary Metal Cations on Redox&#8208;Active Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of secondary metal cations is an attractive strategy for tuning the properties of redox&#8208;active complexes, but work with heavier elements has received less attention than it deserves. Here, a series of complexes pairing palladium with a range of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;valent secondary metal cations has been prepared and characterized. Electrochemical work reveals that electron transfer to the complexes is tuned by the incorporated redox&#8208;inactive metals, opening new opportunities for &#8220;designer&#8221; redox chemistry.







Abstract
Incorporation of redox&#8208;inactive metals into redox&#8208;active complexes and catalysts attracts attention for engendering new reactivity modes, but this strategy has not been extensively investigated beyond the first&#8208;row of the transition metals. Here, the isolation and characterization of the first series of heterobimetallic complexes of palladium with mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;valent redox&#8208;inactive metal ions are reported. A Reinhoudt&#8208;type heteroditopic ligand with a salen&#8208;derived [N2,O2] binding site for Pd and a crown&#8208;ether&#8208;derived [O6] site has been used to prepare isolable adducts of the Lewis acidic redox&#8208;inactive metal ions (Mn+). Comprehensive data from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveal distinctive trends in the structural properties of the heterobimetallic species, including an uncommon dependence of the Pd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M distance on Lewis acidity. The reorganization energy associated with reduction of the heterobimetallic species is strongly modulated by Lewis acidity, with the slowest heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics associated with the strongest incorporated Lewis acids.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Incorporation of secondary metal cations&lt;/b&gt; is an attractive strategy for tuning the properties of redox-active complexes, but work with heavier elements has received less attention than it deserves. Here, a series of complexes pairing palladium with a range of mono-, di-, and tri-valent secondary metal cations has been prepared and characterized. Electrochemical work reveals that electron transfer to the complexes is tuned by the incorporated redox-inactive metals, opening new opportunities for &#8220;designer&#8221; redox chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporation of redox-inactive metals into redox-active complexes and catalysts attracts attention for engendering new reactivity modes, but this strategy has not been extensively investigated beyond the first-row of the transition metals. Here, the isolation and characterization of the first series of heterobimetallic complexes of palladium with mono-, di-, and tri-valent redox-inactive metal ions are reported. A Reinhoudt-type heteroditopic ligand with a salen-derived [&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] binding site for Pd and a crown-ether-derived [&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] site has been used to prepare isolable adducts of the Lewis acidic redox-inactive metal ions (&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt;). Comprehensive data from single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveal distinctive trends in the structural properties of the heterobimetallic species, including an uncommon dependence of the Pd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt; distance on Lewis acidity. The reorganization energy associated with reduction of the heterobimetallic species is strongly modulated by Lewis acidity, with the slowest heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics associated with the strongest incorporated Lewis acids. This hitherto unexplored reorganization energy penalty for electron transfer contrasts with prior thermodynamic studies, revealing that kinetic parameters should be considered in studies of reactivity involving heterobimetallic species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Machine learning accelerated photodynamics simulations reveal the excited&#8208;state mechanistic pathways of fluorobenzenes. The excited&#8208;state distortions promote the cis&#8208;trans isomerization of a &#960;C&#8208;C bond during the nonradiative decay. The distribution of surface hopping structures indicates the photochemical 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclizations of fluorobenzene originate from the dynamical effects, where the instantaneous nuclear momentum drives the &#963;&#8208;bond formation in the Dewar&#8208;fluorobenzenes.Excited&#8208;State Distortions Promote the Photochemical 4&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclizations of Fluorobenzenes via Machine Learning Accelerated Photodynamics Simulations (Li and Lopez)







Abstract
Benzene fluorination increases chemoselectivities for Dewar&#8208;benzenes via 4&#960;&#8208;disrotatory electrocyclization. However, the origin of the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities of fluorobenzenes remains unexplained because of the experimental limitations in resolving the excited&#8208;state structures on ultrafast timescales. The computational cost of multiconfigurational nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations is also currently cost&#8208;prohibitive. We now provide high&#8208;fidelity structural information and reaction outcome predictions with machine&#8208;learning&#8208;accelerated photodynamics simulations of a series of fluorobenzenes, C6F6&#8208;nHn, n=0&#8211;3, to study their S1&#8594;S0 decay in 4&#8197;ns. We trained neural networks with XMS&#8208;CASPT2(6,7)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ calculations, which reproduced the S1 absorption features with mean absolute errors of 0.04&#8197;eV (&lt;2&#8197;nm). The predicted nonradiative decay constants for C6F4H2, C6F6, C6F3H3, and C6F5H are 116, 60, 28, and 12&#8197;ps, respectively, in broad qualitative agreement with the experiments. Our calculations show that a pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of fluorinated benzenes leads to an S1 local&#8208;minimum region that extends the excited&#8208;state lifetimes of fluorobenzenes. The pseudo Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions reduce when fluorination decreases. Our analysis of the S1 dynamics shows that the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions promote an excited&#8208;state cis&#8208;trans isomerization of a &#960;C&#8208;C bond. We characterized the surface hopping points from our NAMD simulations and identified instantaneous nuclear momentum as a factor that promotes the electrocyclizations.

         <title>Luminescent Pyrrole&#8208;Based Phosphaphenalene Gold Complexes: Versatile Anticancer Tools with Wide Applicability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new gold standard: Phosphaphenalene gold(I) complexes are potent anticancer drugs. Subtle structural modifications of the phosphaphenalene core lead to remarkable photophysical properties and enhance the activity of the gold complexes against cancer. In particular, pyrrole&#8208;based phosphaphenalene derivatives exhibit high efficacy towards 14 different brain cancer cell lines including glioblastomas, brain metastases, meningiomas, IDH&#8208;mutant gliomas and head and neck cancers, reaching IC50 values of as low as 730&#8197;nM. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the phosphaphenalenes introduce the possibility to develop theranostic applications. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Herold&#8208;Mende, C. Romero&#8208;Nieto, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104535).
