      <title>Identification of Isomeric&#160;N&#8208;glycans by Conformer Distribution Fingerprinting using Ion Mobility&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>Glycans possess unparalleled structural complexity arising from chemically similar monosaccharide building blocks, configurations of anomeric linkages and different branching patterns, potentially giving rise to many isomers. This level of complexity is one of the main reasons that identification of exact glycan structures in biological samples still lags behind that of other biomolecules.&#160; Here, we introduce a methodology to identify isomeric N&#8208;glycans by determining gas phase conformer distributions (CDs) by measuring arrival time distributions (ATDs) using drift&#8208;tube&#160; ion mobility spectrometry&#8208;mass spectrometry . &#160;Key to the approach is the use of a range of well&#8208;defined synthetic glycans that made it possible to investigate conformer distributions in the gas phase of isomeric glycans in a systematic manner. In addition, we have computed CD fingerprints by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which compared well with experimentally determined CDs. It&#160; supports that ATDs resemble conformational populations in the gas phase and offer the prospect that such an approach can contribute to generating a library of CCS distributions (CCSDs) for structure identification.</dc:description>

      <title>The Weak 3D Topological Insulator Bi12Rh3Sn3I9</title>
      <dc:description>
Research on topological insulators (TIs) has rapidly progressed, notably owing to their intriguing physical properties. These materials are bulk semiconductors but host protected metallic surface states. As shown in the cover artwork, the spins of the electrons in these states are locked orthogonally to their propagation direction. Specific symmetries of the electronic band structure allow dissipation&#8208;free electron and information transport. Therefore, they are envisioned as promising candidates in the development of high&#8208;performance spin field&#8208;effect transistors and quantum bits. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Ruck et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001953).

An N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene functionality at a Si6 siliconoid is shown capturing sulfur with a landing net in the cover art. This directing effect&#8212;active also for selenium and tellurium&#8212;results in the expansion of the cluster instead of oxidation of the unsaturated silicon vertices shown with padlocks.

      <title>Interface amorphization of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus upon the treatment with diazonium salts</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) represents one of the most appealing 2D materials due to its electronic, optical, and chemical properties. Many strategies have been pursued to face its environmental instability, covalent functionalization being one of the most promising. However, the extremely low functionalization degrees and the limitations in proving the nature of the covalent functionalization still represent challenges in many of these sheet architectures reported to date. Here we shine light on the structural evolution of 2D&#8208;BP upon the addition of electrophilic diazonium salts. We demonstrated the absence of covalent functionalization in both the neutral and the reductive routes, observing in the latter case an unexpected interface conversion of BP to red phosphorus (RP), as characterized by Raman,&#160;  31  P&#8208;MAS NMR, and X&#8208;Ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS). Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (TG&#8208;GC&#8208;MS), as well as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) gave insights into the potential underlying radical mechanism, suggesting a Sandmeyer&#8208;like reaction.</dc:description>

The fluorescence chemosensor array (barrels in the cover image) exhibited turn&#8208;off responses to the major types of taste components of wine.

      <dc:description>
Known as a bright and photostable fluorophore, widely employed in chemistry, biology and physics, the DCM molecule and its photophysical properties remain mysterious. Its multiple isomers and conformers, especially the light&#8208;induced E&#8211;Z isomerization, have a great influence on the DCM behavior. A complete investigation, involving structure characterization, HPLC separation, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy and DFT calculations, deciphers the role of the solvent and irradiation wavelength on the fluorescence photoswitching capability of the DCM molecule.

Electron&#8208;poor cyclopentadienide ligands based on neutral, cationic and dicationic imidazolium Cp ylides were prepared. The donating properties of these colorful compounds were analyzed by their oxidation potentials as well as that of their respective ruthenocene complexes. Each substitution by an imidazolium moiety increases the oxidation potential of about 500&#8197;mV. In addition, fixing the imidazolium moieties in the Cp plane by annellation also induces a withdrawing effect. More information can be found in the Full Paper by D. Kunz et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202002801).

      <title>Configurational and Constitutional Dynamics of Enamine Molecular Switches</title>
      <dc:description>Dual configurational and constitutional dynamics in systems based on enamine molecular switches has been systematically studied. pH&#8208;responsive moieties, such as 2&#8208;pyridyl and 2&#8208;quinolinyl units, were required on the &#8220;stator&#8221; part, also providing enamine stability through intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding (IMHB) effects. Upon protonation or deprotonation, forward and backward switching could be rapidly achieved. Extension of the stator &#960;&#8208;system in the 2&#8208;quinolinyl derivative provided a higher E&#8208;isomeric equilibrium ratio under neutral conditions, pointing to a means to achieve quantitative forward/backward isomerization processes. The &#8220;rotor&#8221; part of the enamine switches exhibited constitutional exchange ability with primary amines. Interestingly, considerably higher exchange rates were observed with amines containing ester groups, indicating potential stabilization of the transition state trough IMHB. Acids, particularly Bi  III  , were found to efficiently catalyze the constitutional dynamic processes. In contrast, the enamine and the formed dynamic enamine system showed excellent stability under basic conditions.

      <title>A liposomal FRET assay identifies potent drug&#8208;like inhibitors of the ceramide transport protein CERT</title>
      <dc:description>Ceramide transfer protein (CERT) mediates non&#8208;vesicular transfer of ceramide from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus and thus catalyzes the rate&#8208;limiting step of sphingomyelin biosynthesis. Usually, CERT ligands are evaluated in tedious binding assays or non&#8208;homogenous transfer assays using radiolabeled ceramides. In this study, we present a facile and sensitive assay for CERT, based on F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). To this end, we mixed donor and acceptor vesicles, each containing a different fluorescent ceramide species. By CERT&#8208;mediated transfer of fluorescent ceramide, a FRET system was established, which allows readout in 96&#8208;well plate format, despite the high hydrophobicity of the components. Screening of a 2000 compound library resulted in two new potent CERT inhibitors. One is approved for use in humans and one is approved for use in animals. Evaluation of cellular activity by quantitative mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy showed inhibition of ceramide trafficking and sphingomyelin biosynthesis.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>When carbonyl ligands coordinate to transition metals, their bond distance either increases (classical) or decreases (nonclassical) with respect to the bond length in the isolated CO molecule. C&#8211;O expansion can easily be understood by&#160; p &#8208;back&#8208;donation, which results in a population of the CO&#8217;s&#160; p* &#8208;antibonding orbital and hence a weakening of its bond. Nonclassical carbonyl ligands are less straightforward to explain, and their nature is still subject of an ongoing debate. In this work, we studied five isoelectronic octahedral complexes, namely Fe(CO)  6  2+  , Mn(CO)  6  +  , Cr(CO)  6  , V(CO)  6  &#8211;  &#160;and Ti(CO)  6  2&#8211;  , at the ZORA&#8208;BLYP/TZ2P level of theory to explain this nonclassical behavior in the framework of Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory. We show that there are two competing forces that affect the C&#8211;O bond length, namely electrostatic interactions (favoring C&#8211;O contraction) and&#160; p &#8208;back&#8208;donation (favoring C&#8211;O expansion). It is a balance between those two terms that determines whether the carbonyl is classical or nonclassical. By further decomposing the electrostatic interaction &#8710;  V  elstat  &#160;into four fundamental terms, we are able to rationalize why &#8710;  V  elstat  &#160;gives rise to the nonclassical behavior, leading to new insights into the driving forces behind C&#8211;O contraction.</dc:description>

      <title>Eco&#8208;friendly methodology for the formation of aromatic carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond using green ionic liquids</title>
      <dc:description>A new sustainable method is reported for the aromatic carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation in solvent&#8208;free and mild conditions (no co&#8208;oxidant, no strong acid and no toxic reagents) using a new type of green ionic liquid.

      <title>Efficient Imine Formation via Oxidative Coupling at Low Temperature Catalyzed by High&#8208;Surface&#8208;Area Mesoporous CeO2 with an Exceptional Redox Property</title>
      <dc:description>A high&#8208;surface&#8208;area mesoporous CeO2  &#160;  (  hsm  CeO2) was prepared by a facile organic template&#8208;induced homogeneous precipitation method and showed the superior catalytic activity in imine synthesis in absence of base from primary alcohols and amines in air atmosphere at low temperature. In comparison, an ordinary CeO2  &#160;  and  hsm  CeO2  &#160;  after different thermal treatments were also investigated. XRD, N2  &#160;  physisorption, UV&#8208;Raman, H2&#8208;TPR, O2&#8208;TPD, EPR and XPS were used to mainly unravel their structural and redox properties.  hsm  CeO2 calcined at 400 &#176;C shows the highest specific surface area (158 m2  &#160;  g&#8208;1), the highest fraction of surface coordinatively unsaturated Ce3+  &#160;  ions (18.2%), and the highest concentration of reactive oxygen vacancies (2.4&#215;1015 spins g&#8208;1) .  .  In the model reaction of oxidative coupling of benzyl alcohol and aniline, such an exceptional redox property of the  hsm  CeO  2  catalyst can boost benzylideneaniline formation (2.75 and 5.55 mmol gceria&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1) based on a &gt; 99% yield at 60 &#176;C and 80 &#176;C respectively in air with no base additives. It can also work effectively at room temperature of 30 &#176;C, as well as for the gram&#8208;grade synthesis. This is one of the best results among all the ceria benchmark catalysts in literature. Moreover, the  hsm  CeO  2  catalyst displays a wide scope towards primary alcohols and amines with good to excellent yield of imines. The influence of reaction parameters, the reusability of catalyst, and the reaction mechanism were investigated.</dc:description>

      <title>Tri(imidazole)&#8208;derivative Moiety: a New Category of Electron Acceptors for Designing Crystalline Hybrid Photochromic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>The intermarriage of neutral and tripodal imidazole ligand, tris(4&#8208;(1Himidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)amine) (TIPA), with zinc phosphite yields two hybrid phosphites, [Zn2(HPO3)2(TIPA)]&#183;2H2O (1) and [Zn3(HPO3)3(TIPA)]&#183;6H2O (2). 1 has a hybrid sheet with neutral zinc&#8208;phosphite chains as supramolecular building blocks (SBBs). 2 exhibits 3D hybrid architecture with another neutral zincophosphite chains as SBBs. The structural discrepancy of 1 and 2 is mainly due to the distinct linkage modes between organic TIPA ligands and inorganic zincophosphite chains. Interestingly, compounds 1 and 2 feature fast photochromism in response to UV light irradiation under ambient conditions. The discrepancy of photochromic performance between 1 and 2 is mainly due to the different geometrical configuration of TIPA ligand. Different with majority of reported hybrid photochromic compounds driven by photochromic active units, the photochromism in 1 and 2 is derived from the electron transfer (ET) between phosphite and non&#8208;photochromic triimidazole&#8208;derivative ligand TIPA. Compared with the being explored nonphotochromic polypyridine&#8208;derivative as electron acceptors (EAs), our work provides a new EA model for designing hybrid photochromic materials based on the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ET mechanism. The multiple anti&#8208;counterfeiting application based on 1 and 2 was investigated.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Mixed Functionalized Tetraacylgermanes</title>
      <dc:description>Tetraacylgermanes are known as highly efficient photoinitiators. In this contribution, we present the synthesis of mixed tetraacylgermanes  4a  &#8208;  c  and  6a  &#8208;  e  with a non&#8208;symmetric substitution pattern. Germenolates are crucial intermediates of these new synthetic protocols. The synthesized compounds show increased solubility, due to lower melting points, compared to the symmetrically substituted (uniform) tetraacylgermanes  1a  &#8208;  d  . Moreover, these mixed derivatives reveal broadened n&#8208;&#960;* absorption bands, enhancing their photo&#8208;activity. Higher absorption at wavelengths above 450 nm of these new derivatives causes efficient photobleaching when using a LED emitting at 470 nm. The quantum yields are in the range of 0.15 &#8211; 0.57, depending on the nature of the aroyl substituents. Based on these properties, mixed functionalized tetraacylgermanes serve as ideal photoinitiators in various applications, especially in those requiring high penetration depth. The synthesized compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, NMR and CIDNP spectroscopy, UV/VIS spectroscopy, photolysis experiments and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The CIDNP data suggest that the germyl radicals generated from our new tetraacylgermanes preferentially add to the tail of the monomer butyl acrylate. In case of  6a&#8208;e  only the mesitoyl groups are cleaved off, whereas for  4a&#8208;c  both the mesitoyl and the aroyl group are subject to &#945;&#8208;cleavage.</dc:description>

By contrast, the emerging area of single electron transfer (SET) reactions enabled by NHC catalysis still remain underdeveloped, but offer plenty of opportunities to develop new catalytic modes and useful synthetic methods. A number of interesting transformations were triggered by the SET process from the electron&#8208;rich Breslow intermediates to various single&#8208;electron acceptors. In additions, recent studies released that the Breslow radical cations could also be generated by single&#8208;electron reduction of the electron&#8208;deficient acyl azolium intermediates. These discoveries open a new avenue for NHC organocatalysis to harness radical reactions.

      <title>Probing alpha&#8208;Amino Aldehydes as Weakly Acidic Pronucleophiles: Direct Access to Quaternary a&#8208;Amino Aldehydes by an Enantioselective Michael Addition Catalyzed by Bronsted Bases</title>
      <dc:description>The high tendency of alpha&#8208;amino aldehydes to undergo 1,2&#8208;additions and their relatively low stability under basic conditions have largely prevented their use as pronucleophiles in the realm of asymmetric catalysis, particularly for the production of quaternary alpha&#8208;amino aldehydes. We now demonstrate that the chemistry of alpha&#8208;amino aldehydes may be expanded beyond these limits by documenting the first direct alpha&#8208;alkylation of alpha&#8208;branched alpha&#8208;amino aldehydes with nitroolefins. The reaction produces densely functionalized products bearing up to two, quaternary and tertiary, vicinal stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. DFT modelling led us to propose that an intramolecular H&#8208;bonding between the &#8208;NH group and the carbonyl oxygen atom in the starting alpha&#8208;amino aldehyde is key for reaction stereocontrol.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalysed asymmetric hydrogen&#8208;borrowing catalysis is rapidly emerging as a powerful method for the formation of both C&#8722;N and C&#8722;C bonds. Various strategies have been developed to achieve such reactions, including asymmetric reduction, dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation, enantiospecific reactions and desymmetrization. These methods enable efficient access to a wide range of useful enantiopure amine&#8208; and carbonyl&#8208;containing materials, and a range of enantioselective processes involving alkylation of both amines and enolates are discussed in this Minireview by T. Kwok et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;12912&#8197;ff.

      <title>Frontispiece: An Iterative Divergent Approach to Conjugated Starburst Borane Dendrimers</title>
      <dc:description>
The branches of the tree illustrate the different stages of an iterative, divergent approach to conjugated borane dendrimers. The first stage of the &#8220;growth&#8221; cycle, a proton&#8208;bud, is shown left. The second stage, the functionalization, is shown on next branch, with a Bpin&#8208;blossom. The third stage in the cycle, the activation, is depicted as a BF3&#8722;&#8208;blossom in full bloom. The last stage of the iterative approach, the expansion, is illustrated by a new branch with two proton&#8208;buds ready for growth. The birds look like redox events from cyclic voltammetry, as addressed in the paper. For more information, see the Full Paper by Todd Marder and colleagues on page&#8197;12951&#8197;ff.

      <title>Liposome Boosted Peroxidase Mimicking Nanozymes Breaking the pH Limit</title>
      <dc:description>Peroxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozymes such as Fe3O4 nanoparticles are promising substitutes for natural enzymes like horseradish peroxidase. However, most nanozymes work efficiently only in acidic conditions. In this work, we study the influence of various liposomes on nanozyme activity. By introducing negatively charged liposomes, peroxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozymes achieved oxidation of TMB in neutral and even alkaline conditions, although the activity towards anionic ABTS was inhibited. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles adsorbed on the liposomes without disrupting membrane integrity as confirmed by fluorescence quenching, dye leakage assays, and cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. Stabilization of the blue colored oxidized products of TMB by electrostatic interactions was believed to be the reason for the enhanced activity. This work has introduced lipids to nanozyme research and it also has practically important applications for using nanozymes at neutral pH such as the detection of hydrogen peroxide and glucose.</dc:description>

      <title>Guest Recognition Control Accompanied by Stepwise Gate&#8208;Closing and Opening of a Macrocyclic Metallohost</title>
      <dc:description>Host&#8208;guest binding behavior of macrocyclic hosts is significantly influenced by the shapes and sizes of the hosts. In particular, closing/opening the apertures of the hosts controls the guest uptake/release. We utilized the post&#8208;metalation modification method, which we have recently developed, to achieve the open/close conversions. The starting open complex, [LCo 2 (pip) 4 ](OTf) 2 , was efficiently converted to the closed complex, [LCo 2 (hda) 2 ](OTf) 2 , which has a doubly&#8208;bridged structure. The conversion of this closed complex to the open complex [LCo 2 (hda) 2 (OAc)] + was too slow to be completed, but this gate&#8208;opening was dramatically accelerated by the addition of Na + . The Na + binding was also significantly enhanced by the gate&#8208;opening, e.g., conversion of [LCo 2 (hda) 2 ] 2+ to [LCo 2 (hda) 2 (OAc)] + .</dc:description>

      <dc:description>In this work, zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808&#8208;P has been found to be an efficient and versatile catalyst for amide esterification.

      <title>Concentration&#8208;dependent interactions of amphiphilic PiB&#8208; derivative metal complexes with amyloid peptides A&#946; and amylin</title>
      <dc:description>Metal chelates targeted to amyloid peptides are widely explored as diagnostic tools or therapeutic agents. The attachment of a metal complex to amyloid recognition units typically leads to a decrease in peptide affinity. We show here that by separating a macrocyclic GdL chelate and a PiB targeting unit with a long hydrophobic C10 linker, it is possible to attain nanomolar affinities for both A&#946;  1&#8208;40  (  K  d  = 4.4 nM) and amylin (  K  d  = 4.5 nM), implicated respectively in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and diabetes. The Scatchard analysis of surface plasmon resonance data obtained for a series of amphiphilic, PiB derivative GdL complexes indicate that their A&#946;  1&#8208;40  or amylin binding affinity varies with their concentration, thus micellar aggregation state. The GdL chelates also affect peptide aggregation kinetics, as probed by thioflavin&#8208;T fluorescence assays. A 2D NMR study allowed identifying that the hydrophilic region of A&#946;  1&#8208;40  is involved in the interaction between the monomer peptide and the Gd  3+  complex. Finally,  ex vivo  biodistribution experiments were conducted in healthy mice by using  111  In labelled analogues. Their pancreatic uptake, ~3%ID/g, is promising to envisage amylin imaging in diabetic animals.</dc:description>

      <title>Cationic Fe(II)&#8208;Triplex Forming Metallohelices as DNA Bulge Binders</title>
      <dc:description>Bulges are essential structural elements in nucleic acids. The detection and targeting of bulged DNA sequences are highly important. Small molecules capable of targeting DNA bulges have attracted considerable attention because they can be used not only as reagents for bulge recognition but also as potential therapeutic drugs. Here we report on the interaction of DNA duplexes containing bulges of various sizes and base compositions with a series of Fe(II)&#8208;triplex forming metallohelices. The results obtained with the aid of the methods of molecular biophysics show that the investigated metallohelices prefer binding to bulged over double&#8208;stranded DNA and that their binding affinities towards bulges differ among individual metallohelices. Moreover, their binding affinities towards bulges strongly depend on the bulge size and the base composition of the bulge loop. The investigated metallohelices can enter eukaryotic cells and accumulate in the cell nucleus, allowing them to interact with nucleic acids. Hence, it is reasonable to suggest that the interaction of the metallohelices with nucleic acids bulges might contribute to the mechanism of their biological activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorescence Response and Self&#8208;Assembly of a Tweezer&#8208;Type Synthetic Receptor Triggered by Complexation with Heme and Its Catabolites</title>
      <dc:description>There is increasing interest in development and applications of synthetic receptors that recognize target biomolecules in aqueous media. We have developed a new tweezer&#8208;type synthetic receptor that exhibits a significant fluorescence response upon the complexation with heme in aqueous solution at pH 7.4. The synthetic receptor consists of a tweezer&#8208;type heme recognition site and sulfo&#8208;Cy5 as a hydrophilic fluorophore. The receptor&#8208;heme complex exhibits a supramolecular amphiphilic character that facilitates the formation of self&#8208;assembled aggregates, and both the tweezer moiety and the sulfo&#8208;Cy5 moiety are important for this property. The synthetic receptor also exhibits significant fluorescence responses to biliverdin and bilirubin, but shows very weak fluorescence responses to flavin mononucleotide, folic acid, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which contain smaller &#960;&#8208;scaffolds.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Bispyridinylidenes (BPYs) have emerged as an important class of neutral organic electron donors, with redox potentials that vary widely with choice of substituent. Methods to predict the effect of substitution on the redox potential are therefore highly desirable. Here we show that the redox potential of BPYs featuring iminophosphorano substituents (R  3  P=N&#8208;), which represent the most reducing class of BPYs, can be predicted based on the well&#8208;known Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) for the respective phosphine fragment (R  3  P). Moreover, building on earlier work relating redox potentials to Hammett&#8208;type substituent constants, it is now possible to quantitatively predict &#963;  p  +  values for iminophosphorano substituents from TEP values. These results provide a path for precisely tailoring redox potentials of iminophosphorano&#8208;substituted BPYs, but also give quantitative descriptors for how these highly versatile iminophosphorano substituents can impact the properties of any molecular scaffold.</dc:description>

      <title>Divergent Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Yaku&#8217;amide B and Its Seven E/Z Isomers</title>
      <dc:description>Yaku&#8217;amide B (1) inhibits cancer cell growth through a unique mechanism of action. Compound  1  binds to mitochondrial FoF1&#8208;ATP synthase, inhibits ATP production, and enhances ATP hydrolysis. The presence of one (E)&#8208; and two (Z)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydroisoleucines (&#916;Ile) in the linear 13&#8208;mer sequence is the most unusual structural feature of  1. To uncover the biological importance of these residues, we synthesized  1  and its seven  E/Z  isomers  2&#8211;8  by devising a new divergent solid&#8208;phase strategy. Both the (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;&#916;Ile residues were stereoselectively constructed by traceless Staudinger ligation on resin to ultimately deliver  1&#8211;8. All isomers  2&#8211;8  displayed the effects on inhibition of cell growth and ATP production, and enhancement of ATP hydrolysis, indicating that  2&#8211;8  share the same mode of action as  1. The least potent isomer  8  was isomeric at the three &#916;Ile residues of the most potent  1. These findings together indicate that the  E/Z&#8208;stereochemistry of the three &#916;Ile residues control the magnitude of the biological functions of  1.</dc:description>

      <title>Control of Axial Chirality by Planar Chirality Based on Optically Active [2.2]Paracyclophane</title>
      <dc:description>
Chiral X&#8208;shaped molecules based on the planar chiral [2.2]paracyclophane have been prepared, in which di(methoxy)terphenyl units are stacked on the central benzene rings. At 25&#8201;&#176;C, methoxyphenyl rings freely rotate in solution, while at &#8722;120&#8201;&#176;C, their rotary motion is suppressed in the excited state. The X&#8208;shaped molecules emit CPL at 25&#8201;&#176;C in solution with a large glum value. On the other hand, at &#8722;120&#8201;&#176;C, dual CPL emission with opposite signs is observed. The axial chirality is controlled by the planar chirality at low temperature, leading ultimately to propeller chirality. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Morisaki et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003188).

Light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells have been fabricated for the first time from graphene quantum dots (GQDs) sandwiched by ITO and Al electrodes, to display a broad and strong white emission. The GQDs have been fabricated in gram scale from electrochemical exfoliation of graphite and studied in electrochemiluminescence to gain insight into their optoelectronic characteristics. It is anticipated to use the GQDs in lighting applications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z. Ding et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003395).

Three birds with one stone: New therapies are needed to facilitate synergistic combinations that span distinct antitumor mechanisms. A small library of structurally relevant C,N&#8208;cyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes was synthesized and their pharmacologic efficacy was investigated. The cover art shows the structure of the complex Ru8, which was demonstrated to have three antitumor functions, including potent cytotoxicity, antimetastasis and antivascular activity. The complex deserves further investigation as a promising drug candidate to combat metastatic cancer. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Chen, H. Wang, et&#8197;al.

      <title>Natural Polyphenol&#8211;Vanadium Oxide Nanozymes for Synergistic Chemodynamic/Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
One&#8208;step assembly of tannic acid and metavanadate led to the formation of a type of nanozyme comprising natural polyphenol&#8208;hybrided mixed valence vanadium oxide nanosheets (TA@VOx NSs). In this nanosystem, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of VOx provides the possibility to achieve tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy (CDT). As a valid supplement to CDT, NIR absorption ensures that TA@VOx NSs can realize NIR light&#8208;mediated photothermal therapy (PTT). Such combination of chemodynamic and photothermal activities means that TA@VOx NSs can be applied for effective synergistic CDT/PTT of cancers. More information can be found in the Full Paper by X.&#8208;C. Shen, B.&#8208;P. Jiang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202002335).

      <title>Synthesis and Coordination Behavior of a New Hybrid Bidentate Ligand with Phosphine and Silylene Donors</title>
      <dc:description>This work describes the synthesis and coordination behavior of a new mixed donor ligand PhC(NtBu)  2  SiC  6  H  4  PPh  2  (  1  ) containing both silylene and phosphine donor sites. Ligand (  1  ) was synthesized from a reaction of ortho&#8208;lithiated diphenylphosphinobenzene (LiC  6  H  4  PPh  2  ) with chlorsilylene (PhC(NtBu)  2  SiCl). Reaction of  1  with Se and GeCl  2  resulted in Si(IV) compounds  2  and  3  by selective oxidation of silylene donor. This strong &#963;&#8208;donor ligand induces dissociation of CuCl and PhBCl  2  leading to formation of ionic complexes  4  and  5  respectively. The reaction of  1  with ZnCl  2 &#173;  and AlCl  3  resulted in the formation of chelate complex  5  and  7  , respectively, while the reaction with EtAlCl  2  and GaCl  3  forms monodentate complexes  8  and  9  . X&#8208;ray analysis of  4  showed that the copper is in the spiro center of the two five&#8208;membered rings. Moreover, the copper(I)chloride has not been oxidized but dissociates to Cu  +  and [CuCl  2  ]  &#173;&#173;&#8208;  . All the compounds are well characterized by mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.</dc:description>

      <title>Study of excited states and electron transfer of semiconductor&#8208;metal&#8208;complex hybrid photocatalysts for CO2 reduction using picosecond time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies</title>
      <dc:description>We have previously reported on a semiconductor&#8208;metal&#8208;complex hybrid photocatalyst for CO2 reduction composed of nitrogen&#8208;doped Ta2O5 as a semiconductor photosensitizer and Ru complex as a CO2 reduction catalyst that operates under visible light (&gt; 400 nm) with high selectivity for HCOOH formation of more than 75 %. The electron transfer from a photoactive semiconductor to the metal&#8208;complex catalyst is a key process for photocatalytic CO2 reduction with hybrid photocatalysts. To understand the mechanism of electron transfer from a semiconductor to the metal&#8208;complex catalyst, here we describe the excited&#8208;state dynamics of several hybrid photocatalysts using time&#8208;resolved emission and infrared absorption spectroscopies. Our results show that electron transfer from the semiconductor to the metal&#8208;complex catalyst does not directly occur upon photoexcitation, but that the photoexcited electron transfers to a new excited state. Based on the present results and previous reports, we suggest that the excited state is a charge transfer state located between shallow defects of the semiconductor and the metal&#8208;complex catalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis, structure and properties of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite NUD&#8208;6</title>
      <dc:description>Pure silica zeolites possessing uniform micropores, large surface area and high thermal and chemical stability have been widely studied and used in the fields of fine chemicals and oil industry. The incorporation of Al into the framework of silica zeolites changes their properties, making them more industrially useful as adsorbents and catalysts. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite NUD&#8208;6 with a 16&#8208;membered&#8208;ring pore channel. The Al was directly incorporated into the zeolite NUD&#8208;6 framework, which was confirmed by  27  Al MAS NMR studies and ammonia temperature&#8208;programmed desorption probes. Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6 was not stable when heated at 550&#176;C to remove the organic templates. However, the organic templates in Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6 could be removed by oxidation in nitric acid at room temperature. The obtained Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6H retained the crystalline structure and possessed both micropores and mesopores despite the occurrence of severe structural distortions due to the presence of the corner&#8208;sharing Q  3  Si  2  O  7  units. The incorporation of Al resulted in both medium and strong acid sites in Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6H, and could facilitate its use in adsorption and catalysis.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pure silica zeolites possessing uniform micropores, large surface area and high thermal and chemical stability have been widely studied and used in the fields of fine chemicals and oil industry. The incorporation of Al into the framework of silica zeolites changes their properties, making them more industrially useful as adsorbents and catalysts. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of an extra&#8208;large&#8208;pore aluminosilicate zeolite NUD&#8208;6 with a 16&#8208;membered&#8208;ring pore channel. The Al was directly incorporated into the zeolite NUD&#8208;6 framework, which was confirmed by  27  Al MAS NMR studies and ammonia temperature&#8208;programmed desorption probes. Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6 was not stable when heated at 550&#176;C to remove the organic templates. However, the organic templates in Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6 could be removed by oxidation in nitric acid at room temperature. The obtained Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6H retained the crystalline structure and possessed both micropores and mesopores despite the occurrence of severe structural distortions due to the presence of the corner&#8208;sharing Q  3  Si  2  O  7  units. The incorporation of Al resulted in both medium and strong acid sites in Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;6H, and could facilitate its use in adsorption and catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework Synthesized in a Deep Eutectic Solvent for Dye Adsorption</title>
      <dc:description>Instead of the use of organic solvents, a deep eutectic solvent (DES) composed of tetrabutylammonium bromide and imidazole (Bu 4  NBr/Im) was employed as a solvent for the first time to synthesize covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Due to the low vapor pressure of the Bu 4  NBr/Im&#8208;based DES, a new carboxyl&#8208;functionalized COF (TpPa&#8208;COOH) was synthesized under the environmental pressure. The as&#8208;synthesized TpPa&#8208;COOH has open channels and the DES can be removed completely from the pores. The dye adsorption performance of TpPa&#8208;COOH was examined for three organic dyes with similar molecular sizes, including one anionic dye (eosin B, EB) and two cationic dyes (methylene blue, MB; safranine T, ST). TpPa&#8208;COOH showed an excellent selective adsorption effect on MB and ST. The electronegative keto form in TpPa&#8208;COOH may help to form electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the &#960;&#8211;stacking frameworks of TpPa&#8208;COOH and the positive plane MB and ST molecules. The adsorption isotherms of MB and ST on TpPa&#8208;COOH were further investigated in detail and the equilibrium adsorption was well&#8208;modeled by using Langmuir isotherm model. Together with hydrogen bonding, TpPa&#8208;COOH showed higher adsorption capacity for ST than that for MB (1135 vs 410 mg/g). These results could provide a guidance for the green synthesis of adsorbents in removing organic dyes from wastewater.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from d10 Metal Carbene Complexes via Intermolecular Charge Transfer and Multicolor Emission with a Monomer&#8208;Dimer Equilibrium</title>
      <dc:description>We report a series of two&#8208;coordinate Au(I) and Cu(I) complexes (3a&#8211;3b and 5a&#8211;5b) as new organometallic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, which were based on the carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;carbazole model with pyridine&#8208;fused&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene (PyTz) ligand. The PyTz features small steric hindrance and low&#8208;energy LUMO (LUMO = &#8211;1.47 eV) locating over the &#960;* orbitals of the whole ligand, which facilitates the intermolecular charge transfer (CT) between a donor (carbazole) and an accepter (PyTz). These compounds exhibit efficient TADF with microsecond lifetimes. Temperature&#8208;dependent PL kinetics of 3a supports a rather small energy gap between S1 and T1 (&#916;ES1&#8211;T1 = 60 meV). Further experiments reveal that there exist dual&#8208;emission properties from a monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium in the solution, exhibiting single&#8208;component multicolor emission from blue to orange including white&#8208;light emission.</dc:description>

      <title>Insights on the Pseudo&#8208;Enantiomeric Properties of Bifunctional Cinchona Alkaloid Squaramide&#8208;derived Organocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>The use of pseudo enantiomers is a well&#8208;known method of achieving products of complementary stereochemistry. Only rarely can different enantiomers of a product be accessed without modulation of the catalyst. Recently, a system was reported wherein two different enantiomers of spirocycles were obtained by a cascade reaction of unsaturated pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones with mercaptoacetaldehyde catalyzed by a single optimized cinchona alkaloid squaramide&#8208;derived organocatalyst. It was originally proposed that the  E  &#8208;/  Z  &#8208;geometry of the unsaturated pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;one dictated the stereochemistry of the spirocycle product, but this was not investigated further. In the present work, we have investigated the nature of a pseudo&#8208;enantiomeric organocatalyst conformation applying density functional theory calculations for investigating the transition states for the reaction. Furthermore, the influence of the double&#8208;bond geometry of the pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;one has been studied beyond what is possible to test experimentally. The results provide a greater understanding for this class of reactions that may be applicable in future methodology development.</dc:description>

      <title>Stabilization of Black Phosphorus using Sonication&#8208;Assisted Simultaneous Exfoliation&#8208;Functionalization</title>

Functionalization has been employed to overcome the sensitivity of BP to ambient conditions while preserving its properties. Here, we report a simultaneous exfoliation&#8208;functionalization process that functionalizes BP flakes during exfoliation, hence providing increased protection which can be attributed to the minimal exposure of flakes to ambient oxygen and water.

Thus, with  t  BuLi, an unprecedented addition to C5 of bipy, a regiochemistry non&#8208;accessible for free bipy, was obtained, while coordinated phen underwent  t  BuLi addition to C2 and C4. Remarkably, when LiHBEt  3  reacted with [Re(bipy)(CO)  3  (PMe  3  )]OTf, hydride addition to the 4 and 6 positions of bipy triggered an intermolecular cyclodimerization of two dearomatized pyridyl rings. In contrast, hydride addition to the phen analog resulted on partial reduction of one pyridine ring. The resulting neutral Re(I) products showed a varied reactivity with HOTf and with MeOTf to yield cationic complexes. These strategies rendered access to Re(I) complexes containing bipy&#8208; and phen&#8208;derived chelates with several C(sp  3  ) centers.</dc:description>

We have developed a concise and regioselective approach to chromenes and chromanes via an aryne&#8208;based synthetic strategy. A practical, gram&#8208;scale synthetic route to chromene&#8208;type aryne precursor was explored. Subsequently, cyclization under mild conditions afforded tetracyclic xanthone skeletons with excellent regioselectivity. In addition, the resulting skeletons could be further transformed in order to construct chromenes and chromanes. Our approach provides a concise strategy for the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of chromene&#8208;type xanthones such as 6&#8208;deoxyisojacareubin, cylindroxanthone D, staudtiixanthone D, brasilixanthone A and cudracuspixanthone O.</dc:description>

      <title>Saccharide Recognition by a Three Arm&#8208;Shaped Host Having Preorganized Three&#8208;Dimensional Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Sites</title>
      <dc:description>Generally, cage&#8208;shaped hosts for saccharides can strongly bind to guest molecules owing to the three&#8208;dimensional preorganized hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites. However, the preparation of cage molecules is often difficult due to the low&#8208;yield macrocyclization step. Here, we report a three arm&#8208;shaped molecule possessing pyridine&#8211;acetylene&#8211;phenol units as a new kind of host having a preorganized three&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonding site. This three arm&#8208;shaped host was readily prepared compared to a cage&#8208;shaped analogue. This host associated with lipophilic glycosides to form chiral complexes, and the association constants were sufficiently high as well as those of the cage&#8208;shaped one. Furthermore, this host extracted native monosaccharides into a lipophilic solvent.</dc:description>

      <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonded BODIPY Frameworks with Tunable Optical Features</title>
      <dc:description>The ability to tune optical features of BODIPY materials in solid state is essential for their photo&#8208;related application and require efficiently control of the crystal packing. In this study, such control of BODIPY supramolecular assemblies was achieved by deliberate design and synthesis a BODIPY containing a strong halogen bond (XB) acceptor (&#8211;NO2) and donor (I, Br) to mediate XB interactions. The di&#8208;halogenated structures formed isostructural mono&#8208;coordinate motif  B3  ,  B4  (1D tubular structure) and symmetric bifurcated motif  B4&#8208;II  (1D zig&#8208;zag chains structure) via N&#8208;O&#183;&#183;&#183;I, Br XB interactions. These XB interactions promote singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet reverse intersystem crossing due to delocalization of oxygen electrons partially onto the Br and I, which leads to unexpected fluorescence enhancement of  B4&#8208;II  .

      <title>Synthetically Versatile Nitrogen Acyclic Carbene stabilized Gold Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have received significant attention as gold nanoparticle stabilizers due to their strong binding affinity towards gold. However, their tunability is limited by the difficulty in obtaining nonsymmetric NHCs. In this regard, N&#8208;acyclic carbenes (NACs) are attractive alternatives due to their high synthetic versatility, allowing easy tuning of their steric and electronic properties towards specific applications. This work reports the first series of stable and monodisperse NAC&#8208;functionalized gold nanoparticles. These particles with sizes ranging 3.8 to 11.6 nm were characterized using NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and TEM. The nanoparticles display good stability at elevated temperatures and for extended periods both dried or dispersed in a medium, as well as in the presence of exogenous thiols. Importantly, these NAC&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles offer a promising and versatile alternative to NHC&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles.</dc:description>

Importantly, these NAC&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles offer a promising and versatile alternative to NHC&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Transition Metal&#8208;promoted Reactions in Aqueous Media and Biological Settings</title>
      <dc:description>During the last decade, there has been a tremendous interest for developing non&#8208;natural biocompatible transformations in biologically relevant media. Among the different encountered strategies, the use of transition metal complexes offers unique possibilities due to their high transformative power. However, translating the potential of metal catalysts to biological settings, including living cells or small&#8208;animal models such as mice or zebrafish, poses numerous challenges associated to their biocompatibility, and their stability and reactivity in crowded aqueous environments. Herein, we describe the most relevant advances in this direction, with a particular emphasis on the systems&#8217; structure, their mode of action and the mechanistic bases of each transformation. Thus, the key challenges from an organometallic perspective might be more easily identified.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the Thermal Stability and Photoisomerization of Azoheteroarenes through Macrocycle Strain</title>
      <dc:description>Azobenzene and its derivatives are one of the most&#8208;widespread molecular scaffolds in a range of modern applications, as well as in fundamental research. After photoexcitation, azo&#8208;based photoswitches revert back to the most stable isomer in a timescale ( [[EQUATION]] ) that determines the range of potential applications. Attempts to bring [[EQUATION]] to extreme values prompted to the development of azobenzene and azoheteroarene derivatives that either rebalance the E&#8208; and Z&#8208; isomer stabilities, or exploit unconventional thermal isomerization mechanisms. In the former case, one successful strategy has been the creation of macrocycle strain, which tends to impact the E/Z stability asymmetrically, and thus significantly modify [[EQUATION]] . On the bright side, bridged derivatives have shown an improved optical switching owing to the higher quantum yields and absence of degradation. However, in most (if not all) cases, bridged derivatives display a  reversed  thermal stability (more stable Z&#8208;isomer), and smaller [[EQUATION]] than the acyclic counterparts, which restricts their potential interest to applications requiring a fast forward and backwards switch. In this paper, we investigate the impact of alkyl bridges to the thermal stability of phenyl&#8208;azoheteroarenes using computational methods, and we reveal that is indeed possible to combine such improved photo&#8208;switching characteristics while preserving the  regular  thermal stability (more stable E&#8208;isomer), and increased [[EQUATION]] values under the appropriate connectivity and bridge length.</dc:description>
