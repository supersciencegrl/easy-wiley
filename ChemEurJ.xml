         <title>Boosting Energy&#8208;Transfer Processes via Dispersion Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The generation of open&#8208;shell intermediates under mild conditions has opened broad synthetic opportunities during this century. However, these reactive species require a tailored tuning of experimental parameters in order to efficiently convert substrates into products. This time&#8208;consuming process is often case&#8208;specific and requires an iteration for each new method. We report a general approach that can overcome these ubiquitous limitations for several visible&#8208;light promoted energy&#8208;transfer processes. The use of either naphthalene (5&#8208;20 equiv.) or simple binaphthyl derivatives (10&#8208;30 mol%) greatly increases their efficiency, giving rise to a new strategy for catalysis. The trend is consistent among different media, photocatalysts, light sources and substrates, allowing one to improve existing methods, to more easily optimize conditions for new ones, and, moreover, to disclose otherwise inaccessible reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 and H2O with Zn(II) Complexes Through Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air and water&#8208;stable zinc (II) complexes of neutral pincer bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;2,6&#8208;di(amino)pyridine (&#8220;PN3P&#8221;) ligands are reported. These compounds, [Zn(&#954;2&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3))Br2] (R = Me, 1; R = H, 2), were shown to be capable of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 at &#8208;2.3 V vs. Fc+/0 to selectively yield CO in mixed water/acetonitrile solutions. These complexes also electrocatalytically generate H2 from water in acetonitrile solutions, at the same potential, with Faradaic efficiencies of up to 90%. DFT computations support a proposed mechanism involving the first reduction of 1 or 2 occurring at the PN3P ligand. Furthermore, computational analysis suggested a mechanism involving metal&#8208;ligand cooperation of a Lewis acidic Zn(II) and a basic ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of quasi solid electrolytes in organic based electrochromic devices: A mini review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interest in all solid organic based electrochromic devices (ECDs) is on the increase. This is because these devices offer the applicability of electrochromic materials in products such as smart sensors, smart windows, flexible wearables and energy storage devices. The use of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes for the construction of these ECDs is attractive because of their ease of preparation, availability, low cost, improve electrochromic performance, good ionic conductivity and prevention of leakages in ECDs. Hence, in this review, a detailed discussion is presented on the progress in the development of semi&#8208;solid electrolytes for ECDs fabrication. The preparation of the most common electrolytes that have been applied for organic based ECDs are summarized. Particular attention is given to efforts and strategies that have been adopted to improve the efficiency of quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes. Importantly, knowledge gaps that warrant further research are clearly identified and recommendations for future works are suggested. This review will be very beneficial for both established and new researchers in the field of electrochromic devices and material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Liquid Crystalline Nanoparticles via Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: Morphology Evolution and Function Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarized the morphology evolution, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and potential application of liquid crystalline (LC) nanoassemblies by polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly(PISA). Under the regulation of LC ordering and PISA process, LC nanoassemblies showed abundant morphologies and specific formation evolution. According to the LC mesogen, the studies were divided into fluoro&#8208;containing, azobenzene, poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) and others to be introduced respectively.







Abstract
Liquid crystalline nanoparticles (LC NPs) are a kind of polymer NPs with LC mesogens, which can form special anisotropic morphologies due to the influence of LC ordering. Owing to the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of the LC blocks, LC NPs show abundant morphology evolution behaviors in response to external regulation. LC NPs have great application potential in nano&#8208;devices, drug delivery, special fibers and other fields. Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) method can synthesize LC NPs at high solid content, reducing the harsh demand for reaction solvent of the LC polymers, being a better choice for large&#8208;scale production. In this review, we introduced recent research progress of PISA&#8208;LC NPs by dividing them into several parts according to the LC mesogen, and discussed the improvement of experimental conditions and the potential application of these polymers.

         <title>Enhancing Intrinsic Magnetic Hardness by Modulating Antagonistic Interactions in the Rare&#8208;Earth&#8208;Free Magnetic Solid Solution Hf2Fe1&#8722;&#948;Ru5&#8722;xIrx+&#948;B2</title>

Experimental and computational investigations of the solid solution Hf2Fe1&#8722;&#948;Ru5&#8722;xIrx+&#948;B2 show that modulating antagonistic magnetic interactions enables the realization of permanent magnets at room temperature.







Abstract
The quinary members in the solid solution Hf2Fe1&#8722;&#948;Ru5&#8722;xIrx+&#948;B2 (x=1&#8211;4, VE=63&#8211;66) have been investigated experimentally and computationally. They were synthesized via arc&#8208;melting and analyzed by EDX and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted a preference for magnetic ordering in all members, but with a strong competition between ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetism arising from interchain Fe&#8722;Fe interactions. The spin exchange and magnetic anisotropy energies predicted the lowest magnetic hardness for x=1 and 3 and the highest for x=2. Magnetization measurements confirm the DFT predictions and demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic ordering (TN=55&#8211;70&#8197;K) found at low magnetic fields changed to ferromagnetic (TC=150&#8211;750&#8197;K) at higher fields, suggesting metamagnetic behavior for all samples. As predicted, Hf2FeRu3Ir2B2 has the highest intrinsic coercivity (Hc=74&#8197;kA/m) reported to date for Ti3Co5B2&#8208;type phases. Furthermore, all coercivities outperform that of ferromagnetic Hf2FeIr5B2, indicating the importance of AFM interactions in enhancing magnetic anisotropy in these materials. Importantly, two members (x=1 and 4) maintain intrinsic coercivities in the semi&#8208;hard range at room temperature. This study opens an avenue for controlling magnetic hardness by modulating antagonistic AFM and FM interactions in low&#8208;dimensional rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free magnetic materials.

         <title>Proton transfer and regulation across chemical interfaces by small&#8208;molecule assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We study proton transport across a membrane mimic composed of the liquid&#8208;liquid interface between an aqueous solution and an organic solution. The proton transport across this membrane mimic can be quantified and analyzed by impedance spectroscopy. We show that the interfacial proton movement is controlled by the pH of the aqueous phase and cross&#8208;membrane proton transfer rate is higher at lower pHs. We utilize proton transporters found in the electron transport chain such as ubiquinols and 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenol to further influence the rate of proton shuttling. The ubiquinols are effective in transporting protons across the membrane when paired with a reducing agent that activates their high rate cross&#8208;membrane proton movement. 2,4&#8208;Dinitrophenol's acts as a pH activated proton transporter only active at pH&gt;4.







Abstract
We report on measurements and control of proton gradient across interfaces of water and dichloroethane. Such interfaces are interesting as mimics of biological membranes. We use impedance spectroscopy to quantify interfacial proton gradient and identify proton transfer modes. We quantify proton movement using reciprocal of time constant (&#964;&#8722;1) acquired from electrochemical impedance modeling. We show that proton gradient across interfaces of water/dichloroethane and &#964;&#8722;1 correlate with the aqueous phase pH, changing from ca. 1&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;1 to 0.2&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;7. &#964;&#8722;1 changes in the presence of proton shuttling fat&#8208;soluble molecules. Dinitrophenol acts as a pH activated proton coupler which is active at around neutral pH and inert at pH &lt;4. However, quinone type cofactors change the interfacial proton transport when activated by redox reactions with ferrocene type molecules, such as decamethyl ferrocence (DMFc). Quinone type cofactors show distinct features in their impedance response assigned to a proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) process, different from the uncoupled proton transfer activity of dinitrophenol. The observed PCET reaction significantly changes &#964;&#8722;1. We use &#964;&#8722;1 as a proton transport descriptor. In particular, CoQ10&#8208;DMFc shows a &#964;&#8722;1 of 3.5&#8197;s&#8722;1 at pH&#8197;7, indicating how small&#8208;molecule assemblies change proton availability.

         <title>The Impact of ortho&#8208;substituents on Bonding in Silver(I) and Halogen(I) Complexes of 2&#8208;Mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;Disubstituted Pyridines: An In&#8208;Depth Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>

2&#8208;Mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines reveal remarkable bonding preference in linear bis&#8208;coordinate silver(I) and halogen(I) complexes investigated in 15&#8197;N NMR solution spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and Density Functional Theory.







Abstract
The coordination nature of 2&#8208;mono&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with electron&#8208;withdrawing halogen and electron&#8208;donating methyl groups for [N&#8722;X&#8722;N]+ (X=I, Br) complexations have been studied using 15N NMR, X&#8208;ray crystallography, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The 15N NMR chemical shifts reveal iodine(I) and bromine(I) prefer to form complexes with 2&#8208;substituted pyridines and only 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine. The crystalline halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;substituted pyridines were characterized by using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, but 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines were unable to form stable crystalline halogen(I) complexes due to the lower nucleophilicity of the pyridinic nitrogen. In contrast, the halogen(I) complexes of 2,6&#8208;dimethylpyridine, which has a more basic nitrogen, are characterized by X&#8208;crystallography, which complements the 15N NMR studies. DFT calculations reveal that the bond energies for iodine(I) complexes vary between &#8722;291 and &#8722;351&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and for bromine between &#8722;370 and &#8722;427 kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The bond energies of halogen(I) complexes of 2&#8208;halopyridines with more nucleophilic nitrogen are 66&#8208;76&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 larger than those of analogous 2,6&#8208;dihalopyridines with less nucleophilic nitrogen. The experimental and DFT results show that the electronic influence of ortho&#8208;halogen substituents on pyridinic nitrogen leads to a completely different preference for the coordination bonding of halogen(I) ions, providing new insights into bonding in halogen(I) chemistry.

         <title>Mn(III) O^N^O Complexes as Water&#8208;tolerant and Environmentally Benign Catalysts for Polyurethane Foam Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salicaldimine&#8208;based O^N^O&#8208;pincer complexes of Mn(III) and Fe(III) serve as excellent, environmentally benign catalysts for the preparation of polyurethane foams. These compounds show high activities, stability in aqueous environments and are non&#8208;volatile, and are therefore suitable alternatives to Sn&#8208; or amine&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Polyurethanes are synthesized on industrial scale by the reaction of diisocyanates with diols in the presence of catalysts which are commonly based on tin complexes and amines. However, due to the toxicity and volatility of these tin catalysts and amines, there is the need to develop new catalysts that are more environmentally benign. Herein, we report the synthesis of O^N^O pincer&#8208;ligated Mn(III) and Fe(III) complexes that serve as suitable catalysts for urethane formation and are stable to hydrolysis as predicted by computations and observed experimentally. The O^N^O pincer scaffold is vital to the activity of these catalysts, simultaneously ensuring increased solubility in the reaction medium as well as providing a stable framework upon dissociation of co&#8208;ligands in the catalytic cycle. In silico mechanistic investigations for urethane formation show that the stabilization of active species in square&#8208;planar geometries enabled by these O^N^O ligands permit the simultaneous coordination of alcohol and isocyanate in suitable configuration at the metal center.

         <dc:description>
We describe a new method for the selective para&#8208;alkylation of anilines. The approach has been applied to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and has allowed the identification of new structures with improved anti&#8208;inflammatory properties.







Abstract
Anilines are core motifs in a variety of important molecules including medicines, materials and agrochemicals. We report a straightforward procedure that allows access to new chemical space of anilines via their para&#8208;C&#8722;H alkylation. The method utilizes commercially available catalytic H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;B(C6F5)3 and is highly selective for para&#8208;C&#8208;alkylation (over N&#8208;alkylation and ortho&#8208;C&#8208;alkylation) of anilines, with a wide scope in both the aniline substrates and alkene coupling partners. Readily available alkenes are used, and include new classes of alkene for the first time. The mild reaction conditions have allowed the procedure to be applied to the late&#8208;stage&#8208;functionalization of non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including fenamic acids and diclofenac. The formed novel NSAID derivatives display improved anti&#8208;inflammatory properties over the parent NSAID structure.

         <title>Short&#8208;Process Regeneration of Highly Stable Spherical LiCoO2 Cathode Materials from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries through Carbonate Precipitation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A creative co&#8208;precipitation strategy to synthesize spherical Al doped precursors and cathode materials with ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) as precipitant from sulfuric acid leaching has been demonstrated by optimal parameters. And the cell with as&#8208;regenerated Al&#8208;doped LiCoO2 cathode material delivers excellent cyclic stability and rate performance, realizing the high&#8208;efficiency recycling and utilization of high&#8208;value Li and Co.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficacy recycling of spent lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) batteries is one of the key tasks in realizing a global resource security strategy due to the rareness of lithium (Li) and cobalt (Co) resources. However, it is of great significance to develop the innovative recycle methods for spent LiCoO2, simultaneously realizing the efficient recovery of valuable elements and the regeneration of high&#8208;performance LiCoO2. Herein, a novel strategy of regenerating LiCoO2 cathode is proposed, which involves the preparation of micro&#8208;spherical aluminum (Al)&#8208;doped lithium&#8208;lacked precursor (Li2xCo1&#8722;x&#8722;yAl2/3yCO3, remarked as &#8220;PLCAC&#8221;) via ammonium bicarbonate coprecipitation. The comprehensive conditions affecting particle growth kinetics, morphology and particle size the has been investigated in detail by physical characterizations and electrochemical measurements. And the optimized Al&#8208;doped LiCoO2 materials with high&#8208;density sphericity (LiCo1&#8722;zAlzO2, remarked as &#8220;LCAO&#8221;) shows a high initial specific capacity of 161&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and excellent capacity retention of 99.5&#8201;% within 100 cycles at 1&#8197;C in the voltage range of 2.8 to 4.3&#8197;V. Our work provides valuable insights into the featured design of LiCoO2 precursors and cathode materials from spent LiCoO2 batteries, potentially guaranteeing the high&#8208;efficacy recycling and utilization of strategic resources.

         <title>Metal Activation Produces Different Reaction Environments for Intermediates during Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Widely used metal pretreatment&#8211;activation methods create different environments experienced by oxidative&#8208;addition intermediates, during the synthesis of organozinc reagents from organohalides and zinc metal. A developed fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) method reveals these differences.







Abstract
Commercial zinc metal powder requires activation for consistent and reliable use as a reductant in the formation of organozinc reagents from organohalides, and for the avoidance of supplier and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variability. However, the impact of activation methods on the reaction environments of subsequent intermediates has been unknown. Herein, a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) method is developed to bridge this knowledge gap, by imaging and examining reaction intermediates on zinc metal that has been activated by pretreatment through different common methods (i.&#8201;e., by chemical activation with TMSCl, dibromoethane, or HCl; or by mechanical activation). The group of chemical activating agents, previously thought to act similarly by removing oxide layers, are here shown to produce markedly different reaction environments experienced by subsequent oxidative&#8208;addition intermediates from organohalides &#8211; data uniquely available through FLIM's ability to detect small quantities of intermediates in&#8197;situ coupled with its microenvironmental sensitivity. These different microenvironments potentially give rise to different rates of formation, subsequent solubilization, and reactivity, despite the shared &#8220;[RZnX]&#8221; molecular structure of these intermediates. This information revises models for methods development for oxidative addition to currently sluggish metals beyond zinc by establishing diverse outcomes for pretreatment activation methods that were previously considered similar.

         <title>Anthraquinone&#8208;Modified Silica Nanoparticles as Heterogeneous Photocatalyst for the Oxidative Hydroxylation of Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of a heterogeneous photocatalyst based on surface&#8208;modified spherical silica nanoparticles with anthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid are presented. The nanomaterial was successfully applied in the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to produce phenols in high yields with low catalyst loading and was reused at least five. This heterogeneous system demonstrated promising catalytic activity for conducting organic transformations under sustainable conditions.







Abstract
In this work, the synthesis and characterization of a heterogeneous photocatalyst based on spherical silica nanoparticles superficially modified with anthraquinone 2&#8208;carboxylic acid (AQ&#8722;COOH) are presented. The nanomaterial was characterized by TEM, SEM, FT&#8208;IR, diffuse reflectance, fluorescence, NMR, DLS, XRD and XPS. These analyses confirm the covalent linking of AQ&#8722;COOH with the NH2 functionality in the nanomaterial and, more importantly, the photocatalyst retains its photophysical properties once bound. The heterogeneous photocatalyst was successfully employed in the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids to phenols under sustainable reaction conditions. Phenols were obtained in high yields (up to 100&#8201;%) with low catalyst loading (3.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), reaching TOF values of 3.7&#8197;h&#8722;1. Using 2&#8208;propanol as solvent at room temperature, the visible light photocatalysis produced H2O2 as a key intermediate to promote the aerobic hydroxylation of arylboronic acids. The heterogeneous photocatalyst was reused at least 5 times, without modification of the nanomaterial structure and morphology. This simple heterogeneous system showed great catalytic activity under sustainable reaction conditions.

         <title>Thermochromic Afterglow from Benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic Acid&#8208;doped Co&#8208;crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The afterglow color of benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acid (BDBA)&#8208;doped co&#8208;crystals with trimethylolpropane (TMP) varied from bluish to greenish color towards an increase of temperature from &#8722;132 to 40&#8201;&#176;C. Based on the photophysical properties of co&#8208;crystals and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, the molecular distortions at the singlet excited states enhanced the spin&#8208;orbit coupling to improve the intersystem crossing rate of BDBA ester.







Abstract
The accurate thermosensing requires a minimum impact of autofluorescence and light scattering from the samples. In this study, we discovered that commercially available benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronic acid (BDBA) doped co&#8208;crystals with trimethylolpropane (TMP) exhibit excellent thermochromic dual phosphorescence properties over a wide temperature range from &#8722;132 to 40&#8201;&#176;C, despite its simple structure that does not have any donor&#8208;acceptor linkage. The dual phosphorescence was consisted of monomeric benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diboronate (BDBA ester) and aggregation&#8208;stabilized species. With an increase in temperature, the emission intensity from the monomeric state significantly decreased, whereas that originating from the aggregated state remained almost constant owing to the difference in their thermal stabilities. Further investigation revealed that molecular distortions in singlet excited states enable efficient intersystem crossing, causing efficient phosphorescence from the monomeric state of BDBA ester.

         <title>A Powerful P&#8722;N Connection: Preparative Approaches, Reactivity, and Applications of P&#8208;Stereogenic Aminophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New catalytic possibilities in the synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine chalcogenides and boranes serve as an expansion in addition to established methods based on chiral auxiliaries. Stereoselective transformations into valuable building blocks facilitate catalyst design for use in organocatalytic and transition metal&#8208;based applications. Here, we present the main achievements of the last decades regarding synthesis, stereocontrolled reactivities, and catalytic applications of P&#8208;stereogenic P&#8722;N&#8208;based compounds.







Abstract
For more than five decades, P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine chalcogenides and boranes have attracted scientific attention and are still in the focus of ongoing research. In the last years, novel transition metal&#8208;based synthesis methods have been discovered, in addition to the long&#8208;known use of chiral auxiliaries. Enantiomerically pure compounds with N&#8722;P+&#8722;X&#8722; (X=O, S, BH3) motifs served as valuable reactive building blocks to provide new classes of organophosphorus derivatives, thereby preserving the stereochemical information at the phosphorus atom. Over the years, intriguing applications in organocatalysis and transition metal catalysis have been reported for some representatives. Asymmetric reductions of C=C, C=N, and C=O double bonds were feasible with selected P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine oxides in the presence of hydrogen transfer reagents. P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphine boranes could be easily deprotected and used as ligands for various transition metals to enable catalytic asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins and imines. This review traces the emergence of a synthetically and catalytically powerful functional compound class with phosphorus&#8208;centered chirality in its main lines, starting from classical approaches to modern synthesis methods to current applications.

Here, we present the main achievements of the last decades regarding synthesis, stereocontrolled reactivities, and catalytic applications of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-stereogenic P&#8722;N-based compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than five decades, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-stereogenic aminophosphine chalcogenides and boranes have attracted scientific attention and are still in the focus of ongoing research. In the last years, novel transition metal-based synthesis methods have been discovered, in addition to the long-known use of chiral auxiliaries. Enantiomerically pure compounds with N&#8722;P&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;X&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (X=O, S, BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) motifs served as valuable reactive building blocks to provide new classes of organophosphorus derivatives, thereby preserving the stereochemical information at the phosphorus atom. Over the years, intriguing applications in organocatalysis and transition metal catalysis have been reported for some representatives. Asymmetric reductions of C=C, C=N, and C=O double bonds were feasible with selected &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-stereogenic aminophosphine oxides in the presence of hydrogen transfer reagents. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-stereogenic aminophosphine boranes could be easily deprotected and used as ligands for various transition metals to enable catalytic asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins and imines. This review traces the emergence of a synthetically and catalytically powerful functional compound class with phosphorus-centered chirality in its main lines, starting from classical approaches to modern synthesis methods to current applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimerization and Crowding in the Binding of Interleukin 8 to Dendritic Glycosaminoglycans as Artificial Proteoglycans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrimers bind proteins more strongly, but not too many: Under physiological conditions, the pro&#8208;inflammatory protein interleukin&#8208;8 is found in an equilibrium of a monomer and a dimeric form. We find that synthetic GAG dendrimers, constructed of highly sulfated GAG&#8208;tetrasaccharides, bind protein monomers with increased affinity, thereby promoting protein dimerization. Thus, dendritic GAG are useful models for branched GAG structures found in&#8208;vivo such as proteoglycans. However, as space is limited in dendritic GAG, crowding reduces protein affinities.







Abstract
The interactions of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) with proteins of the extracellular matrix govern and regulate complex physiological functions including cellular growth, immune response, and inflammation. Repetitive presentation of GAG binding motifs, as found in native proteoglycans, might enhance GAG&#8208;protein binding through multivalent interactions. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of dendritic GAG oligomers constructed of nonasulfated hyaluronan tetrasaccharides for investigating the binding of the protein chemokine interleukin 8 (IL&#8208;8) to artificial, well&#8208;defined proteoglycan architectures. Binding of mutant monomeric and native dimerizable IL&#8208;8 was investigated by NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Dendritic oligomerization of GAG increased the binding affinity of both monomeric and dimeric IL&#8208;8. Monomeric IL&#8208;8 bound to monomeric and dimeric GAG with KD values of 7.3 and 0.108&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. The effect was less pronounced for dimerizable wild&#8208;type IL&#8208;8, for which GAG dimerization improved the affinity from 34 to 5&#8197;nM. Binding of dimeric IL&#8208;8 to oligomeric GAG was limited by steric crowding effects, strongly reducing the affinity of subsequent binding events. In conclusion, the strongest effect of GAG oligomerization was the amplified binding of IL&#8208;8 monomers, which might concentrate monomeric protein in the extracellular matrix and thus promote protein dimerization under physiological conditions.

         <title>Mono(Lewis Base)&#8208;Stabilized Gallium Iodide: An Unexplored Class of Promising Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculations suggest that Lewis base stabilized GaI (LB&#8594;GaI) complexes exhibit promising ligand properties and are capable of displaying metallomimetic behavior.







Abstract
Quantum&#8208;chemical (DFT) calculations on hitherto unknown base(carbene)&#8208;stabilized gallium monoiodides (LB&#8594;GaI) suggest that these systems feature one lone pair of electrons and a formally vacant p&#8208;orbital &#8211; both centered at the central gallium atom &#8211; and exhibit metallomimetic behavior. The calculated reaction free energies as well as bond dissociation energies suggest that these LB&#8594;GaI systems are capable of forming stable donor&#8208;acceptor complexes with group 13 trichlorides. Examination of the ligand exchange reactions with iron and nickel complexes indicates their potential use as ligands in transition metal chemistry. In addition, it is found that the title compounds are also able to activate various enthalpically robust bonds. Further, a detailed mechanistic investigation of these small molecule activation processes reveals the non&#8208;innocent behavior of the carbene (base) moiety attached to the GaI fragment, thereby indicating the cooperative nature of these bond activation processes. The energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and activation strain model (ASM) of reactivity were also employed to quantitatively understand and rationalize the different activation processes.

         <title>Kinetic and Thermodynamic Control of Supramolecular Aggregation of Near Infrared Pyrrolopyrrole Cyanine Fluorophores Confined in Colloidal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the kinetic and thermodynamic control of the supramolecular aggregation of a cyanine dye and its derivatives confined within colloidal nanoparticles. The aggregation number, aggregation states, and optical properties of the chromophores can be manipulated by optimizing the alkyl and polymer chains attached, as well as adjusting the effective dye concentration and surfactants.







Abstract
Control of the intermolecular aggregation of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules as chromophores is crucial for tuning their physical properties such as light absorption/emission, and energy and charge transfer. Lots of advances have been achieved in control of intermolecular aggregation of organic chromophores in solid states where an indefinitely large number of molecules are involved. However, much less understanding has been gained at a mesoscale of aggregates formed by well&#8208;defined organization of a deterministic number of chromophores, which has been realized in natural photosynthetic systems but still remains rare in manmade materials. Here, we report both the kinetic and the thermodynamic control of the supramolecular aggregation of a near&#8208;infrared cyanine dye, PPcy, and its derivatives confined in colloidal nanoparticles stabilized by surfactants in aqueous media. Our results demonstrate that both the aggregation number, the aggregation state and the optical properties of the PPcy chromophores are controllable through optimization of the alkyl and polymer chains tethered from PPcy, the effective concentration of the chromophore inside each particle, and the surfactants utilized to stabilize the colloids in water.

         <title>Modeling Amine Methylation in Methyl Ester Cavitand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding and methylation reaction of eight amines in a resorcinarene&#8208;based methyl ester cavitand are studied computationally using a combination of molecular dynamics and density functional theory techniques. The origins of the experimentally&#8208;observed rate acceleration compared to the solution reactions are analyzed.







Abstract
Methylation of amines inside an introverted resorcinarene&#8208;based deep methyl ester cavitand is investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations. Experimentally, the cavitand has been shown to bind a number of amines and accelerate the methylation reaction by more than four orders of magnitude for some of them. Eight different amines are considered in the present study, and the geometries and energies of their binding to the cavitand are first characterized and analyzed. Next, the methyl transfer reactions are investigated and the calculated barriers are found to be in generally good agreement with experimental results. In particular, the experimentally&#8208;observed rate acceleration in the cavitand as compared to the solution reaction is well reproduced by the calculations. The origins of this rate acceleration are analyzed by computational modifications made to the structure of the cavitand, and the role of the solvent is discussed.

         <title>The Fluoride Method: Access to Silver(III) NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unfolding novel metal carbenes: Silver(III) carbene complexes with square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometries are reported. These unprecedented organosilver(III) compounds exhibit remarkable stability: In the solid state they evolve into mixed&#8208;valence Ag(I)/Ag(III) compounds only at high temperatures (&gt;185&#8201;&#176;C).







Abstract
We have synthesized the first silver(III) carbene complexes, (CF3)3Ag(NHC), by direct reaction of the silver(III) fluoride precursor complex [PPh4][(CF3)3AgF] with different imidazolium salts. This novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. The silver(III) carbene complexes thus prepared are unprecedented and show remarkable thermal stabilities. They display square&#8208;planar or square&#8208;pyramidal geometry. Following our calculations, the electronic structure of a model representative complex exhibits Inverse Ligand Field (ILF). The compounds reported herein are synthetic analogues of the elusive difluorocarbene and carbonyl species proposed as intermediates in the acidic decomposition of [Ag(CF3)4]&#8722;. The synthetic procedure reported is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition&#8208;metals in high oxidation states.

This novel methodology circumvents the use of free NHC molecules. The silver(III) carbene complexes thus prepared are unprecedented and show remarkable thermal stabilities. They display square-planar or square-pyramidal geometry. Following our calculations, the electronic structure of a model representative complex exhibits Inverse Ligand Field (ILF). The compounds reported herein are synthetic analogues of the elusive difluorocarbene and carbonyl species proposed as intermediates in the acidic decomposition of [Ag(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The synthetic procedure reported is envisaged to enable access to carbene complexes of other late transition-metals in high oxidation states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel starfruit&#8208;shaped metal&#8211;organic framework (SMOF) composed of zirconium and tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine linkers has been fabricated. The unique morphology of the SMOF, characterized by 2D nanosheet petals grown through edge&#8208;sharing, arises from 3D PCN&#8208;222 MOF intermediates. The distinct morphology of the SMOF leads to superior catalytic activity in detoxifying G&#8208;type nerve agent and blister agent simulants, surpassing that of its 3D counterparts. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8208;a. Tao, J. Wang, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302835).

         <dc:description>Proteases are involved in many essential biological processes. Dysregulation of their activity underlies a wide variety of human diseases. Photopharmacology, as applied on various classes of proteins, has the potential to assist protease research by enabling spatiotemporal control of protease activity. Moreover, it may be used to decrease side&#8208;effects of protease&#8208;targeting drugs. In this review, we discuss the current status of the chemical design of photoactivatable proteases inhibitors and their biological application. Additionally, we give insight into future possibilities for further development of this field of research</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Influence on Cyaphide&#8208;Azide 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions: Aromaticity and Activation Strain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The factors governing 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions involving C[[EQUATION]]P&#8208;containing compounds are computationally explored in detail using quantum chemical tools. To this end, the parent process involving tBuN3 and tBuCP is analyzed and compared to the analogous reaction involving organometallic cyaphide complexes (metal = Ag, Pt, Ge, Mg), in order to understand the role of the metal fragment in such transformations. It is found that while the metal fragment does not significantly influence the aromaticity of the corresponding concerted transition states or the regioselectivity of the transformation, it may modify the reactivity of the cyaphide complexes (i.e. Ge and Mg cyaphide complexes are comparatively more reactive). The computed reactivity trends and the factors behind the regioselectivity of the cycloaddition reaction are quantitatively analyzed with the help of the activation strain model in combination with the energy decomposition analysis method.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Catalytic&#8208;Space for the Reactivity of Metal&#8208;free Boron Nitride with O2 for H2O&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Methane to HCHO and CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal based catalysts have been widely employed to catalyze partial oxidation of light alkanes. Recently, metal&#8208;free hexagonal&#8208;boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has emerged as a promising catalyst for the oxidation of CH4 to HCHO and CO; however, the intricate catalytic surface of h&#8208;BN at molecular and electronic levels remains inadequately understood. Key questions include how electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms in h&#8208;BN reduce O2, and whether the partial oxidation of methane over h&#8208;BN exhibits similarities to traditional transition&#8208;metal catalysts. In our study, we computationally&#8208;mapped in&#8208;detail the surface catalytic&#8208;space of h&#8208;BN for methane oxidation. We considered different structures of h&#8208;BN and show that these structures contain numerous sites for O2 binding and therefore various routes for methane oxidation are possible. The activation barriers for methane oxidation via various paths vary from ~83 to ~123 kcal mol&#8722;1. To comprehend the differences in activation barriers, we employed geometrical, orbital and distortion/interaction analysis (DIA). Orbital analysis reveals that methane activation over h&#8208;BN in presence of dioxygen follows a standard hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. It is also shown that water plays an intriguing role in reducing the barrier for HCHO and CO formation by acting as a bridge.</dc:description>

         <title>Deconstructing Best&#8208;in&#8208;Class Neoglycoclusters as a Tool for Dissecting Key Multivalent Processes in Glycosidase Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalency represents an appealing option to modulate selectivity in enzyme inhibition and transform moderate glycosidase inhibitors into highly potent ones. The rational design of multivalent inhibitors is however challenging because global affinity enhancement relies on several interconnected local mechanistic events, whose relative impact is unknown. So far, the largest multivalent effects ever reported for a non&#8208;polymeric glycosidase inhibitor have been obtained with cyclopeptoid&#8208;based inhibitors of Jack bean &#945;&#8208;mannosidase (JB&#945;&#8208;man). Here, we report a structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) study based on the top&#8208;down deconstruction of best&#8208;in&#8208;class multivalent inhibitors. This approach provides a valuable tool to understand the complex interdependent mechanisms underpinning the inhibitory multivalent effect. Combining SAR experiments, binding stoichiometry assessments, thermodynamic modelling and atomistic simulations allowed us to establish the significant contribution of statistical rebinding mechanisms and the importance of several key parameters, including inhitope accessibility, topological restrictions, and electrostatic interactions. Our findings indicate that strong chelate&#8208;binding, resulting from the formation of a cross&#8208;linked complex between a multivalent inhibitor and two dimeric JB&#945;&#8208;man molecules, is not a sufficient condition to reach high levels of affinity enhancements. The deconstruction approach thus offers unique opportunities to better understand multivalent binding and provides important guidelines for the design of potent and selective multiheaded inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategies towards Advanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts at Large Current Densities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen (H2), produced by water electrolysis with the electricity from renewable sources, is an ideal energy carrier for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral and sustainable society. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the cathodic half&#8208;reaction of water electrolysis, which requires active and robust electrocatalysts to reduce the energy consumption for H2 generation. Despite numerous electrocatalysts have been reported by the academia for HER, most of them were only tested under relatively small current densities for a short period, which cannot meet the requirements for industrial water electrolysis. To bridge the gap between academia and industry, it is crucial to develop highly active HER electrocatalysts which can operate at large current densities for a long time. In this review, the mechanisms of HER in acidic and alkaline electrolytes are firstly introduced. Then, design strategies towards high&#8208;performance large&#8208;current&#8208;density HER electrocatalysts from five aspects including number of active sites, intrinsic activity of each site, charge transfer, mass transfer, and stability are discussed via featured examples. Finally, our own insights about the challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorogenic Rhodamine Probes with Pyrrole Substitution Enables STED and Lifetime Imaging of Lysosomes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorogenic dyes with high brightness, large turn&#8208;on ratios, excellent photostability, favorable specificity, low cytotoxicity, and high membrane permeability are essential for high&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging in live cells. In this study, we endowed these desirable properties to a rhodamine derivative by simply replacing the N, N&#8208;diethyl group with a pyrrole substituent. The resulting dye, Rh&#8208;NH, exhibited doubled Stokes shifts (54 nm) and a red&#8208;shift of more than 50 nm in fluorescence spectra compared to Rhodamine B. Rh&#8208;NH preferentially exists in a non&#8208;emissive but highly permeable spirolactone form. Upon binding to lysosomes, the collective effects of low pH, low polarity, and high viscosity endow Rh&#8208;NH with significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on, making it a suitable candidate for wash&#8208;free, high&#8208;contrast lysosome tracking. Consequently, Rh&#8208;NH enabled us to successfully explore stimulated emission depletion (STED) super&#8208;resolution imaging of lysosome dynamics, as well as fluorescence lifetime imaging of lysosomes in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of 2&#8208;Pyridone Fluorophores for Brighter Emissions at Longer Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent discovery of blue fluorophores with high quantum yields based on pyridone structures inspired the development of new low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluorophores with bright emissions at tunable wavelengths, which are highly attractive for various applications. In this study, we propose a rational design strategy for 2&#8208;pyridone&#8208;based fluorophores with bright emissions at long wavelengths. With a detailed understanding of the positional substitution effects on each carbon atom of the 2&#8208;pyridone core, we developed a bright blue fluorophore (&#955;abs = 377 nm; &#955;em = 433 nm; &#949; = 13,200 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1; &#632;F = 88%) through C3&#8208;aryl and C4&#8208;ester substitutions followed by cyclization. Furthermore, by applying the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) principle, we invented a bright green fluorophore through C3&#8208; and C4&#8208;diester and C6&#8208;aryl substitutions. The ICT fluorophore based on the pyridone structure shows large molar absorptivity (&#949; = 20,100 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1), longer emission wavelength (&#955;em = 539 nm), high emission quantum yield (&#632;F = 74%), and large Stokes shift (&#916;v = 5720 cm&#8722;1), which are comparable to those of practical&#160; fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;activity Relationship Study to Develop Peptide Amphiphiles as Species&#8208;Specific Antimicrobials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimicrobial peptide amphiphiles (PAs) are a promising class of molecules that can disrupt the bacterial membrane or act as drug nanocarriers. In this study, we prepared 33 PAs to establish supramolecular structure&#8208;activity relationships. We studied the morphology and activity of the nanostructures against different Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains (such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii). Next, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the key contributors to activity. We found that for S. aureus, the zeta potential was the major contributor to the activity while Gram&#8208;negative bacteria were more influenced by the partition coefficient (LogP) with the following order P. aeruginosa &gt; E. coli &gt; A. baumannii. We also performed a study of the mechanism of action of selected PAs on the bacterial membrane assessing the membrane permeability and depolarization, changes in zeta potential and overall integrity. We studied the toxicity of the nanostructures against mammalian cells. Finally, we performed an in vivo study using the wax moth larvae to determine the therapeutic efficacy of the active PAs. This study shows cationic PA nanostructures can be an intriguing platform for the development of nanoantibacterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Catalytic Efficiency of D&#8208;lactonohydrolase through the Synergy of Tunnel Engineering, Evolutionary Analysis, and Force&#8208;Field Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Computational design advances enzyme evolution and their use in biocatalysis in a faster and more efficient manner. In this study, a synergistic approach integrating tunnel engineering, evolutionary analysis, and force&#8208;field calculations has been employed to enhance the catalytic activity of D&#8208;lactonohydrolase (D&#8208;Lac), which is a pivotal enzyme involved in the resolution of racemic pantolactone during the production of vitamin B5. The best mutant, N96S/A271E/F274Y/F308G (M3), was obtained and its catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) was nearly 23&#8208;fold higher than that of the wild&#8208;type. The M3 whole&#8208;cell converted 20% of DL&#8208;pantolactone into D&#8208;pantoic acid (D&#8208;PA, &gt;99% e.e.) with a conversion rate of 47% and&#160;space&#8208;time&#160;yield&#160;of&#160;107.1&#160;g L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, demonstrating its great potential for industrial&#8208;scale D&#8208;pantothenic acid production. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the reduction in the steric hindrance within the substrate tunnel and conformational reconstruction of the distal loop resulted in a more favourable"catalytic" conformation, making it easier for the substrate and enzyme to enter their pre&#8208;reaction state. This study illustrates the potential of the distal residue on the pivotal loop at the entrance of the D&#8208;Lac substrate tunnel as a novel modification hotspot capable of reshaping energy patterns and consequently influencing the enzymatic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct growth control of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria using visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive novel photoswitchable antibiotics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In addition to the discovery of new (modified) potent antibiotics to combat antibiotic resistance, there is a critical need to develop novel strategies that would restrict their off&#8208;target effects and unnecessary exposure to bacteria in our body and environment. We report a set of new photoswitchable arylazopyrazole&#8208;modified norfloxacin antibiotics that present a high degree of bidirectional photoisomerization, impressive fatigue resistance and reasonably high cis half&#8208;lives. The irradiated isomers of most compounds were found to exhibit nearly equal or higher antibacterial activity than norfloxacin against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Notably, against norfloxacin&#8208;resistant S. aureus bacteria, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive p&#8208;SMe&#8208;substituted derivative showed remarkably high antimicrobial potency (MIC of 0.25 &#181;g/mL) in the irradiated state, while the potency was reduced by 24&#8208;fold in case of its non&#8208;irradiated state. The potency was estimated to be retained for more than 7 hours. This is the first report to demonstrate direct photochemical control of the growth of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria and to show the highest activity difference between irradiated and non&#8208;irradiated states of a photoswitchable antibiotic. Additionally, both isomers were found to be non&#8208;harmful to human cells. Molecular modellings were performed to identify the underlying reason behind the high&#8208;affinity binding of the irradiated isomer to topoisomerase IV enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Is Simultaneous Binding to DNA and Gyrase Important for the Antibacterial Activity of Cystobactamids?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cystobacamids are aromatic oligoamides that exert their natural antibacterial properties by inhibition of bacterial gyrases. Such aromatic oligoamides were proposed to inhibit a&#8208;helix&#8208;mediated protein&#8208;protein interactions and may serve for specific recognition of DNA. Based on this suggestion, we designed new derivatives that have duplicated cystobactamid triarene units as model systems to decipher the specific binding mode of cystobactamids to double stranded DNA. Solution NMR analyses revealed that natural cystobactamids as well as their elongated analogues show an overall bent shape at their central aliphatic unit, with an average CX&#8208;CY&#8208;CZ angle of ~110 degrees. Our finding is corroborated by the target&#8208;bound structure of close analogues, as established by cryo&#8208;EM very recently. Cystobactamid CN&#8208;861&#8208;2 binds directly to the bacterial gyrase with an affinity of 9 &#181;M, and also exhibits DNA&#8208;binding properties with specificity for AT&#8208;rich DNA. Elongation/dimerization of the triarene subunit of native cystobactamids is demonstrated to lead to an increase in DNA binding affinity. This implies that cystobactamids&#8217; gyrase inhibitory activity necessitates not just interaction with the gyrase itself, but also with DNA via their triarene unit.</dc:description>

         <title>Dextrans, Pullulan and Lentinan, New Scaffold Materials for Use as Hydrogels in Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of hydrogels based on dextrans, pullulan and lentinan to be used in biomedical applications including tissue engineering is reported. Despite the fact that selected polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid are well established, little is known, how these polysaccharides can be chemically modified to create hydrogels under controlled conditions. In this study we present a small library of chemically modified polysaccharides which are used for a divergent approach to achieve biomedical relevant hydrogels. In this case the crosslinking is based on thio ether formation between thiol modified donor and vinylsulfone or maleimide modified acceptor components. Successful synthesis of the linker systems and coupling at the polysaccharides, hydrogel formation takes place under physiological conditions. We extended the study by coupling small molecules like adhesion factors for increasing&#160;  cell compatibility  as well as a dye for further studies. The different hydrogels were studied to their rheological properties, water uptake, their permeability, biodegrability and their cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Flowmicro In&#8208;Line Analysis&#8208;Driven Design of Reactions mediated by Unstable Intermediates: Flash Monitoring Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct observation of reactive intermediates is an important issue for organic synthesis. However, intermediates with an extreme instability are hard to be monitored by common spectroscopic methods such as FTIR. We have developed synthetic method utilizing flow microreactors, which enables a generation and reactions of unstable intermediates. Herein we report that, based on our flowmicro techniques, we developed an in&#8208;line analysis method for reactive intermediates in increments of milliseconds. We demonstrated the direct observation of the living and dead species of the anionic polymerization of alkyl methacrylates. The direct information of the living species enabled the anionic polymerization and copolymerization of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylates, which is the important but difficult reaction in the conventional method.</dc:description>

         <title>Epoxide&#8208;Mediated Trans&#8208;Thioglycosylation and Application to the Synthesis of Oligosaccharides Related to the Capsular Polysaccharides of C. Jejuni HS:4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enzyme&#8208;resistant thioglycosides are highly valuable immunogens because of their enhanced metabolic stability. We report the first synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides related to the capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of Campylobacter jejuni HS:4 for potential use in conjugate vaccines. The native CPS structures of the pathogen consist of a challenging repeating disaccharide formed with &#946;(1&#224;4)&#8208;linked 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranoside and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine; the rare 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;ido&#8208;heptopyranosyl backbone and &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration of the former monosaccharide makes the synthesis of this family of antigens extremely challenging.&#160; So far, no synthesis of the thioanalogs of the CPS antigens have been reported. The unprecedented and elegant synthesis presented in this work is built on an elegant approach by using &#946;&#8208;glycosylthiolate as a glycosyl donor to open the 2,3&#8208;epoxide functionality of pre&#8208;designed 6&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;talo&#8208;heptopyranosides. Our results illustrated that this key trans&#8208;thioglycosylation can be designed in a modular and highly regio and stereo&#8208;selective manner. Built on the success of this novel approach, we succeed the synthesis of a family of thiooligosaccharides including a thiohexasaccharide which is considered to be the desired antigen length and complexity for immunizations. We also report the first direct conversion of base&#8208;stable but acid&#8208;labile 2&#8208;trimethylsilylethyl glycosides to glycosyl&#8208;1&#8208;thioacetates in a one&#8208;pot manner.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A versatile method for the automated synthesis of composites containing DNA&#8208;oligonucleotides and boron cluster scaffolds and their assembly into functional nanoparticles is described. The obtained, torus&#8208;like nanoparticles carry antisense oligonucleotides that target two different oncogenes simultaneously. The nanoparticles exhibited notable silencing efficiency in vitro in a pancreatic carcinoma cell line PANC&#8208;1 toward EGFR and c&#8208;Myc genes at the mRNA level, and a significant efficiency at the protein level. The proposed approach may be an attractive alternative to methods currently used, including one therapeutic nucleic acid, one genetic target, or use of cocktails of therapeutic nucleic acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectively transport and removal of fluoride ion by pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excess fluoride ions in groundwater accumulate through the roots of crops, affecting photosynthesis and inhibiting their growth. Long&#8208;term bioaccumulation also threatens human health because it is poorly degradable and toxic. Currently, one of the biggest challenges is developing a unique material that can efficiently remove fluoride ions from the environment. The excellent properties of functionalized pillar[5]arene polymer&#8208;filled nanochannel membranes were explored to address this challenge. Constructing a multistage porous nanochannel membrane, consisting of microscale etched nanochannels and nanoscale pillar[5]arene cross&#8208;linked polymer voids. A fluoride removal rate of 0.0088 mmol&#8226;L&#8208;1&#8226;min&#8208;1 was achieved. Notably, this rate surpassed the rates observed with other control ions by a factor of 6 to 8.8. Our research provides a new direction for developing water fluoride ion removal materials</dc:description>

Sterically hindered yet active: A new family of chiral NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;Cl complexes, bearing sterically encumbered NHC ligands, has been accessed by merging anilines with commercially available chiral aminoalcohols and amines. Evaluation of the catalytic activity in enantioselective allenol cyclization has pointed out the importance of the steric hindrance and conformational flexibility of the NHC core for reactivity. Ion metathesis between NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;Cl and AgOTs, required for the activation of the gold complex, appeared to be very slow in commonly used MeNO2, in contrast to DCM.







Abstract
Gold(I) catalysis has been recognized as a valuable tool for the unique transformation of multiple carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Enantioselective &#960;&#8208;catalysis based on gold(I) complexes is, however, still underdeveloped due to lack of privileged ligands. Herein, we present an accessible method to a new family of stable yet catalytically active chiral NHC&#8722;Au(I)&#8722;Cl complexes. The key to preserving a simultaneous fine balance between reactivity and stability in this newly developed family appears to be sterically hindered, but conformationally flexible NHC ligands. These could be easily accessed on a multigram scale by merging sterically hindered anilines with commercially available amino alcohols and amines via a four&#8208;steps synthetic sequence without the need for chromatographic purification. Further investigations of the catalytic activity of NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;Cl complexes identified the OH functionality incorporated into the NHC core as crucial for the level of enantioselectivity as well as the TsO&#8722; anion responsible for the activation of NHC&#8722;Au(I)&#8722;Cl. Finally, NMR studies and X&#8208;ray investigations revealed for the first time that the widely accepted ion metathesis (NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;Cl to NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;OSO2R) responsible for the activation of NHC&#8722;Au&#8722;Cl complexes does not take place (or it is very slow) in commonly used MeNO2 in contrast to DCM.

         <title>Oxidation&#8208;state sensitive light&#8208;induced dynamics of Ruthenium&#8208;4H&#8208;Imidazole complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient absorption spectro&#8208;electrochemistry allows for a more thorough understanding of excited state dynamics of intermediates in solar energy conversion processes. In this study it is reported, that the lifetime of the deactivation pathway of short&#8208;lived excited states of oxidized Ruthenium(II) 4H&#8208;imidazole photosensitizers can be varied by two orders of magnitude by the presence and type of multi&#8208; or monodentate ligands.







Abstract
Oxidized molecular states are key intermediates in photo&#8208;induced redox reactions, e.&#8201;g., intermolecular charge transfer between photosensitizer and catalyst in photoredox catalysis. The stability and longevity of the oxidized photosensitizer is an important factor in optimizing the respective light&#8208;driven reaction pathways. In this work the oxidized states of ruthenium(II)&#8208;4H&#8208;imidazole dyes are studied. The ruthenium complexes constitute benchmark photosensitizers in solar energy interconversion processes with exceptional chemical stability, strong visible light absorption, and favourable redox properties. To rationalize the light&#8208;induced reaction in the oxidized ruthenium(III) systems, we combine UV&#8208;vis absorption, resonance Raman, and transient absorption spectroelectrochemistry (SEC) with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Three complexes are compared, which vary with respect to their coordination environment, i.&#8201;e., combining an 4H&#8208;imidazole with either 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) or 2,2&#8242;;6&#8242;2&#8220;&#8208;terpyridine (tpy) coligands, and chloride or isothiocyanate ligands. While all oxidized complexes have similar steady state absorption properties, their excited state kinetics differ significantly; the study thus opens the doorway to study the light&#8208;driven reactivity of oxidized molecular intermediates in intermolecular charge transfer cascades.

         <title>Hydride&#8208;Containing Pt&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;rich Nanoclusters: Synthesis, Structure, and Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To optimize the HER performance, the size, composition, and structure of bimetallic PtH&#8722;Cu NCs are controlled with atomic precision. The addition of CF3COOH to cluster 1 resulted in the structural change from a bicapped icosahedral Cu14 cage encapsulating a linear PtH2 unit (HER&#8208;inactive cluster) to a vertex&#8208;missing Cu11 cuboctahedron encaging a PtH moiety in cluster 2 (HER&#8208;active cluster) and distorted 3,3,4,4,4&#8208;pentacapped trigonal prismatic Cu11 cage enclosing a PtH2 unit in cluster 3. Cluster 2 reveals the highest HER activity among the bimetallic NC catalysts with a near&#8208;zero onset potential (&#951;) of &#8722;0.03&#8197;V (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
A structurally precise hydride&#8208;containing Pt&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;rich nanocluster [PtH2Cu14{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)6] (1) has been synthesized. It consists of a bicapped icosahedral Cu14 cage that encapsulates a linear PtH2 unit. Upon the addition of two equivalents of CF3COOH to 1, two hydrido clusters are isolated. These clusters are [PtHCu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)4] (2), which is a vertex&#8208;missing Cu11 cuboctahedron encaging a PtH moiety, and [PtH2Cu11{S2P(OiPr)2}6(CCPh)3] (3), a distorted 3,3,4,4,4&#8208;pentacapped trigonal prismatic Cu11 cage enclosing a PtH2 unit. The electronic structure of 2, analyzed by Density Functional Theory, is a 2e superatom. The electrocatalytic activities of 1&#8211;3 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) were compared. Notably, Cluster 2 exhibited an exceptionally excellent HER activity within metal nanoclusters, with an onset potential of &#8722;0.03&#8197;V (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a Tafel slope of 39&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, and consistent HER activity throughout 3000&#8197;cycles in 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4. Our study suggests that the accessible central Pt site plays a crucial role in the remarkable HER activity and may provide valuable insights for establishing correlations between catalyst structure and HER activity.

         <title>The Effect of Conformational Freedom vs Restriction on the Rate in Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Monohydrogenation of Dienones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It was found that the conformation of an unsaturated carbonyl is extremely important for the reactivity in iridium catalyzed hydrogenation. This reactivity difference is used for a novel type of regioselective hydrogenation of dienes in which the (s)&#8208;cis configured olefin is preferentially hydrogenated. The regiodiscrimination overrules the conventional reactivity order in substitution pattern in iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of olefins.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation constitutes an efficient strategy for the preparation of chiral molecules. When dienes are subjected to hydrogenation, control over regioselectivity still presents a large challenge and the fully saturated alkane is often yielded. A few successful monohydrogenations of dienes have been reported, but hitherto these are only efficient for dienes comprised of two distinctly different olefins. Herein, the reactivity of a conjugated carbonyl compound as a function of their conformational freedom is studied, based on a combined experimental and theoretical approach. It was found that alkenes in the (s)&#8208;cis conformation experience a large rate acceleration while (s)&#8208;trans restrained alkenes undergo hydrogenation slowly. Ultimately, this reactivity aspect was exploited in a novel method for the monohydrogenation of dienes based on conformational restriction ((s)&#8208;cis vs (s)&#8208;trans). This mode of discrimination conceptually differs from existing monohydrogenations and dienones constructed of two olefins similar in nature could efficiently be hydrogenated to the chiral alkene (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The extent of regioselection is even powerful enough to overcome the conventional reactivity order of substituted olefins (di&gt;tri&gt;tetra). This high yielding and atom&#8208;economical protocol provides an interesting opportunity to instal a stereogenic center on a carbocycle, while leaving a synthetically useful alkene untouched.

         <title>Investigation of the Chemisorption&#8208;Catalysis Behavior of Sulfur Species on the Electrocatalysts Designed by Co&#8208;regulation Strategy of Anions and Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical research has demonstrated that co&#8208;regulation strategy of anions and cations is an effective approach to tune the electronic structure and physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts. FeCo2Se4 and CuCo2Se4 combined appropriate affinity with superior electronic conductivity and catalytic capacity have been rapidly and economically discovered as novel electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries.







Abstract
Li&#8208;S batteries possess high energy density and have been one of the most promising energy storage systems. For sulfur cathodes, the electrochemical performance is still seriously hindered by the polysulfide shuttling and sluggish conversion kinetics. It has been demonstrated to be one effective strategy to address the above issues via designing electrocatalysts with robust affinity and catalytic capacity towards polysulfides. However, it is still a great challenge to rapidly and economically discover high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. Herein, using density functional theory calculation, we studied the chemisorption&#8208;catalysis behavior of sulfur species on a series of electrocatalysts (MCo2X4, M=Co, Zn, Cu, Ni, Fe, and Mn, X=O, S, and Se) to assess the effect of the anions and cations co&#8208;regulation on their electronic structure, chemisorption behavior, and catalytic property. FeCo2Se4 and CuCo2Se4 combined appropriate chemisorption with superior electronic conductivity and sulfur reduction catalytic capacity have been predicted as novel electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries. This study gives theoretical guidance for rapid discovery of high&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst to boost the electrochemical performance of sulfur cathodes.

Efficient red thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials consisting of cyano&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;diphenyldipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine acceptors and triphenylamine donors are reported, and the significant influence of cyano substituents on photophysical property and electroluminescence performance are elucidated. High&#8208;performance red OLEDs are achieved, providing excellent external quantum efficiencies of 28.8&#8201;% at 616&#8197;nm and 20.2&#8201;% at 648&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Red luminescent materials are essential components for full color display and white lightening based on organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) technology, but the extension of emission color towards red or deep red region generally leads to decreased photoluminescence and electroluminescence efficiencies. Herein, we wish to report two new luminescent molecules (2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA) consisting of cyano&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;diphenyldipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine acceptors and triphenylamine donors. As the increase of cyano substituents, the emission wavelength is greatly red&#8208;shifted and the reverse intersystem crossing process is promoted, resulting in strong red delayed fluorescence. Meanwhile, due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the molecular structures become rigidified and planarized, which brings about large horizontal dipole ratios. As a result, 2CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA and 4CNDPBPPr&#8208;TPA can perform as emitters efficiently in OLEDs, furnishing excellent external quantum efficiencies of 28.8&#8201;% at 616&#8197;nm and 20.2&#8201;% at 648&#8197;nm, which are significantly improved in comparison with that of the control molecule without cyano substituents. The findings in this work demonstrate that the introduction of cyano substituents to the acceptors of delayed fluorescence molecules could be a facile and effective approach to explore high&#8208;efficiency red or deep red delayed fluorescence materials.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Enthalpy Compensation in Solvent Geometry Regulated Supramolecular Polymerization of Luminescent Napthalimide via a Non&#8208;Cooperative, Isodesmic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we demonstrated the supramolecular polymerization of a luminescent napthalimide semiconductor in a J&#8208;type aggregation fashion in linear (dodecane) and cyclic (decalin) hydrocarbon&#8208;based solvents. It follows non&#8208;cooperative isodesmic mechanism in both the solvents, but the strength of self&#8208;assembly and gelation were found to be stronger in linear solvent due to matching geometry operated favorable van der Waals interactions with the peripheral alkyl chains.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are an important class of materials with fascinating functions and properties originated from the dynamic behavior and highly ordered molecular organizations. Here, a donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor based functionalized luminescent napthalene monoimide (NMI) undergoes J&#8208;type self&#8208;assembly by non&#8208;covalent interactions via a non&#8208;cooperative, isodesmic mechanism to form supramolecular 1D nanowire. The fundamental insights into the thermodynamics regulating the supramolecular polymerization were derived through the fitting of the isodesmic model to variable temperature UV/Vis data in linear (dodecane) and nonliner hydrocarbon (decalin) based solvents. This shows a significant role of entropy&#8208;enthalpy compensation in solvent geometry&#8208;regulated formation and stabilization of supramolecular polymer. Furthermore, we have quantitively estimated the influence of solvent geometry and found that NMI forms stronger self&#8208;assembly and spontaneous gel in linear hydrocarbon based solvent compared to nonliner one and thereby substantially increases the degree of polymerization in linear hydrocarbon solvent (dodecane). This is accredited to the effective influence of the linear hydrocarbon solvent molecules in the polymerization process by favourable van der waals interactions with the peripheral alkyl chains of the NMI monomers in contrast to unfavourable interaction of nonliner hydrocarbon solvent due to geometry mismatch.

         <title>Urea&#8208;Promoted Neat Synthesis of Fused Dihydroisoquinolines and Disubstituted Pyridines: A Mechanistic Observation with Molecular&#8208;Sensing Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise and efficient synthesis of fused isoquinolines has been established by using an environmentally friendly neat approach. In this method, the electrocyclic reaction is emphasized over the typical aza&#8208;Michael addition. This green methodology allows the synthesis of various isoquinolines, including the alkaloid decumbenine B and a fluorophore that selectively detects picric acid.







Abstract
An efficient and short synthesis of fused dihydroisoquinolines, diaryl substituted pyridine derivatives in good to high yields has been established by using an environmentally safe, solvent&#8208;metal&#8208;oxidant&#8208;free tandem approach. In this article, we discuss how the electrocyclic reaction is more pronounced in the solid phase in the presence of urea, whereas the typical aza&#8208;Michael addition is more prominent in presence of arylamine in the solution phase for 3&#8208;(2&#8208;formylcycloalkenyl)acrylic ester derivative substrates. The wide range of substrates and urea&#8208;promoted neat synthesis made our approach more significant in medical and also analytical science. Moreover, an isoquinoline alkaloid decumbenine&#8197;B analogue has been synthesized by using our newly developed neat methodology. We have also investigated the photophysical properties of the synthesized fused dihydroisoquinoline derivatives. One of the synthesized molecules was used as a sensor for the selective detection of toxic picric acid. Therefore, the effective neat synthesis and molecular sensing applications of these compounds made our approach more exciting in the field of heterocyclic chemistry.

         <title>More Electropositive is More Electronegative: Atom Size Determines C=X Group Electronegativity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More electropositive is more electronegative! The C=X group electronegativity is increased when the electronegativity of X is decreased down a group of the Periodic Table. Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses reveal that the steric size of atom X is at the origin of this counterintuitive and unexpected phenomenon.







Abstract
Opposite to what one might expect, we find that the C=X group can become effectively more, not less, electronegative when the Pauling electronegativity of atom X decreases down Groups&#8197;16, 15, and 14 of the Periodic Table. Our quantum&#8208;chemical analyses, show that, and why, this phenomenon is a direct consequence of the increasing size of atom X down a group. These findings can be applied to tuning and improving the hydrogen&#8208;bond donor strength of amides H2NC(=X)R by increasingly withdrawing density from the NH2 group. A striking example is that H2NC(=SiR2)R is a stronger hydrogen&#8208;bond donor than H2NC(=CR2)R.

     alt="More Electropositive is More Electronegative: Atom Size Determines C=X Group Electronegativity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More electropositive is more electronegative&lt;/b&gt;! The C=X group electronegativity is increased when the electronegativity of X is decreased down a group of the Periodic Table. Quantum-chemical analyses reveal that the steric size of atom X is at the origin of this counterintuitive and unexpected phenomenon.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Research Progress in Liquid Phase Growth of GaN Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flux and ammonothermal methods are capable of the growth of large size, high quality GaN crystals, which are the main methods of liquid phase growth. The research progress of these two growth methods in terms of chemical additives and growth process is summarised, and their application prospects in industrial production are discussed.







Abstract
As a wide band gap semiconductor, gallium nitride (GaN) has high breakdown voltage, excellent structural stability and mechanical properties, giving it unique advantages in applications such as high frequency, high power, and high temperature. As a result, it has broad application prospects in optoelectronics and microelectronics. However, the lack of high&#8208;quality, large&#8208;size GaN crystal substrates severely limit the improvement of electronic device performance. To solve this problem, liquid phase growth of GaN has attracted much attention because it can produce higher quality GaN crystals compared to traditional vapor phase growth methods. This review introduces two main methods of liquid phase growth of GaN: the flux method and ammonothermal method, as well as their advantages and challenges. It reviews the research history and recent advances of these two methods, including the effects of different solvents and mineralizers on the growth quality and performance of GaN crystals, as well as various technical improvements. This review aims to outline the principles, characteristics, and development trends of liquid phase growth of GaN, to provide more inspiration for future research on liquid phase growth, and to achieve further breakthroughs in its development and commercial application.

         <title>Towards a General Access to 1&#8208;Azaspirocyclic Systems via Photoinduced, Reductive Decarboxylative Radical Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet versatile strategy for the construction of important 1&#8208;azaspirocyclic scaffolds is described. Alkynyl&#8208;tethered N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters, swiftly assembled through an alkylation/deprotection/activation sequence, undergo photoinduced reductive decarboxylative radical 5&#8208;exo and 6&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclizations employing eosin Y (EY) as inexpensive photocatalyst. The key step can proceed in a diastereoconvergent manner and affords diverse ring systems relevant to medicinal chemistry and natural products.

         <title>Carboranylphosphines: B9&#8208;Substituted Derivatives with Enhanced Reactivity for the Anchoring to Dendrimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several ortho&#8208;carboranes bearing a phenoxy or a phenylamino group in the B9 position were prepared employing various protection and deprotection strategies. Following established protocols, dendritic compounds were synthesized from a hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene or thiophosphoryl chloride core, and possible anchoring options for the B9&#8208;substituted ortho&#8208;carboranes were investigated experimentally and theoretically (DFT). Furthermore, 1&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;phosphanyl&#8208;substituted carborane derivatives were obtained. The resulting diethyl&#8208;, diisopropyl&#8208;, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;, diphenyl&#8208; or diethoxyphosphines bearing a tunable ortho&#8208;carborane moiety are intriguing ligands for future applications in homogeneous catalysis or the medicinal sector.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral organic molecules possessing high quantum yields, circular dichroism, and circularly polarized luminescence values have great potential as optically active materials for future applications. Recently, the identification of a promising class of inherently chiral compounds was reported, namely macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiyne linked pseudo&#8208;meta[2.2]paracyclophanes, displaying high circular dichroism and related gabs values albeit modest quantum yields. Increasing the quantum yields in an attempt to get bright circularly polarized light emitters, the high&#8208;yielding heterocyclization of those 1,3&#8208;butadiyne bridges resulting in macrocyclic 2,5&#8208;thienyls linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes is herein described. The chiroptical properties of both, the previously reported 1,3&#8208;butadiyne, and the novel 2,5&#8208;thienyl bridged macrocycles of various sizes, are experimentally recorded, and theoretically described using density&#8208;functional theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Partial Hydrogenation and Deuteration of Tetracyclic (Hetero)aromatic Systems Using a Simple Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of added &#8216;3&#8208;dimensionality&#8217; through late&#8208;stage functionalization of extended (hetero)aromatic systems is a powerful synthetic approach. The abundance of starting materials and cross&#8208;coupling methodologies to access the precursors allows for highly diverse products. Subsequent selective partial reduction can alter the core structure in a manner of interest to medicinal chemists. Herein, we describe the precise, partial reduction of multicyclic heteroaromatic systems using a simple heterogeneous catalyst. The approach can be extended to introduce deuterium (again at late&#8208;stage). Excellent yields can be obtained using simple reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>[2,2]Paracyclophane Bridged, Thiophene Based Macrocycles: Synthesis and Electronic Properties in Different Redox States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of through&#8208;space electronic coupling in &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains an underexplored area. In this work, we present the facile synthesis of two isomeric macrocycles (1 and 2) bridged by [2,2]paracyclophane (pCp) and based on thiophene. The structures of these macrocycles have been confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Our investigation centers on their electronic properties across various redox states, with a specific focus on potential through&#8208;space electronic coupling and global aromaticity. Experimental measurements, including UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR electronic absorption, NMR, ESR spectra, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that both the neutral compounds and their tetracations exhibit a closed&#8208;shell ground state. However, their dications manifest as diradical dications with a subtle magnetic exchange interaction. Consequently, the through&#8208;space electronic coupling facilitated by the pCp unit in their respective ground states appears to be weak.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting hydrogen production of a MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalyst with clean interface via facile one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen production from photocatalysis via the usage of multicomponent photocatalysts represents a promising pathway for carbon peaking and carbon neutrality, owing to their structural advantages in dealing with the three crucial processes in photocatalysis, namely, light harvesting, charge transfer, and surface redox reactions. We demonstrate the fabrication of a MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalyst, denoted as semiconductor/MOF/cocatalyst, by a one&#8208;pot electrochemical synthetic route. The as&#8208;fabricated multicomponent photocatalyst has a clean interface among the components, leading to close connections that contribute to high&#8208;quality heterojunction and facilitate photogenerated charge transfer and separation, thereby the efficient hydrogen evolution. The hydrogen production rate of the resultant ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/Pt is 1327 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1, which is much higher than that of ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF (15 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1) and pure Zr&#8208;MOF (10.1 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1), as well as the photodeposited&#8208;Pt products ZrO2/Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (287 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1) and Zr&#8208;MOF/PtPD (192 &#956;mol&#8729;g&#8208;1&#8729;h&#8208;1) obtained by the step&#8208;wise synthetic approach. The work gives a good inspiration for the rational design and construction of MOF&#8208;based multicomponent photocatalysts through the one&#8208;pot electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free COFs: Catalytic skeletons, linkages and edges have been employed to construct metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks for the oxygen reduction reaction. By tuning the COFs&#8217; electronic states, the corresponding catalytic properties can be precisely modulated, which provides new insight into designing such electrocatalysts at the molecular&#8208;level.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key reaction in metal air and fuel cells. Among the catalysts that promote ORR, carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts are getting more attention because of their maximum atom utilization, effective active sites and satisfactory catalytic activity and stability. However, the pyrolysis synthesis of these carbons resulted in disordered porosities and uncontrolled catalytic sites, which hindered us in realizing the catalysts&#8217; design, the optimization of catalyst performance and the elucidation of structure&#8211;property relationship at the molecular level. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constructed with designable building blocks have been employed as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the ORR due to their controlled skeletons, tailored pores size and environments, as well as well&#8208;defined location and kinds of catalytic sites. In this Concept article, the development of metal&#8208;free COFs for the ORR is summarized, and different strategies including skeletons regulation, linkages engineering and edge&#8208;sites modulation to improve the catalytic selectivity and activity are discussed. Furthermore, this Concept provides prospectives for designing and constructing powerful electrocatalysts based on the catalytic COFs.

         <title>Gd3TeBO9: A Rare&#8208;Earth Borate with Significant Magnetocaloric Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gadolinium&#8208;based oxide Gd3TeBO9 with high Gd content and excellent magnetocaloric effect is described.







Abstract
Magnetic refrigeration technology based on Gd&#8208;based paramagnets is expected to be applied to refrigeration in extremely low temperatures, thereby reducing the consumption of liquid helium. Here, we obtained a compound, Gd3TeBO9 with high Gd3+ concentration through element substitution. The Gd3+ concentration in this compound is as high as 2.4&#215;1024&#8197;ions/kg, which is 33&#8201;% higher than the commercial Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG), and further magnetic tests show that Gd3TeBO9 has a large magnetic entropy change (57.44&#8197;J/(kg&#8201;K) and 408&#8197;mJ/(cm3&#8201;K) at 2.6&#8197;K and 7&#8197;T), which is 1.5&#8197;times that of GGG, implying the possibility of its further development as an potential magnetocaloric material.

         <title>Deamination of Polyols from the Glycolysis of Polyurethane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phasing out of landfilling is inevitable, chemical recycling allows the consideration of plastic waste as a resource to get the most out of it to produce new valuable materials.







Abstract
Methylenedianiline (MDA) is a secondary, undesired, product of the glycolysis process of polyurethane (PU) scraps due to hydrolysis and pyrolysis side reactions. As an aromatic and carcinogen amine, MDA poses different problems in handling, transporting, and labelling recycled polyols derived from glycolysis, hindering the closure of PU recycling loop. Aiming to provide a solution to this issue, in this work different deaminating agents (DAs) were investigated with the purpose of analyzing their reactivity with MDA. A first part of the study was devoted to the analysis of MDA formation as a function of reaction time and catalyst concentration (potassium acetate) during glycolysis. It was observed that the amount of MDA increases almost linearly with the extent of PU depolymerization and catalyst content. Among the DAs analyzed 2&#8208;ethylhexyl glycidyl ether (2&#8208;EHGE), and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) showed interesting performance, which allowed MDA content to be diminished below the limit for labelling prescription in 30 minutes. PU rigid foams were, therefore, synthesized from the corresponding recycled products and characterized in terms of thermal and mechanical performance. Ac2O&#8208;deaminated polyols led to structurally unstable foams with poor compressive strength, while 2&#8208;EHGE&#8208;deaminated products allowed the production of foams with improved mechanical performance and unaltered thermal conductivity.

         <title>Generation of Bioactivity&#8208;Tailored FK506/FK520 Analogs by CRISPR Editing in Streptomyces tsukubaensis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic engineering by targeted CRISPR editing was used to establish a sustainable production process for bioactivity&#8208;tailored FK506/FK520 analogues displaying FKBP12 binding while calcineurin inhibition was spared for a potential use in acute kidney injury (AKI).







Abstract
For a potential application of FK506 in the treatment of acute kidney failure only the FKBP12 binding capability of the compound is required, while the immunosuppressive activity via calcineurin binding is considered as a likely risk to the patients. The methoxy groups at C13 and C15 are thought to have significant influence on the immunosuppressive activity of the molecule. Consequently, FK506 analogs with different functionalities at C13 and C15 were generated by targeted CRISPR editing of the AT domains in module&#8197;7 and 8 of the biosynthetic assembly line in Streptomyces tsukubaensis. In addition, the corresponding FK520 (C21 ethyl derivative of FK506) analogs could be obtained by media adjustments. The compounds were tested for their bioactivity in regards to FKBP12 binding, BMP potentiation and calcineurin sparing. 15&#8208;desmethoxy FK506 was superior to the other tested analogs as it did not inhibit calcineurin but retained high potency towards FKBP12 binding and BMP potentiation.

         <title>Isolation, Characterization and Reactivity of Key Intermediates Relevant to Reductive (Electro)catalysis with Cp*Rh Complexes Containing Pyridyl&#8208;MIC (MIC=Mesoionic Carbene) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation and crystallographic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical and theoretical investigations of key intermediates relevant to reductive (electro)catalysis with Rh&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;MIC complexes are presented. Additionally, the interconversion between them and their role in pre&#8208;catalytic activation are discussed.







Abstract
In recent years, metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) ligands have been reported as excellent homogeneous and molecular electrocatalysts. In combination with group 9 metals, such ligands form highly active catalysts for hydrogenation/transfer hydrogenation/hydrosilylation catalysis and electrocatalysts for dihydrogen production. Despite such progress, very little is known about the structural/electrochemical/spectroscopic properties of crucial intermediates for such catalytic reactions with these ligands: solvato complexes, reduced complexes and hydridic species. We present here a comprehensive study involving the isolation, crystallographic characterization, electrochemical/spectroelectrochemical/theoretical investigations, and in&#8208;situ reactivity studies of all the aforementioned crucial intermediates involving Cp*Rh and pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands. A detailed mechanistic study of the precatalytic activation of [RhCp*] complexes with pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands is presented. Intriguingly, amphiphilicity of the [RhCp*]&#8208;hydride complexes was observed, displaying the substrate dependent transfer of H+, H or H&#8722;. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind targeting intermediates and reactive species involving metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands and investigating the interconversion amongst them.

A water&#8208;soluble iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxide enabled the synthesis of complexes with hard transition metal ions, revealing a new structural motif in which six molecules assemble a macrocycle through C&#8208;Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bonds.







Abstract
Studies of the supramolecular chemistry of iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxides have been confined to non&#8208;polar media until now. To overcome that limitation, an iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxide was derivatized with a primary alcohol group; the compound is soluble in polar solvents and stable in acidic to neutral aqueous media. Nickel (II) and iron (II) form macrocyclic complexes with six molecules of that iso&#8208;tellurazole N&#8208;oxide in a hitherto not&#8208;observed macrocyclic arrangement defined by CTe&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O chalcogen bonds and &#954;6&#8208;O bound to the metal ion. This behaviour is in sharp contrast with the &#954;n&#8208;Te (n=1,2,4) complexes formed by soft metal ions.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Glycosyl Luciferins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the synthesis of glycosyl luciferins and their potential for determining glycosidase activity. Two novel synthetic routes were developed that were used to introduce the luciferin moiety in a late&#8208;stage of the sequence and the linear range of the glycosidase assays and kinetics of the substrates were determined.







Abstract
Measuring glycosidase activity is important to monitor any aberrations in carbohydrate hydrolase activity, but also for the screening of potential glycosidase inhibitors. To this end, synthetic substrates are needed which provide an enzyme&#8208;dependent read&#8208;out upon hydrolysis by the glycosidase. Herein, we present two new routes for the synthesis of caged luminescent carbohydrates, which can be used for determining glycosidase activity with a luminescent reporter molecule. The substrates were validated with glycosidase and revealed a clear linear range and enzyme&#8208;dependent signal upon the in&#8197;situ generation of the luciferin moiety from the corresponding nitrile precursors. Besides, we showed that these compounds could directly be synthesized from unprotected glycosyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorides in a two&#8208;step procedure with yields up to 75&#8201;%. The intermediate methyl imidate appeared a key intermediate which also reacted with d&#8208;cysteine to give the corresponding d&#8208;luciferin substrate rendering this a highly attractive method for synthesizing glycosyl luciferins in good yields.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Allylic Alcohols via Substrate Control on Asymmetric Lithiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sparteine free Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Aggarwal rearrangement was applied to various chiral acetonides. Utilizing different vinyl boronic esters a high level of substrate control was observed leading to excellent selectivities. These selectivities were attributed to stereoelectronic effects of the neighboring acetonide moiety. The obtained formal Felkin and anti&#8208;Felkin products feature up to four contiguous stereocenters representing structural motifs common in natural products.







Abstract
Allylic alcohols are a privileged motif in natural product synthesis and new methods that access them in a stereoselective fashion are highly sought after. Toward this goal, we found that chiral acetonide&#8208;protected polyketide fragments performing the Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Aggarwal rearrangement in the absence of sparteine with high yields and diastereoselectivities rendering this protocol a highly valuable alternative to the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Takai&#8211;Kishi reaction. Various stereodyads and &#8208;triads were investigated to determine their substrate induction. The mostly strong inherent stereoinduction was attributed to a combination of steric and electronic effects.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Triggered Imine Coupling: Synthesis and Characterization of Three Redox States (0,&#8211;1,&#8211;2) of a Ni(N2S2) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic voltammetry of a bis(imine&#8208;thiolate) Ni(SNS)2 complex reveals that one&#8208;electron reduction triggers ligand imine C&#8722;C bond formation, quantitatively yielding a [Ni(N2S2)]&#8901;&#8722; radical monoanion that can be reversibly oxidized or further reduced to the dianion. Detailed characterization of these three redox states elucidates the redox&#8208;active role of the N2S2 ligand.







Abstract
Metal imine&#8208;thiolate complexes, M(NS)2 are known to undergo imine C&#8722;C bond formation to give M(N2S2) complexes (M=Co, Ni) containing a redox&#8208;active ligand. Although these transfor&#8208;mations are not typically quantitative, we demonstrate here that the one&#8208;electron reduction of a related Ni bis(imine&#8208;thiolate) complex affords the corresponding paramagnetic [Ni(N2S2)]&#8208; anion (2&#8901;&#8722;) exclusively; subsequent oxidation with [Cp2Fe]BF4 then affords a high yield of neutral 2 (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl).

     alt="Electron-Triggered Imine Coupling: Synthesis and Characterization of Three Redox States (0,&#8211;1,&#8211;2) of a Ni(N2S2) Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclic voltammetry of a bis(imine-thiolate) Ni(SNS)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex reveals that one-electron reduction triggers ligand imine C&#8722;C bond formation, quantitatively yielding a [Ni(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; radical monoanion that can be reversibly oxidized or further reduced to the dianion. Detailed characterization of these three redox states elucidates the redox-active role of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ligand.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal imine-thiolate complexes, M(NS)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are known to undergo imine C&#8722;C bond formation to give M(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) complexes (M=Co, Ni) containing a redox-active ligand. Although these transfor-mations are not typically quantitative, we demonstrate here that the one-electron reduction of a related Ni bis(imine-thiolate) complex affords the corresponding paramagnetic [Ni(N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; anion (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;&#8722;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;) exclusively; subsequent oxidation with [Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe]BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; then affords a high yield of neutral &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; (Cp=&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-cyclopentadienyl). Moreover, electrochemical studies indicate that a second one-electron reduction affords the diamagnetic dianion. Both anionic products were isolated and characterized by SC-XRD and their electronic structures were investigated by UV-vis spectro-electrochemistry, EPR and NMR spectroscopy, and DFT studies. These studies show that reduction proceeds primarily on the ligand, with (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; containing both thiolate and ring-delocalized anions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preclinical Evaluation of Zn(II) Self&#8208;Assemblies with Selective Cytotoxic Activity Against Cancer Cells In Vitro and In Ovo</title>

         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;bidentate ligands L1 and L2 form dinuclear double helicates with Zn2+ and Cu2+ and these self&#8208;assemblies can bind phosphate and 4&#8208;nitrophenylphosphate anions. The complexes show selective cytotoxic and antitumor activity, but this is highly dependent upon which ligand, metal ion and anion are used. The lead compound [(L2)2Zn2]2+ displays in ovo efficacy with a 67&#8201;% reduction in tumor weight and 100&#8201;% embryo survival rate.







Abstract
Dipodal pyridylthiazole amine ligands L1 and L2 both form different metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies with Zn2+ and Cu2+ and these are shown to be toxic and selective towards cancer cell lines in&#8197;vitro. Furthermore, potency and selectivity are highly dependent upon the metal ions, ligand system and bound anion, with significant changes in chemosensitivity and selectivity dependent upon which species are employed. Importantly, significant anti&#8208;tumor activity was observed in ovo at doses that are non&#8208;toxic.

         <title>Ultrathin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Selective Photocatalytic C2H2 Semihydrogenation in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports an ultrathin MOF sheets (Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs) catalyst for selectively semihydrogenation of C2H2 into C2H4. Under C2H2 atmosphere, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalytic C2H2 hydrogenation in aqueous solution was achieved with TONC2H4 of 2124 and 99.5&#8201;% selectivity for C2H4. Even under competitive conditions (1.10&#8197;vol&#8201;% C2H4 in C2H2), Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs can reduce the concentration of C2H2 to 5&#8197;ppm with 90.3&#8201;% selectivity for C2H4 over C2H6, proved its potential for application in polymer&#8208;grade ethylene production.







Abstract
The selective semihydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H4 in crude C2H4 (with ~1&#8197;vol&#8201;% C2H2 contamination) is a crucial process in the manufacture of polyethylene. Comparing to conventional thermalcatalytic route with Pd as catalyst under high temperature with H2 as hydrogen source, photocatalytic C2H2 reduction reaction with H2O as hydrogen source can achieve high selectivity under milder conditions, but has rarely been reported. Here, we present a kind of ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs) that demonstrate excellent catalytic activities in the semihydrogenation of C2H2. Employing Ru(bpy)32+ as the photosensitizer, this catalyst attains a noteworthy turnover number (TON) of 2124 for C2H4, coupled with an impressive selectivity of 99.5&#8201;% after 12&#8197;h visible light irradiation. This performance is comparable to molecular catalysts and notably surpasses the efficiency of bulk metal&#8211;organic framework materials. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs achieve a 99.95&#8201;% conversion of C2H2 under industrial relevant conditions (1.10&#8201;% C2H2 in C2H4) with 90.3&#8201;% selectivity for C2H4 over C2H6, demonstrating a great potential for polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 production.

         <title>Reversible Reactions of Nitric Oxide with a Binuclear Iron(III) Nitrophorin Mimic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>

Strong attractive interactions between corrole subunits drive the release of nitric oxide from iron(III) nitrosyls, mimicking nitrophorin function.







Abstract
Construction of functional synthetic systems that can reversibly bind and transport the most biologically important gaseous molecules, oxygen and nitric oxide (NO), remains a contemporary challenge. Myoglobin and nitrophorin perform these respective tasks employing a protein&#8208;embedded heme center where one axial iron site is occupied by a histidine residue and the other is available for small molecule ligation, structural features that are extremely difficult to mimic in protein&#8208;free environments. Indeed, the hitherto reported designs rely on sophisticated multistep syntheses for limiting access to one of the two axial coordination sites in small molecules. We have shown previously that binuclear Ga(III) and Al(III) corroles have available axial sites, and now report a redox&#8208;active binuclear Fe(III) corrole, (1&#8208;Fe)2, in which each (corrolato)Fe(III) center is 5&#8208;coordinate, with one axial site occupied by an imidazole from the other corrole. The binuclear structure is further stabilized by attractive forces between the corrole &#960; systems. Reaction of NO with (1&#8208;Fe)2 affords mononuclear iron nitrosyls, and of functional relevance, the reaction is reversible: nitric oxide is released upon purging the nitrosyls with inert gases, thereby restoring (1&#8208;Fe)2 in solutions or films.

Design and synthesis of two new pentagon&#8208;embedded carbo[11]helicenes through the post&#8208;functionalization of twistacene, possessing high enantiomerization barriers of 42.29&#8197;kcal/mol and 40.76&#8197;kcal/mol based on TD&#8208;DFT calculation are described. Not only they can be chemically oxidized into stable cationic radicals, but also display promising radiative cooling behavior.







Abstract
Two new pentagon&#8208;embedded carbo[11]helicenes have been designed and synthesized in a three&#8208;step process, which are the first example of carbo[11]helicenes through the post&#8208;functionalization of twistacene. TD&#8208;DFT analyses indicate that both of them possess high enantiomerization barriers of 42.29&#8197;kcal/mol and 40.76&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively. They emit strong red fluorescence and can be chemically oxidized into stable cationic radicals upon addition of AgSbF6 evidenced by the bathochromic&#8208;shifted absorption spectra and the appearance of electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signals. In addition, such helical derivatives can be chosen as radiative cooling materials in a glass model house, and the maxima of 5.4&#8201;&#176;C for the former and 6.5&#8201;&#176;C for the latter are found in the comparative tests, which might be caused by the NIR reflective response.

Simple two&#8208;step synthesis towards pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;b][3]benzazepines and 7,11b&#8208;dihydro&#8208;6H&#8208;pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines from readily available (dihydro)isoquinolines is described. The key moment of the transformations is a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement in vinyl&#8208;, ethynyl substituted di(tetra)hydroisoquinolines. The influence of substituents, nucleophiles, and solvents is shown (up to 10 examples).







Abstract
Under microwave (MW) irradiation at 150&#8201;&#176;C in toluene and in the presence of nucleophiles (DMAP, triphenylphosphine and tetrahydrothiophene) 1&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;2&#8208;vinyldi&#8208; and tetrahydroisoquinolines undergo [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement providing pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;b][3]benzazepines in good yields. The replacement of toluene with acetonitrile directs the rearrangement towards the formation of 7,11b&#8208;dihydro&#8208;6H&#8208;pyrido[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines.

         <title>Are &#8220;Carbon Dots&#8221; Always Carbon Dots? Evidence for their Supramolecular Nature from Structural and Dynamic Studies in Solution and in the Pure Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model unraveling the supramolecular nature of the so&#8208;called carbon dots (CDs) is proposed, in which small to medium&#8208;sized molecular species present in dilute solution dynamically assemble into supramolecular organized structures when highly concentrated or in the solid state. (HR&#8208;TEM: high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, PFG&#8208;NMR: pulsed field gradient&#8208;NMR, TRFA: time&#8208;resolved fluorescence anisotropy).







Abstract
A model for the morphology (size, shape, and crystallinity) of carbon dots (CDs) in the solid state consistent with the observed photoluminescence in solution is proposed herein. Overwhelming evidence has been collected that links the data coming from solid&#8208;state analysis (high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS)) to that of solution (pulsed&#8208;field gradient (PFG)&#8208;NMR spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TRFA), and steady&#8208;state/time&#8208;resolved fluorescence), allowing the establishment of an overall structural model for CDs. According to this model, the so&#8208;called carbon dots, observed under HRTEM imaging, are in fact supramolecular organized structures dynamically assembled from small to medium&#8208;sized molecular species when the solvent is removed to give the solid form. In this way, the imaged nanoparticles (TEM/AFM) are not covalently bound entities formed during the synthetic process, but instead supramolecular entities formed by noncovalent interactions. These particles, if at all present in solution, have the form of loose associations of relatively small molecules. This study was conducted on CDs obtained from the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of a biomass waste (olive wet pomace).

         <title>Selective Perchlorate Sensing Using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy with Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers of semiaza&#8208;Bambusurils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SAMs of novel semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils equipped with thioethers or dithiolane functionalities as surface&#8208;anchoring groups on gold electrodes were characterized. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy employing both negative and positively charged redox couples revealed that derivatives equipped with benzyl methyl thioether, especially the lipoic amide group, were suitable for anion sensing measurements and bound perchlorate preferentially over other anions.







Abstract
In the last two decades, perchlorate salts have been identified as environmental pollutants and recognized as potential substances affecting human health. We describe self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of novel semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils (semiaza&#8208;BUs) equipped with thioethers or disulfide (dithiolane) functionalities as surface&#8208;anchoring groups on gold electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) with Fe(CN)63&#8722;/4&#8722; as a redox probe, together with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ellipsometry, were employed to characterize the interactions at the interface between the anchoring groups and the metal substrate. Data showed that the anion receptors&#8242; packing on the gold strongly depends on the anchoring group. As a result, SAMs of BUs with lipoic amide side chains show a concentration&#8208;dependent layer thickness. The BU SAMs are extremely stable on repeated electrochemical potential scans and can selectively recognize perchlorate anions. Our electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies indicated that semiaza&#8208;BU equipped with the lipoic amide side chains binds perchlorate (2&#8211;100&#8197;mM) preferentially over other anions such as F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, I&#8722;, AcO&#8722;, H2PO4&#8722;, HPO42&#8722;, SO42&#8722;, NO2&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, or CO32&#8722;. The resistance performance is 10 to 100&#8197;times more efficient than SAMs containing all other tested anions.

An elegant total chemical synthesis route has been developed for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike&#8208;RBD. Leveraging a multi&#8208;segment convergent native chemical ligation strategy, this innovative approach holds immense promise in advancing the development of effective intervention strategies against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The highly efficient chemical synthesis method outlined here can be directly applied to the synthesis of other mutated variants or the mirror&#8208;image of the spike RBD for screening against peptide/protein&#8208;based library.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its global spread have created an unprecedented public health crisis. The spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has gained significant attention due to its crucial role in viral entry into host cells and its potential as both a prophylactic and a target for therapeutic interventions. Herein, we report the first successful total synthesis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), highlighting the key challenges and the strategies employed to overcome them. Appropriate utilization of advanced solid phase peptide synthesis and cutting&#8208;edge native chemical ligation methods have facilitated the synthesis of this moderately large protein molecule. We discuss the problems encountered during the chemical synthesis and approaches taken to optimize the yield and the purity of the synthetic protein molecule. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the chemically synthesized homogeneous spike RBD efficiently binds to the known mini&#8208;protein binder LCB1. The successful chemical synthesis of the spike RBD presented here can be utilized to gain valuable insights into SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBD biology, advancing our understanding and aiding the development of intervention strategies to combat future coronavirus outbreaks. The modular synthetic approach described in this study can be effectively implemented in the synthesis of other mutated variants or enantiomer of the spike RBD for mirror&#8208;image drug discovery.

         <title>Magnetic Relaxations of Chromium Nitride Porphyrinato Complexes Driven by the Anisotropic g&#8208;Factor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>

Detailed analyses for vibrational and dynamical magnetism of chromium nitride (CrN2&#8722;)&#8208;porphyrinato complex revealed that g&#8208;value anisotropy accelerates magnetic relaxations greater than the internal magnetic field from nuclear spin does.







Abstract
Molecule&#8208;based magnetic materials are useful candidates as the spin qubit due to their long coherence time and high designability. The anisotropy of the g&#8208;values of the metal complexes can be utilized to access the individual spin of the metal complexes, making it possible to achieve the scalable molecular spin qubit. For this goal, it is important to evaluate the effect of g&#8208;value anisotropy on the magnetic relaxation behaviour. This study reports the slow magnetic relaxation behaviour of chromium nitride (CrN2+) porphyrinato complex (1), which is structurally and magnetically similar with the vanadyl (VO2+) porphyrinato complex (2) which is known as the excellent spin qubit. Detailed analyses for vibrational and dynamical magnetism of 1 and 2 revealed that g&#8208;value anisotropy accelerates magnetic relaxations greater than the internal magnetic field from nuclear spin does. These results provide a design criterion for construction of multiple spin qubit based on g&#8208;tensor engineering.

A cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyzes the hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates. DFT calculations support a mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8722;N bond formation.







Abstract
We report hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates catalyzed by a cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyst. The cyclic carbodiphosphorane outperformed the other Lewis basic carbon species tested, including other zerovalent carbon compounds, phosphorus ylides, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin. Hydroborations of seven carbodiimides and nine isocyanates were performed at room temperature to form N&#8208;boryl formamidine and N&#8208;boryl formamide products. Intermolecular competition experiments demonstrated the selective hydroboration of alkyl isocyanates over carbodiimide and ketone substrates. DFT calculations support a proposed mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Amphoteric Reactivity of an Iron&#8208;Bispidine Complex</title>

A transient iron(III)&#8208;superoxido species in disguise orchestrates the reactivity of an iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxido complex stabilized in an engineered bispidine scaffold.







Abstract
The reactivity of FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complexes has remained a riddle to inorganic chemists owing to their thermal instability and impotency towards organic substrates. These iron&#8208;oxygen adducts have been known as sluggish oxidants towards oxidative electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Herein, we report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a relatively stable mononuclear high&#8208;spin FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex supported by an engineered bispidine framework. Against the notion, this FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex serves as a rare example of versatile reactivity in both electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Detailed mechanistic studies and computational calculations reveal a novel reaction mechanism, where a putative superoxido intermediate orchestrates the amphoteric property of the oxidant. The design of the backbone is pivotal to convey stability and reactivity to alkylperoxido and superoxido intermediates. Contrary to the well&#8208;known O&#8722;O bond cleavage that generates an FeIV&#8208;oxido species, the FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex reported here undergoes O&#8722;C bond scission to generate a superoxido moiety that is responsible for the amphiphilic reactivity.

         <title>9&#8208;Azahomocubane</title>

9&#8208;Azahomocubane is unique amongst the nitrogen derivatives of homocubane, as it contains a secondary nitrogen atom, which can be used as a building block through amide bond formation. Herein reported is the first synthesis of 9&#8208;azahomocubane, which was achieved via a rarely utilized Stieglitz rearrangement, and confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis. The chemical stability of 9&#8208;azahomocubane exceeds that of the 1&#8208;azahomocubane, as predicted, although the basicity and calculated strain energy are similar.







Abstract
Homocubane, a highly strained cage hydrocarbon, contains two very different positions for the introduction of a nitrogen atom into the skeleton, e.&#8201;g., a position 1 exchange results in a tertiary amine whereas position 9 yields a secondary amine. Herein reported is the synthesis of 9&#8208;azahomocubane along with associated structural characterization, physical property analysis and chemical reactivity. Not only is 9&#8208;azahomocubane readily synthesized, and found to be stable as predicted, the basicity of the secondary amine was observed to be significantly lower than the structurally related azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, although similar to 1&#8208;azahomocubane.

         <title>Oxidants Controlled C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of N&#8208;Aryltetrahydroisoquinolines: The Construction of the Quaternary Carbon Center and Cleavage of the C&#8722;N Bond</title>

A C&#8722;H functionalization of &#945;&#8208;THIQ esters was achieved by triarylamine radical cation salt and tert&#8208;butyl nitrite, respectively, providing a series of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy THIQ esters and N&#8208;NO skeleton containing keto esters under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Initiated by triarylamine radical cation salt (TBPA), the direct C&#8722;H bond functionalization of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;aryltetrahydroisoquinoline esters was smoothly realized, giving a series of &#945;&#8208;hydroxylated derivatives with a quaternary carbon center in good yields. Differently, in the presence of tert&#8208;butyl nitrite (TBN), the C&#8722;N single bond was cleaved to keto esters. The mechanistic study revealed that these reactions were mediated by a similar mechanism, in which the N&#8208;nitrosation might provide a driving force to the C&#8722;N bond cleavage.

         <title>Regulating the Interfacial Charge Density by Constructing a Novel Zn Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Highly Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thepolar organic molecule amidinothiourea (ATU), as an electrolyte additive, can be stably adsorbed on the surface of zinc metal to construct the zinc anode&#8208;electrolyte interface and build new Zn&#8208;bond, promoting Zn2+ desolvation and deposition kinetics. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bonding network of the electrolyte can be reconstructed by ATU, which facilitates the migration of cation.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted considerable attention. However, due to the uneven distribution of charge density at Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface, severe dendrites and corrosion are generated during cycling. In this work, a facile and scalable strategy to address the above&#8208;mentioned issues has been proposed through regulating the charge density at Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. As a proof of concept, amidinothiourea (ATU) with abundant lone&#8208;pair electrons is employed as an interfacial charge modifier for Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The uniform and increased interfacial charge distribution on Zn anode&#8208;electrolyte interface has been obtained. Moreover, the unique Zn&#8208;bond constructed between N atoms and Zn2+ as well as the hydrogen bonds are formed among ATU and Ac&#8722; anion/active H2O, which promote the migration and desolvation behavior of Zn2+ at anode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Accordingly, at a trace concentration of 0.01&#8197;mg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 ATU, these features endow Zn anode with a long cycling life (more than 800&#8197;h), and a high average Columbic efficiency (99.52&#8201;%) for Zn||Cu batteries. When pairing with I2 cathode, the improved cycling ability (5000 cycles) with capacity retention of 77.9&#8201;% is achieved. The fundamental understanding on the regulation of charge density at anode&#8208;electrolyte interface can facilitate the development of AZIBs.

         <title>Please Mind the Gap: Highly Condensed P&#8211;N Networks in LiP4N7 and Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x</title>

The highly condensed lithium nitridophosphates LiP4N7 and Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x were prepared at pressures of 10&#8197;GPa in the multianvil press. Their structures were elucidated and their thermal stabilities and expansion coefficients were investigated. Synthesis of these materials closes a gap in the periodic table, as other alkali nitridophosphates like NaP4N7 or Na3P6N11 have been known for decades.







Abstract
Alkali nitridophosphates AP4N7 and A3P6N11 (A=Na, K, Rb, Cs) have been known for decades. However, their Li homologues have remained elusive. In this work, the highly condensed lithium (imido)nitridophosphates LiP4N7 and Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x (x=1.66(3)) were synthesized from LiPN2 and P3N5 in the multianvil press at 10&#8197;GPa. They constitute the first lithium nitridophosphates with 3D networks exhibiting a degree of condensation larger than 0.5 and high thermal stability. LiP4N7 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with a=4.5846(6)&#8197;&#197;, b=8.0094(11)&#8197;&#197;, and c=13.252(2)&#8197;&#197; (Z=4). Li3&#8722;xP6N11&#8722;x(NH)x crystallizes in the triclinic space group P
 with Z=2, a=4.6911(11)&#8197;&#197;, b=7.024(2)&#8197;&#197;, c=12.736(3)&#8197;&#197;, &#945;=87.726(11), &#946;=80.279(11), and &#947;=70.551(12)&#176;. Both compounds are stable against hydrolysis in air.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Cyanobactin Natural Product Balgacyclamide B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic pathway for balgacyclamide B was developed in 17&#8208;steps and a 2&#8201;% overall yield. The synthetic pathway opens a new route towards recently isolated cyanobactin's, especially for the balgacyclamide family and its analogs. Advanced intermediates from the synthetic pathway are being used to explore porin&#8208;mediated transportation in gram&#8208;negative bacteria.







Abstract
Balgacyclamide A&#8722;C are a family of cyanobactin natural products isolated from freshwater cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa. These macrocyclic peptides are characterized by their oxazoline&#8208;thiazole core, their 7 or 8 stereocenters, and their antiparasitic activities. Balgacyclamide B is known for its activity towards Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine&#8208;resistant strain K1, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, and Leishmania donovani. In this report, the first total synthesis of Balgacyclamide B is described in a 17&#8208;steps pathway and a 2&#8201;% overall yield. The synthetic pathway toward balgacyclamide B can be adapted for the future syntheses of balgacyclamide A and C. In addition, a brief history background of oxazolines syntheses is shown to emphasize the importance of the cyclization conditions used to interconvert or retain configuration of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides via dehydrative cyclization.

         <title>Hauser&#8208;Kraus Annulation Initiated Multi&#8208;Cascade Reactions for Facile Access to Functionalized and Fused Oxazepines, Carbazoles and Phenanthridinediones</title>

Advancing on track. Several nitrogen&#8208;containing aromatic heterocycles such as dihydrobenzo[d]naphthooxazepine, benzo[a]carbazole and benzo[j]phenanthridine&#8208;7,12&#8208;dione are accessible by a base mediated reaction of 3&#8208;olefinic oxindole with 3&#8208;nucleophilic phthalide. This cascade synthesis involved several regioselective steps such as Hauser&#8208;Kraus annulation, ring cleavage (C&#8722;C&#963;), ring expansion, ring opening and ring contraction reactions in one pot. The formation of a new compound at every stage of the reaction by forming multiple new chemical bonds while proceeding to the title compound is another highlight of this reaction sequence. Further, the transformation generates stable and isolable medium rings. The complete mechanism of the reaction was rationalized by isolating and converting all stable intermediates to target compounds and by control experiments.







Abstract
The Hauser&#8208;Kraus (H&#8722;K) annulation of N&#8208;unsubstituted 3&#8208;olefinic oxindoles with 3&#8208;nucleophilic phthalides triggers a cascade of ring expansion and ring contraction reactions through several regioselective steps in one pot. While oxazepines were isolated in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of base at room temperature, carbazoles and phenanthridinediones were the products in the presence of excess base and microwave irradiation. Mechanistic studies guided by stepwise reactions and control experiments revealed that the isolable oxazepine intermediate, formed via ring expansion of the H&#8722;K adduct, is the key precursor to carbazole and phenanthridinedione via decarboxylative regioselective cyclizations.

[1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement can dearomatize aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles! Through a one&#8208;pot four&#8208;step process that includes lithiation, nucleophilic addition, Brook rearrangement, and dearomatization reaction, we enable the formation of non&#8208;aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles with functional capabilities starting from readily available precursors. Subsequent functionalization reactions provide access to a diverse compound library.







Abstract
The [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement stands as a potent technique for constructing complex molecules. In this study, we showcase its power in the dearomatization of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles. Through a concise four&#8208;step process that integrates lithiation, nucleophilic addition, Brook rearrangement and dearomatization reaction, we demonstrate a versatile strategy for generating diverse non&#8208;aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles which exhibit ambident reactivities. Various acyl silanes, halo&#8208;pyridines, and quinolines have been explored within this context. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated through the construction of complex architectures.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening of 1,3&#8208;Imidazole Based Mesoionic Carbenes (iMICs) and Ring&#8208;Closing Clicks: Facile Access to iMIC&#8208;Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 3, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable unmasked iMICs are extremely scarce and have limited shelf&#8208;life. An unprecedented ring&#8208;opening of iMICs to N&#8208;ethynylformimidamides (eFIMs) has been reported. eFIMs are thermally stable under an inert atmosphere and show moderately air&#8208;stability. They are excellent iMIC&#8208;surrogates and readily undergo ring&#8208;closing&#8208;clicks with a variety of (non)metal Lewis acids, affording iMIC&#8208;compounds (iMIC)[M] with zero waste and easy workup.







Abstract
Herein, ring&#8208;opening of mesoionic carbenes (iMICs) (iMIC=[ArC{N(Dipp)}2C(SiMe3)C:) (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3, Ar=Ph, 4&#8208;Me2NC6H4 or 4&#8208;PhC6H4) based on an 1,3&#8208;imidazole scaffold to yield N&#8208;ethynylformimidamide (eFIM) derivatives as crystalline solids (eFIM={(Dipp)N=C(Ar)N(Dipp)}C&#8801;CSiMe3) is reported. eFIMs are thermally stable under inert gas atmosphere and show moderate air stability (t1/2=3&#8197;h for Ar=Ph). eFIMs are excellent surrogates of iMICs, which generally have a limited shelf&#8208;life, and readily undergo ring&#8208;closing click reactions with a variety of main&#8208;group as well as transition metal Lewis acids to form hitherto challenging iMIC&#8208;compounds in good to excellent yields. In addition to the relevance of eFIMs in the synthesis of iMIC&#8208;compounds, quantification of the stereoelectronic properties of a representative iMIC (Ar=Ph) by experimental and theoretical methods suggests remarkably &#963;&#8208;donor property and steric profile of these new ligand sets.

The detection of perchlorate is necessary for monitoring environmental pollution. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302968), E. Keinan, J. Huskens, O. Reany and co&#8208;workers show that self&#8208;assembled monolayers of semiaza&#8208;bambus[6]urils show excellent sensitivity and selectivity in the electrochemical impedimetric detection of the perchlorate anion in comparison to other anions.

The depicted model unveils the supramolecular nature of the so&#8208;called carbon dots (CDs), which in dilute solution are in fact individual small&#8208;to&#8208;medium&#8208;sized molecular species that only assemble into supramolecular organized structures when in the solid state. The image also alludes to the main techniques that allowed coherent correlations to be established between the morphology of CDs in the solid state (HRTEM) and the solution properties. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;V. Prata and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302955).

Owing to the advantages of high surface area, tenable polygonal porosity, predictable and stable structure, and precise chemical control, covalent organic frameworks offer numerous potential in addressing the crucial points for sensing application. Here, we systematically review recent chemical sensors based on covalent organic frameworks.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a type of crystalline porous polymer composed of light elements through strong covalent bonds. COFs have attracted considerable attention due to their unique designable structures and excellent material properties. Currently, COFs have shown outstanding potential in various fields, including gas storage, pollutant removal, catalysis, adsorption, optoelectronics, and their research in the sensing field is also increasingly flourishing. In this review, we focus on COF&#8208;based sensors. Firstly, we elucidate the fundamental principles of COF&#8208;based sensors. Then, we present the primary application areas of COF&#8208;based sensors and their recent advancements, encompassing gas, ions, organic compounds, and biomolecules sensing. Finally, we discuss the future trends and challenges faced by COF&#8208;based sensors, outlining their promising prospects in the field of sensing.

Fluorescent mesoporous silica materials (FMSMs) exhibit a series of significant advantages in sensing. FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors have been well developed and widely applied in environmental and biological fields. In this review, the preparation methodologies, sensing mechanisms, and applications in solutions and biospecimens of FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors are summarized and discussed in detail.







Abstract
Since Cu2+ ions play a pivotal role in both ecosystems and human health, the development of a rapid and sensitive method for Cu2+ detection holds significant importance. Fluorescent mesoporous silica materials (FMSMs) have garnered considerable attention in the realm of chemical sensing, biosensing, and bioimaging due to their distinctive structure and easily functionalized surfaces. As a result, numerous Cu2+ sensors based on FMSMs have been devised and extensively applied in environmental and biological Cu2+ detection over the past few decades. This review centers on the recent advancements in the methodologies for preparing FMSMs, the mechanisms underlying sensing, and the applications of FMSMs&#8208;based sensors for Cu2+ detection. Lastly, we present and elucidate pertinent perspectives concerning FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the N&#8208;Hydroxylations Catalyzed by the&#160;Binuclear Iron Domain of SznF enzyme: Key Piece in the Synthesis of Streptozotocin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SznF, a member of the emerging family of heme&#8208;oxygenase&#8208;like (HO&#8208;like) di&#8208;iron oxidases and oxygenases, employs two distinct domains to catalyze the conversion of N&#969;&#8208;methyl&#8208;L&#8208;arginine (L&#8208;NMA) into N&#8208;nitroso&#8208;containing product, which can subsequently be transformed into streptozotocin. Using unrestricted density functional theory (UDFT) with the hybrid functional B3LYP, we have mechanistically investigated the two sequential hydroxylations of L&#8208;NMA catalyzed by SznF's binuclear iron central domain. Mechanism B primarily involves the O&#8208;O bond dissociation, forming Fe(IV)=O, induced by the H+/e&#8722; introduction to the FeA side of &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8208;Fe2(III/III), the substrate hydrogen abstraction by Fe(IV)=O, and the hydroxyl rebound to the substrate N radical. The stochastic addition of H+/e&#8722; to the FeB side (mechanism C) can transition to mechanism B, thereby preventing enzyme deactivation. Two other competing mechanisms, involving the direct O&#8208;O bond dissociation (mechanism A) and the addition of H2O as a co&#8208;substrate (mechanism D), have been ruled out.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity of a Mononuclear N,N,O&#8208;Bound Fe(II) &#945;&#8208;Keto&#8208;Acid Complex</title>

Modelling &#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Enzymes. We employed a bulky, tripodal N,N,O phenolate ligand to synthesise the first example of a mononuclear, N,N,O&#8208;bound iron(II) &#945;&#8208;keto&#8208;acid complex. This unique, pentacoordinate complex is a close structural model of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent iron enzymes. The complex undergoes rapid decarboxylation when exposed to O2, thereby mirroring important aspects of native enzyme reactivity.







Abstract
A bulky, tridentate phenolate ligand (ImPh2NNOtBu) was used to synthesise the first example of a mononuclear, facial, N,N,O&#8208;bound iron(II) benzoylformate complex, [Fe(ImPh2NNOtBu)(BF)] (2). The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of 2 reveals that the iron centre is pentacoordinate (&#964;=0.5), with a vacant site located cis to the bidentate BF ligand. The M&#246;ssbauer parameters of 2 are consistent with high&#8208;spin iron(II), and are very close to those reported for &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;bound non&#8208;heme iron enzyme active sites. According to&#8197;NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, the structural integrity of 2 is retained in both coordinating and non&#8208;coordinating solvents. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the iron centre has a very low oxidation potential and is more prone to electrochemical oxidation than the redox&#8208;active phenolate ligand. Complex 2 reacts with NO to form a S=3/2 {FeNO}7 adduct in which NO binds directly to the iron centre, according to EPR, UV&#8208;vis, IR spectroscopies and DFT analysis. Upon O2 exposure, 2 undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to form a diiron(III) benzoate complex, [Fe2(ImPh2NNOtBu)2(&#956;2&#8208;OBz)(&#956;2&#8208;OH)2]+ (3). A small amount of hydroxylated ligand was also observed by ESI&#8208;MS, hinting at the formation of a high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediate. Initial reactivity studies show that 2 is capable of oxygen atom transfer reactivity with O2, converting methyl(p&#8208;tolyl)sulfide to sulfoxide.

         <title>Fluorinated Polymer Donors for Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the last decade, the fluorination of polymer donors has dominated the development of high&#8208;performance OSCs. This review summarized the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, fluorinated polymers and their physical and photovoltaic properties. A concise outlook is presented for fluorinated polymer donors to fulfill the practical application of OSCs.







Abstract
The rapid development of narrow&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) has boosted the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs) over 19&#8201;%. The new features of high&#8208;performance NFAs, such as visible&#8208;NIR light absorption, moderate the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO), and high crystallinity, require polymer donors with matching physical properties. This emphasizes the importance of methods that can effectively tune the physical properties of polymers. Owning to very small atom size and strongest electronegativity, the fluorination has been proved the most efficient strategy to regulate the physical properties of polymer donors, including frontier energy level, absorption coefficient, dielectric constant, crystallinity and charge transport. Owing to the success of fluorination strategy, the vast majority of high&#8208;performance polymer donors possess one or more fluorine atoms. In this review, the fluorination synthetic methods, the synthetic route of well&#8208;known fluorinated building blocks, the fluorinated polymers which are categorized by the type of donor or acceptor units, and the relationships between the polymer structures, properties, and photovoltaic performances are comprehensively surveyed. We hope this review could provide the readers a deeper insight into fluorination strategy and lay a strong foundation for future innovation of fluorinated polymers.

         <title>Phosphinidenes: Fundamental Properties and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphinidenes are very reactive compounds containing a monocoordinated phosphorus atom, and this class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds serves as versatile intermediates in synthetic phosphorus chemistry. In this Concept we will review the recent experimental progresses in probing the fundamental properties of the prototype phosphinidenes in the triplet and singlet state.







Abstract
Phosphinidenes are heavy congeners of nitrenes that have been broadly used as in&#8197;situ reagents in synthetic phosphorus chemistry and also serve as versatile ligands in coordination with transition metals. However, the detection of free phosphinidenes is largely challenged by their high reactivity and also the lack of suitable synthetic methods, rendering the knowledge about the fundamental properties of this class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds limited. Recently, an increasing number of free phosphinidenes bearing prototype structural and bonding properties have been prepared for the first time, thus enabling the exploration of their distinct reactivity from the nitrene analogues. This Concept article will discuss the experimental approaches for the generation of the highly unstable phosphinidenes and highlight their distinct reactivity from the nitrogen analogues so as to stimuate future studies about their potential applications in phosphorus chemistry.

         <title>Zeolite/Polymer Composites Prepared by Photopolymerization: Effect of Compensation Cations on Opacity and Gas Adsorption Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphical abstract: The composition of zeolite influences the photopolymerization process of zeolite/polymer&#8208;based composites. The nature of compensation cations was examined to determine their effect on the opacity of the cured composite (via colorimetric analyses) and on the gas adsorption properties (for water, carbon dioxide and 1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene) on calcined composites.







Abstract
The fabrication of structured zeolite adsorbents through photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing which offers a solution to the limitations of conventional shaping techniques has been demonstrated but many parameters still need to be optimized. In this study, we studied the influence of zeolite compensation cations on the photopolymerization and the composite's properties. Modified zeolites (LTA 4&#8197;A and FAU 13X exchanged with K+, Li+, Sr2+, Ca2+ or Mg2+) were incorporated in PEGDA with BDMK as photoinitiator, and the formulation was cured under mild conditions (LED@405&#8197;nm, room temperature, under air). Our results indicate that the nature of zeolite compensation cations affects the colorimetric properties of polymer/zeolite composites: a better translucency parameter results in higher depth of cure. After calcination at 650&#8201;&#176;C and complete removal of PEGDA, pure zeolitic monoliths were tested for adsorption of gas molecules of interest (carbon dioxide, dichlorobenzene and water). Structured 4&#8197;A and 13X monoliths obtained by 3D printing exhibit comparable adsorption capacity to commercial beads prepared from the same zeolites. This study enhances our understanding of the photopolymerization process involved in the production of polymer/zeolite composites. These composites are used in the fabrication of zeolitic objects through 3D printing, offering potential solutions to various environmental and dental challenges.

         <title>Heterometallic AuI6AgI6 Macrocyclic Cluster Templated by a Supramolecular Melamine Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The AuI6AgI6 macrocyclic cluster has been constructed by a supramolecular templating approach. The bilayered tri&#8208;deprotonated melamine dimer [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722;]2 held together with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions is observed for the first time, and it is important for the highly ordered alignment of metal atoms. The supramolecular templates containing multiple symmetric binding sites present a facile approach to functional metal clusters.







Abstract
The application of supramolecular templates in aligning atomically precise heterometal arrays is important for pursuing functional materials. Herein, we report that a bilayered supramolecular tri&#8208;deprotonated melamine dimer functions as an effective template in the construction of a heterometallic gold(I)&#8208;silver(I) macrocyclic cluster [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722;]2&#8722;AuI6AgI6. X&#8208;ray single crystal structural analysis showed that a crown&#8208;like AuI6AgI6 macrocycle is aligned around two parallelly stacked &#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722; moieties hold together with &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Theoretical calculations revealed that the [&#956;6&#8208;(C3N6H3)3&#8722;]2 motif dominantly contributes to the near&#8208;occupied orbitals in the electronic structure, which is closely related to its luminescence properties. This work demonstrates that the supramolecular templates containing multiple symmetric binding sites may present a facile approach in the construction of functional metal clusters.

The coordination chemistry of the homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;dinuclear tetrahedral molybdenum complexes [Mo2E2] (E=P, As, Sb) and [Mo2PE] (E=As, Sb) towards [(dppf)Cu(MeCN)2][BF4] are presented showing structural evidence of the side&#8208;on &#951;2&#8208;coordination of the tetrahedral [Mo2PE] and [Mo2E2] complexes and a rare &#951;1&#8208;coordination of the [Mo2PSb] complex.







Abstract
Novel isomorphous tetranuclear complexes, [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;E2{CpMo(CO)2}2]BF4 [E=P (1), As (4), Sb (5), (dppf=1,1&#8242;&#8208;bis&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;ferrocene)] and [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE{CpMo(CO)2}2]BF4 [E=As (2), Sb(3)] were synthesized from the reactions between [(dppf)Cu(MeCN)2][BF4] and tetrahedral molybdenum complexes containing unsubstituted homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;diatomic group&#8208;15 elements [(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;E2{CpMo(CO)2}2] [E=P (A), As (D), Sb (E)] and [(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8208;PE{CpMo(CO)2}2] [E=As (B), Sb (C)], respectively. In all these products, the {Mo2E2} or {Mo2PE} moieties coordinate the Cu(I) center via a rare side&#8208;on &#951;2&#8208;coordination mode. The X&#8208;ray structure analyses of [(dppf)Cu(&#956;3,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8208;PSb{CpMo(CO)2}2][BF4] demonstrate, for the first time, the utilization of an &#951;1&#8208;coordination mode for the ligand complex C to coordinate to the Cu(I) center. All the products were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Electrochemical studies also revealed the formation of 1&#8211;5, and, further, to understand the structure and bonding of the products, theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) were conducted.

         <title>Characterization by Gel Permeation Chromatography of the Molecular Weight of Supramolecular Polymers Generated by Forming Polyrotaxanes through the Introduction of External Stoppers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers find wide applications across diverse domains, and the molecular weight exerts a critical influence on their applicability. Consequently, the measurement of molecular weight for supramolecular polymers assumes paramount significance. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) requiring low&#8208;concentration condition is a common characterization employed for molecular weight determination, which is not suitable for supramolecular polymers possessing concentration&#8208;independence property. Here, to break this threshold, we synthesized M1 embodying dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) moiety as well as dibenzylammonium salt (DBA) group, which was capable of self&#8208;assembling into supramolecular polymers terminated with aldehyde groups at its end. Upon the addition of (4&#8208; (1,2,2&#8208;Triphenylvinyl) phenyl) methylamine (TPE&#8208;NH2), supramolecular polymers underwent a transition into polyrotaxanes, for which it was led by the generation of imine bonds. By virtue of GPC, the molecular weight of polyrotaxanes was obtained, then it was available to gain the molecular weight of supramolecular polymers with the help of transformation efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Potential of Fused Heterocycle&#8208;Based Triarylhydrazone Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of triarylhydrazone photoswitches was designed, following an idea to control the strength of a hydrogen bond connecting the photo&#8208;active hydrazone part with a heteroaryl substituent. Introducing a benzothiazole moiety results in high overall thermal stability, absorption above 365&#8197;nm, while maintaining satisfactory photoconversion rates. High&#8208;quality calculations and advanced ultrafast spectroscopy allowed the nature of the electronic transitions to be resolved, and the light was shed on the mechanism of photoisomerization and de&#8208;excitation processes.







Abstract
Triarylhydrazones represent an attractive class of photochromic compounds offering many interesting features including high molar absorptivity, good addressability, and extraordinary thermal stability. In addition, unlike most other hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitches, they effectively absorb light above 365&#8197;nm. However, previously prepared triaryhydrazones suffer from low quantum yields of the Z&#8594;E photoisomerization. Here, we have designed a new subclass of naphthoyl&#8208;benzothiazole hydrazones that balance the most beneficial features of previously reported naphthoyl&#8208;quinoline and benzoyl&#8208;pyridine triarylhydrazones. These preserve the attractive absorption characteristics, exhibit higher thermal stability of the metastable form than the former and enhance the rate of the Z&#8594;E photoisomerization compared to the later, as a result of the weakening of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydrazone hydrogen and the benzothiazole moiety. Introducing the benzothiazole motif extends the tunability of the photochromic behaviour of hydrazone&#8208;based switches.

         <dc:description>
Biological evaluation of cuneane analogs of ketoprofen, an anti&#8208;inflammatory drug having m&#8208;substituted benzene moiety, was conducted. This study was inspired from the structural similarity of 1,3&#8208;substituted cuneanes with m&#8208;substituted benzene. Selective isomerization of 1,4&#8208;substituted cubanes into 1,3&#8208;substituted cuneanes enabled this evaluation. Biological evaluation of the synthesized analogs of ketoprofen and in silico study of the result of biological study revealed a potential isosteric usage of cuneane skeleton as a m&#8208;substituted benzenes in medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
We herein evaluate a biological applicability of 1,3&#8208;substituted cuneanes as an isostere of m&#8208;substituted benzenes based on its structural similarity. An investigation of a method to obtain 1,3&#8208;substituted cuneanes by selective isomerization of 1,4&#8208;substituted cubanes enables this attempt by giving a key synthetic step to obtain a cuneane analogs of pharmaceuticals having m&#8208;substituted benzene moiety. Biological evaluation of the synthesized analogs and in silico study of the obtained result revealed a potential usage of cuneane skeleton in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Photophysical Properties of Asymmetric Fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we reported the one&#8208;pot synthesis, structures, and properties of novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, in comparison with benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs. The different structures and properties can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. A new BODIPY with helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton and intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption was developed.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a one&#8208;pot procedure to synthesize novel fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs from &#945;&#8208;(2&#8208;alkynylphenyl)&#8208;pyrrole and acylpyrrole, using 5&#8208;exo cyclization as the key transformation. Compared to benzene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs, although they have similar chemical compositions, their structures and properties significantly differ from each other, which can be attributed to the less aromaticity of the fulvene linker than benzene. Notably, fulvene&#8208;[b]&#8208;fused BODIPY 1&#8201;b exhibits helical&#8208;twisted core skeleton, intensified red&#8208;shifted absorption, and peak fluorescence. In addition, the pathway of this one&#8208;pot reaction and the mechanism of POCl3 mediated 5&#8208;exo cyclization have been proposed by a combining experimental and computational study.

         <title>Ferrocenyl Dinuclear Gold(I) Complexes. Study of their Structural Features and the Influence of Bridging and Phosphane Ligands in a Catalytic Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinuclear gold(I) complexes with ferrocenylphosphane and different bridging ligands such as, chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate have a significant influence in their reactivity. Chloride&#8208;bridged complexes excel as highly efficient catalysts, while thiolate&#8208;bridged ones exhibit varied conversion rates. Additionally, the use of monophosphane or diphosphane ligands introduces intriguing performance differences, offering prospects for customized catalytic systems.







Abstract
The combination of the ferrocene moiety with gold(I) catalysis remains a relatively unexplored field. In this article, we delve into the synthesis, characterization, and potential catalytic activity of four complexes utilizing both monodentate and bidentate ferrocenyl diphenylphosphane ligands (ppf and dppf), coordinated with two gold(I) metal centers, linked by either chloride or pentafluorophenylthiolate bridging ligands. This leads to the formation of cationic &#8220;self&#8208;activated&#8221; precatalysts capable of initiating the catalytic cycle without the need for external additives. The catalytic activity of these complexes was assessed through a model reaction in gold(I) catalysis, specifically the cyclization of a N&#8208;propargylbenzamide to produce an oxazole. In addition, we studied and compared the influence exerted by both the phosphane and the bridging ligand on the performance of these catalysts.

         <title>Incorporating Photoresponses into Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous liquids are a relatively new class of porous material, and while a large proportion of research has been aimed at improving gas capacity and selectivity, there has been less focus on the selective and controllable release of gas from within the material. With a handful of examples now reported, we discuss the concept of photoresponsive porous liquids, aimed at invoking a change in the gas capacity on irradiation with light, and discuss important factors in their design, alongside potential strategies for the realisation of further systems.







Abstract
Porous liquids combine the properties of a porous solid with those of a liquid, creating a porous flowable media. Since their discovery, these materials have gathered widespread interest within the scientific community, with substantial numbers of new systems being discovered, often with a focus on increasing the pore volume and gas capacity. Which begs the question, what does the future hold for porous liquids? Recently, the first examples of photoresponsive porous liquids have emerged, allowing changes in porosity to be observed under UV irradiation. Here, we expand on our previous report of photoresponsive porous liquids and explore the conceptualisation of responsive porous liquids and how these materials could be developed with the ability to respond to light, thereby offering a potential mechanism of controllable uptake and release in these systems. This concept article summarises different approaches that could be used to incorporate a photoresponse in a porous liquid before discussing recently reported systems, alongside important factors to consider in their design. Finally, by taking inspiration from the methods used to translate porous solids into the liquid state, combined with the field of photoresponsive materials, we discuss potential strategies that could be employed to realise further examples of photoresponsive porous liquids.

         <title>Bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane Building Blocks as Promising Benzene and Cycloalkane Isosteres: Multigram Synthesis, Physicochemical and Structural Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence (EDIEA) is an efficient approach to bicyclic fused and bridged mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks. The method is applicable for the multigram preparation of the target compounds, which is illustrated by synthesis of over 50 building blocks on up to 150&#8197;g scale. Physicochemical and structural parameters of the title scaffolds illustrate their utility as promising benzene and cycloalkane isosteres and provide a rationale for fine&#8208;tuning the compound's properties during drug optimization.







Abstract
Electrophilic double bond functionalization &#8211; intramolecular enolate alkylation sequence was used to obtain a series of bridged and fused bicyclo[m.n.k]alkane derivatives (i.&#8201;e., bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes, bicyclo[3.2.1]octanes, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes, and bicyclo[4.2.0]heptanes). The scope and limitations of the method were established, and applicability to the multigram synthesis of target bicyclic compounds was illustrated. Using the developed protocols, over 50 mono&#8208; and bifunctional building blocks relevant to medicinal chemistry were prepared. The synthesized compounds are promising isosteres of benzene and cycloalkane rings, which is confirmed by their physicochemical and structural characterization (pKa, LogP, and exit vector parameters (EVP)). &#8220;Rules of thumb&#8221; for the upcoming isosteric replacement studies were proposed.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth of 1D covalent organic frameworks perpendicularly on the surface of GO nanosheets, a 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D design, improves the photocatalytic performance for many tandem oxidation and hydrogenation reactions. Under white light irradiation, 1D COF nanorods exhibit a superior visible light activity. The improved charge transfer and desirable separation rate obtain through the junction between COR and GO sheets.







Abstract
Development of one dimensional covalent organic frameworks (1D&#8208;COFs) with potential in light absorption and catalysis is still challenging, due to their rapid interpenetration to form 2D and 3D porous structures. Here we report a successful synthesis of imine&#8208;linked 1D covalent organic ribbons (COR), using two simple linear building blocks 1,4&#8208;Benzenediamine (Bda) and [2,2&#8242;&#8208;Bipyridine]&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;dicarbaldehyde (Bpy). The obtained 1D structure with nanorod morphology could keep its physicochemical characteristic properties when it is perpendicular to the surface of graphene oxide (GO) sheets (1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D structure). Due to an AB &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and efficient charge transfer between perpendicular 1D COR and GO sheets, the obtained nanocomposite showed strong visible light absorbance (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm) with coefficient of 4.400&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and decreased recombination rate of photogenerated reactive species by 92&#8201;%. The strategy of 1D&#8208;p&#8208;2D light driven system greatly enhanced the photocatalytic activity in practical applications such as both oxidation and hydrogenation tandem reactions to a rate constant of higher than 0.02&#8197;min&#8722;1. This study presents the first case of 1D covalent organic polymers grown perpendicularly on a carbon&#8208;based layer for boosting electron mobility through the junction between the two components.

         <title>Towards Efficient Polymeric Binders for Transition Metal Oxides&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional PVdF binders still remain some limitations to its use for high&#8208;voltage transition metal oxide cathodes (TMOCs). This review aims at providing a comprehensive summary of the ideal requirements, design strategies and recent progress of polymeric binders for TMOCs. Future design perspectives and promising research technologies for advanced binders for high&#8208;voltage TMOCs are introduced.







Abstract
Transition metal oxide cathodes (TMOCs) such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 have been widely employed in Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to superior operating voltages, high reversible capacities and relatively low cost. Nevertheless, despite significant advancements in practical application, TMOC&#8208;based LIBs face great challenges such as transition metal dissolution and volume expansion during cycling, which jeopardizes the future advance of high&#8208;voltage TMOCs. As a critical component of cathode, polymeric binder acts as a crucial part in maintaining the mechanical and ion/electron conductive integrity between active particles, carbon additives, and the aluminum collector, hence minimizing cathode pulverization during battery cycling. Moreover, Polymeric binder with specialized functions is thought to offer a new solution to enhancing the electrochemical stability of the TMOCs. Therefore, this review aims at providing a comprehensive summary of the ideal requirements, design strategies and recent progress of polymeric binders for TMOCs. Future design perspectives and promising research technologies for advanced binders for high&#8208;voltage TMOCs are introduced.

         <title>&#8220;Photo&#8208;Adrenalines&#8221;: Photoswitchable &#946;2&#8208;Adrenergic Receptor Agonists as Molecular Probes for the Study of Spatiotemporal Adrenergic Signaling</title>

         <dc:description>
&#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor agonists are used for the treatment of asthma, but also play a role in heart diseases. Several photoswitchable &#946;2&#8208;receptor agonists with nanomolar activity were synthesized and one adrenaline derivative is a one&#8208;digit nanomolar, trans&#8208;on, full agonist for the &#946;2&#8208;receptor. It represents a novel molecular probe for biological studies with high structural similarity to native adrenaline.







Abstract
&#946;2&#8208;adrenergic receptor (&#946;2&#8208;AR) agonists are used for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but also play a role in other complex disorders including cancer, diabetes and heart diseases. As the cellular and molecular mechanisms in various cells and tissues of the &#946;2&#8208;AR remain vastly elusive, we developed tools for this investigation with high temporal and spatial resolution. Several photoswitchable &#946;2&#8208;AR agonists with nanomolar activity were synthesized. The most potent agonist for &#946;2&#8208;AR with reasonable switching is a one&#8208;digit nanomolar active, trans&#8208;on arylazopyrazole&#8208;based adrenaline derivative and comprises valuable photopharmacological properties for further biological studies with high structural accordance to the native ligand adrenaline.

         <title>Improved Interface Construction on Anode and Cathode for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Ultralow&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte Containing Dual&#8208;Additives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared with Li+, Na+ with a smaller stokes radius has faster de&#8208;solvation kinetics. An electrolyte with ultralow sodium salt (0.3 M NaPF6) is used to reduce the cell cost. However, the organic&#8208;dominated interface, mainly derived from decomposed solvents (SSIP solvation structure), is defective for the long cycling performance of sodium ion batteries. In this work, the simple application of dual additives, including sodium difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) and tris(trimethylsilyl)borate (TMSB), is demonstrated to improve the cycling performance of the hard carbon/NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell by constructing interface films on the anode and cathode. A significant improvement on cycling stability has been achieved by incorporating dual additives of NaDFOB and TMSB. Particularly, the capacity retention increased from 17% (baseline) to 79% (w/w, 2.0 wt % NaDFOB) and 83% (w/w, 2.0 wt % NaDFOB and 1.0 wt % TMSB) after 200 cycles at room temperature. Insight into the mechanism of improved interfacial properties between electrodes and electrolyte in ultralow concentration electrolyte has been investigated through a combination of theoretical computation and experimental techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Azaphosphinate Dyes: A Low Molecular Weight Near&#8208;Infrared Scaffold for Development of Photoacoustic or Fluorescence Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes are desirable for biological imaging applications including photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. Nonetheless, current NIR dyes are often plagued by relatively large molecular weights, poor water solubility, and limited photostability. Herein, we provide the first examples of azaphosphinate dyes which display desirable properties such as low molecular weight, absorption/emission above 750 nm, and remarkable water solubility. In PA imaging, an azaphosphinate dye exhibited a 4.1&#8208;fold enhancement in intensity compared to commonly used standards, the ability to multiplex with existing dyes in whole blood, imaging depths of 2.75 cm in a tissue model, and contrast in mice. An improved derivative for fluorescence imaging displayed a &gt;10&#8208;fold reduction in photobleaching in water compared to the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green dye and could be visualized in mice. This new dye class provides a robust scaffold for the development of photoacoustic or NIR fluorescence imaging agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Direct Mechanocatalytic Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling via Twin&#8208;Screw Extrusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work establishes the first direct mechanocatalytic reaction protocol within an extruder, focusing on the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. Through the coating of either the extruder screws or barrel with Pd, we executed the cross&#8208;coupling reaction without the reliance on molecular catalyst compounds or powders, and solvents continuously. We identified the influence and interplay of crucial reaction parameters such as temperature, mechanical energy input, residence time, rheology, and catalyst contact time and finally obtained 36% and 75% of the reaction product after one and four reactor passes respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer Clicked Poly(ferrocenylsilanes) at Au Nanoparticles as Platforms with Multiple Functions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamers are widely used in biosensing due to their specific sensitivity toward many targets. Thus, gold nanoparticle (AuNP) aptasensors are subject to intense research due to the complementary properties of aptamers as sensing elements and AuNPs as transducers. We present herein a novel method for the functional coupling of thrombin&#8208;specific aptamers to AuNPs via an anionic, redox&#8208;active poly(ferrocenylsilane) (PFS) polyelectroyte. The polymer acts as a co&#8208;reductant and stabilizer for the AuNPs, provides grafting sites for the aptamer, and can be used as a redox sensing element, making the aptamer&#8208;PFS&#8208;AuNP composite (aptamer&#8208;AuNP) a promising model system for future multifunctional sensors. The aptamer&#8208;AuNPs exhibit excellent colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments owing to the combined electrosteric stabilizing effects of the aptamer and the PFS. The synthesis of each assembly element is described, and the colloidal stability and redox responsiveness is studied. As an example to illustrate applications, we present results for thrombin sensitivity and specificity using the specific aptamer.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;immolation Assisted Morphology Transformation of Prebiotic Lipidated&#8208;cationic Amino Acids: Electro&#8208;droplet Mediated C&#8208;C Coupling Reaction to Synthesize Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compartmentalization protected biomolecules from the fluctuating environments of early Earth. Although contemporary cells mostly use phospholipid&#8208;based bilayer membranes, the utility of non&#8208;bilayer compartments was not ruled out during the prebiotic and modern eras. In the present study, we demonstrated the prebiotic synthesis of lipidated cationic amino acid&#8208;based amphiphiles (lauryl ester of lysine, Lys; ornithine, Orn; and 2,4&#8208;diamino butyric acid, Dab) using model dry&#8208;down reaction. Orn, and Dab&#8208;based amphiphiles (OrnL and DabL) self&#8208;assemble into micellar membranes but undergo pH&#8208;responsive self&#8208;immolation assisted transformation to lipid droplet&#8208;like morphologies, a probable alternative compartment model in the prebiotic Earth. These cationic droplets encapsulated prebiotic molecules (isoprene) and assisted electron transfer reaction to synthesize isoprenoid derivatives at primitive Earth conditions. The self&#8208;assembly of prebiotic amphiphiles, their transformation to droplet compartments, and droplet&#8208;assisted C&#8208;C bond formation reaction might help the evolution to synthesize various biomolecules required for the origin of life.</dc:description>

         <title>CBe2H5&#8211;: unprecedented 2&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity and dynamic structural fluxionality in a planar tetracoordinate carbon cluster</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 14&#8208;electron ternary anionic CBe2H5&#8211; cluster containing a planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) atom is designed herein. Remarkably, it can be stabilized by only two beryllium atoms with both &#960;&#8208;acceptor/&#963;&#8208;donor properties and two hydrogen atoms, which means that the conversion from planar methane (transition state) to ptC species (global minimum) requires the substitution of only two hydrogen atoms. Moreover, two ligand H atoms exhibit alternate rotation, giving rise to interesting dynamic fluxionality in this cluster. The electronic structure analysis reveals the flexible bonding positions of ligand H atoms due to C&#8208;H localized bonds, highlighting the rotational fluxionality in the cluster, and two CBe2 3c&#8208;2e delocalized bonds endow its rare 2&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Unprecedentedly, the fluxional process exhibits a conversion in the type of bonding (&#963; bond &#8660; &#960; bond), which is an uncommon fluxional mechanism. The cluster can be seen as an attempt to apply planar hypercoordinate carbon species to molecular motors.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient C&#8208;Si/C&#8208;H Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Enabled by a Radical Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The methods for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes are long&#8208;standing challenges due to the extreme inertness of C&#8208;Si(R3) bond, though the reaction is environmentally friendly and highly regioselective to synthesize biaryls. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes and aryl via a radical mechanism. The reaction proceeds efficiently with aryl sulfonium salts as limiting reagents, exhibits broad substrate scope, and provides an important synthetic strategy to acquire biaryls, exemplified by unsymmetrical fluorescence probes and late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs. Of note, the experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies revealed a radical mechanism where the copper catalyst and CsF play critical roles on the radical generation and desilylation process.</dc:description>

         <title>CARBON DOTS: Bioimaging and Anticancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer, responsible for approximately 10 million lives annually, urgently requires innovative treatments, as well as solutions to mitigate the limitations of traditional chemotherapy, such as long&#8208;term adverse side effects and multidrug resistance. This review focuses on Carbon Dots (CDs), an emergent class of nanoparticles (NPs) with remarkable physicochemical and biological properties, and their burgeoning applications in bioimaging and as nanocarriers in drug delivery systems for cancer treatment. The review initiates with an overview of NPs as nanocarriers, followed by an in&#8208;depth look into the biological barriers that could affect their distribution, from barriers to administration, to intracellular trafficking. It explores CDs' synthesis,&#160;both bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches, and their notable biocompatibility, supported by a selection of in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo studies. Special attention is given to CDs' role in bioimaging, highlighting their optical properties. The discussion extends to their emerging significance as drug carriers, particularly in the delivery of doxorubicin and other anticancer agents, underscoring recent advancements and challenges in this field with examples of other promising bioapplications, emergent owing to the NPs flexible design. As research on CDs evolves, we envisage key challenges, as well as the potential of CD&#8208;based systems in bioimaging and cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of the Unusual Chemical Bonds and Dipole Moments of AeF&#8208; (Ae = Be &#8208; Ba): A Lesson in Covalent Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum chemical calculations of the anions AeF&#8208; (Ae = Be &#8208; Ba) have been carried out using ab initio methods at the CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVPP level and density functional theory employing BP86 with various basis sets. The detailed bonding analyses using different charge&#8208; and energy partitioning methods show that the molecules possess three distinctively different dative bonds in the lighter species with Ae = Be, Mg and four dative bonds when Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba. The occupied 2p atomic orbitals (AOs) and to a lesser degree the occupied 2s AO of F&#8208; donate electronic charge into the vacant spx(&#963;) and p(&#960;) orbitals of Be and Mg which leads to a triple bond AeF&#8208;. The heavier Ae atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use their vacant (n&#8208;1)d AOs as acceptor orbitals which enables them to form a second &#963; donor bond with F&#8208; that leads to quadruply bonded AeF&#8208; (Ae = Ca &#8211; Ba). The presentation of molecular orbitals or charge distribution using only one isodensity value may give misleading information about the overall nature of the orbital or charge distribution. Better insights are given by contour line diagrams.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Contrast Photoacoustic Imaging of Localized Cysteine in Orthotopic Breast Cancer Enabled by A Totally&#8208;Caged Methylene Blue Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to the 90th anniversary of South China Normal University.It developed a methylene blue&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with NIR optical absorption totally caged, which could afford dramatical &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; absorption transition for high&#8208;contrast photoacoustic sensing imaging (PASI) towards the localized cysteine. This work established an up&#8208;to&#8208;date strategy to originally eliminate the background photoacoustic signal for PASI to accurately monitor cysteine in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
High&#8208;contrast photoacoustic sensing imaging (PASI) was greatly determined by optical absorption changes of the absorbers usually enabled by activatable probes via controllably converting the absorbed electromagnetic energy to ultrasound waves. However, most of current photoacoustic probes still suffer from limited imaging contrast towards specific species because of their small absorption spectral changes in the near infrared (NIR) region. Herein, we developed a methylene blue&#8208;based photoacoustic probe with its NIR optical absorption totally caged, which could afford dramatical &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; absorption transition for high&#8208;contrast photoacoustic imaging towards the localized cysteine. The rationally designed methylene blue&#8208;based probe for cysteine (MB&#8208;Cys) would keep in off state with almost no absorption in NIR region, while upon activated by cysteine through cyclization reaction with acrylates, it would reconstruct the &#960;&#8208;conjugation system to release the free methylene blue with strong absorption centered at 665&#8197;nm (&gt;130&#8208;fold enhancement). The unique responsive behavior could enable the PASI for photoacoustic mapping the cysteine in orthotopic breast cancer in a high&#8208;contrast manner. Therefore, this work established an up&#8208;to&#8208;date strategy to originally eliminate the background photoacoustic signal for PASI to accurately monitor cysteine in&#8197;vivo.

         <title>Phosphonium&#8208;substituted Diphosphaindenylide (PPI): Exploration of Biradical Character and Ligand Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide, PPI, is reported. Introduction of two P atoms to the indenyl core results in considerable biradical character. Moreover, the ligand properties of PPI are investigated using a chromium tricarbonyl complex as model compound.







Abstract
Starting from C6H4(PCl2)2 and the TMS&#8208;substituted ylide (TMS)2C=PR3 (TMS=trimethylsilyl, R=p&#8208;tolyl), the phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide PPI was prepared in two steps. CASSCF calculations as well as the reactivity toward diphenyl acetylene suggest a notable biradical character in PPI. Reaction with [Cr(CO)3(MeCN)3] affords the complex [Cr(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;PPI)] (5). This complex was employed to explore the ligand properties of PPI, which demonstrates considerable potential through the combination of strong metal&#8208;ligand interactions and the possibility of a pronounced indenyl effect.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Construction of Metal Nanoparticles Loaded COF Catalysts for Aqueous Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of metal nanoparticles loaded COFs catalysts have been prepared via one&#8208;pot construction strategy without lab&#8208;cost procedures, demonstrating excellent hydrogenation performance under mild conditions. The new strategy can be further evolved as into a versatile platform to create new COFs materials and explore the resultant applications.







Abstract
The catalysis performance of metal nanoparticles (NPs) will be significantly deteriorated because of their spontaneous agglomeration during practical applications. Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) materials with functional groups and well&#8208;defined channels benefit for the dispersion and anchor of metal ions and the confined growth of metal NPs, working as an ideal platform to compose catalytic systems. In this article, we report a one&#8208;pot strategy for the preparation of metal NPs loaded COFs without the need of post&#8208;modification. During the polymerization process, the pre&#8208;added metal ions were stabilized by the rapidly formed COF oligomers and hardly disturb the construction of COFs. After reduction, metal NPs are uniformly anchored on the COF matrix. Eventually, a wide spectrum of metal NPs, including Au, Pd, Pt, AuPd, CuPd, CuPt and CuPdPt, loaded COFs are successfully prepared. The versatility and metal ions anchoring mechanism are verified with four different COF matrixes. Taking AuPd NPs as example, the resultant AuPd NPs loaded COF materials can selectively decompose ammonium formate and produce hydrogen in&#8208;situ, exhibiting over 99&#8201;% conversion of hydrodechlorination for chlorobenzenes and nitro&#8208;reduction reaction for nitroaromatic compounds under ambient temperature in aqueous solution.

The versatility and metal ions anchoring mechanism are verified with four different COF matrixes. Taking AuPd NPs as example, the resultant AuPd NPs loaded COF materials can selectively decompose ammonium formate and produce hydrogen &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt;, exhibiting over 99&#8201;% conversion of hydrodechlorination for chlorobenzenes and nitro-reduction reaction for nitroaromatic compounds under ambient temperature in aqueous solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Peptidomimetics via Ugi Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent development for the construction of peptidomimetics via Ugi reactions or post&#8208;Ugi transformations. By the combination of Ugi reaction and transition metal catalysis such as gold, palladium, rhodium and copper, as well as metal&#8208;free strategies, devise linear, cyclic and polycyclic peptidomimetics are prepared in a rapid, highly efficient and step&#8208;economical manner.







Abstract
Peptidomimetics have been extensively explored in many area due to their ability to improve pharmacological qualities and interesting biological activities. Cycles could be incorporated in peptides to reduce their flexibility, often enhancing the affinity for a certain receptor. Many efforts have been made to synthesize various peptidomimetics. Among them, the Ugi reaction is a popular way for the synthesis of peptidomimetics because it provides peptide&#8208;like products. The Ugi reaction consists of the condensation of an aldehyde or ketone, a carboxylic acid, an amine, and an isocyanide usually giving a linear peptidomimetic. In order to obtain other linear, cyclic or polycyclic peptidomimetics, the acyclic products have to undergo additional transformations or cyclizations. This review covers the years from 2018&#8211;2023, regarding the synthesis of linear, cyclic and polycyclic peptidomimetics, employing Ugi reactions eventually followed by post&#8208;Ugi transformations. Organo&#8208;catalyzed reactions, base&#8208;promoted reactions, and metal&#8208;free reactions toward peptidomimetics are highlighted.

         <title>In vitro Production of Hemin&#8208;Based Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) is crucial to improve various industrial and biotechnological processes. In this study, we successfully designed a hemin&#8208;based ArM with peroxidase activity. Our results reveal improved properties compared to the activity of free hemin. Moreover, we also achieved the fabrication of this ArM in&#8197;vitro and in emulsio.







Abstract
Developing enzyme alternatives is pivotal to improving and enabling new processes in biotechnology and industry. Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are combinations of protein scaffolds with metal elements, such as metal nanoclusters or metal&#8208;containing molecules with specific catalytic properties, which can be customized. Here, we engineered an ArM based on the consensus tetratricopeptide repeat (CTPR) scaffold by introducing a unique histidine residue to coordinate the hemin cofactor. Our results show that this engineered system exhibits robust peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity driven by the hemin. The expression of the scaffold and subsequent coordination of hemin was achieved by recombinant expression in bulk and through in&#8197;vitro transcription and translation systems in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil drops. The ability to synthesize this system in emulsio paves the way to improve its properties by means of droplet microfluidic screenings, facilitating the exploration of the protein combinatorial space to discover improved or novel catalytic activities.

         <title>A New Series of Sandwich&#8208;Type 5,5&#8242;&#8208;Biterphenylenes: Synthetic Challenge, Structural Uniqueness and Photodynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crowded biaryls, bi&#8208;linear&#8208;terphenylenes, contain several aryl/terphenylenyl/aryl sandwiches. This unique structure provides an ideal model for studying the through&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, which are strongly reflected in the shielding of 1H&#8201;NMR chemical shifts, properties and aromaticity.







Abstract
A new series of biaryls, bi&#8208;linear&#8208;terphenylenes (BLTPs), were prepared using the tert&#8208;butyllithium&#8208;mediated cyclization as the key synthetic step. The three&#8208;dimensional structures of the studied compounds were verified using X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT calculations. Tetraaryl(ethynyl)&#8208;substituted BLTPs are highly crowded molecules, and the internal rotation around the central C&#8722;C bond is restricted due to a high barrier (&gt;50&#8197;kcal/mol). These structures contain several aryl/terphenylenyl/aryl sandwiches, where the through&#8208;space &#960;&#8208;&#960; (TSPP) interactions are strongly reflected in the shielding of 1H&#8201;NMR chemical shifts, reduction of oxidation potentials, increasing aromaticity of the central six&#8208;membered ring and decreasing antiaromaticity of the four&#8208;membered rings in a terphenylenyl moiety based on NICS(0) and iso&#8208;chemical shielding surfaces. Despite the restricted C&#8722;C bond associated intramolecular TSPP interactions for BLTPs in the ground state, to our surprise, the electronic coupling between two linear terphenylenes (LTPs) in BLTPs in the excited state is weak, so that the excited&#8208;state behavior is dominated by the corresponding monomeric LTPs. In other words, all BLTPs undergo ultrafast relaxation dynamics via strong exciton&#8208;vibration coupling, acting as a blue&#8208;light absorber with essentially no emission.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks: Synthesis Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically porous COFs (HP&#8208;COFs) refers to the integration of hierarchical pore distributions, which may include micropore, mesopore and macropore within one porous system. In this article, we introduce the synthesis methods of HP&#8208;COFs, encompassing topological structure design, in&#8208;situ templating, monolithic COF synthesis, defect engineering, and crystalline self&#8208;transformation. Simultaneously, we briefly introduce the applications of HP&#8208;COFs.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high porosity have garnered considerable interest for various applications owing to their robust and customizable structure. However, conventional COFs are hindered by their narrow pore size, which poses limitations for applications such as heterogeneous catalysis and guest delivery that typically involve large molecules. The development of hierarchically porous COF (HP&#8208;COF), featuring a multi&#8208;scale aperture distribution, offers a promising solution by significantly enhancing the diffusion capacity and mass transfer for larger molecules. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthesis strategies of HP&#8208;COF materials, including topological structure design, in&#8208;situ templating, monolithic COF synthesis, defect engineering, and crystalline self&#8208;transformation. The specific operational principles and affecting factors in the synthesis process are summarized and discussed, along with the applications of HP&#8208;COFs in heterogeneous catalysis, toxic component treatment, optoelectronics, and the biomedical field. Overall, this review builds a bridge to understand HP&#8208;COFs and provides guidance for further development of them on synthesis strategies and applications.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Cutting&#8208;Edge Materials for Carbon Dioxide Capture and Water Harvesting from Air</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) exemplify up&#8208;and&#8208;coming crystalline porous materials characterized by spectacular specific surface areas, adjustable pore environments, and superb physicochemical stabilities. This Review highlights the enormous potential and recent advances of COFs for carbon dioxide trapping and water harvesting from air, in addition to highlighting the key challenges and future research directions.







Abstract
The implacable rise of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere and acute water stress are one of the central challenges of our time. Present&#8208;day chemistry is strongly inclined towards more sustainable solutions. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), attributable to their structural designability with atomic precision, functionalizable chemical environment and robust extended architectures, have demonstrated promising performances in CO2 trapping and water harvesting from air. In this Review, we discuss the major developments in this field as well as sketch out the opportunities and shortcomings that remain over large&#8208;scale COF synthesis, device engineering, and long&#8208;term performance in real environments.

         <title>Chiral Supramolecular Organogel Constructed Using Riboflavin and Melamine: Its Application in Photo&#8208;Catalyzed Colorimetric Chiral Sensing and Enantioselective Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of optically active riboflavin and melamine derivatives produces a chiral supramolecular organogel, which acts as a light&#8208;stimulated chiral sensor and a chiral adsorbent that enables colorimetric chiral discrimination and optical resolution.







Abstract
The synthesis of a chiral supramolecular organogel via the hierarchical helical self&#8208;assembly of optically active riboflavin and melamine derivatives is described herein. Owing to the photocatalysis of riboflavin and the supramolecular chirality induced in the helically stacked riboflavin/melamine complex, the gel is observed to act as a light&#8208;stimulated chiral sensor of optically active alcohols by detecting the change in color from yellow to green. The gel also served as an efficient chiral adsorbent, enabling optical resolution of a racemic compound with high chiral recognition ability.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Bola&#8208;Amphiphilic Porphyrin&#8208;Perylenebisimide Architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthetic approach and the characterization of a family of highly water&#8208;soluble porphyrin&#8208;PBI donor&#8208;acceptor amphiphiles by the utilization of oligo&#8208;carboxylic acid capped Newkome dendrons. The amphiphiles form stable aggregates in basic aqueous solutions. The amphiphiles can be individualized by the addition of THF, which manifests itself, for example, in the reinstatement of fluorescence emission.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis and characterization of a family of three water&#8208;soluble bola&#8208;amphiphilic zinc&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;perylenebisimide triads containing oligo carboxylic&#8208;acid capped Newkome dendrons in the periphery. Variations of the perylenebisimide (PBI) core geometry and dendron size (G1 and G2 dendrons with 3&#8208; and 9&#8208;carboxylic acid groups respectively) allow for tuning the supramolecular aggregation behavior with respect to variation of the molecular architecture. The triads show good solubility in basic aqueous media and aggregation to supramolecular assemblies. Theoretical investigations at the DFT level of theory accompanied by electrochemical measurements unravel the geometric and electronic structure of the amphiphiles. UV/Vis and fluorescence titrations with varying amounts of THF demonstrate disaggregation.

         <title>Cyclic Hydrocarbon Frameworks Containing Two Bismuth Atoms: Towards 9,10&#8208;Dibismaanthracene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of dinuclear bismuth heterocycles featuring the dihydro&#8208;dibismaanthrace structural motif are presented. These compounds involve bismuth halides, selenides, and heterobimetallic bismuth / transition&#8208;metal compounds with a versatile coordination chemistry. Synthetic access to the low&#8208;valent highly reactive dibismaanthracene (the so&#8208;called bismanthrene) has been probed and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based bismanthrene surrogates are suggested.







Abstract
When bismuth atoms are incorporated into cyclic organic systems, this commonly goes along with strained or distorted molecular geometries, which can be exploited to modulate the physical and chemical properties of these compounds. In six&#8208;membered heterocycles, bismuth atoms are often accompanied by oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen as a second hetero&#8208;element. In this work, we present the first examples of six&#8208;membered rings, in which two CH units are replaced by BiX moieties (X=Cl, Br, I), resulting in dihydro&#8208;anthracene analogs. Their behavior in chemically reversible reduction reactions is explored, aiming at the generation of dibisma&#8208;anthracene (bismanthrene). Heterometallic compounds (Bi/Fe, Bi/Mn) are introduced as potential bismanthrene surrogates, as supported by bismanthrene&#8208;transfer to selenium. Analytical techniques used to investigate the reported compounds include NMR spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Application of MXene&#8208;Based Materials for Cathode in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have a high specific capacity and energy density to become the most promising high&#8208;energy storage system in the future. MXenes own metallic conductivity and strong polysulfides adsorption to overcome the drawbacks of low conductivity and the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of Li&#8722;S batteries. This review summarizes different preparation methods and properties of MXenes and their cathode application in Li&#8722;S batteries.







Abstract
The lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have a high theoretical specific capacity of 1675&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and have become the most promising high&#8208;energy storage system for the next generation batteries technology. However, their applications are hindered by insulated feature and volume expansion of sulfur, as well as the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polysulfides. MXenes own metallic conductivity and strong ability of polysulfides adsorption. Besides, their unique two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure, large specific surface area, abundant functional groups, and adjustability are beneficial to overcome the drawbacks of the sulfur cathode. In this review, different mainstream preparation methods and excellent properties of MXenes are summarized. Significant achievements and recent progress of MXene&#8208;based cathodes and interlayers applied to Li&#8722;S cathodes are concluded later. Finally, the challenges, possible solutions and potential applications of MXenes for Li&#8722;S batteries are also presented.

         <title>Ca(II) and Yb(II) complexes featuring M(C&#8801;C)4 structural motif: enforced proximity or genuine &#951;2&#8208;bonding?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#951;2&#8208;coordination of the alkyne triple C&#8801;C bond to Ca2+ and Yb2+ ions in the 1,8&#8208;bis(ethynyl)substituted carbazolide complexes is confirmed in the solid state by X&#8208;Ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy and in the solution by NMR spectroscopy. QTIAM analysis proves the existence of M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C) T&#8208;shaped bond pathways.







Abstract
Bis(carbazolide) complexes M[3,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;1,8&#8208;(RC&#8801;C)2Carb]2(THF)n (R=SiMe3, n=0, M=Ca, Yb; R=Ph, n=1, M=Ca, Yb; n=0, M=Yb) were synthesized through transamination reaction of M[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2 with two molar equivalents of carbazoles. The complexes feature M(&#951;2&#8208;C&#8801;C)4 structural motif composed of M(II) ions encapsulated by four acetylene fragments due to atypical for alkaline&#8208; and rare&#8208;earth metals &#951;2&#8208;interactions with triple C&#8801;C bond. This interaction is evidenced experimentally by X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy in the solid state and by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy in the solution. According to QTAIM analysis there are 4 bond critical points (3;&#8722;1) between the metal atom and each of the triple bonds, which are connected by a strongly curved, almost T&#8208;shaped bond pathway.

         <title>Fluorescence color change of supramolecular polymer networks controlled by crown ether&#8208;cation recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition was fabricated. The host dimer M1 which exhibits blue fluorescence was prepared by decorating benzo[15]crown&#8208;5 with a quinoline group. M1 can crosslink the ammonium cations&#8208;grafted polymer P1 to form a supramolecular polymer networks through host&#8208;guest recognition, accompanied by the transformation of blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence.







Abstract
We report a fluorescent supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) system based on crown ether&#8208;cation recognition. The polymer side chains bear ammonium cations, which can be recognized by host molecules with a B15C5 unit and a quinoline group at each end. The quinoline group makes the host molecule exhibit blue fluorescence. After the formation of SPNs, the recognition of the crown ether&#8208;cation transforms the blue fluorescence into yellow fluorescence. The accompanying fluorescence color change during the formation of SPNs makes it with potential applications in the fields of display, printing, information storage, and bioimaging.

         <title>Blue&#8208;Light Irradiated Mn(0)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroxylation and C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization of Unactivated Alkanes with C(sp2)&#8722;H Bonds of Quinones for Alkylated Hydroxy Quinones and Parvaquone</title>

Herein, a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation of naphthoquinone with unactivated alkanes using Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst under blue&#8208;light (457&#8197;nm) irradiation without any utilization of external base, oxidant, and pre&#8208;functionalization is described. Using the presented methodology, the high&#8208;value&#8208;added compound parvaquone (a commercially available drug for treating theileriosis) and its derivatives can be directly constructed under ambient reaction conditions.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of unreactive hydrocarbons is always challenging due to its inherited chemical inertness, slightly different reactivity of various C&#8722;H bonds, and intrinsically high bond dissociation energies. Here, a site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkylation of naphthoquinone with unactivated hydrocarbons using Mn2(CO)10 as a catalyst under blue&#8208;light (457&#8197;nm) irradiation without any external acid or base and pre&#8208;functionalization is presented. The selective C&#8722;H functionalization of tertiary over secondary and secondary over primary C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in abundant chemical feedstocks was achieved, and hydroxylation of quinones was realized in&#8197;situ by employing the developed methodology. This protocol provides a new catalytic system for the direct construction of high&#8208;value&#8208;added compounds, namely, parvaquone (a commercially available drug used to treat theileriosis) and its derivatives under ambient reaction conditions. Moreover, this operationally simple protocol applies to various linear&#8208;, branched&#8208;, and cyclo&#8208;alkanes with high degrees of site selectivity under blue&#8208;light irradiated conditions and could provide rapid and straightforward access to versatile methodologies for upgrading feedstock chemicals. Mechanistic insight by radical trapping, radical scavenging, EPR, and other controlled experiments well corroborated with DFT studies suggest that the reaction proceeds by a radical pathway.

         <title>Synthesis and dark state EPR properties of PDI&#8208;trityl dyads and triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromophore&#8208;radical systems are promising structures for quantum information science experiments, due to the possibility of generating high&#8208;spin states with strong spin polarization upon light excitation. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a number of different perylene diimides covalently linked to trityl radicals and explore their dark state properties by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.







Abstract
Covalently&#8208;linked chromophore&#8208;radical systems with their unique optical and magnetic properties are useful for applications in, e.&#8201;g., quantum information science. To expand the catalog of molecular systems, we synthesized and characterized six novel chromophore&#8211;radical and radical&#8208;chromophore&#8208;radical systems employing derivatives of perylene diimide (PDI) as the chromophore and trityl as the radical. The EPR properties of these compounds were evaluated in solution at cryogenic and room temperatures. In addition, the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling in the two bistrityl systems was investigated using DQC measurements. The presented results serve as a basis for further spectroscopic investigations under photoexcitation of the PDI core.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative Skeletal Editing of Indazoles by Donor Carbene Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the prevalence of heterocyclic scaffolds in drug&#8208;related molecules, converting these highly modular heterocyclic scaffolds into structural diversified and dearomatized analogs is an ideal strategy for improving their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we describe an efficient method for silver carbene mediated dearomative N&#8211;N bond cleavage leading to skeletal hopping between indazole and 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinazoline via a highly selective single&#8208;carbon insertion procedure. Using this methodology, a series of dihydroquinazoline analogues with diarylmethylene&#8208;substituted quaternary carbon centers were constructed with excellent yields and good functional group compatibility, which was further illustrated by the late&#8208;stage diversification of important pharmaceutically active ingredients. DFT calculations indicated that the silver catalyst not only induces the formation of the silver carbene, but also activates the diazahexatriene intermediate, which plays a crucial role in the formation of the C&#8211;N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Puffing with Large Volume Expansion and Photomechanical Motions induced by Topochemical [4+4] Reactions in Molecular Crystal Solvates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we report the first example of two crystal solvates of an anthracene&#8208;benzhydrazide based molecule (Ant) that display very distinct photo&#8208;responsive behaviour when 365 or 405 nm or visible light is illuminated. For the first time, the crystal hydrate that has water molecule in the lattice (hereafter named as Ant&#8208;H2O) display fascinating puffing behavior with large volume expansion and surface modulation when illuminated with 405 nm light, a phenomenon very much similar to the rice or popcorn puffing by thermal treatment. Utilizing the properties of photoconverted Ant&#8208;H2O crystals, we have demonstrated their application in photoinduced enhanced liquid absorption using various liquids/solutions.The other crystal solvate having DMF in the crystal lattice (hereafter named as Ant&#8208;DMF) responds to 405 nm light by bending, twisting, chopping, jumping or splitting etc. The chopping of Ant&#8208;DMF crystal was also observed under ambient / white light but at a slower rate compared to 405 nm light. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study reveals that the photoinduced puffing and photomechanical effects of these materials are rooted to the topochemical [4+4] cycloaddition reaction between the anthracene moieties that facilitate molecular packing change assisted by the reconfiguration of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions involving lattice trapped solvent molecules.</dc:description>

Utilizing the properties of photoconverted Ant-H2O crystals, we have demonstrated their application in photoinduced enhanced liquid absorption using various liquids/solutions.The other crystal solvate having DMF in the crystal lattice (hereafter named as Ant-DMF) responds to 405 nm light by bending, twisting, chopping, jumping or splitting etc. The chopping of Ant-DMF crystal was also observed under ambient / white light but at a slower rate compared to 405 nm light. Single crystal X-ray diffraction study reveals that the photoinduced puffing and photomechanical effects of these materials are rooted to the topochemical [4+4] cycloaddition reaction between the anthracene moieties that facilitate molecular packing change assisted by the reconfiguration of intermolecular non-covalent interactions involving lattice trapped solvent molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Interface&#8208;cascading Silicon Photoanode with Strengthened Built&#8208;in Electric Field and Enriched Surface Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To promote interfacial charge transfer process and accelerate surface water oxidation reaction kinetics for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting over n&#8208;type Silicon (n&#8208;Si) based photoanodes, herein, starting with surface stabilized n&#8208;Si/CoOx, a NiOx/NiFeOOH composite overlayer was coated by atomic layer deposition and spray coating to fabricate the multilayer structured n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode. Encouragingly, the obtained n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH photoanode exhibits much increased PEC activity for water splitting, with onset potential cathodically shifted to ~0.96 V vs. RHE and photocurrent density increased to 22.6 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for OER, as compared to n&#8208;Si/CoOx, even significantly surpassing the counterpart n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/FeOOH and n&#8208;Si/CoOx/NiOx/NiOOH photoanodes. Photophysical and electrochemical characterizations evidence that the deposited CoOx/NiOx/NiFeOOH composite overlayer would create large band bending and strong built&#8208;in electric field at the introduced cascading interfaces, thereby producing a large photovoltage of 650 mV to efficiently accelerate charge transfer from the n&#8208;Si substrate to the electrolyte for water oxidation. Furthermore, the surface oxygen vacancy enriched NiFeOOH overlayer could effectively catalyze the water oxidation reaction by thermodynamically reducing the energy barrier of rate determining step for OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold&#8208;promoted biocompatible selenium arylation of small molecules, peptides and proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A low pKa (5.2), high polarizable volume (3.8 &#197;), and proneness to oxidation under ambient conditions make selenocysteine (Sec, U) a unique, natural reactive handle present in most organisms across all domains of life. Sec modification still has untapped potential for site&#8208;selective protein modification and probing. Herein we demonstrate the use of a cyclometalated gold(III) compound, [Au(bnpy)Cl2], in the arylation of diselenides of biological significance, with a scope covering small molecule models, peptides, and proteins using a combination of multinuclear NMR (including 77Se NMR), and LC&#8208;MS. Diphenyl diselenide (Ph&#8208;Se)2 and selenocystine, (Sec)2, were used for reaction optimization. This approach allowed us to demonstrate that an excess of diselenide (Au/Se&#8208;Se) and an increasing water percentage in the reaction media enhance both the conversion and kinetics of the C&#8208;Se coupling reaction, a combination that makes the reaction biocompatible. The C&#8208;Se coupling reaction was also shown to happen for the diselenide analogue of the cyclic peptide vasopressin ((Se&#8208;Se)&#8208;AVP), and the Bos taurus glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) enzyme in ammonium acetate (2 mM, pH = 7.0). The reaction mechanism, studied by DFT revealed a redox&#8208;based mechanism where the C&#8208;Se coupling is enabled by the reductive elimination of the cyclometalated Au(III) species into Au(I).</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis with Organoselenium Compounds &#8211; The Past Twelve Years</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery and synthetic applications of novel organoselenium compounds and their reactions proceeded rapidly during the past fifty years and such processes are now carried out routinely in many laboratories. At the same time, the growing demand for new enantioselective processes provided new challenges. The convergence of selenium chemistry and asymmetric synthesis led to key developments in the 1970s, although the majority of early work was based on stoichiometric processes. More recently, greater emphasis has been placed on greener catalytic variations, along with the discovery of novel reactions and a deeper understanding of their mechanisms. The present review covers the literature in this field from 2010 to early 2023 and encompasses asymmetric reactions mediated by chiral selenium&#8208;based reagents, auxiliaries and, especially, catalysts. Protocols based on achiral selenium compounds in conjunction with other species of chiral catalysts, as well as reactions that are controlled by chiral substrates, are also included.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of 2&#8208;Substituted Benzo[cd]Indoles via the Reaction of peri&#8208;Dilithionaphthalenes with Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple and effective organolithium approach to the synthesis of 2&#8208;substituted benzo[cd]indoles from peri&#8208;dihalonaphthalenes and nitriles has been developed. The reaction proceeds via a surprisingly easy intramolecular aromatic nucleophilic substitution facilitated by the &#8220;clothespin effect&#8221;. The discovered transformation provides good isolated yields, allows usage of an extensive range of nitriles, and demonstrates a good substituents tolerance. UV&#8208;absorption and NMR spectra of the obtained benzo[cd]indoles and their protonated forms demonstrated exclusive protonation to indole nitrogen atom even in the presence of two NMe2 groups in positions 5 and 6 (i.e. &#8220;proton sponge&#8221; moiety)</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligo(para&#8208;phenylene) (PPn) is a compound composed of directly connected 1,4&#8208;phenylene moieties. The synthesis of PPn composed of six or more phenylene moieties with no substituent at the internal phenylene moiety has been challenging because of its low solubility. Herein we synthesized oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxanes, including a deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane, with a defined number of phenylene moieties. Biaryl coupling of iodoarenes mediated by macrocyclic dibenzodihydrophenanthroline&#8208;Ni complex was utilized for the first time to synthesize the [2]rotaxanes. Compared to the non&#8208;interlocked deca(para&#8208;phenylene), the deca(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxane showed higher solubility. The properties of the oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)[2]rotaxanes and non&#8208;interlocked oligo(para&#8208;phenylene)s were analyzed by spectroscopic methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Central Ring Puckering Enhances the Stokes Shift of Xanthene Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small&#8208;molecule dyes are generally designed based on well&#8208;understood electronic effects. However, steric hindrance can promote excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, increasing the difference between the positions of absorption and emission bands (the Stokes shift). Accordingly, we hypothesized that sterically induced central ring puckering in xanthene dyes could be used to systematically increase their Stokes shift. Through a combined experimental/quantum&#8208;chemical approach, we screened a group of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin dyes with a perturbed central ring geometry. Our results showed that an atom with sp3 hybridization in position 10 of (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronins induces central ring puckering and facilitates excited&#8208;state geometric relaxation, thereby markedly enhancing their Stokes shifts (by up to ~2000 cm&#8722;1). Thus, we prepared fluorescent (9&#8208;acylimino)&#8208;pyronin pH sensors, which showed a Stokes shift disparity between acid and base forms of up to ~8700 cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the concept of ring puckering&#8208;enhanced Stokes shift can be applied to a wide range of xanthene analogues found in the literature. Therefore, central ring puckering may be reliably used as a strategy for enhancing Stokes shifts in the rational design of dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Topology of Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks through Site&#8208;Selective Synthetic Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the topology of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is of paramount scientific interest but remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present a site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy that enables the tuning of 2D COF topology by simply adjusting the molar ratio of an amine&#8208;functionalized dihydrazide monomer (NH2&#8208;Ah) and 4,4',4''&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazine&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triyl)tribenzaldehyde (Tz). This approach resulted in the formation of two distinct COFs: a clover&#8208;like 2D COF with free amine groups (NH2&#8208;Ah&#8208;Tz) and a honeycomb&#8208;like COF without amine groups (Ah&#8208;Tz). Both COFs exhibited good crystallinity and moderate porosity. Remarkably, the clover&#8208;shaped NH2&#8208;Ah&#8208;Tz COF, with abundant free amine groups, displayed significantly enhanced adsorption capacities toward crystal violet (CV, 261 mg/g) and congo red (CR, 1560 mg/g) compared to the nonfunctionalized honeycomb&#8208;like Ah&#8208;Tz COF (123 mg/g for CV and 1340 mg/g for CR), underscoring the pivotal role of free amine functional groups in enhancing adsorption capacities for organic dyes. This work highlights that the site&#8208;selective synthetic strategy paves a new avenue for manipulating 2D COF topology by adjusting the monomer feeding ratio, thereby modulating their adsorption performances toward organic dyes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Using CBr4 as a mild oxidant, the direct C&#8208;H bond oxidation of N&#8208;aryltetrahydroisoquinolines was achieved, giving a series of the corresponding iminium salts in high yields under metal&#8208; and photo&#8208;free reaction conditions. This reaction is superior in high yields and good functional group tolerance, and the late&#8208;stage derivatization showed that these iminium&#160;salts can readily be applied to the synthesis of the functionalized THIQs.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridine Iodine(I) Cations: Kinetic Trapping as a Sulfonate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seven pyridine iodine(I) sulfonate complexes were prepared and isolated at low temperatures and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The inherently instable pyridine iodine(I) cations are stabilized by an oxygen of sulfonate anions via the I&#183;&#183;&#183;O halogen bond. In these complexes, the iodine atom of the pyridine iodine(I) cation acts as an electron acceptor and the sulfonate oxygen as the electron donor. These complexes are stable enough in the crystalline state, yet decompose rapidly under ambient conditions, also being unstable in solution. The (pyridine)N&#8211;I bond lengths [2.140(3) &#8208; 2.197(2) &#197;] and the I&#183;&#183;&#183;O halogen bonds [2.345(6) &#8208; 2.227(3) &#197;] are analogous to (imide)N&#8211;I&#183;&#183;&#183;O&#8211;N&#8208;pyridine uncharged halogen&#8208;bonded complexes formed from N&#8208;haloimides and pyridine N&#8208;oxides, thus confirming the existence of elusive pyridine iodine(I) cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Dual C&#8210;F Bond Activation of Hexafluorobenzene Mediated by Boron Atom</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of laser&#8208;ablated boron atoms with hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) was investigated in neon and argon matrices, and the products are identified by matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The reaction is triggered by a boron atom insertion into one C&#8210;F bond of hexafluorobenzene on annealing, forming a fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical (A). UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation of the &#160;fluoropentafluorophenyl boryl radical causes generation of a 2&#8208;difluoroboryl&#8208;tetrafluorophenyl radical (B) via a second C&#8210;F bond activation. A perfluoroborepinyl radical (C) generated from the C&#8210;C bond insertion reaction is also observed upon deposition and under UV&#8208;Vis light irradiation. These findings reveal the first example of a double C&#8211;F bond activation of hexafluorobenzene mediated by a nonmetal and provides a possible route for synthesis of new perfluorinated organo&#8208;boron compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Features of DNA Mimic Foldamers for Structural Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA mimic foldamers based on aromatic oligoamide helices bearing anionic phosphonate side chains have been shown to bind to DNA&#8208;binding proteins sometimes orders of magnitude better than DNA itself. Here, we introduce new features in the DNA mimic foldamers to facilitate structural investigations of their interactions with proteins. Thirteen new foldamer sequences have been synthesized and characterized using NMR, circular dichroism, molecular modeling, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The results show that foldamer helix handedness can be quantitatively biased by means of a single stereogenic center, that the foldamer structure can be made C2&#8208;symmetrical as in palindromic B&#8208;DNA sequences, and that associations between foldamer helices can be promoted utilizing dedicated C&#8208;terminal residues that act as sticky ends in B&#8208;DNA structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy transfer on cytoskeleton of red blood cell ghosts and&#160;their efficiency control by KCl concentration&#8208;induced cell shrinkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lipid bilayer membranes such as liposomes have been utilized as reactors to construct bioinspired artificial photosynthesis. Embedding functional compounds, including chromophores and catalysts, into two&#8208;dimensional lipid membranes allows their high local concentration and proximity, resulting in enhanced reactivity compared to that of homogeneous solutions. The control of photoreactions by the physical and chemical properties of membranes, such as fluidity and phase separation, has also been well studied in recent years. In contrast, it remains difficult to control chemical reactions via dynamic membrane deformation. Here, we report on the control of excitation energy transfer reaction utilizing red blood cell ghosts (RBCGs), which have asymmetric lipid membranes and inherent and unique deformability, as reactors. RBCGs, in which donor and acceptor molecules were chemically conjugated to a two&#8208;dimensional cytoskeleton located beneath the inner membrane, exhibited energy transfer, and their efficiency varied depending on the amount and ratio of donor and acceptor modifications, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the KCl concentration&#8208;induced RBCG shrinkage enhanced the energy transfer efficiency. Our proposed method is expected to facilitate the construction of photoreaction systems that can be controlled via membrane deformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing the Role of BN&#8208;Embedding Position in B2N2&#8208;Perylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating heteroatoms can effectively modulate the molecular optoelectronic properties. However, the fundamental understanding of BN doping effects in BN&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is underexplored, lacking rational guidelines to modulate the electronic structures through BN units for advanced materials. Herein, a concise synthesis of novel B2N2&#8208;perylenes with BN doped at the bay area is achieved to systematically explore the doping effect of BN position on the photophysical properties of PAHs. The shift of BN position in B2N2&#8208;perylenes alters the &#960; electron conjugation, aromaticity and molecular rigidness significantly, achieving substantially higher electron transition abilities than those with BN doped in the nodal plane.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Incorporating heteroatoms can effectively modulate the molecular optoelectronic properties. However, the fundamental understanding of BN doping effects in BN-embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is underexplored, lacking rational guidelines to modulate the electronic structures through BN units for advanced materials. Herein, a concise synthesis of novel B2N2-perylenes with BN doped at the bay area is achieved to systematically explore the doping effect of BN position on the photophysical properties of PAHs. The shift of BN position in B2N2-perylenes alters the &#960; electron conjugation, aromaticity and molecular rigidness significantly, achieving substantially higher electron transition abilities than those with BN doped in the nodal plane. It is further clarified that BN position dominates the photophysical properties over BN orientation. The revealed guideline here may apply generally to novel BN-PAHs, and aid the advancement of BN-PAHs with highly-emissive performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light driven control over oligomerization of triple and quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded ditopic self&#8208;assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers offer tremendous potential to produce new &#8220;smart&#8221; materials however, there remains a need to develop systems that are responsive to external stimuli. In this work visible&#8208;light responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymers comprising photoresponsive supramolecular synthons (I&#8208;III) consisting of two hydrogen bonding motifs (HBMs) connected by a central ortho&#8208;tetrafluorinated azobenzene have been characterized by DOSY NMR and viscometry. Comparison of different hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs reveals that assembly in the low and high concentration regimes is strongly influenced by the strength of association between the HBMs. I, Incorporating a triply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer, was found to exhibit concentration dependent switching between a monomeric pseudo&#8208;cycle and supramolecular oligomer through intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions between the HBMs. II, Based on the same photoresponsive scaffold, and incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded homodimer was found to form a supramolecular polymer which was dependent upon the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium and thus dependent upon both concentration and photochemical stimulus. Finally, III, incorporating a quadruply hydrogen&#8208;bonded heterodimer represents the first photoswitchable AB type hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymer. Depending on the concentration and photostationary state, four different assemblies dominate for both monomers II and III, demonstrating the ability to control supramolecular assembly and physical properties triggered by light.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Reactivities of tert&#8208;Butyllithium by the Addition of Stoichiometric Amounts of Tetrahydrofuran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In alkyllithium chemistry the highest reactivity has historically been linked to the smallest degree of aggregation possible. Since tert&#8208;butyllithium is known to form a monomer in tetrahydrofuran solution, using just stoichiometric amounts of the lewis base to selectively form a dimeric species seemed irrational. In this study, we showed a considerable increase of the reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi when using stoichiometric amounts of THF in the non&#8208;polar solvent n&#8208;pentane in order to enable the deprotonation of simple methyl silanes and other low C&#8211;H&#8208;acidic substrates. In this context, we were able to obtain the corresponding aggregates of t&#8208;BuLi with the ligand THF in suspension and as crystalline solids and investigate them by single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis, in situ FTIR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Furthermore, we were able to explain the enhanced reactivity of t&#8208;BuLi with stoichiometric amounts of THF on the basis of structural features of the bridged dimer obtained under these conditions. With these findings, we present a new target in the aggregation of alkyllithium reagents: the selectively formed &#8220;frustrated&#8221; aggregates!</dc:description>

         <title>Design Strategies toward High&#8208;Utilization Zinc Anodes for Practical Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) hold a promise as the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their higher specific capacity. However, the actual capacity falls far below the requirements of commercial AZMBs due to the inevitable dendritic growth and side reactions on the surface of Zn anode. Reducing the N/P ratio (negative capacity/positive capacity) is an effective method to achieve high energy density. A significant amount of research has been devoted to increasing the cathode loading and specific capacity to achieve the goal of low N/P batteries. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of comprehensive overview regarding how to enhance the utilization of the Zn anode to balance the cycle life and energy density of AZMBs. In this review, we summarize the challenges faced in achieving high&#8208;utilization Zn anodes and elaborate on the modifying strategies for the Zn anode to lower the N/P ratio. The current research status and future prospects for the practical application of high&#8208;performance AZMBs are proposed at the end of the review.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Modular Reactivity of Low Valent Al/Zn Heterobimetallics Supported by Common Monodentate Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances on low valent main group metal chemistry have shown the excellent potential of heterobimetallic complexes derived from Al(I) to promote cooperative small molecule activation processes. A signature feature of these complexes is the use of bulky chelating ligands which act as spectators providing kinetic stabilization to their highly reactive Al&#8208;M bonds. Breaking new ground in this field, here we report the synthesis of novel unsupported Al/Zn bimetallics prepared by the selective formal insertion of AlCp* into the Zn&#8208;N bond of the utility zinc amides ZnR2&#160;(R = HMDS, hexamethyldisilazide; or TMP, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide). By systematically assessing the reactivity of the new [(R)(Cp*)AlZn(R)] bimetallics towards carbodiimides, structural and mechanistic insights have been gained on their ability to undergo insertion in their Zn&#8208;Al bond. Disclosing a dramatic ligand effect, when R = TMP, an isomerization process can be induced giving [(TMP)2AlZn(Cp*)] which displays a special reactivity towards carbodiimides and carbon dioxide involving both its Al&#8208;N bonds, leaving its Al&#8208;Zn bond untouched.</dc:description>

         <title>Monomeric gold hydrides for carbon dioxide reduction: ligand effect on the reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We analyzed the ligand electronic effect in the reaction between a [LAu(I)H]0/&#8208; hydride species and CO2, leading to a coordinated formate [LAu(HCOO)]0/&#8208;. We explored 20 different ligands, such as carbenes, phosphines and others, carefully selected to cover a wide range of electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor properties. We included in the study the only ligand, an NHC&#8208;coordinated diphosphene, that, thus far, experimentally demonstrated facile and reversible reaction between the monomeric gold(I) hydride and carbon dioxide. We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold&#8208;hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO2 with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand &#963; donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO2 activation.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ construction of poly(tetraisopentyl acrylate) based gel polymer electrolytes with LixLa2&#8208;xTiO3 for high energy density lithium&#8208;metal batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As promising alternatives to liquid electrolytes, polymer electrolytes attract much research interest recently, but their widespread use is limited by the low ionic conductivity. In this study, we use electrostatic spinning to introduce particles of an ionic conductor into polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers to prepare a porous membrane as the host of gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs). The relevant in&#8208;situ produced GPE performs a high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1, and a high lithium transfer number of 0.85 at 30 &#176;C, respectively. A symmetrical Li cell with this GPE can cycle stably for 550 h at a current density of 0.5 mA/cm2. While the capacity retention of the NCM|GPE|Li cell is 79.84% after 500 cycles at 2C. Even with an increased cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5 V, the 1st coulomb efficiency reaches 91.58% with a specific discharge capacity of 213.4 mAh/g. This study provides a viable route for the practical application of high energy density lithium metal batteries.</dc:description>
